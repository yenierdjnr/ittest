[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Cuz Windows 10 is\nsuch a departure from what we're used to.\n\n33\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.300\nAnd then we've seen it before,\nI mean going from Windows XP to Windows 7.\n\n34\n00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.440\nOr, did I skip Vista in there?\n\n35\n00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.160\nOr did I do that intentionally?\n\n36\n00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.220\nTo Windows 8, those kind of steps where,\nit's a new operating system, things are in\n\n37\n00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.610\ndifferent places the start menu,\nI have one or I don't, that kind of thing.\n\n38\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.690\n&gt;&gt; Just small little idiosyncrasies.\n\n39\n00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.700\n&gt;&gt; But you get to Windows 10.\n\n40\n00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.730\n&gt;&gt; And it's a game changer.\n\n41\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.\n\n42\n00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.850\nYou look at the objectives and it's like,\n\n43\n00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.689\nhey, we've got three sections that\ncomprise of about 30 to 35% of this exam.\n\n44\n00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.270\nAnd you're thinking,\nthe three objective domains.\n\n45\n00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.770\nThat's not a lot,\nwe've got, what do we have?\n\n46\n00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.440\nImplement windows for the first domain\nwe have configuring into the port\n\n47\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.550\npoor services and then we also\nhave manage and maintain windows.\n\n48\n00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.270\nWithin there there are a lot of\ndifferent tools and new features and\n\n49\n00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.940\njust really Microsoft or\nwindows as a whole has changed.\n\n50\n00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.400\nThe business model, we've seen\nthis big shift where we don't have\n\n51\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.260\nnecessarily a product per se anymore,\nbut you see the shift for\n\n52\n00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.710\nWindows as as service\nhere with Windows 10.\n\n53\n00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.170\nAnd that, I think,\n\n54\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.800\nis the biggest change that we're\nlooking at in this operating system.\n\n55\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.820\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n56\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.660\nAnd we're still in the mix.\n\n57\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.000\nWe can still get a Windows 10 ISO.\n\n58\n00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.460\nWe can install it, we can deploy it.\n\n59\n00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.640\nBut things are shifting, so\nwe're kinda seeing both at this point.\n\n60\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.460\nSo Cherokee, where do we start\nin our journey of installing and\n\n61\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.460\nconfiguring Windows 10?\n\n62\n00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I think the best place to\nstart would be with our specifications,\n\n63\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.090\nlike our hardware requirements.\n\n64\n00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.240\nBecause if you don't have\nthe hardware to go ahead and\n\n65\n00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.040\nrun the operating system, then you're\njust kind of, that's it, right?\n\n66\n00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.690\nSo let's take a look at my screen, and\n\n67\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.630\nI wanna go over a few\nthings that are essential.\n\n68\n00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.690\nNow keep in mind that these\nare going to be the bare minimums.\n\n69\n00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.410\nYou always,\nif you have the ability financially, or\n\n70\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.790\nyou have the right amount of resources.\n\n71\n00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.570\nYou wanna go ahead and think about other\ntypes of software applications or any\n\n72\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.970\nkind of requirements that you may have,\nbut it's important to know the minimums.\n\n73\n00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.020\nBecause let's just say from an exam\nperspective or even a business use case,\n\n74\n00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.980\nif you are provisioning virtual machines\nand your customer wants to get the most\n\n75\n00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.430\nreturn on investment for whatever it is\nthat project that they're rolling out,\n\n76\n00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.980\nthey don't want you over provisioning\nsystems and allocating a ton of\n\n77\n00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.140\nhardware resources if you're only\ngonna be utilizing it 30% or running.\n\n78\n00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.150\nSo we're gonna look at the minimums and\n\n79\n00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.960\nthen of course it's gonna be\nunique on a per use basis here.\n\n80\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.920\n&gt;&gt; One of the things I always like people\nto remember when they're looking at\n\n81\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.120\nthose minimum requirements\n&gt;&gt; One, as Cherokee pointed out,\n\n82\n00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.810\nit is minimum.\n\n83\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.510\nThat means this will run.\n\n84\n00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.420\nDoesn't mean you're gonna\nlike the way it runs, but\n\n85\n00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.500\nit will run on this amount of resources.\n\n86\n00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.020\nAnd two, it's taking into consideration\nnothing other than the operating system.\n\n87\n00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.900\nSo as soon as put your first\napplication and try to run it.\n\n88\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.470\nNow you're running out of resources cuz\nyour operating system is already running\n\n89\n00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.190\nat the minimum.\n\n90\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.960\nSo definitely as Cherokee says,\nthe more you can put in there,\n\n91\n00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.790\nthe better off you're going to be.\n\n92\n00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.880\nBut for the exam, you have to know, hey,\n\n93\n00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.490\nwhat is absolutely required to get\nthis operating system installed?\n\n94\n00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.810\n&gt;&gt; Right, because you might\nactually see a case study or\n\n95\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.330\nsomething like that where\nthey're giving you a scenario.\n\n96\n00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.790\nYou read through the scenario and\nthen they say, hey, could we go ahead and\n\n97\n00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.300\ndeploy this a certain way.\n\n98\n00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.870\nIt's basically like\nmeeting with a customer.\n\n99\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.270\nYou would have this conversation,\nwhat is your current environment?\n\n100\n00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.580\nWhat kind of requirements do you have?\n\n101\n00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.790\nSecurity requirements, budgeting\nrequirements, and things like that.\n\n102\n00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.290\nSo you might see actual\nquestions wrapped up into\n\n103\n00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.460\na case study that you\nmight see in real life.\n\n104\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.640\nSo let's take a look at the processor\nbecause here you need to have at least one\n\n105\n00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.560\ngigahertz or faster processor.\n\n106\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.550\nOr SOC, which stands for System on a Chip.\n\n107\n00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.520\nNow, when we look at RAM,\nthere are two different categories here.\n\n108\n00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.530\nWe need at least one gig if we're gonna\nbe running a 32 bit architecture.\n\n109\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.540\nHowever, if you plan on\nrunning that 64-bit,\n\n110\n00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.610\nyou're going to need at least 2 GB,\nright here.\n\n111\n00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.130\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n112\n00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.050\nAnd again, like Mike and I are saying,\nthis is minimum for that RAM.\n\n113\n00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.650\nI mean, that would be-\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if you could-\n\n114\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.510\n&gt;&gt; Just like a nightmare.\n\n115\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.790\n&gt;&gt; You know, it's kind of funny, because\nyou look at these specs, and you're like,\n\n116\n00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.680\nwait, a 1 Gigahertz processor?\n\n117\n00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.590\n2 GB of RAM.\n\n118\n00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.200\nI would have to special\norder that from somewhere\n\n119\n00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.130\nto get that few resources\nput in the systems.\n\n120\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.620\nSo if you're buying a new system or\nbuilding one,\n\n121\n00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.010\nmost likely these are not\ngonna affect you at all.\n\n122\n00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.960\nBut if we're thinking about upgrading,\ncuz companies, it's easy for us to think.\n\n123\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.460\nI'm just gonna go buy a new laptop.\n\n124\n00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.150\nBut what if you're buying hundreds or\nthousands of machines?\n\n125\n00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.490\nOr you're trying to keep\nMachines in production, right?\n\n126\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.160\nUpgrades are really where these\nminimum requirements come into play.\n\n127\n00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.220\nCuz it might have ran Windows 7 fine,\nbut will it run Windows 10?\n\n128\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.190\n&gt;&gt; And when you're creating your Virtual\nMachines and you're trying to think about\n\n129\n00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.960\nhow much of these resources should we\nallocate, this is a good starting point.\n\n130\n00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.090\nBut you definitely, like we said\nYou wanna test that out first.\n\n131\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now looking at your hard disk space\n\n132\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.590\nagain.\n\n133\n00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.730\nKind of mirroring what Mike was saying.\n\n134\n00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.915\nWoah, 16 gigs for your 32 bit.\n\n135\n00:06:23.915 --> 00:06:26.630\n[LAUGH] And then also here 20 gigs,\n\n136\n00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.280\na little bit more, for\nthat 64 bit architecture as well.\n\n137\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.930\nNow, for your graphics card, you're going\nto need at least DirectX 9 or later.\n\n138\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.230\nAgain, that's pretty common if you're\nbuying a newer piece of hardware.\n\n139\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.630\nThen that's going to come\nintegrated as well as your WDDM for\n\n140\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.050\nthose drivers to support that display,\nagain.\n\n141\n00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.950\nWe're at 800x600, so I think as long as\nyou check those, these are essentials and\n\n142\n00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.150\nthey're almost kind of like gimme\nquestions, because, they're essential.\n\n143\n00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.240\nYou need to know what they are.\n\n144\n00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.530\nSo if you can memorize those and just\nunderstand that then you're good to go.\n\n145\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.960\n&gt;&gt; I like easy questions.\n\n146\n00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.460\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n147\n00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.190\nOkay, now let's take a look at\nWell maybe I'm really not sure.\n\n148\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.160\nSo I know I've passed the hurdle, I've\nchecked my hardware, and I'm good to go.\n\n149\n00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.920\nBut I'm not really sure if Windows 10\nis right for me, so how can I tell?\n\n150\n00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.440\nWell, the good news is, Microsoft hands us\na ton of tools to streamline this process.\n\n151\n00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.860\nAnd I think maybe the hardest part\nof it all is just understanding what\n\n152\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.600\ntools to use, where can I find these\ntools and how can they help me.\n\n153\n00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.030\nSo I've tried to put\nthese links together for\n\n154\n00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.130\nyou to kind of streamline this as well.\n\n155\n00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.210\nSo one that I have a feeling Microsoft\nreally wants you to understand is called\n\n156\n00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.490\nthe Microsoft Assessment and\nPlanning Toolkit.\n\n157\n00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.790\nSo we'll be taking a look\nat this a little bit later.\n\n158\n00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:57.335\nBut I just wanna introduce this to you,\nas well as somewhere,\n\n159\n00:07:57.335 --> 00:08:02.800\nlet me see, I have a ton of\ntabs here open, but your ADK.\n\n160\n00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.692\nThis is the Windows Assessment and\nDeployment Kit.\n\n161\n00:08:05.692 --> 00:08:09.122\nThis is kind of like a bundle or\nlike a suitcase and\n\n162\n00:08:09.122 --> 00:08:12.302\nits got all these little\ntools inside of it and\n\n163\n00:08:12.302 --> 00:08:17.157\na lot of these tools that we will be\nlooking out throughout this series\n\n164\n00:08:17.157 --> 00:08:21.536\nactually are kind of fun on their own,\nbut maybe like a party.\n\n165\n00:08:21.536 --> 00:08:24.396\nLike when you start adding more,\nyou get more fun.\n\n166\n00:08:24.396 --> 00:08:27.725\nSo you get better features and\nthey just work.\n\n167\n00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:31.232\nThey are really designed in\na modular way to work together.\n\n168\n00:08:31.232 --> 00:08:36.127\nSo if you wanted to see what was included\nin our ADK, in our assessment and\n\n169\n00:08:36.127 --> 00:08:40.634\ndeployment kit, let me go ahead and\nclick on this link right here.\n\n170\n00:08:40.634 --> 00:08:45.381\nSome really great documentation and\nI'll scroll down, and maybe zoom in so\n\n171\n00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:46.800\nyou guys can see this.\n\n172\n00:08:50.099 --> 00:08:55.049\nSo you'll see some of these tools that\nwe'll talk about and just know that they\n\n173\n00:08:55.049 --> 00:09:00.692\nare available like the Windows Assessment\nToolkit, Windows Configuration Designer.\n\n174\n00:09:00.692 --> 00:09:05.451\nThese are going to be really focal\npoints within this series and also for\n\n175\n00:09:05.451 --> 00:09:09.355\nthe 697, which is complimentary\nto this show as well.\n\n176\n00:09:09.355 --> 00:09:11.887\nI just wanted to let you know that hey,\n\n177\n00:09:11.887 --> 00:09:15.066\nyou can grab it from this\nparticular link here.\n\n178\n00:09:15.066 --> 00:09:18.691\nBut also if you didn't want all of those,\nMicrosoft does break it down for\n\n179\n00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.281\nindividual downloads as well.\n\n180\n00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:24.004\nSo you can just kind of piecemeal\nthem together as you choose.\n\n181\n00:09:24.004 --> 00:09:31.299\nNow if you're really confused as to, look,\nI have this line of business application.\n\n182\n00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:33.725\nMy system isn't even going\nto be worth anything,\n\n183\n00:09:33.725 --> 00:09:36.450\nif I don't have this particular\napplication running.\n\n184\n00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.488\nThat's gonna be the deciding factor there.\n\n185\n00:09:39.488 --> 00:09:41.768\nWell, they put together this website.\n\n186\n00:09:41.768 --> 00:09:46.318\nSo you can just, I wouldn't say\nit's 100% comprehensive, but\n\n187\n00:09:46.318 --> 00:09:49.937\nthe most common applications\nare gonna be noted here.\n\n188\n00:09:49.937 --> 00:09:54.993\nThey even put a chart for their most\ncommon to see with what versions.\n\n189\n00:09:54.993 --> 00:09:59.069\nLet me zoom in, so you all can\nsee this like Cisco, any connect.\n\n190\n00:09:59.069 --> 00:10:02.754\nSo maybe this is a particular application\nthat your business relies on.\n\n191\n00:10:02.754 --> 00:10:05.465\nYou can look at a quick\nglance to see which versions.\n\n192\n00:10:05.465 --> 00:10:06.801\nWe're going to support that.\n\n193\n00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:10.460\nAnd if you have a custom application\nthat you wanna check on,\n\n194\n00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.340\nyou could go ahead and do that.\n\n195\n00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.921\nNow, I'm just gonna kind of\npick a haphazard one here.\n\n196\n00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:19.455\nSo let's say,\nSlack which is the messaging system.\n\n197\n00:10:19.455 --> 00:10:24.227\nBut perhaps that was something that was\nintegral that my business functionality.\n\n198\n00:10:24.227 --> 00:10:27.398\nSo I'm gonna check to see if\nWindows 10 is even a viable option.\n\n199\n00:10:27.398 --> 00:10:33.317\nSo I'll check and here,\nyou can see that Slack is adopted.\n\n200\n00:10:33.317 --> 00:10:37.128\nSo at least I can start making\nthose business decisions and\n\n201\n00:10:37.128 --> 00:10:41.948\nkind of formulate a plan to present to\nsomeone, if I'm not the decider for\n\n202\n00:10:41.948 --> 00:10:45.249\nthe IT department or\nwhatever your situation is.\n\n203\n00:10:45.249 --> 00:10:49.327\nJust kind of giving you a lot\nof tools at your disposal.\n\n204\n00:10:49.327 --> 00:10:52.344\nSo what else do we got here?\n\n205\n00:10:52.344 --> 00:10:55.017\nOnce, let's say we've decided,\nhey, you know what?\n\n206\n00:10:55.017 --> 00:10:57.680\nWindows 10 is a good choice for me.\n\n207\n00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.320\nWe need to start thinking about how\nwe're going to get that operating\n\n208\n00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.880\nsystem deployed.\n\n209\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.970\nThere are different situations, different\ninstances that you need to consider.\n\n210\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:12.800\nSo Microsoft breaks it down into these\nthree categories here and we'll talk\n\n211\n00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.900\nabout them holistically, and then look\nat them a little bit more individually.\n\n212\n00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.128\nThe first one is going to be wipe and\nload.\n\n213\n00:11:20.128 --> 00:11:21.426\nIt's kind of a funny name.\n\n214\n00:11:21.426 --> 00:11:24.265\nI used to know it as just a clean install.\n\n215\n00:11:24.265 --> 00:11:25.984\nMaybe like a bare-bones install.\n\n216\n00:11:25.984 --> 00:11:30.566\nBut basically, it's kind of like\ngetting a fresh new haircut.\n\n217\n00:11:30.566 --> 00:11:32.438\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So starting fresh and\n\n218\n00:11:32.438 --> 00:11:37.336\nwe'll take a look at that a little bit\nmore, but where this is important?\n\n219\n00:11:37.336 --> 00:11:39.847\nI wanted to kind of lay out these steps.\n\n220\n00:11:39.847 --> 00:11:43.341\nBecause if you've never taken\na Microsoft exam before,\n\n221\n00:11:43.341 --> 00:11:47.945\nthere are sometimes situations where\nyou need to know sequential orders.\n\n222\n00:11:47.945 --> 00:11:53.096\nSo this could be really helpful there just\nunderstanding how this process works.\n\n223\n00:11:53.096 --> 00:11:58.456\nSo looking at that wipe and load, you're\ngonna capture the data and settings.\n\n224\n00:11:58.456 --> 00:12:05.148\nSo I wouldn't say 100% synonymous,\nbut very similar to backing up.\n\n225\n00:12:05.148 --> 00:12:06.623\nSo if you create the backup,\n\n226\n00:12:06.623 --> 00:12:10.015\nit may be an additional not like\nyour normal enterprise backups.\n\n227\n00:12:10.015 --> 00:12:14.244\nBut hey, let's just make sure we have\na good working order of that information,\n\n228\n00:12:14.244 --> 00:12:16.622\nanything that I want\nto permanently retain.\n\n229\n00:12:16.622 --> 00:12:19.269\nBecause like I said,\nwe're wiping this information.\n\n230\n00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:21.769\nYou are wiping the system out.\n\n231\n00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:26.644\nWe're gonna deploy images, they can be\ncustom here and then we'll go ahead and\n\n232\n00:12:26.644 --> 00:12:31.011\ninstall or inject our drivers and\napplications and restore the data and\n\n233\n00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:32.266\nsettings that way.\n\n234\n00:12:32.266 --> 00:12:34.819\nSo really,\nthere's not too many situations.\n\n235\n00:12:34.819 --> 00:12:37.241\nI can't think of a situation\nwhere this would be horrible.\n\n236\n00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:41.014\nI don't know if you can, Mike,\nbut I think it's pretty viable.\n\n237\n00:12:41.014 --> 00:12:43.578\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's usually one\nof our favorite ways to go.\n\n238\n00:12:43.578 --> 00:12:46.766\nBecause you are removing all traces\nof the old operating system.\n\n239\n00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.854\nThere's no DLLs or\nanything weird hanging out.\n\n240\n00:12:49.854 --> 00:12:52.264\nThere may be-\n&gt;&gt; Residual lingering problems.\n\n241\n00:12:52.264 --> 00:12:55.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, little quirky things can go\nwrong when some DLLs get overwritten and\n\n242\n00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.408\nthey shouldn't have or they don't get\noverwritten and they should have.\n\n243\n00:12:59.408 --> 00:13:04.031\nSo quirky things can happen\nsometimes during an upgrade process.\n\n244\n00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:06.754\nThe only reason I can think\nthat you wouldn't do a wipe and\n\n245\n00:13:06.754 --> 00:13:10.044\nload though is if you had a line of\nbusiness, a custom application and\n\n246\n00:13:10.044 --> 00:13:12.849\nit wasn't easy to get the source\nfiles to reinstall that.\n\n247\n00:13:12.849 --> 00:13:16.586\nSo you need to try to preserve that app or\nsomething like that.\n\n248\n00:13:16.586 --> 00:13:21.141\nBut most of the time, we can simply\nyou know do some type of export.\n\n249\n00:13:21.141 --> 00:13:23.830\nGet the data off of there and\nthen we install.\n\n250\n00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.618\n&gt;&gt; And there are so many tools available\nto us today that make this process a lot\n\n251\n00:13:28.618 --> 00:13:30.977\neasier than historically has been.\n\n252\n00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:34.477\nNow l agree with Mike,\nl think this is great solution,\n\n253\n00:13:34.477 --> 00:13:36.921\nespecially for Enterprise options.\n\n254\n00:13:36.921 --> 00:13:41.567\nBut Microsoft really wants us to\nlean towards this middle column and\n\n255\n00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:44.267\nthis is going to be an in place upgrade.\n\n256\n00:13:44.267 --> 00:13:46.023\nSo I want you guys to think about that.\n\n257\n00:13:46.023 --> 00:13:49.601\nIn place upgrades will preserve the data,\nsettings,\n\n258\n00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:52.730\napplications and\nthe drivers theoretically.\n\n259\n00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.217\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n260\n00:13:54.217 --> 00:13:56.278\n&gt;&gt; And then you can go ahead and\n\n261\n00:13:56.278 --> 00:14:01.476\ninstall a standard operating system\nimage that as long as the upgrade\n\n262\n00:14:01.476 --> 00:14:07.301\npath is available for you, as long as\nyou're not working in an older system,\n\n263\n00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:10.192\nyou can see here that I have the usage.\n\n264\n00:14:10.192 --> 00:14:13.137\nYou have to be starting with\nat least Windows 7 or later.\n\n265\n00:14:13.137 --> 00:14:17.707\nSo we're not talking XP or Vista for\nthis particular or even older, but\n\n266\n00:14:17.707 --> 00:14:19.701\nfor these operating systems.\n\n267\n00:14:19.701 --> 00:14:22.453\n&gt;&gt; And that's something that's changed and\nwe're talking about all the big\n\n268\n00:14:22.453 --> 00:14:25.738\nchanges that Windows 10 is bringing, and\nthis is one area it's definitely changing.\n\n269\n00:14:25.738 --> 00:14:30.099\nI know you got a lot more to talk about\nit, but I'm old school and wipe and\n\n270\n00:14:30.099 --> 00:14:33.023\nload or\nclean installs was always the way to go.\n\n271\n00:14:33.023 --> 00:14:34.861\nWith Windows 10 though, that is changing.\n\n272\n00:14:34.861 --> 00:14:38.705\nAs you say, you're seeing Microsoft\ndriving you towards those end place\n\n273\n00:14:38.705 --> 00:14:41.997\nupgrades and it's so\neasy to do as long as you're 7 and later.\n\n274\n00:14:41.997 --> 00:14:44.389\nBecause the operating systems are so\nsimilar,\n\n275\n00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:47.936\nthe hardware requirements are the same and\nwe are seeing more of that.\n\n276\n00:14:47.936 --> 00:14:52.034\nAnd really, the upgrades that occur now\nwith this new upgrade model are almost\n\n277\n00:14:52.034 --> 00:14:55.526\nlike doing in place upgrades every\nfew months, every six months.\n\n278\n00:14:55.526 --> 00:14:58.263\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's kind of just\nlike that rolling system here.\n\n279\n00:14:58.263 --> 00:15:00.559\nSo definitely, we see that big change.\n\n280\n00:15:00.559 --> 00:15:05.255\nNow something to think about with the,\nI should have mentioned this prior to.\n\n281\n00:15:05.255 --> 00:15:07.457\nI have this little helpful tool section.\n\n282\n00:15:07.457 --> 00:15:12.366\nBut if you're not 100% sure with your\napplications and how they're gonna be\n\n283\n00:15:12.366 --> 00:15:17.348\ninteracting with the new operating system,\nMicrosoft does provide some tools to\n\n284\n00:15:17.348 --> 00:15:22.212\nhelp at least check and see if they're\ngoing to compatible with the new system.\n\n285\n00:15:22.212 --> 00:15:27.680\nYou might need to go ahead and check for\nupdates for those applications.\n\n286\n00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.043\nSometimes they're not compatible, so\nthat is something you wanna check on.\n\n287\n00:15:32.043 --> 00:15:34.211\nNow, talking about new.\n\n288\n00:15:34.211 --> 00:15:39.049\nThis is also a new component here at\nleast for me and the way that I always\n\n289\n00:15:39.049 --> 00:15:43.487\nwas thinking, because this\nprovisioning is not re-imaging.\n\n290\n00:15:43.487 --> 00:15:46.828\nSo this is not the same as like a wipe and\nload or clean install.\n\n291\n00:15:46.828 --> 00:15:51.424\nSo when you hear this term and I may,\nI gotta really try to use this term.\n\n292\n00:15:51.424 --> 00:15:55.904\nBecause in provisioning, I always thought,\nokay, well, I'm getting things ready.\n\n293\n00:15:55.904 --> 00:16:00.394\nWell, provisioning in Microsoft\nlanguage now is really\n\n294\n00:16:00.394 --> 00:16:05.175\nfocusing on Transforming\na device to an enterprise device.\n\n295\n00:16:05.175 --> 00:16:12.120\nSo let's say maybe I have, you see this\nterm right here, this acronym, CYOD.\n\n296\n00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.330\nSo you might be familiar with the term\nBYOD for bring your own device, but\n\n297\n00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.680\nnow you see something called\nchoose your own device.\n\n298\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.480\nSo it's all about the end user and the\nemployee and giving them options here, so\n\n299\n00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.980\nuser centric.\n\n300\n00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.910\nAnd, If I give someone that opportunity or\nthat capability to choose,\n\n301\n00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:32.680\nmaybe they really like the tablet\nthat they were using at home.\n\n302\n00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.490\nSo maybe it's running Windows 10 Home.\n\n303\n00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.070\nBut they want to bring it into work and\nstart running it there.\n\n304\n00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.570\nWell, we can't take that tablet as is.\n\n305\n00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.430\nThere are some things that we need to do\nto make sure that we're adhering to our\n\n306\n00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.270\ncorporate security policy.\n\n307\n00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:53.090\nAnd making sure that this device is\noptimized for business functionality.\n\n308\n00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.540\nSo that's what provision is.\n\n309\n00:16:54.540 --> 00:17:00.950\nSo I can create provisioning files and\nthen modify\n\n310\n00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:06.880\nthe existing operating system to make it\nworkable or usable in a work environment.\n\n311\n00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.260\nSo that's what provisioning is.\n\n312\n00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.290\nThat's kind of a newer one for\nme, too, there Mike.\n\n313\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it is, and\nwe see this especially like\n\n314\n00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:17.720\nif you're using In Tune as your\nmobile device management platform.\n\n315\n00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.237\nWe can provision Windows 10 devices,\nwe can provision an IOS devices and\n\n316\n00:17:22.237 --> 00:17:27.199\nlike you said, a kind of enterprise wide\npreparation of devices for company use.\n\n317\n00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:31.609\nAnd that means getting those\nsecurity profiles on there,\n\n318\n00:17:31.609 --> 00:17:37.647\nrequiring passwords or pins to get back\ninto the device requiring encryption.\n\n319\n00:17:37.647 --> 00:17:41.347\nMaking those choices for our users so they\ncan use them in our business environment\n\n320\n00:17:41.347 --> 00:17:43.610\nand comply with our security policies.\n\n321\n00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes and this so for\n\n322\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.920\nlike continuous monitoring,\nthis is not what they're referencing here.\n\n323\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.438\nSo that's gonna be an additional solution.\n\n324\n00:17:51.438 --> 00:17:56.008\nSo once you have provision device, then\nyou can go ahead and if you're gonna be\n\n325\n00:17:56.008 --> 00:18:00.441\nusing system center or some other\nmonitoring tool to make sure that there's\n\n326\n00:18:00.441 --> 00:18:05.247\nno configuration drift, or that you\nare still, in like some health compliance.\n\n327\n00:18:05.247 --> 00:18:09.943\nIf you have that kind of incorporated into\nyour security policy then that's something\n\n328\n00:18:09.943 --> 00:18:13.480\nadditional that you would want to\nmake sure stays with that device\n\n329\n00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.070\ndepending on if you have like different\ntypes of agents available for that.\n\n330\n00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:23.120\nBut Windows or Microsoft does provide\na good documentation on where I can go to\n\n331\n00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:29.570\nfind information on how I can go ahead and\nprovision different types of devices here.\n\n332\n00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:33.020\nSo here we can see it applies to\nWindows 10, Windows 10 mobile.\n\n333\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.557\nAnd you know that's another big\nthing I haven't mentioned yet Mike.\n\n334\n00:18:36.557 --> 00:18:38.975\n&gt;&gt; Mh-mm.\nThat a really big change is that,\n\n335\n00:18:38.975 --> 00:18:43.883\nwith the advent of Windows 10,\nthe developers at Microsoft really\n\n336\n00:18:43.883 --> 00:18:48.890\nwanted to stand behind this notion\nof having a cross device platform.\n\n337\n00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:57.370\nLike hey, this operating system works on\nyour laptop or your Xbox or your phone.\n\n338\n00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.820\nSo this is kinda of a cool\nidea that we see here and\n\n339\n00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.740\nthen there's also linkage to provide\ndifferent types of provisioning as well.\n\n340\n00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.195\nThat makes it a little bit easier for\nthe developers I would think.\n\n341\n00:19:07.195 --> 00:19:10.740\nCuz instead of developing four different\napplications for different platforms,\n\n342\n00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.790\nI've got one that's cross platform.\n\n343\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.500\nIf it's running Windows 10,\nit'll run on that device.\n\n344\n00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.750\n&gt;&gt; That's right and on Xbox, that's one\nthat I'm always gonna kinda think about,\n\n345\n00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.970\nbecause we are PlayStation\npeople over here, so.\n\n346\n00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:23.556\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n347\n00:19:23.556 --> 00:19:24.119\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n\n348\n00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:26.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I didn't say that.\n\n349\n00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.260\nAll right, so what else do we have here?\n\n350\n00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.840\nSo knowing what version you're currently\nrunning on is going to be a big\n\n351\n00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.550\ndetermining factor because we'll take\na look at upgrade paths a little bit more.\n\n352\n00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.940\nBut knowing like, let's say, hey I\ndon't want to perform a wipe and load.\n\n353\n00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.040\nI wanna look at an in place upgrade.\n\n354\n00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.590\nHow do I know if my system is\ncapable of allowing that to happen?\n\n355\n00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.420\nSo something we can do here.\n\n356\n00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.220\nAnd let me just go down.\n\n357\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.800\nIf you can either type in Cortana, in\nthe search bar, you can type in about and\n\n358\n00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.310\nit should bring up an information\nicon here that says about your PC.\n\n359\n00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:05.160\nSo right down here in this section,\nyou'll see Windows specifications.\n\n360\n00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.330\nIf I can zoom in a little bit,\nhopefully you guys can see that.\n\n361\n00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.140\nThere we go, right here.\n\n362\n00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.140\nSo we can see that I'm currently\nrunning Windows 10 Enterprise and\n\n363\n00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.730\nI have a Version 17.09,\nyou can see the build as well.\n\n364\n00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.270\nSo this will be a good\nindication to let you know\n\n365\n00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.490\ncurrently where you are in your systems.\n\n366\n00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.430\nThe map tool that I was\ntalking about previously,\n\n367\n00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:30.110\nthat is going to be a really\ncool tool that you guys can use.\n\n368\n00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.950\nSo I can check individually\non my system here.\n\n369\n00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.210\nBut let's say from an enterprise\nperspective, a networking perspective,\n\n370\n00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.960\nI wanna reach out to my network and\nsee if, hey, is Mike's device capable for\n\n371\n00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.050\nthis upgrade?\n\n372\n00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:44.740\nSo that tool is agentless, so\n\n373\n00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:49.420\nit means there's not an active piece\nof software residing on that computer.\n\n374\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:54.330\nAll it does is leverage a WMI query and\nit'll go ahead and pull that information\n\n375\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:58.520\nand generate a report to let you know who\nis available for this particular upgrade.\n\n376\n00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fantastic.\n\n377\n00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:03.100\nCuz I'm definitely not gonna run around\nto every machine if I have thousands of\n\n378\n00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.240\ncomputers where we geographically\nspread out at different offices.\n\n379\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.040\nI can't go to each machine and\ngo to that About screen.\n\n380\n00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.170\nI really don't wanna have to install\na piece of software on every device and\n\n381\n00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.550\nhave a report back, so the fact that\nthey've got this agentless tool,\n\n382\n00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.530\nthat allow me to get a report back and\n\n383\n00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.990\nsee Enterprise Wide, if we're ready\nto start upgrading, is fantastic.\n\n384\n00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so there's a couple other\nthings, so that's really cool because like\n\n385\n00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.150\nMike said, we don't wanna be running\naround sneaker netting things anymore.\n\n386\n00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.060\nAnother way you could quickly tell,\nlet me see if I can remember this.\n\n387\n00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:40.130\nIt's just gonna be Windows r here and\nI think, I already have it pulled up.\n\n388\n00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.850\nLet me zoom in so you can see this.\n\n389\n00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.710\nIt's going to be winver for\nWindows version.\n\n390\n00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.490\nClick OK and\n\n391\n00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.730\nthen it will pull up in a quick glance\nthe same information, if I can find it.\n\n392\n00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.225\nOkay, it's up here at the top left corner.\n\n393\n00:21:52.225 --> 00:21:56.165\nBut you can see here that this also\nhas my versioning information or\n\n394\n00:21:56.165 --> 00:21:57.980\nmaybe you can't because it's so small.\n\n395\n00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.305\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But there you go,\n\n396\n00:21:59.305 --> 00:22:00.995\nnow you should be able to see that.\n\n397\n00:22:00.995 --> 00:22:06.032\nSame info here, just a different\nway about getting that information.\n\n398\n00:22:06.032 --> 00:22:09.692\n&gt;&gt; I like that about screen two,\nbecause just above the Windows versioning\n\n399\n00:22:09.692 --> 00:22:12.699\ninformation is the PC's information,\nhardware-wise.\n\n400\n00:22:12.699 --> 00:22:18.250\nIt's a good time to check on your minimum\nrequirements, RAM, CPU, things like that.\n\n401\n00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:19.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike.\nIt's really great if we can look at that\n\n402\n00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:20.720\ninformation.\n\n403\n00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.048\nAnd any kind of information can be\nhelpful to us during this process.\n\n404\n00:22:24.048 --> 00:22:28.025\nFor instance, if you look at my screen,\nthe information we just obtained,\n\n405\n00:22:28.025 --> 00:22:29.527\nversion 1709, right?\n\n406\n00:22:29.527 --> 00:22:35.339\nSo this can also give us a clue as\nto what type of channels we are on,\n\n407\n00:22:35.339 --> 00:22:40.610\nas far as when and\nhow we obtain update information.\n\n408\n00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.720\nWe're gonna put a pin in this and\ncome back and\n\n409\n00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.710\nlook at this in more detail, but\nI just kind of wanted to point that out.\n\n410\n00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.970\nAny kind of information\nis going to be good for\n\n411\n00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.140\nus, at least getting started here.\n\n412\n00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.220\nSo to that note, let's go ahead and\n\n413\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.950\ntake a look at some information,\nreferencing skills or addition.\n\n414\n00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:04.190\nSo a skill is just going to be short for\nstock keeping unit.\n\n415\n00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:08.226\nAnd let me find that correct, here we go.\n\n416\n00:23:08.226 --> 00:23:12.970\nSo you`ll see different skews for\ndifferent fringe\n\n417\n00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:18.045\noperating systems, so\nin order to maintain with GDPR.\n\n418\n00:23:18.045 --> 00:23:21.936\nMicrosoft has to kind of pull back\nsome of its components, such as\n\n419\n00:23:21.936 --> 00:23:27.260\nthe Windows Media Player if we're talking\nabout shipping overseas and so forth.\n\n420\n00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:33.820\nBut let's take a look at their core or\nthe most used editions here.\n\n421\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.200\nSo I should say these are the editions,\nbut every now and\n\n422\n00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.410\nthen you'll find some slight differences.\n\n423\n00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:42.120\nSo Windows 10 Home, this operating system,\n\n424\n00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:47.070\nif you've been familiar with operating\nsystems in Windows environments for\n\n425\n00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.520\na while, it's kind of got that\nsame nostalgic feeling like, hey,\n\n426\n00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.420\nthis is gonna be really designed for\nmy home user.\n\n427\n00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.071\nIt's going to be at a lower price point.\n\n428\n00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:59.755\nIt doesn't have all the bells and whistles\nand a lot of those enterprise capabilities\n\n429\n00:23:59.755 --> 00:24:02.954\nthat we see, of course,\nwith that higher price, right?\n\n430\n00:24:02.954 --> 00:24:06.029\nSo Just keeping that in mind and\nas we continue and\n\n431\n00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:10.011\nwe'll look specifically at\nthose individual upgrade paths.\n\n432\n00:24:10.011 --> 00:24:13.668\nYou kinda have to think about that\nlike hey, if I'm starting out\n\n433\n00:24:13.668 --> 00:24:17.391\nwith Windows 7 Home edition,\nI shouldn't expect to go ahead and\n\n434\n00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:20.525\nbe running into that Pro edition and\nthings like that.\n\n435\n00:24:20.525 --> 00:24:24.850\nYou kinda have to keep in mind whenever\nyou're looking at these operating systems.\n\n436\n00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:29.228\nSo again, Pro is going to be\nkind of a step up in features\n\n437\n00:24:29.228 --> 00:24:32.386\navailable to us as well as Enterprise.\n\n438\n00:24:32.386 --> 00:24:34.300\nAnd so looking at the size,\n\n439\n00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:39.809\nmaybe I've determined that I wanna use\nthis operating system for my company.\n\n440\n00:24:39.809 --> 00:24:42.397\nSo trying to determine if\nI wanna go with Pro or\n\n441\n00:24:42.397 --> 00:24:45.881\nEnterprise is going to be what\nI really need to look at there.\n\n442\n00:24:45.881 --> 00:24:47.622\nWhat's the size of my organization?\n\n443\n00:24:47.622 --> 00:24:49.854\nAm I looking at a smaller or\na medium sized?\n\n444\n00:24:49.854 --> 00:24:52.328\nPro might be something that I'd choose.\n\n445\n00:24:52.328 --> 00:24:54.895\nOr if I need a larger scale ability,\n\n446\n00:24:54.895 --> 00:25:00.128\nthen Enterprise would probably be\nthe way that my company leans toward.\n\n447\n00:25:00.128 --> 00:25:04.418\nNow looking at Windows 10 Mobile and\nthat's not to say you can't have a mix in\n\n448\n00:25:04.418 --> 00:25:08.838\nyour environment and that's really what\nWindows 10 is all about is having that\n\n449\n00:25:08.838 --> 00:25:11.779\nfunctionality, that option\nto have that mix there.\n\n450\n00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:14.668\nSo again, we see Windows 10 Mobile.\n\n451\n00:25:14.668 --> 00:25:17.269\nNot as many features as the Enterprise,\nbut\n\n452\n00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:20.091\njust knowing that these\noptions are out there.\n\n453\n00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:23.811\nNow, Windows 10 Education is not\ngonna be something you can go out and\n\n454\n00:25:23.811 --> 00:25:25.299\npurchase in a retail venue.\n\n455\n00:25:25.299 --> 00:25:28.362\nThis is going to be on\na licensing option here for\n\n456\n00:25:28.362 --> 00:25:32.356\nthose educational partners,\nreally streamlined for that.\n\n457\n00:25:32.356 --> 00:25:39.389\nNow if you're using Windows 10 IoT Core,\nthat's going to be for your IoT devices.\n\n458\n00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:44.793\nAll sorts of like little projects\nthat you might have running along and\n\n459\n00:25:44.793 --> 00:25:49.464\nwe see this happening or\nthe use of IoT Core more nowadays than\n\n460\n00:25:49.464 --> 00:25:53.414\nwe didn't have this operating\nsystem in the past.\n\n461\n00:25:53.414 --> 00:25:55.596\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it wasn't a thing.\n\n462\n00:25:55.596 --> 00:25:57.943\n&gt;&gt; When there was no Internet of Things.\n\n463\n00:25:57.943 --> 00:25:59.625\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there weren't any thing.\n\n464\n00:25:59.625 --> 00:26:01.659\n&gt;&gt; But it was, but\nit wasn't like it is now, I guess.\n\n465\n00:26:01.659 --> 00:26:03.874\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there wasn't a need,\n\n466\n00:26:03.874 --> 00:26:06.795\nlet's just say that and then-\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, just a quick aside.\n\n467\n00:26:06.795 --> 00:26:08.818\nIt always makes me laugh,\ncuz we've had an Internet.\n\n468\n00:26:08.818 --> 00:26:10.896\nWe've had things connected\nto the internet, but\n\n469\n00:26:10.896 --> 00:26:12.440\nthat wasn't an Internet of Things.\n\n470\n00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.288\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't like\nan official acronym there.\n\n471\n00:26:14.288 --> 00:26:14.983\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n472\n00:26:14.983 --> 00:26:16.115\n&gt;&gt; With the IoT.\n\n473\n00:26:16.115 --> 00:26:18.139\n&gt;&gt; I know what they mean, but\nI just like picking on them.\n\n474\n00:26:18.139 --> 00:26:21.763\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and some of these you guys\nmight already be familiar with.\n\n475\n00:26:21.763 --> 00:26:24.746\nI just wanna kinda go over them, so\nyou know the options that are out there.\n\n476\n00:26:24.746 --> 00:26:29.383\nBecause even like this one, I was kind of\nlike shocked when I saw this one just kind\n\n477\n00:26:29.383 --> 00:26:31.032\nof jump out the bushes at me.\n\n478\n00:26:31.032 --> 00:26:33.578\nThis Windows 10 S like what is that?\n\n479\n00:26:33.578 --> 00:26:36.460\nBut I might even have a link here,\nyou guys.\n\n480\n00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:41.074\nI'll put it in the show notes,\nbut Windows 10 S is going to be,\n\n481\n00:26:41.074 --> 00:26:43.550\nthat's not the right one.\n\n482\n00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:46.070\nIt's going to be with security.\n\n483\n00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.636\nHere we go, actually.\n\n484\n00:26:47.636 --> 00:26:50.544\nMight as well take a look at\nthis since we're right here, but\n\n485\n00:26:50.544 --> 00:26:52.669\nI will scroll all the way\ndown at the bottom.\n\n486\n00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:55.815\nI think they have a little video\nthat you can watch right here,\n\n487\n00:26:55.815 --> 00:26:58.249\nif you click on this\nlearn about Windows 10 S.\n\n488\n00:26:58.249 --> 00:27:02.770\nSo this is going to be, if you think\nabout the term hardening a system,\n\n489\n00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:06.159\nthis is taking that idea and\nreally running with it.\n\n490\n00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:08.611\nYou're hardening a system\nwith Windows 10 S.\n\n491\n00:27:08.611 --> 00:27:13.692\nYou can only utilize\nWindows Store approved,\n\n492\n00:27:13.692 --> 00:27:16.826\napplications, browsers.\n\n493\n00:27:16.826 --> 00:27:18.569\n&gt;&gt; That's the way I think of that version.\n\n494\n00:27:18.569 --> 00:27:21.637\nThe S stands for store,\nbecause you can only run store apps.\n\n495\n00:27:21.637 --> 00:27:22.296\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n496\n00:27:22.296 --> 00:27:27.664\n&gt;&gt; And it's secured and hardened,\nbecause you can't do anything to it.\n\n497\n00:27:27.664 --> 00:27:30.408\nI can't install off the shelf products.\n\n498\n00:27:30.408 --> 00:27:33.685\nI can't put other things in there that\nare gonna open up security holes.\n\n499\n00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:37.745\nSo I don't know that it's that much more\nsecure than any other version of Windows,\n\n500\n00:27:37.745 --> 00:27:41.225\nbut it's hardened in the fact that you\ncan't do a lot of changes to it and\n\n501\n00:27:41.225 --> 00:27:42.345\nthat's a good thing.\n\n502\n00:27:42.345 --> 00:27:45.936\nAnd for some systems where I don't\nwant my users, maybe it's students and\n\n503\n00:27:45.936 --> 00:27:48.216\nI'm passing out services\nto all the students.\n\n504\n00:27:48.216 --> 00:27:50.289\nI don't want them adding and\ninstalling things.\n\n505\n00:27:50.289 --> 00:27:52.827\nSo definitely see a big future for that.\n\n506\n00:27:52.827 --> 00:27:56.044\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so just knowing that\nthat is available for you also.\n\n507\n00:27:56.044 --> 00:27:58.821\nAnd so if we look at some of\nthe differences here and you guys,\n\n508\n00:27:58.821 --> 00:28:02.150\nI encourage you to spend time and\nreally drill through the differences.\n\n509\n00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:06.543\nMaybe as we continue taking a look at\ndifferent features that the operating\n\n510\n00:28:06.543 --> 00:28:10.449\nsystem has to offer, you might get\nyour wheels turning and think,\n\n511\n00:28:10.449 --> 00:28:13.189\nI wonder if home has\nthat particular feature.\n\n512\n00:28:13.189 --> 00:28:16.608\nOr whatever feature is something that\nyou're like wow, I think that's great.\n\n513\n00:28:16.608 --> 00:28:19.217\nI really wanna take advantage of that and\nleverage it.\n\n514\n00:28:19.217 --> 00:28:21.885\nYou can look at,\nI think I have right here.\n\n515\n00:28:21.885 --> 00:28:24.004\nThere's, oops, somewhere.\n\n516\n00:28:24.004 --> 00:28:27.548\nSorry guys, I have so many tabs going on.\n\n517\n00:28:27.548 --> 00:28:31.755\nMicrosoft does and I'll try to find the\nlinks and put them in the show notes for\n\n518\n00:28:31.755 --> 00:28:34.927\nyou, but there are different\nfeatures like spreadsheets\n\n519\n00:28:34.927 --> 00:28:38.047\nthat show you which features\nare available and whatnot.\n\n520\n00:28:38.047 --> 00:28:41.145\nSo you can make that decision\non your own like Cortana.\n\n521\n00:28:41.145 --> 00:28:43.555\nMaybe that's something you need,\nmaybe it's not.\n\n522\n00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:48.696\nBut just knowing that you\nhave that option there.\n\n523\n00:28:48.696 --> 00:28:56.069\nSo again, this particular website, wrong\none has, let me zoom out a little bit.\n\n524\n00:28:56.069 --> 00:28:57.993\nYou can look at a glance.\n\n525\n00:28:57.993 --> 00:29:01.926\nThey take the two,\nI guess maybe the most popular ones here.\n\n526\n00:29:01.926 --> 00:29:04.558\nHome and Pro and\nkind of line them up side by side, so\n\n527\n00:29:04.558 --> 00:29:06.590\nyou can look at the differences there.\n\n528\n00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:09.373\nBut I think that's enough to get started.\n\n529\n00:29:09.373 --> 00:29:12.328\nI think you guys have plenty\nto look at as far as homework.\n\n530\n00:29:12.328 --> 00:29:16.362\nIf you're not familiar with these editions\nand these deployment options, but\n\n531\n00:29:16.362 --> 00:29:19.144\nthe good news is we're gonna\ncome back with a part two.\n\n532\n00:29:19.144 --> 00:29:22.614\nWe'll take an in-depth look at\nthose deployment options and\n\n533\n00:29:22.614 --> 00:29:24.288\nthen cover a few more things.\n\n534\n00:29:24.288 --> 00:29:26.341\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan, Cherokee.\n\n535\n00:29:26.341 --> 00:29:27.431\nI like what I've heard so far.\n\n536\n00:29:27.431 --> 00:29:31.330\nHope everybody out there has as\nwell look forward to part two.\n\n537\n00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:32.217\nHope to see you back here.\n\n538\n00:29:32.217 --> 00:29:34.818\nBut for now, signing off for ITProTV.\n\n539\n00:29:34.818 --> 00:29:36.149\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n540\n00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.874\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n541\n00:29:36.874 --> 00:29:38.583\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n542\n00:29:38.583 --> 00:29:44.449\n[MUSIC]\n\n543\n00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:47.863\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.369\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:12.722\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:17.216\nwelcome to another exciting episode here\nat ITProTV, I'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:22.130\nToday, we're doing an installing and\nconfiguring, Windows 10, preparation for\n\n7\n00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.090\nthat 70-698 exam.\n\n8\n00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.950\nAnd in this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.100\nwe're actually doing a part two on\npreparing for installation of Windows 10.\n\n10\n00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.410\nBack with us in studios\nis Ms Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.350\nWelcome back Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me.\n\n12\n00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.370\nI know we're still\ntalking about preparing.\n\n13\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.110\nWe haven't actually jumped in\nthe saddle yet, but don't worry.\n\n14\n00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.230\nThere's plenty of that to come.\n\n15\n00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.370\nSo we really do need to take some\ntime to logically think about,\n\n16\n00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.680\nthis is a large portion of the exam.\n\n17\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.730\nYou're going to get questions\nabout really designing and\n\n18\n00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.870\nchoosing the right operating system for\nyour environment.\n\n19\n00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.140\nSo I'd like you to spend some extra time,\nI said I'd come back with a part two to\n\n20\n00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.663\ndive a little more in depth in\nsome of those deployment options.\n\n21\n00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:08.699\nI'd like to have a conversation Mike\nabout just kind of what are some things\n\n22\n00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:09.610\nwe think about?\n\n23\n00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.210\nOr at least maybe you think about?\n\n24\n00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.050\nOr what's something that you think about,\nright?\n\n25\n00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.800\nSo when we're sitting down\nwith our customer and\n\n26\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.990\nwe're having these discussions,\nor we're trying to plan.\n\n27\n00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.490\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\nI have something that Microsoft,\n\n28\n00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.770\nthey lay it out in this way, right?\n\n29\n00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.263\nSo, some deployment considerations.\n\n30\n00:01:27.263 --> 00:01:32.010\nNow, when we`re talking\nbare metal custom image.\n\n31\n00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.027\nLets say I got a PO for\nI don't know 500 surfaces.\n\n32\n00:01:36.027 --> 00:01:40.498\nAnd I can choose the operating system,\nI`m starting from fresh.\n\n33\n00:01:40.498 --> 00:01:42.595\nIt`s kind of easy that way right?\n\n34\n00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:45.440\nThere`s not a lot of variation, but\n\n35\n00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.290\nwhen I have an existing infrastructure\nwhich that's usually what happens, right?\n\n36\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.770\nI might even have a mixture of\ndifferent types of platforms.\n\n37\n00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.290\nSo that's where things\nget a little complicated.\n\n38\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.230\nAnd in place upgrades are not\nalways the best solution.\n\n39\n00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.500\nAlthough, we were talking about Microsoft\ndoes like us to lean that way, but\n\n40\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.220\nthere are some exceptions where we can't.\n\n41\n00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.870\nSo we just have to look at a bare metal or\n\n42\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.170\na white bin load to type installation,\nright?\n\n43\n00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.590\nSo let's take a look at this first column.\n\n44\n00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.610\nSo device considerations.\n\n45\n00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.540\nThis is a big one.\n\n46\n00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.840\nIf we're talking about BIOS to UEFI.\n\n47\n00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.570\nThere's currently no supported\ntransition or bridge there.\n\n48\n00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.460\nSo you're not gonna be able to\nperform an in place upgrade, right?\n\n49\n00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.830\nSo these are just a few other things,\nany kind of disk partitioning or\n\n50\n00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.790\ndisk encryption from\na third party hardware,\n\n51\n00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.890\nI should say directly affect\nthis decision for you.\n\n52\n00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.890\nSo kind of once you look at all\nof your hardware requirements and\n\n53\n00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.900\nyou decide, okay, I've passed this hurdle.\n\n54\n00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.790\nIt's moving on to this next section here\nfor your operating system considerations.\n\n55\n00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.300\nSo we look at things like our\noperating system architecture.\n\n56\n00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.240\nSo if we're talking x86 or\n32 bit and trying to transition into\n\n57\n00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.450\nthat 64 bit that x64,\nwe don't have that support either.\n\n58\n00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.200\nSo these are kind of like,\nit's not a gray area.\n\n59\n00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.880\nIt's either black or\nwhite here, we can't continue.\n\n60\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.536\nSo that's why they go in this order,\n\n61\n00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:19.176\nright?\n&gt;&gt; It's also a good point this is why we\n\n62\n00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:22.885\nwanna find this stuff out before we\nactually start that upgrade process.\n\n63\n00:03:22.885 --> 00:03:23.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n\n64\n00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.470\n&gt;&gt; This is why the planning is so\n\n65\n00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.387\nimportant and\n\n66\n00:03:26.387 --> 00:03:31.300\nwhy we need to use tools that Microsoft\ngives us to analyze what we have.\n\n67\n00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.181\nBecause I don't wanna get in\nthe middle of upgrading 500 devices and\n\n68\n00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:37.199\nrealize that they're all 32 bit.\n\n69\n00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.660\nI'm trying to push out a 64 bit image and\nthings go wrong.\n\n70\n00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.690\nOr half of my devices were\nstill bios based and not UEFI,\n\n71\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.050\nand they've all failed.\n\n72\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.860\nAnd now I've gotta figure out what to do.\n\n73\n00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.120\nWhy this planning phase\nis extremely important.\n\n74\n00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.550\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it could become costly.\n\n75\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.373\nI mean if you already start and\nroll out a project and then realize you've\n\n76\n00:03:56.373 --> 00:04:00.037\nmade a mistake, you know [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Could be one of those RGEs,\n\n77\n00:04:00.037 --> 00:04:00.953\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n78\n00:04:00.953 --> 00:04:01.896\nresume maybe.\n&gt;&gt; Resume-\n\n79\n00:04:01.896 --> 00:04:03.724\n&gt;&gt; Resume generating event.\n\n80\n00:04:03.724 --> 00:04:04.454\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't want\n\n81\n00:04:04.454 --> 00:04:05.055\none of those.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n82\n00:04:05.055 --> 00:04:05.599\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n83\n00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.099\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n84\n00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.887\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n85\n00:04:06.887 --> 00:04:07.873\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what else do we got to\n\n86\n00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:10.906\nconsider?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, other things like base operating\n\n87\n00:04:10.906 --> 00:04:15.783\nsystem languages.\nSo currently, let's say I can't translate\n\n88\n00:04:15.783 --> 00:04:19.003\nfrom French to English.\nI would need to go ahead and\n\n89\n00:04:19.003 --> 00:04:21.770\nperform a clean installation there.\n\n90\n00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.680\nAlso, future considerations\nwithin that operating system.\n\n91\n00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.890\nAnd you know this is kind of ironic Mike,\nyou and I were just talking about this and\n\n92\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.900\nwe were gonna kinda circle back later.\n\n93\n00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.920\nBut why not mention it now here for\n\n94\n00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.880\nour domain joined versus\nutilizing local administrations.\n\n95\n00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.330\nSo hey, if I need to go ahead and\nhave a domain joined\n\n96\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.100\noperating system then Windows 10\nHome Edition is not gonna work for me.\n\n97\n00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.685\nSo I really need to look at\nthese types of things here.\n\n98\n00:04:47.685 --> 00:04:49.827\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially with today's\n\n99\n00:04:49.827 --> 00:04:52.427\nenterprises and we're trying to BYOD or\n\n100\n00:04:52.427 --> 00:04:57.787\nlet their users bring in their own devices\nthey bought that PC from Big Box company.\n\n101\n00:04:57.787 --> 00:05:01.769\nAnd it came with Windows 10 Home and now\nwe got to try to figure how to manage it\n\n102\n00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:04.490\nor do we upgrade,\ncuz I can't join it to the domain.\n\n103\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.711\nSo again, good planning and understanding\nthose different skews can help us in this\n\n104\n00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:10.090\nplanning phase.\n&gt;&gt; For sure,\n\n105\n00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.070\nand you guys can take a look at\nthese here and check them out.\n\n106\n00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.660\nI mean this is not a comprehensive list.\n\n107\n00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.980\nThis is just a good idea\nto get those questions,\n\n108\n00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.020\nto get you thinking in that way, but\nI mean this one's pretty severe here.\n\n109\n00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.020\nIf you're trying to move from XP or\nVista that's not gonna happen either so.\n\n110\n00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.739\nYeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Windows 7 is gonna be our earliest\n\n111\n00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:31.497\ntier to go ahead and\nperform that in place upgrade.\n\n112\n00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:32.408\nAnd then lastly,\n\n113\n00:05:32.408 --> 00:05:36.700\na consideration that they want to point\nout is any kind of device considerations.\n\n114\n00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.730\nSo here I have bulk application changes.\n\n115\n00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.270\nSo what that means is almost, hey,\nis it going to be worth my time and\n\n116\n00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.360\neffort to go ahead and update or\n\n117\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.960\nmake changes to applications to fit\ninto this new operating system.\n\n118\n00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.050\nOr should I just perform\na clean installation?\n\n119\n00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.900\nSo that's going to be,\nit's kind of like looking at time and\n\n120\n00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.580\njust weighing out the pros and cons there.\n\n121\n00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.250\nAnd if I've made it through\nall those checkpoints,\n\n122\n00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.630\nthen that's when I can say hey look,\nan in place upgrade is perfect for us.\n\n123\n00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.560\nLet's go ahead and\n\n124\n00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.140\nstart that planning of how were\ngoing to deploy the actual upgrade.\n\n125\n00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.420\nSo, let's take a look at that.\n\n126\n00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.635\nSo, The first one that I would\nlike to go back to is Wipe &amp; Load,\n\n127\n00:06:19.635 --> 00:06:21.910\njust because this is where we started.\n\n128\n00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.310\nAnd I told you I would go into depth for\neach one of these.\n\n129\n00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.460\nSo, Wipe &amp; Load is going to be minimal\nchanges to the existing processes.\n\n130\n00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.050\nIf you have a scheduled\nmaintenance window, this is great,\n\n131\n00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:41.040\nbecause you don't have to interfere with\nthe end users time or anything like that.\n\n132\n00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.380\nNow, granted there may be a tweaking\nperiod where they don't have everything\n\n133\n00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.520\njust perfect and\nyou'd have to go maybe and check on that.\n\n134\n00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.320\nBut aside from that, you can look\nat a lot of that ahead of time and\n\n135\n00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.240\nget everything kind of planned out.\n\n136\n00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.320\nAgain, this is something that\nwe've been using for a long time.\n\n137\n00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.036\nIt is familiar with enterprises and\nit comes with out of the box support for\n\n138\n00:07:03.036 --> 00:07:05.025\nWindows 7, 8, and 8.1.\n\n139\n00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:08.406\nNow, I would like to kind of\ngo through these steps here,\n\n140\n00:07:08.406 --> 00:07:12.999\nbecause this is where I said look,\nif you're not familiar with these tools.\n\n141\n00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.920\nHere's your opportunity to get familiar,\n\n142\n00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.528\nbecause you are gonna see\nthese tools in the future.\n\n143\n00:07:18.528 --> 00:07:21.850\nSo knowing where,\n\n144\n00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.660\nhow I should be using these tools like\nhere for the User State Migration Tool,\n\n145\n00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.840\nbut we'll look at this more in depth,\nwe're just getting started, right?\n\n146\n00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.480\nBut understanding the processes that\nwe have to go through is going to be\n\n147\n00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.360\nimportant, because you might\nsee that in a sequential order\n\n148\n00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.890\ncoming up here shortly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n149\n00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.700\n&gt;&gt; So let's say here for our Wipe &amp; Load.\n\n150\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.628\nWe start with, again,\nit has to be 7, 8 or 8.1.\n\n151\n00:07:45.628 --> 00:07:48.759\nWe wanna capture those\ndata setting initially and\n\n152\n00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:52.261\nthen we could use a tool like\nUser State Migration Tool or\n\n153\n00:07:52.261 --> 00:07:56.299\nsome other options to go ahead and\npull that information for us.\n\n154\n00:07:56.299 --> 00:08:01.139\nSomething we would want to think\nabout is having available storage to\n\n155\n00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:05.568\nhold this information during\nthe migration process, right?\n\n156\n00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:10.293\nRemove the existing operating system next\nstudents install the new operating system\n\n157\n00:08:10.293 --> 00:08:14.754\nperhaps with the tool like DISM even\nallowing for those offline installations,\n\n158\n00:08:14.754 --> 00:08:16.279\nthings like that, right?\n\n159\n00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:22.278\nLarger companies might be utilizing\na more comprehensive deployment option,\n\n160\n00:08:22.278 --> 00:08:25.508\nand we'll talk about those later as well.\n\n161\n00:08:25.508 --> 00:08:29.439\nThen you'd wanna go ahead and\ninstall any kind of applications,\n\n162\n00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:33.740\nfollowed with backing up or\nrestoring our data and user settings here.\n\n163\n00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.532\nAgain with that user state migration tool,\n\n164\n00:08:36.532 --> 00:08:40.983\njust as an example to help you walk\nthrough this thought process to land\n\n165\n00:08:40.983 --> 00:08:44.843\nyou over here with your fresh\nclean install of Windows 10.\n\n166\n00:08:44.843 --> 00:08:48.653\nSo that's the wipe and load option, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and as you were saying there,\n\n167\n00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:52.401\nyou gotta make sure you understand those\nsteps and the order that they go in.\n\n168\n00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:56.624\nThey do like to ask you those drag and\ndrag these steps into the proper order on\n\n169\n00:08:56.624 --> 00:08:59.332\nthose exams so\nmake sure you get those down path.\n\n170\n00:08:59.332 --> 00:09:02.695\nThe one I always thought throws people\noff is your got install apps and\n\n171\n00:09:02.695 --> 00:09:05.249\nthen restore data and\nsometimes people think well,\n\n172\n00:09:05.249 --> 00:09:08.051\nshouldn't I restore the data and\nthen install the apps?\n\n173\n00:09:08.051 --> 00:09:12.485\nAnd keep in mind that in that data that\nyou've exported from that first step,\n\n174\n00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:15.703\ncapture data and settings,\nyou're using maybe USMT.\n\n175\n00:09:15.703 --> 00:09:19.194\nThere's application settings in there,\nlike Office settings.\n\n176\n00:09:19.194 --> 00:09:22.414\nWhat's your default font for Word.\n&gt;&gt; Good point Mike, yep.\n\n177\n00:09:22.414 --> 00:09:23.927\n&gt;&gt; How many spreadsheets by default in\n\n178\n00:09:23.927 --> 00:09:25.700\nthe Excel workbooks, things like that.\n\n179\n00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.374\nWell if I've captured those settings and\nI go to restore those settings,\n\n180\n00:09:29.374 --> 00:09:31.481\nif Excel isn't installed yet,\n&gt;&gt; I don't get those.\n\n181\n00:09:31.481 --> 00:09:32.352\n&gt;&gt; There's nowhere to put\n\n182\n00:09:32.352 --> 00:09:33.316\nthose settings, right?\n\n183\n00:09:33.316 --> 00:09:34.881\nThere's no registry entries for Excel.\n\n184\n00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:37.572\nSo you've gotta make sure\nthose apps are installed and\n\n185\n00:09:37.572 --> 00:09:40.392\nthen you can restore all that\nuser data and those things.\n\n186\n00:09:40.392 --> 00:09:43.588\nSo just make sure you get the order\nof those steps when preparing for\n\n187\n00:09:43.588 --> 00:09:45.895\nthe exam and for the real world.\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n188\n00:09:45.895 --> 00:09:48.758\nAll right, so\nmoving over to Microsoft's favorite,\n\n189\n00:09:48.758 --> 00:09:50.757\nhere we have our in-place upgrades.\n\n190\n00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:55.436\nSo here we can see, again automatically\npreserving existing apps,\n\n191\n00:09:55.436 --> 00:09:58.995\nsettings and drivers and\nthat is in a perfect world.\n\n192\n00:09:58.995 --> 00:10:02.288\nAgain, you always wanna perform\nany kind of like backup ahead of\n\n193\n00:10:02.288 --> 00:10:03.698\ntime which they have here.\n\n194\n00:10:03.698 --> 00:10:06.212\nOur first step, capture data and settings.\n\n195\n00:10:06.212 --> 00:10:10.451\nAnd you can use the integrated\nWindows setup utility to go ahead and\n\n196\n00:10:10.451 --> 00:10:15.144\nwalk through this process, as long as\nthe upgrade path is supported, and\n\n197\n00:10:15.144 --> 00:10:19.863\nwe will spend some more time looking\nat those upgrade paths in the future.\n\n198\n00:10:19.863 --> 00:10:21.886\nI'm trying to see,\nwhat else do we have here?\n\n199\n00:10:21.886 --> 00:10:26.586\nInstalled are retained but\nthey may need updating to go ahead and\n\n200\n00:10:26.586 --> 00:10:29.036\nperform correctly afterwards.\n\n201\n00:10:29.036 --> 00:10:33.439\nOr, again, in the previous show I\nmentioned different tools available to us,\n\n202\n00:10:33.439 --> 00:10:37.645\nfor us to check ahead of time to make\nsure that those applications are gonna be\n\n203\n00:10:37.645 --> 00:10:41.422\nfunctioning as an end result,\nbecause that is not always the case.\n\n204\n00:10:41.422 --> 00:10:46.640\nSo you need to be mentally and\nemotionally prepared to handle that.\n\n205\n00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.061\n[LAUGH] You also get a roll back option so\nthat is kinda cool too because if you're\n\n206\n00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:55.617\nnot, mentally and emotionally prepared\nthen at least you have something to fall\n\n207\n00:10:55.617 --> 00:10:57.223\nback on, right?\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully.\n\n208\n00:10:57.223 --> 00:10:57.823\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully.\n\n209\n00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:04.749\n[LAUGH] User &amp; app settings and data files\nare going to be retained, hopefully.\n\n210\n00:11:04.749 --> 00:11:08.514\nAnd no external storage space is\nneeded like we just saw when we were\n\n211\n00:11:08.514 --> 00:11:12.617\ntalking about that wipe and load to\nretain and hold the user data files and\n\n212\n00:11:12.617 --> 00:11:14.451\nsettings during that process.\n\n213\n00:11:14.451 --> 00:11:16.726\nAnd it doesn't allow for\naddition changes and\n\n214\n00:11:16.726 --> 00:11:18.838\nit has limited operating system support.\n\n215\n00:11:18.838 --> 00:11:20.995\nSo we will talk a little\nbit more about this.\n\n216\n00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:23.158\nBut just like Mike was emphasizing,\n\n217\n00:11:23.158 --> 00:11:27.497\nknowing the sequence of these steps\nhere is going to be pretty important.\n\n218\n00:11:27.497 --> 00:11:30.045\nWe don't have as many in\nthis particular layout here.\n\n219\n00:11:30.045 --> 00:11:32.868\nWe've got to capture the data and\nsettings,\n\n220\n00:11:32.868 --> 00:11:37.102\nremove that existing OS, install\nthe new image and then go ahead and\n\n221\n00:11:37.102 --> 00:11:40.313\nperform that restore to\nget us to our Windows 10.\n\n222\n00:11:40.313 --> 00:11:47.002\nAll right, now, this provisioning we'll\nbe looking at this more in depth as well.\n\n223\n00:11:47.002 --> 00:11:49.690\nAnd remember,\nthis is provisioning not reimaging.\n\n224\n00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.279\nWe're going to be,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for here?\n\n225\n00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:56.292\nWe're gonna be transforming, okay?\n\n226\n00:11:56.292 --> 00:11:59.597\nThat particular device, so\nthat's what we're talking about here.\n\n227\n00:11:59.597 --> 00:12:03.302\nWe can use media, USB tethering or\neven email to go ahead and\n\n228\n00:12:03.302 --> 00:12:07.400\njust distribute those packages,\nthose files to these devices.\n\n229\n00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.028\nAnd I think that's gonna be\na big thing to think about is,\n\n230\n00:12:11.028 --> 00:12:14.523\nhow am I going to get these\npackages out to my end users?\n\n231\n00:12:14.523 --> 00:12:17.807\nIt can be triggered either from the cloud\nor a corporate network connection.\n\n232\n00:12:17.807 --> 00:12:20.985\nSo of course,\nwe see the cloud in everything here.\n\n233\n00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:23.746\nWe're not talking just about\non premise deployments.\n\n234\n00:12:23.746 --> 00:12:27.338\nWe can leverage Azure and\nbring that in as well.\n\n235\n00:12:27.338 --> 00:12:31.258\nAlso, you can leverage NFC or\nQR codes for easy deployment option here.\n\n236\n00:12:31.258 --> 00:12:34.355\nMake it super easy for those end users.\n\n237\n00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:38.741\nAs well as enabling that Enterprise SKU,\nlike we spoke about before, and\n\n238\n00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:42.017\ninstalling your apps in\nEnterprise configurations.\n\n239\n00:12:42.017 --> 00:12:46.198\nNow, remember, we said this is\nnot going to be a replacement for\n\n240\n00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:48.763\nany kind of mobile device management.\n\n241\n00:12:48.763 --> 00:12:52.197\nThat's something that you want\nto add on and keep that in mind.\n\n242\n00:12:52.197 --> 00:12:56.300\nIt's super important here, so we're not\ntalking about continued management or\n\n243\n00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.761\nmonitoring, we're just talking\nabout the initial provisioning.\n\n244\n00:12:59.761 --> 00:13:02.283\nSo just kinda keeping that in mind.\n\n245\n00:13:02.283 --> 00:13:04.101\nSo you're gonna remove existing items.\n\n246\n00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:06.783\nYou're gonna start with\nthe Windows 10 operating system.\n\n247\n00:13:06.783 --> 00:13:11.191\nSo any kind of, I don't know,\ngames or Facebook applications or\n\n248\n00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:14.575\nwhatever is not essential\nto your organization.\n\n249\n00:13:14.575 --> 00:13:17.111\nSo go ahead and remove those items.\n\n250\n00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:20.598\nAnd then you're gonna enable\nthat enterprise use so\n\n251\n00:13:20.598 --> 00:13:23.379\nthat it is related to that organization.\n\n252\n00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:26.706\nAnd then you can add your\ncorporate applications and\n\n253\n00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:32.088\ncorporate configurations to make that\ndevice compatible with your organization.\n\n254\n00:13:32.088 --> 00:13:34.290\nThere are also a couple of tools here.\n\n255\n00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:39.254\nWe will talk about these\nmore in the future.\n\n256\n00:13:39.254 --> 00:13:43.851\nNow this one's kinda funny, let me kind\nof zoom in so you guys can see this.\n\n257\n00:13:43.851 --> 00:13:48.166\nWhat was that, Ctrl+Shift+?\n\n258\n00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:49.807\nAll right,\nmaybe we wanna be in presentation mode.\n\n259\n00:13:49.807 --> 00:13:51.537\nI don't know if you can see that.\n\n260\n00:13:51.537 --> 00:13:54.553\nWe will look at it more and\nI will also, there, thanks Taylor.\n\n261\n00:13:54.553 --> 00:14:00.753\nSo WICD or I've heard in Boston they\ncall it the wicked provisioning tool.\n\n262\n00:14:00.753 --> 00:14:01.352\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n263\n00:14:01.352 --> 00:14:01.897\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n264\n00:14:01.897 --> 00:14:04.609\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a chuckle.\n\n265\n00:14:04.609 --> 00:14:05.204\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n266\n00:14:05.204 --> 00:14:08.859\nthis is going to be one way we\ncan get that information out.\n\n267\n00:14:08.859 --> 00:14:12.508\nAnd I think that's .PPKG files.\n\n268\n00:14:12.508 --> 00:14:15.835\nBut we will spend some\ntime looking at those.\n\n269\n00:14:15.835 --> 00:14:17.817\nThere are slight differences there.\n\n270\n00:14:17.817 --> 00:14:21.197\nKnowing that,\na lot of these tools do work together.\n\n271\n00:14:21.197 --> 00:14:23.105\nFor instance, we also have another option.\n\n272\n00:14:23.105 --> 00:14:28.151\nOur Windows System Image Manager\nis going to be part of, or\n\n273\n00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:34.029\ncan work with our MDT, so\nour Microsoft Deployments Tools as well.\n\n274\n00:14:34.029 --> 00:14:38.582\nSo just knowing that and the answer files\nand we'll take some time to really look at\n\n275\n00:14:38.582 --> 00:14:41.620\nthose ways that we can provision and\nconfigure those.\n\n276\n00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:46.579\nBecause it's not just good enough\nat this point to know them, but\n\n277\n00:14:46.579 --> 00:14:50.725\nwe may see situations where\nwe're asked to go ahead and\n\n278\n00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:56.066\nset those up there, so we're gonna\nneed to spend some time with that.\n\n279\n00:14:56.066 --> 00:15:01.034\nAnd then of course, if all else fails and\nyou know I've done my homework I still\n\n280\n00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:05.779\ncan't decide, Microsoft actually took\nit upon themselves to go ahead and\n\n281\n00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:10.068\ncreate, let me find the link here,\na little site to kind of guide and\n\n282\n00:15:10.068 --> 00:15:12.445\nnavigate you through this process.\n\n283\n00:15:12.445 --> 00:15:17.121\nSo again this link is in the show notes\nas well, and it's a way that Microsoft\n\n284\n00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:20.866\ncan help you choose which version\nof Windows is best for you.\n\n285\n00:15:20.866 --> 00:15:23.192\nAnd it's kinda fun here.\n\n286\n00:15:23.192 --> 00:15:28.882\nIt's more, in my opinion,\nof a marketing type tool,\n\n287\n00:15:28.882 --> 00:15:32.978\nbut just knowing that it is available.\n\n288\n00:15:32.978 --> 00:15:37.159\nAm I looking for a new Windows 10 PC,\nor I'm looking for the operating system,\n\n289\n00:15:37.159 --> 00:15:41.610\nam I looking for updates or just different\ntypes of features that I wanna understand.\n\n290\n00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.393\nSo if we just select one of these and\n\n291\n00:15:44.393 --> 00:15:49.289\nthen we have additional click\nthrough type functionalities\n\n292\n00:15:49.289 --> 00:15:54.015\njust to kind of I guess take us shopping.\n&gt;&gt; That's where the ultimate,\n\n293\n00:15:54.015 --> 00:15:56.632\nmaybe we wanna buy a gaming console today.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we do.\n\n294\n00:15:56.632 --> 00:15:57.535\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's do that.\n\n295\n00:15:57.535 --> 00:16:00.122\nAre you looking,\ndid we want something to go?\n\n296\n00:16:00.122 --> 00:16:01.912\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I got LAN parties all over the,\n\n297\n00:16:01.912 --> 00:16:02.551\nOkay, sure.\n\n298\n00:16:02.551 --> 00:16:06.404\nAll right, so now we can see our\nresults and see what we have here.\n\n299\n00:16:06.404 --> 00:16:11.066\nAnd for the low, low price of $1,500,\nMike, you can have your LAN\n\n300\n00:16:11.066 --> 00:16:15.360\nparty with that fancy Alienware laptop.\n&gt;&gt; Crazy, I actually have an Alienware.\n\n301\n00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.933\nNot quite that new, but\nso see the wizard worked.\n\n302\n00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:18.863\nIt new exactly what I wanted.\n\n303\n00:16:18.863 --> 00:16:21.154\n[LAUGH] That's pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:16:21.154 --> 00:16:22.307\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, anyway.\n\n305\n00:16:22.307 --> 00:16:25.555\nSo that's, all joking aside though,\nthat is an option for you but\n\n306\n00:16:25.555 --> 00:16:28.455\nyou're definitely going to need\nto do your own homework and\n\n307\n00:16:28.455 --> 00:16:31.655\nresearch whenever you're deploying\nthis for an organization.\n\n308\n00:16:31.655 --> 00:16:34.014\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that might be good for a very,\n\n309\n00:16:34.014 --> 00:16:38.156\nvery small two to five person shop or\nthe home user or something like that.\n\n310\n00:16:38.156 --> 00:16:38.684\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n311\n00:16:38.684 --> 00:16:40.420\n&gt;&gt; Definitely not enterprise level\n\n312\n00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.699\npreparedness that we've got other tools\nthat Cherokee is gonna walk us through.\n\n313\n00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:47.834\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually I like how you said that\n\n314\n00:16:47.834 --> 00:16:52.584\nhome user because another\nideology that Microsoft has is,\n\n315\n00:16:52.584 --> 00:16:56.010\nand let me think of\nthe best way to say this.\n\n316\n00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:01.676\nIn the past it's been more of when you're\non a device you're either creating or\n\n317\n00:17:01.676 --> 00:17:02.615\nconsuming.\n\n318\n00:17:02.615 --> 00:17:07.851\nAnd I feel like with Windows 10,\nthey're trying to merge those two.\n\n319\n00:17:07.851 --> 00:17:09.822\nSo if you think about it, Mike,\n\n320\n00:17:09.822 --> 00:17:13.399\nusually on laptops we're\nsitting here creating emails or\n\n321\n00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:18.378\ncreating spreadsheets, and it might easier\nfor us to read an email on our phone.\n\n322\n00:17:18.378 --> 00:17:23.214\nSo that's the consuming side whereas on\nour laptops were created on workstations,\n\n323\n00:17:23.214 --> 00:17:25.065\ndesktops, whatever, right?\n\n324\n00:17:25.065 --> 00:17:29.499\nSo what we see here with Windows 10 is\nmore than merge when you see things\n\n325\n00:17:29.499 --> 00:17:33.941\nlike continuum for the phones, so\nfor those mobile operating systems.\n\n326\n00:17:33.941 --> 00:17:38.756\nI If I had a Windows 10 capable phone-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n327\n00:17:38.756 --> 00:17:40.310\n&gt;&gt; I could take that phone,\n\n328\n00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:44.761\ncast it to a monitor, like the monitor\nyou might be watching right now.\n\n329\n00:17:44.761 --> 00:17:48.885\nAnd as long as that monitor had HDMI\ncapabilities to support that wireless\n\n330\n00:17:48.885 --> 00:17:53.351\ndongle, because there are accessories\nthat you would need to get to go with it.\n\n331\n00:17:53.351 --> 00:17:57.578\nAnd make sure that your phone had\nthe hardware to support it as well.\n\n332\n00:17:57.578 --> 00:18:02.053\nBut you could use your phone as a computer\nor to provide any kind of presentation.\n\n333\n00:18:02.053 --> 00:18:05.601\nSo that would be, it's kind of\na game changer in the sense that for\n\n334\n00:18:05.601 --> 00:18:07.222\nreally having portability.\n\n335\n00:18:07.222 --> 00:18:10.495\nAnd just think about that, if you were\na salesperson, you traveled a lot.\n\n336\n00:18:10.495 --> 00:18:15.149\nSo that's another thing I want you guys\nto think about here as we continue on our\n\n337\n00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:16.567\nWindows 10 journey.\n\n338\n00:18:16.567 --> 00:18:20.251\nAnd the last thing I wanna take a look\nat here in this show is going to be,\n\n339\n00:18:20.251 --> 00:18:24.121\nall right, so maybe I've decided I\nwanna have a particular edition, but\n\n340\n00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:25.570\nI don't know how to get it.\n\n341\n00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:26.756\nI don't know where to begin.\n\n342\n00:18:26.756 --> 00:18:28.684\nSo let's take a look at my screen.\n\n343\n00:18:28.684 --> 00:18:32.223\nHere I have a Windows 10 download option,\nand\n\n344\n00:18:32.223 --> 00:18:38.343\nit gives some information about how to\ncreate a Windows 10 installation media.\n\n345\n00:18:38.343 --> 00:18:44.170\nNow there are other ways to go ahead and\ndo this than what's outlined right here.\n\n346\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:48.261\nAnd like Mike was saying from a consumer\nside or from an enterprise side,\n\n347\n00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:52.691\nyou're not always going to have those\nenterprise options unless you have that\n\n348\n00:18:52.691 --> 00:18:55.264\ninfrastructure already set up and\nbuilt up.\n\n349\n00:18:55.264 --> 00:18:56.391\nBut at minimum,\n\n350\n00:18:56.391 --> 00:19:01.390\nwe'll take a look at what we can do\njust from the basic consumer side here.\n\n351\n00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.358\nAnd, of course,\nyou can run this in an enterprise as well.\n\n352\n00:19:04.358 --> 00:19:08.950\nBut like we were kind of joking about\nbefore, having a USB drive in your pocket\n\n353\n00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:13.703\nand running around to other computers is\nnot the most efficient way of working.\n\n354\n00:19:13.703 --> 00:19:18.605\nSo we wanna think about not only how\nthe operating systems can be efficient for\n\n355\n00:19:18.605 --> 00:19:21.485\nus, but\nhow we can work efficiently as well.\n\n356\n00:19:21.485 --> 00:19:27.171\nSo we can go ahead and download our\nWindows 10 installation media tool.\n\n357\n00:19:27.171 --> 00:19:30.737\nI might have that up on\nour virtual machine here.\n\n358\n00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:31.797\nGive me one second.\n\n359\n00:19:31.797 --> 00:19:32.538\nI think I do.\n\n360\n00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.782\nLook in my folder here.\n\n361\n00:19:37.782 --> 00:19:40.500\nThat link is to the download.\n\n362\n00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.420\nIt's really a small file so\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n363\n00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.002\nOkay, so let's go ahead and\nlaunch that media creation tool.\n\n364\n00:19:48.002 --> 00:19:50.429\nI'll hit Yes.\n\n365\n00:19:50.429 --> 00:19:52.041\nAnd this will just guide us and\n\n366\n00:19:52.041 --> 00:19:55.470\nwalk through that process to\ncreate that installation media.\n\n367\n00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.969\nSo any kind of removable media, USB drives\nare great cuz they're small, they're\n\n368\n00:19:59.969 --> 00:20:04.355\nportable, if you're looking at that\nsmaller individual deployment options.\n\n369\n00:20:04.355 --> 00:20:08.323\nDo you have DVDs anymore, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; I needed one the other day and\n\n370\n00:20:08.323 --> 00:20:09.860\nI couldn't find a computer.\n\n371\n00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.773\nI had to break out the old alienware\nas a matter of fact and find\n\n372\n00:20:12.773 --> 00:20:14.953\nthe power supply so I could plug it in.\n&gt;&gt; Well-\n\n373\n00:20:14.953 --> 00:20:16.496\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not too many DVDs anymore.\n\n374\n00:20:16.496 --> 00:20:18.202\n&gt;&gt; You do have that option so\n\n375\n00:20:18.202 --> 00:20:19.346\njust know that.\n\n376\n00:20:19.346 --> 00:20:22.664\nWe're gonna go ahead and\naccept our EULA here.\n\n377\n00:20:22.664 --> 00:20:24.531\nIt's just getting a few things ready.\n\n378\n00:20:24.531 --> 00:20:28.341\nIt's pretty straightforward just\nwalking you through this process.\n\n379\n00:20:28.341 --> 00:20:32.672\nBut you do need to just think about how\nyou're gonna get that information or\n\n380\n00:20:32.672 --> 00:20:37.554\nhow you're gonna get that operating system\nto your individual users or customers,\n\n381\n00:20:37.554 --> 00:20:39.638\nyour friends, family, whoever.\n\n382\n00:20:39.638 --> 00:20:41.321\nSo it says, hey, what do you want to do?\n\n383\n00:20:41.321 --> 00:20:44.634\nUpgrade this PC or\ncreate installation media?\n\n384\n00:20:44.634 --> 00:20:49.579\nAll right, so we can create it from\na USB flash drive, DVD or ISO file for\n\n385\n00:20:49.579 --> 00:20:50.494\nanother PC.\n\n386\n00:20:50.494 --> 00:20:52.789\nSo that's what we can select here.\n\n387\n00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:57.717\nAnd just kind of walking through that,\nnow you will be asked things\n\n388\n00:20:57.717 --> 00:21:02.211\nlike what language, what edition,\nand the architecture.\n\n389\n00:21:02.211 --> 00:21:05.929\nSo just keep that in mind, and\nthen you can just go through and hit Next.\n\n390\n00:21:05.929 --> 00:21:07.108\nIt's just behind my head.\n\n391\n00:21:07.108 --> 00:21:08.539\nWe don't need to see that though.\n\n392\n00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:11.861\nAnd then it'll ask you what kind of media.\n\n393\n00:21:11.861 --> 00:21:12.978\nThis is a good point.\n\n394\n00:21:12.978 --> 00:21:16.657\nLooking at the size of that\noperating system here, so\n\n395\n00:21:16.657 --> 00:21:21.396\njust reminding you, you need to have\nat least 8 GB here to go ahead and\n\n396\n00:21:21.396 --> 00:21:24.537\nget that installation media ready for\nthat.\n\n397\n00:21:24.537 --> 00:21:29.100\nAnd here, Mike's favorite for that DVD.\n\n398\n00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.836\nSo it will create the ISO, but we-\n&gt;&gt; I do like the ISO.\n\n399\n00:21:31.836 --> 00:21:33.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do too because you\n\n400\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:33.733\ncan put that.\n\n401\n00:21:33.733 --> 00:21:37.589\nWe're joking around but you can put it on\nyour network or you can use that ISO for\n\n402\n00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:39.235\na lot of different things there.\n\n403\n00:21:39.235 --> 00:21:41.603\nSo just, let's see.\n\n404\n00:21:41.603 --> 00:21:43.878\nWe'll say, if I select.\n\n405\n00:21:43.878 --> 00:21:45.708\nOops, I am going crazy with this.\n\n406\n00:21:45.708 --> 00:21:49.572\nIf I were to select the flash drive,\nI don't have one plugged in and\n\n407\n00:21:49.572 --> 00:21:53.850\nthe operating system will know that,\nso I'm just going to say ISO file for\n\n408\n00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:57.868\nright now and it will say hey you\ndon't have a flash drive plugged in.\n\n409\n00:21:57.868 --> 00:22:00.306\nAnd then I go ahead and\nselect the location.\n\n410\n00:22:00.306 --> 00:22:02.511\nAnd it's pretty\nstraightforward process there.\n\n411\n00:22:02.511 --> 00:22:07.026\nI just wanted to show you guys how to get\nthere, and to get that process started.\n\n412\n00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:12.559\nBut I think this is a very good point for\nus to move forward.\n\n413\n00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:15.943\nAnd we'll get started in\nthe actual configuration, and\n\n414\n00:22:15.943 --> 00:22:17.785\njust kind of getting in there.\n\n415\n00:22:17.785 --> 00:22:19.699\nWell, I won't jump the gun,\n\n416\n00:22:19.699 --> 00:22:22.970\nso installation before configuration.\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n417\n00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.164\nAll right, that means we're\ngonna be installing really soon.\n\n418\n00:22:26.164 --> 00:22:29.247\nBut not yet, because we are out of\ntime for this particular episode.\n\n419\n00:22:29.247 --> 00:22:30.832\nHope you guys enjoyed watching this one.\n\n420\n00:22:30.832 --> 00:22:33.663\nSigning off for\nITProTV I've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n421\n00:22:33.663 --> 00:22:34.497\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n422\n00:22:34.497 --> 00:22:35.959\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n423\n00:22:35.959 --> 00:22:41.967\n[MUSIC]\n\n424\n00:22:41.967 --> 00:22:45.032\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro TV.\n\n",

00:00:05.050\n&gt;&gt; Coming at you live from San Francisco,\n\n4\n00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.462\nCalifornia.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:08.462 --> 00:00:12.450\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.437\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another exciting\n\n7\n00:00:14.437 --> 00:00:15.852\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.852 --> 00:00:17.140\nI'm you're host Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.178\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10, preparing for\n\n10\n00:00:21.178 --> 00:00:23.090\nthat 70-698 exam.\n\n11\n00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.710\nThis is a part three for\npreparing to install.\n\n12\n00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.680\nSo if you missed the first two,\nmake sure you go back in library and\n\n13\n00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.650\ncheck those out.\n\n14\n00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.638\nBut here to continue our thought\nprocess along is none other than\n\n15\n00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:33.586\nMs Cherokee Boose.\n\n16\n00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:35.468\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Mike, how's it going?\n\n17\n00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:35.999\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic,\n\n18\n00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.435\nexcited cuz we're getting into some more\ninstallation with Windows 10, right?\n\n19\n00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:40.440\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n20\n00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.270\nI know I can't hardly\ncontain my excitement either.\n\n21\n00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.005\nJust like you may not have been able\nto contain your excitement when you\n\n22\n00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.743\nheard a new release of the Windows\noperating system was coming about in\n\n23\n00:00:50.743 --> 00:00:51.618\nthe past.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n24\n00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:52.672\n&gt;&gt; Like let's say XP,\n\n25\n00:00:52.672 --> 00:00:56.707\nhow many years did we have that operating\nsystem running in our environment?\n\n26\n00:00:56.707 --> 00:00:57.624\n&gt;&gt; Several years.\n\n27\n00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:58.457\n&gt;&gt; Several years.\n\n28\n00:00:58.457 --> 00:00:59.660\n&gt;&gt; It was a good one.\n\n29\n00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.097\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it was stable, it worked,\n\n30\n00:01:02.097 --> 00:01:04.260\nit met our needs, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n31\n00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.910\n&gt;&gt; So whenever we would get notice that\n\n32\n00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.140\na new operating system\nwas going to be released,\n\n33\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.280\nwe'd have to start thinking about\nthings like compatibilities.\n\n34\n00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.500\nThis new operating system, if this is is\nsomething that I'm going to be pushing out\n\n35\n00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.670\nin my environment, are my users\ngoing to be compatible with it?\n\n36\n00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.590\nOr even from a home,\nlike from a personal perspective, maybe I\n\n37\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.230\nhave like a particular music player or\nsomething that I listen to all the time.\n\n38\n00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.320\nAnd back then, that was a big deal.\n\n39\n00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.320\nMaking sure that all of your\nsoftware was able to work\n\n40\n00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.600\nin conjunction with this\nnew operating system.\n\n41\n00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.150\nWith those releases though,\nyou had some time to test and pile it.\n\n42\n00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.750\nYou didn't have to worry about any\nkind of rigid or strict deadlines.\n\n43\n00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.378\nBut we have Windows as the service now,\nright?\n\n44\n00:01:49.378 --> 00:01:50.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.020\n&gt;&gt; And all of that old style,\n\n46\n00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.920\nthat old methodology for\ndeployments has gone out the window, and\n\n47\n00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.260\nwe're on this kind of\nrolling continual basis here.\n\n48\n00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.640\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\ntalk about that for a moment and\n\n49\n00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.550\nthe different types of timelines that\nwe see with Windows 10 as a service.\n\n50\n00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.020\nSo if we think about\nthe Windows insider previews.\n\n51\n00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.100\nSo if you don't know what that is,\nit's basically an opportunity for\n\n52\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.030\nyou to go ahead and sign up and\n\n53\n00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.010\nget a sneak peek at the new release,\nthe new version of the operating system.\n\n54\n00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.180\nAnd this has been around for\na long time, it's their beta testing,\n\n55\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.748\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n56\n00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:30.980\n&gt;&gt; So this is the opportunity where\n\n57\n00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.970\nthe end users can provide\nfeedback to Microsoft,\n\n58\n00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.870\nand as matter a fact,\nMicrosoft is listening all the time.\n\n59\n00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.740\nWe have a feedback hub integrated into\nthe Windows 10 operating system, and\n\n60\n00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.886\nI'll show you that as well.\n\n61\n00:02:41.886 --> 00:02:47.330\nBut at least six months are gonna\nbe devoted strictly to,\n\n62\n00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.240\nevaluating is the term that they use,\nevaluating this version\n\n63\n00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.730\nbefore it's even sent out to a pilot,\nwhich we can actually see.\n\n64\n00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.720\nSo this first section here is yellow\nduring the evaluation process.\n\n65\n00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.024\nThen you have a pilot, and that'll usually\nlast about four months to go ahead and\n\n66\n00:03:05.024 --> 00:03:06.340\ntest it.\n\n67\n00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.510\nAnd once you decide, look,\nthis pilot works well,\n\n68\n00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.920\nit fits in my environment,\nlet's go ahead and roll this out.\n\n69\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.900\nSo instead of waiting a few years before\nthe next operating system gets pushed out,\n\n70\n00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.170\nwe really only see 12 months before\nthe support for that version is starting.\n\n71\n00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.890\nYou got a 60-day grace period\nhere before the cycle continues.\n\n72\n00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.460\nSo if we look down here\ntowards the bottom and\n\n73\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.580\nstay in line with what Microsoft\nhas currently been doing,\n\n74\n00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.110\nthey have their semi-annual\nrelease here in January and July.\n\n75\n00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.700\nAnd just kind of looking\nat the overlaps there,\n\n76\n00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.330\nso you'd take a look at\ntheir release cadence, and\n\n77\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.340\nthere's normally about an 18-month window\nwhere there's some overlap, right?\n\n78\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.987\nTo kind of give us that time to prepare\nus for the new version that's coming out.\n\n79\n00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:59.124\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's definitely a change, and\n\n80\n00:03:59.124 --> 00:04:01.080\nI know people don't like changes.\n\n81\n00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.888\nAnd it's gonna be rough at first getting\nused to this new update cycle and\n\n82\n00:04:04.888 --> 00:04:08.521\nWindows as a service, but\nit's also got some really cool concepts.\n\n83\n00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:12.813\nThe fact that Microsoft is openly sharing\nwith us, I think they learned with Vista\n\n84\n00:04:12.813 --> 00:04:16.791\nthat, hey, it's a good idea to let\npeople use this as we're developing and\n\n85\n00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:20.920\nfind those bugs, kinks, things we need\nto work out, so that's pretty cool.\n\n86\n00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.167\nI think every IT department should have at\nleast somebody in the insider program so\n\n87\n00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:28.735\nthey can get those early releases and\ncheck out those new features and\n\n88\n00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:33.248\nsee if they're gonna cause any issues with\ncustom applications and things like that.\n\n89\n00:04:33.248 --> 00:04:37.308\nBut the fact that Microsoft is listening\nand allowing us to help them do that,\n\n90\n00:04:37.308 --> 00:04:39.939\nkind of beta testing if you will,\nis pretty cool.\n\n91\n00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:40.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually, Mike,\n\n92\n00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.172\nlet's go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n93\n00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:46.343\nHere on my screen, if I just go\nahead in the Cortana search bar and\n\n94\n00:04:46.343 --> 00:04:48.860\nI type in feedback hub.\n\n95\n00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.530\nYep, there you go.\n\n96\n00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.920\nFeedback hub, this is going to\nbe what Mike's talking about.\n\n97\n00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.620\nAn opportunity for you to go ahead and\nexpress your concerns, issues, errors.\n\n98\n00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.439\nAnd what's cool about our feedback hub\nis that in the context of what we're\n\n99\n00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:07.807\ngonna be looking at for\nthis particular objective,\n\n100\n00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:12.781\nhow to configure upgrade readiness,\nwe can actually, as administrators,\n\n101\n00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:16.937\nview information that was left by\nour end users in feedback hub.\n\n102\n00:05:16.937 --> 00:05:20.316\nSo Microsoft takes,\nthey take that information,\n\n103\n00:05:20.316 --> 00:05:25.895\nthey can respond to the end user, but then\nthey're also gonna share that end user's\n\n104\n00:05:25.895 --> 00:05:31.450\nerror as well as their response with\nyou in the upgrade readiness workspace.\n\n105\n00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.370\nNow, let me just talk about that for\na second.\n\n106\n00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.650\nSo, Mike, I do kind of find it odd that\nhere for Windows 10 on the client side\n\n107\n00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:45.580\noperating system, they do have configure\nupgrade readiness as an objective.\n\n108\n00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.588\nAnd if you guys are like,\nlook, I've looked all over,\n\n109\n00:05:48.588 --> 00:05:51.212\nI have no clue what upgrade readiness is,\nwell,\n\n110\n00:05:51.212 --> 00:05:53.489\nit used to be called log analytics.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n111\n00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:54.616\n&gt;&gt; So there was a branding\n\n112\n00:05:54.616 --> 00:05:56.159\nchange within Microsoft, and\n\n113\n00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.860\nthat's what the term upgrade readiness\nis now what they're calling it.\n\n114\n00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.370\nSo, when you're looking at documentation,\n\n115\n00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.226\njust don't let that\nthrow you off too much.\n\n116\n00:06:04.226 --> 00:06:08.100\nBut here with Windows 10,\nbeing a client side operating system,\n\n117\n00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.910\nsome of you never will have the urge\nto work in an IT environment.\n\n118\n00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.930\nMaybe you're taking this class for\nyour own personal use.\n\n119\n00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.290\nJust know for the exam, we do need to\nlook at this tool in this workspace\n\n120\n00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.290\nas it's more of a management tool,\nit is a management tool and\n\n121\n00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.390\nan enterprise environment.\n\n122\n00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.650\nAs a matter of fact,\nit's a type of data insight.\n\n123\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.670\nIt provides insights via data or\n\n124\n00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.600\nanalytics that are collected on your\nmachines through telemetry information.\n\n125\n00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.032\nSo Windows 10 has telemetry information\nintegrated right in the OS.\n\n126\n00:06:46.032 --> 00:06:50.914\nAnd that was one of the things that people\nkind of were talking about when Windows 10\n\n127\n00:06:50.914 --> 00:06:55.317\nfirst came out, because the operating\nsystem does catalog things like what\n\n128\n00:06:55.317 --> 00:06:59.787\nkind of applications do you use,\nwhat kind of hardware you're running, and\n\n129\n00:06:59.787 --> 00:07:01.644\nit creates those profiles, and\n\n130\n00:07:01.644 --> 00:07:06.480\nthat's really what's going to be driving\nthe ability to use upgrade readiness.\n\n131\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.591\nSo, pretty cool there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n132\n00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:10.870\nthis used to be something that\nwas challenging back in the day.\n\n133\n00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.800\nWhen we were talking about going\nfrom 2000 to XP or XP to Vista,\n\n134\n00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.370\nit was a very manual process.\n\n135\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.620\nI had to know all the different\npieces of hardware I had out there,\n\n136\n00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.370\nall the software that was being\nrun on those to determine\n\n137\n00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.970\nalmost on an individual node basis whether\nor not it was ready to be upgraded.\n\n138\n00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.110\nNow with a tool like this, I can sit back,\nlet agents do the work, and\n\n139\n00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.645\ngo look at my network and tell me, hey,\nare these machines ready to be upgraded\n\n140\n00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:37.764\nto Windows 10?\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, well,\n\n141\n00:07:37.764 --> 00:07:40.337\nthat sounds great but\nit's not all hands-off here, so\n\n142\n00:07:40.337 --> 00:07:42.217\nI will have to warn you about that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n143\n00:07:42.217 --> 00:07:44.585\n&gt;&gt; There is some actual manual work.\n\n144\n00:07:44.585 --> 00:07:47.380\nWe haven't configured the robots\nto do our jobs 100% yet but\n\n145\n00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.736\nwho knows that may be coming.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:51.336\n&gt;&gt; Actually, let's talk about that for\n\n147\n00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:53.470\na second what Mike was explaining there.\n\n148\n00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.659\nSo let me just pull up this tab.\n\n149\n00:07:55.659 --> 00:07:56.868\nAll right, if you wanna take a look here.\n\n150\n00:07:56.868 --> 00:08:01.419\nSo this is going to be the workflow\nthat Microsoft recommends\n\n151\n00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:05.320\nus take a look at using\na risk balanced approach.\n\n152\n00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.423\nTo compatibility.\n\n153\n00:08:06.423 --> 00:08:10.280\nSo let's take a look at this first line\nof this first vertical bar here, and\n\n154\n00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.540\nthis is what Mike was talking about\nwhat we had to do in the past.\n\n155\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.040\nUnfortunately, this part\nstill doesn't know this.\n\n156\n00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.460\nBut they do help us quite\na bit here with that.\n\n157\n00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.370\nSo the first thing we need to\nlook at is how to create and\n\n158\n00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.390\nmaintain an app portfolio.\n\n159\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.190\nLet's think about that for a second.\n\n160\n00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.680\nWhenever I say app, application,\nwhether it be from the Windows Store or\n\n161\n00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.750\nsome other type of software, or\n\n162\n00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.330\neven a web based application,\nthat's what we're referencing here.\n\n163\n00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.020\nSo it's important to note that when\nwe're talking about web based.\n\n164\n00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.730\nBecause for instance, well I'll wait,\nwe'll see how that goes.\n\n165\n00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:49.840\nBut that's what we're talking about here,\nand we need to create a complete list of\n\n166\n00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.750\napps and web pages used\nthroughout the organization.\n\n167\n00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.390\nLuckily, that's where\nthe telemetry help comes in.\n\n168\n00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.440\nSo we don't have to manually do that part,\nthe system.\n\n169\n00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.170\nSo upgrade readiness is going to be\nscouring our systems, and it's agentless.\n\n170\n00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.920\nSo what that means is I don't even have to\ninstall any additional software onto my\n\n171\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.440\nsystem so it's all integrated within\nthe Windows 10 operating system here.\n\n172\n00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.850\nSo upgrade readiness will do this first\npart and provide that list for me.\n\n173\n00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:23.360\nThe business and IT experts should\nbe identified as well as IT and\n\n174\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.740\nyour organization is going to work with\nthe businesses to eliminate duplicates,\n\n175\n00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.640\ndefine supported versions and so forth.\n\n176\n00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.960\nSo what your really doing is\ncoming up with a plan here.\n\n177\n00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.190\nAnd it's cool how Microsoft creates\na work flow in upgrade readiness so\n\n178\n00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.720\nwe can kind of stick to this process and\nkeep us on track there, and\n\n179\n00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.190\nwe'll take a look at that a little bit.\n\n180\n00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:49.030\nBut this is really if you just wanna spend\nsome time and take a look at these and\n\n181\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.020\ncome back and read these.\n\n182\n00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.770\nThese are the steps that we're\ngonna be going through, and\n\n183\n00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.490\nI'm gonna show you them,\nactually, in the portal, as well.\n\n184\n00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.430\nSo you need to, this is the manual part\nright here, this is where, actually, all\n\n185\n00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:05.250\nthe work is happening, during prioritize\nand identify critical applications.\n\n186\n00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.440\nSo what is a critical application, Mike?\n\n187\n00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.020\nSo it's kind of interesting\nthere is no set definition but\n\n188\n00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.722\nMicrosoft does provide these categories\nhere as I guess just categories\n\n189\n00:10:18.722 --> 00:10:24.158\nthat you can use and fill as you\nfeel necessary or your organization.\n\n190\n00:10:24.158 --> 00:10:25.192\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,\n\n191\n00:10:25.192 --> 00:10:29.381\ndifferent organizations are gonna think\nthat different applications are critical\n\n192\n00:10:29.381 --> 00:10:31.975\nto their particular business needs, right?\n\n193\n00:10:31.975 --> 00:10:34.585\nYou're a sales based business.\n\n194\n00:10:34.585 --> 00:10:37.965\nSomething that supports those sales\nfunctions is gonna be critical to what you\n\n195\n00:10:37.965 --> 00:10:40.265\ndo and\nto what your business does every day.\n\n196\n00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:42.955\nWhereas if you're not in sales, those\nsame apps aren't considered critical.\n\n197\n00:10:42.955 --> 00:10:45.890\nSo it's definitely on a per\norganization basis right?\n\n198\n00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.170\nSo you can already say,\nthis is always critical,\n\n199\n00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:49.340\nthis is not critical.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n200\n00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.380\nAnd I think that's were in a first\ncolumn is business a IT experts\n\n201\n00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:58.080\nidentified that you have like\nchampions to really take ownership of\n\n202\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.630\nthis project because what you're\ngonna need to do is say, okay, look.\n\n203\n00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:05.965\nMaybe this particular application\nis business-critical,\n\n204\n00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:10.620\nmission-critical, meaning my company will\nnot continue to function without it.\n\n205\n00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.890\nWhereas there may be\ndepartment-critical applications, so\n\n206\n00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.175\nyou you might want to have a champion or\nrepresentative from each one of those\n\n207\n00:11:17.175 --> 00:11:20.865\ndepartments to be involved in this\nprocess so they can say, look,\n\n208\n00:11:20.865 --> 00:11:25.405\nour department needs this application\nto be functional, productive.\n\n209\n00:11:25.405 --> 00:11:28.300\nBut it is not going to halt\nthe entire production of our\n\n210\n00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.420\norganization, without it.\n\n211\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.090\nSo really triaging and assessing,\nand making sure everyone is\n\n212\n00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:39.070\non board with what these categories\nmeans is going to be ideal here.\n\n213\n00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.220\nSo you're not,\neveryone's on the same page, really.\n\n214\n00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.650\nAll right, so once you do identify\nthose business critical applications,\n\n215\n00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:47.750\nyou'll need to validate them.\n\n216\n00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.130\nYou'll need to make sure that they work,\nyou'll look at things like versioning, and\n\n217\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.240\nmake sure that.\n\n218\n00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.710\nAnd here's the thing, sometimes, not all\n\n219\n00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:01.660\nsystems are gonna be able to support it,\nthat's okay, as long as you have a plan.\n\n220\n00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.900\nAnd you'll see in the actual work\nspace where we have options, like, so\n\n221\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.290\nwe can track our progress for\nthe testing portion as well, and\n\n222\n00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:15.340\nthen looking at those really important\nbusiness critical applications\n\n223\n00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.810\nwe can leverage pilots for\nbroader validation.\n\n224\n00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.580\nExcuse me, if I can even speak.\n\n225\n00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:27.028\nBecause some testing is not as rigorous\nand not as thorough as actual piloting.\n\n226\n00:12:27.028 --> 00:12:28.740\nSo piloting,\nwe're creating a lab environment.\n\n227\n00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.340\nWe're trying to simulate or recreate our\nenvironments, and then running through all\n\n228\n00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.184\nthe paces, and checking the functions\nof that application, not just,\n\n229\n00:12:37.184 --> 00:12:38.570\nhey, it's installed and\n\n230\n00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.610\nit launches up kind of thing.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's one thing for\n\n231\n00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.470\nan application to successfully launch and\n\n232\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:49.190\nrun on a nice, fresh,\nclean install of Windows 10.\n\n233\n00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.050\nIt's another thing for\nthat same application to run\n\n234\n00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.530\non a machine that has all of our\nline of business applications,\n\n235\n00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.630\ncustomizations that\nwe've done to the image.\n\n236\n00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:00.670\nDoes it still work, or does something\nin there kinda break that application?\n\n237\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.370\n&gt;&gt; Exactly Mike.\n\n238\n00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.960\nAnd especially with the release\nof that cadence there,\n\n239\n00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.620\nthose continuous updates,\nthere are slight changes.\n\n240\n00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.310\nSo that's something that it's not one and\ndone, you forget about it,\n\n241\n00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.230\nwe're good to go there.\n\n242\n00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.460\nSo that's why we have this tool.\n\n243\n00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.110\nAnd I will say this though.\n\n244\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.910\nThe first time you set upgrade readiness\nup and you're going through and\n\n245\n00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:25.000\nprioritizing and identifying all\nthose applications, the majority,\n\n246\n00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.850\nthe bulk of them will stay\nthe same from version to version.\n\n247\n00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.490\nNow, you do have the flexibility\nto reprioritize and\n\n248\n00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.160\nchange that information but really\ngetting it set up initially is gonna\n\n249\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.860\nbe where most of that work has done so\nI'm a big fan.\n\n250\n00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.100\nI know a lot of people are not.\n\n251\n00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.770\nI'm a big fan of the whole\nWindows as a service and\n\n252\n00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.690\nthe way the upgrades are going.\n\n253\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:51.290\nYou go back to, I don't know if this is\nthe time or place for this conversation,\n\n254\n00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.100\nbut you think about the way things were\ndone in the past and your developers of\n\n255\n00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.850\nthe next version of the operating system.\n&gt;&gt; We're working with an old version\n\n256\n00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.100\nof the core.\n\n257\n00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.190\nIt's a long drawn out story but this is\ngonna be a much more streamlined process.\n\n258\n00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.740\nWe're always going to be working with\nthe latest and the greatest, and\n\n259\n00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.300\nI think it's gonna make\na better product in the end.\n\n260\n00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:12.280\nIt is just something that we're gonna have\nto change our work cycles in the way we\n\n261\n00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.310\nmaintain our images and\ndeploy Windows 10 is gonna change.\n\n262\n00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.900\nBut I think it's for the better.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n263\n00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.920\nOkay, so you guys have heard about Azure,\nI'm sure.\n\n264\n00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.990\nIf not, we definitely have shows on that,\n\n265\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.410\nhundreds of hours worth of content\nthat Adam has recorded for you.\n\n266\n00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:32.440\nSo now, for\nthe objective that Microsoft calls out for\n\n267\n00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.280\nthis exam it says configure\nupgrade readiness.\n\n268\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:41.020\nSo what they leave out is that upgrade\nreadiness is part of something called OMS.\n\n269\n00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.160\nSo the operations management suite,\n\n270\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.760\nthat is utilized with the Azure fabric\nis where you can find upgrade readiness.\n\n271\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:55.090\nSo you are not required for this exam to\ngo ahead and configure and set up OMS.\n\n272\n00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:56.440\nThat part is kind of implied.\n\n273\n00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.590\nSo that's why I'm saying I\nthink it's a little strange for\n\n274\n00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.890\nthe client's side exam, but that's okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n275\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.760\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna look at it all anyways.\n\n276\n00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.550\nSo let's take a look at my screen here and\nwhat I have is,\n\n277\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:11.490\nI do have an Azure account set up here and\nI'm just looking at my dashboard.\n\n278\n00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:15.370\nWhat you will need to\nhave is a resource group.\n\n279\n00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:19.650\nSo over on the left-hand side here,\nI am going to click on the Resource Group.\n\n280\n00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.252\nYou can see that there\nare a lot already created.\n\n281\n00:15:22.252 --> 00:15:25.722\nAnd in order to create a new\nresource group here in LMS or\n\n282\n00:15:25.722 --> 00:15:28.980\nin our Azure suite,\nwe can go ahead and select Add.\n\n283\n00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.617\nNow, this part,\n\n284\n00:15:31.617 --> 00:15:36.550\nyou have to have, let me zoom in so you\nguys can see that, I think you'll be okay.\n\n285\n00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:42.320\nFor the resource group name,\nyou have to have something unique, and\n\n286\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.218\nI don't mean unique to your workstation,\nor unique to your environment,\n\n287\n00:15:47.218 --> 00:15:49.963\nI mean unique in entire Azure space here.\n\n288\n00:15:49.963 --> 00:15:54.791\nSo let's just go ahead and we'll say\n\n289\n00:15:54.791 --> 00:15:59.631\nunique name needs to be here, okay.\n\n290\n00:15:59.631 --> 00:16:01.424\nThe reason I'm not putting any spaces or\nlowercases.\n\n291\n00:16:01.424 --> 00:16:03.480\nI have noticed some issues with.\n\n292\n00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.281\nSpaces and uppercase letters here.\n\n293\n00:16:06.281 --> 00:16:10.697\nSo I'm just gonna keep it all lowercase,\nI don't know if that's really a thing or\n\n294\n00:16:10.697 --> 00:16:12.750\nnot, but I'm gonna keep it that way.\n\n295\n00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.998\nI do know that it has to\nbe unique within the space.\n\n296\n00:16:14.998 --> 00:16:18.120\nIt will let us know if it's not here.\n\n297\n00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.576\nAnd then I'm gonna keep my\nsubscription where it is,\n\n298\n00:16:20.576 --> 00:16:22.060\nthat's just how ours is set up.\n\n299\n00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.019\nYou do wanna take a look at your\nresource group location, so\n\n300\n00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:29.810\ncurrently I'm in East US, which makes\nsense, because that's where we're located.\n\n301\n00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.200\nIf you were elsewhere in the world,\nthen you would go ahead and\n\n302\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.460\nclick the resource group location\nto just make that system,\n\n303\n00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.770\nyour Azure fabric work more for\nyour speeds.\n\n304\n00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.430\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nhit Create here.\n\n305\n00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.120\nI'm gonna zoom out a little bit.\n\n306\n00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.390\nI do see a little.\n\n307\n00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.660\nAll right, green check there,\nit's hard to see.\n\n308\n00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.350\nAnd I hit Create and\n\n309\n00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:04.170\nit created rather quickly, over in the top\nright-hand corner, I was too slow.\n\n310\n00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.360\nYou saw, it said resource group created.\n\n311\n00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.150\nNow, here's the thing\nwith upgrade readiness.\n\n312\n00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:14.750\nIt's going to take 24 to 48\nhours to go ahead and populate\n\n313\n00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:20.050\ninformation within your environment,\nand scan all of those devices.\n\n314\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.940\nYou're gonna need to wait that time,\nI mean, it does really take that long.\n\n315\n00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:27.010\nSo what I've done is I've created one\nalready for us and had that set up here.\n\n316\n00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:30.634\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead and click in\non that, and that's gonna be Cherokee,\n\n317\n00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:31.821\nthat I have listed there.\n\n318\n00:17:34.027 --> 00:17:38.770\nI'm gonna zoom in a little bit, and what\nwe're gonna do, this is my OMS workspace.\n\n319\n00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.327\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nclick into cherokee1.\n\n320\n00:17:42.923 --> 00:17:45.540\nAnd we're really just getting\ninto upgrade readiness.\n\n321\n00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.970\nI'm showing you where you would\ngo to get that configured, but\n\n322\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.340\nlike I said, setting up OMS,\nthat's another show.\n\n323\n00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.802\nSo here I'm going into my OMS portal.\n\n324\n00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:00.230\nAnd we'll see a tile here for\nupgrade readiness.\n\n325\n00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.210\nJust give it a second, it's thinking.\n\n326\n00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.520\nRight here is my tile for\nupgrade readiness.\n\n327\n00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.540\nAnd it shows a quick glance some\nstatistics, but let's really dive in and\n\n328\n00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.670\nlook at everything under the hood,\nI should say.\n\n329\n00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:19.820\nAll right, I wanna zoom out to kinda\nshow you how this is laid out.\n\n330\n00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:24.550\nSo we have these vertical UI elements and\nthey're called blades.\n\n331\n00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:28.080\nSo this is one blade, and\nthen this is another blade, and\n\n332\n00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.100\nyou can drill through individual\nblades for more granular information.\n\n333\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.680\nAnd so, let's just take a look at\nwhat we see here at first glance.\n\n334\n00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:41.830\nSo over on the left-hand side,\nthis is going to be your upgrade overview.\n\n335\n00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.607\nSo I can see I have 6,000 total computers,\n\n336\n00:18:44.607 --> 00:18:48.230\n5,000 computers that have\nalready been upgraded.\n\n337\n00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.050\nSo this, obviously, is showing after\nan upgrade has already taken place, and\n\n338\n00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.640\nthis is just sample data\nthat Microsoft has provided.\n\n339\n00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.010\nBecause I don't have 5,000\ncomputers to show you guys.\n\n340\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.230\nAnd this is where you would\nlook at important things like,\n\n341\n00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.640\nwhat's my target version?\n\n342\n00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.720\nAnd let me zoom in a little bit so\nyou can see that.\n\n343\n00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.360\nSo here I'm trying to upgrade\nto Windows 10 version 1709.\n\n344\n00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.630\nAnd of course you can change that\ndepending on whatever version you're\n\n345\n00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.070\nlooking to test for.\n\n346\n00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.770\nAnd it has all sorts of information\nsuch as your computers,\n\n347\n00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.890\nthe computers upgraded, and\nwe'll drill through all of that.\n\n348\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.675\nAs an additional element that\nMicrosoft has added right here,\n\n349\n00:19:25.675 --> 00:19:29.650\nforefront, you see the Spectre and\nMeltdown notification.\n\n350\n00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.825\nAnd here is the thing, and\nthis is my opinion here,\n\n351\n00:19:32.825 --> 00:19:38.160\nis Microsoft already has this great\ntelemetry data about your hardware,\n\n352\n00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.680\nso why not, if you're gonna\nbe using upgrade readiness.\n\n353\n00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.490\nI mean, it's a free tool if you\nsign up with an Azure free account,\n\n354\n00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:49.330\nyou set up OMS, and\nyou're just running upgrade readiness,\n\n355\n00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.860\nlet's work together to share.\n\n356\n00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.830\nSo Microsoft has this huge\ndatabase of information, right?\n\n357\n00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.564\nAnd so if they wanna share\ntheir information with you and\n\n358\n00:20:00.564 --> 00:20:04.420\nkeep these systems healthy, this is one\nway where they're trying to do that.\n\n359\n00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:09.017\nAnd so if you can go through and look at\nthe information about, because we know\n\n360\n00:20:09.017 --> 00:20:13.546\nthat Spectre and Meltdown are specifically\ngonna be targeting processor,\n\n361\n00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.900\ndifferent types of hardware, right?\n\n362\n00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:20.590\nSo, looking at the telemetry\ndata Microsoft can gather,\n\n363\n00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:25.980\nthey're gonna give you just some tips\non how to prevent that, and really\n\n364\n00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.160\nidentify any machines that are most at\nrisk and then what you can do to fix that.\n\n365\n00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.520\nSo that's kind of newer,\nthese four blades right here,\n\n366\n00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.260\nbecause of this particular\ntech that's been out.\n\n367\n00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.440\nBut it's really cool because they\nalso have an upgrade readiness blog.\n\n368\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:47.268\nAnd in their blog,\nI'm sure over time it'll be changing and\n\n369\n00:20:47.268 --> 00:20:50.480\nupdating with this tool as well.\n\n370\n00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.820\nSo, depending on what's actually\nhappening in the real world at that time.\n\n371\n00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:59.900\nNow, this is where I said they kind of\nmimic that diagram that I showed you.\n\n372\n00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.730\nSo when we were looking at the work flow,\nthis is what we see here.\n\n373\n00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.410\nAnd so let's take a look at step one here.\n\n374\n00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:11.880\nIdentify important applications, so\nMicrosoft really leaves that up to you.\n\n375\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.660\nHowever, there is a heuristic\napproach that they do take, and\n\n376\n00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.810\nit's super tiny,\nlet me see if I can zoom in.\n\n377\n00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.570\nApplications installed on 2% or\nless of your computer inventory\n\n378\n00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:28.020\nare automatically assigned\nan importance of Low install count, and\n\n379\n00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.740\nwill not be shown in Step 2\nunless they have a known issues.\n\n380\n00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:37.060\nSo, here's the thing,\nunless you specify otherwise, right?\n\n381\n00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.464\nBy looking at that 2%,\nthey can identify and\n\n382\n00:21:40.464 --> 00:21:44.320\nreally, they're called\nlong tail applications.\n\n383\n00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.100\nSo they'll just kind of remove any\nof those long tail applications\n\n384\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.550\nthat do not warrant your time and\neffort validating and\n\n385\n00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:56.140\ntesting if only maybe one person\nis using that application, right?\n\n386\n00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.056\nSo that's not mission or\nbusiness critical.\n\n387\n00:21:58.056 --> 00:22:01.568\nI mean maybe in some certain situation it\ncould be if there's Homer Simpson with his\n\n388\n00:22:01.568 --> 00:22:03.486\nbutton that he's about to push or\nwhatever.\n\n389\n00:22:03.486 --> 00:22:06.470\n[LAUGH] Usually not the case.\n\n390\n00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:11.680\nSo they do take care of that for you,\nwhich really, and let me zoom in here.\n\n391\n00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.735\nLook at the amount of work that\nthat has reduced us down to, so\n\n392\n00:22:14.735 --> 00:22:19.780\n15.5K noted as low install count.\n\n393\n00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.490\nAnd I think that that's really the trend\nthat a lot of environments have,\n\n394\n00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:27.990\nis a lot of them are long tail\napplications that will eliminate that 2%\n\n395\n00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:33.240\nso you can really focus in on\nthe remaining portion of the applications.\n\n396\n00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:38.880\nNow, there is a little button\nright here for Assign Importance.\n\n397\n00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.810\nAnd it's so tiny and\nyou kind of have to look for\n\n398\n00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:45.450\nit, but this is where the majority of\nthe work happens within this workflow.\n\n399\n00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:50.270\nSo let's go ahead and click on that and\nI'll zoom out, and we can take a look now.\n\n400\n00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.710\nLooking at the different\nviews here it might be,\n\n401\n00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.160\nI kinda wanna just move\nit a little bit around.\n\n402\n00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.360\nOkay, its already in the view that I like.\n\n403\n00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.952\nYou do have a list view, a table view,\nand I like this one here for assign\n\n404\n00:23:02.952 --> 00:23:08.890\nimportance because you can really follow\nit out, and get the information there.\n\n405\n00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:13.340\nCuz all sorts of great info,\nthe application name, the vendor.\n\n406\n00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:17.970\nSo that's important, like each one of\nthese columns will allow you to create\n\n407\n00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:21.290\nqueries to really filter out for\nparticular searches if you're trying to\n\n408\n00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.806\nwork with specific parameters there,\nwhich is nice.\n\n409\n00:23:24.806 --> 00:23:31.190\nIt really lists the application version,\nas well as the total install count.\n\n410\n00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.840\nAnd I will say this,\n\n411\n00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:38.300\nlooking at the total install count\nsometimes is a good measurement.\n\n412\n00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.460\nHowever, don't take it with\na grain of salt, basically.\n\n413\n00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.720\nWhat you really should be looking at, or\nat least I feel like you should be looking\n\n414\n00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.130\nat, is looking at this\npercent of active computers.\n\n415\n00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.195\nI can't remember the exact amount.\n\n416\n00:23:51.195 --> 00:23:54.603\nI wanna say maybe within the last month,\nbut it'll show the percentage of,\n\n417\n00:23:54.603 --> 00:23:57.586\ninstead of just having the application\ninstalled on this system,\n\n418\n00:23:57.586 --> 00:24:00.640\nhow many people are actually launching it,\nrunning it, using it.\n\n419\n00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.470\nSo that's the key there.\n\n420\n00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:08.990\nNow, Importance, Not reviewed.\n\n421\n00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:13.570\nSo Microsoft is going to have Not\nreviewed here cuz I haven't reviewed,\n\n422\n00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.820\nyou haven't reviewed it yet, and\nthen that low install count.\n\n423\n00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:22.190\nMicrosoft is not going to flag something\nas business critical, that's up to you.\n\n424\n00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.940\nSo this is where Mike was talking\nabout that work comes in,\n\n425\n00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.570\nand it is a lot of work to begin with.\n\n426\n00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:31.580\nSo that's why you might wanna go ahead and\ncreate a team to go ahead and set this up,\n\n427\n00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.276\nand you can delegate as well.\n\n428\n00:24:33.276 --> 00:24:37.481\nFrom the drop-down menu,\nwe can go ahead and\n\n429\n00:24:37.481 --> 00:24:41.032\ntriage, or classify the apps here.\n\n430\n00:24:41.032 --> 00:24:45.843\nAnd sometimes ignore, I mean that\nit is a viable option like hey,\n\n431\n00:24:45.843 --> 00:24:49.095\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nignore this for now.\n\n432\n00:24:49.095 --> 00:24:51.763\nIt's not that we are blocking it,\nit's just that it's not a big deal\n\n433\n00:24:51.763 --> 00:24:54.529\nif your music player doesn't work on\nyour work computer kind of thing.\n\n434\n00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:55.115\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n435\n00:24:55.115 --> 00:24:58.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Then you can go ahead and\n\n436\n00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.250\nset the TestPlan.\n\n437\n00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:05.630\nSo different types of tests here,\nso regression test, smoke test.\n\n438\n00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.800\nLike hey, I'm just gonna go head and\nspin it up in a VM,\n\n439\n00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.630\nsee if it works, and\ngive it that kind of test.\n\n440\n00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.970\nOr like we spoke about, let's go ahead and\ncreate an actual pilot and\n\n441\n00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:16.910\nrun it through all the paces.\n\n442\n00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.620\nAnd then you can also state the results.\n\n443\n00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.890\nSo if its pass, pending,\nfailed, inconclusive, or\n\n444\n00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.760\nwe determine that it's going\nto be a blocked application.\n\n445\n00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.650\nAnd this part is pretty cool, on\nthe application owner section right here,\n\n446\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:35.700\nI can click in and\ntype in a champion or owner.\n\n447\n00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.660\nSo maybe I give Mike, I assign him, I look\nat all the different apps that need to\n\n448\n00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.930\nbe tested, and\nI divvy them up amongst my IT department.\n\n449\n00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:50.040\nSo I can go ahead and assign Mike x amount\nof apps or whatever, so pretty cool there.\n\n450\n00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.750\nAnd then the last category here is\nif it's ready for Windows or not.\n\n451\n00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.290\nAnd of course you can drill through on\neach one of these, that's what's so\n\n452\n00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:02.380\ncool about this, it's really,\nreally granular.\n\n453\n00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.946\nBut we'll keep on looking at\nthe different steps here,\n\n454\n00:26:04.946 --> 00:26:06.646\nI know we're getting short of time.\n\n455\n00:26:06.646 --> 00:26:09.680\nI could really talk about this forever,\nthere's so much.\n\n456\n00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.876\n&gt;&gt; And it's really convenient, too.\n\n457\n00:26:10.876 --> 00:26:13.630\nI can imagine you're trying to\ndo this with pen and paper, or\n\n458\n00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:15.200\nin an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n459\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.540\nTrying to manually track all the different\napplications that are in use,\n\n460\n00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.380\nhow many people are actually\nusing this application.\n\n461\n00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.551\nThose are the kind of things\nthat this is gonna simplify for\n\n462\n00:26:23.551 --> 00:26:24.600\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; For sure,\n\n463\n00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.050\nI mean, there really is just so much\nyou could present for a business case.\n\n464\n00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:34.630\nAnd even trying to present,\nreally strengthen your,\n\n465\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.710\nnot argument, but\njust your business case for\n\n466\n00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.660\nhey, I don't have enough resources\nto test all of these applications.\n\n467\n00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.780\nOr I'm going to need x amount of time, or\n\n468\n00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.630\nhuman resources, or whatever, so\nit really helps in that way as well.\n\n469\n00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:51.420\nSo then you're gonna be able to go ahead\nand review applications with known issues,\n\n470\n00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.480\nand that's what's really\ncool about upgrading this.\n\n471\n00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.820\nI know I keep saying that,\n\n472\n00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.080\nbut there are so many cool things\nabout it because it's a huge database.\n\n473\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.530\nSo here at ITProTV, we can type\nin any kind of issues, the ISVs,\n\n474\n00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:08.460\nthe independent software vendors,\nthey can report any kind of known issues.\n\n475\n00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.460\nThey can also vouch for the app,\nand say, look, we've tested it\n\n476\n00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.880\nin this version of Windows, it's good to\ngo, contact us for support or whatever.\n\n477\n00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.140\nSo you can see all of these notes here for\nthose particular applications.\n\n478\n00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:21.880\nAs a matter of fact,\n\n479\n00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.960\nMicrosoft has an additional website,\nwe've already taken a look at it.\n\n480\n00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.793\nBut I will remind you of that,\nit's just readyforwindows.com,\n\n481\n00:27:30.793 --> 00:27:33.890\nand it may look familiar because\nwe have looked at this before.\n\n482\n00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.330\nYou go ahead and\nyou type your application in here, and\n\n483\n00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:41.450\nit tells you if the application is\neither highly adopted or adopted.\n\n484\n00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:45.760\nSo highly adopted means\nthat at least 100,000\n\n485\n00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.590\ncommercial installations\nare utilizing this application.\n\n486\n00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.405\nAdopted means 10,000 applications.\n\n487\n00:27:52.405 --> 00:27:55.010\nAnd then there are lower\ncategories as well.\n\n488\n00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:59.110\nBut just knowing that hey, look, 100,000\npeople are using this app but, Mike,\n\n489\n00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.640\nI'm sorry you're having a problem with it.\n\n490\n00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.720\nBut with the releases coming so often,\n\n491\n00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.840\nthere's no way Microsoft can test every\nsingle possible configuration and\n\n492\n00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.750\napplication marriage out there,\nif you will.\n\n493\n00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:19.600\nSo that's why we have that, we're focusing\non the most important things here.\n\n494\n00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.770\nOkay, let me just see it\nkind of gone out of here.\n\n495\n00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.860\nLet me go back to my portal,\n\n496\n00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.510\nI think I already had one instance\nlaunched up, but it's okay.\n\n497\n00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:34.052\nI think we were on step two.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n498\n00:28:37.642 --> 00:28:41.418\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, it is okay.\n\n499\n00:28:41.418 --> 00:28:43.203\nI got a little bit lost, but we're good.\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n500\n00:28:43.203 --> 00:28:45.477\n&gt;&gt; All right, scrolling, scrolling,\n\n501\n00:28:45.477 --> 00:28:47.470\nstep 2, resolving the issues.\n\n502\n00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.200\nThis is another big one here.\n\n503\n00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.150\nSo in addition to just looking at\napplications, we looked at all types of\n\n504\n00:28:55.150 --> 00:29:00.150\ndrivers in another episode, or\nwe will, and so this is part of it.\n\n505\n00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.720\nTaking advantage of having\na hardware information and\n\n506\n00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.580\nworking with the operating system.\n\n507\n00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.350\nAnd if I zoom in, you guys can see this.\n\n508\n00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:13.660\nIn the past, [LAUGH] when we had\nthose lulls between the releases,\n\n509\n00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.730\nSally from accounting would go ahead and\n\n510\n00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.500\nnot test a particular feature or function\nof the OS until, maybe it was to print.\n\n511\n00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.870\nMaybe a print driver wasn't functioning,\nand\n\n512\n00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:30.410\nshe didn't know until she tested\nthat document to be printed.\n\n513\n00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:32.590\nAnd it was 20 minutes before\nshe had to turn it in.\n\n514\n00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.510\nAnd then now Sally's\nproblem is your emergency.\n\n515\n00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:40.670\nSo what this can do for\nus as admins, allow us to\n\n516\n00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:45.070\npreemptively or just be proactive with\nany kind of driver issues that may have.\n\n517\n00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:47.095\nBecause what we are looking at\nhere with the driver issues,\n\n518\n00:29:47.095 --> 00:29:49.750\nwe're talking about the little yellow\n\n519\n00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:53.720\nexclamation points that you do see in\nyour device manager for those client OSs.\n\n520\n00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:56.170\nAll right, so what else?\n\n521\n00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:59.185\nI'm reviewing those apps.\n\n522\n00:29:59.185 --> 00:30:05.380\nNow deploying, so\nthis is going to be pretty cool here.\n\n523\n00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:10.490\nThere's actually an option where you\ncan export your upgrade readiness,\n\n524\n00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:14.470\nyour system information into\nan Excel spreadsheet format.\n\n525\n00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:16.780\nSo that you can go ahead and\nwork with System Center,\n\n526\n00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.050\ncreate that connector, and have all the\ninformation for deployment ready to go.\n\n527\n00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:23.963\nI mean,\nthat is pretty amazing if you ask me.\n\n528\n00:30:25.929 --> 00:30:28.060\nLet's see, review in progress,\nwe have some.\n\n529\n00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.300\nWe have also noted here, and\n\n530\n00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:34.200\nhere's that little tab, and\nI don't know why they did this though.\n\n531\n00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.930\nSo some of the really important\nfunctions are tiny and microscopic, so\n\n532\n00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:41.330\nhere you have that Export Computers,\nand we'll click that.\n\n533\n00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:46.004\nAnd up here on the top left-hand\ncorner you'll see that Excel icon, and\n\n534\n00:30:46.004 --> 00:30:50.309\nthat's where you can go ahead and\nexport that information there.\n\n535\n00:30:50.309 --> 00:30:51.080\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n536\n00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.534\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and just come back in here and,\n\n537\n00:30:53.534 --> 00:30:57.510\nI know we're getting there,\nwe're getting there Mike.\n\n538\n00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.110\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n539\n00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.990\nhow much more do you have to do?\n\n540\n00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.352\nCuz we're about out of time.\n\n541\n00:31:00.352 --> 00:31:02.190\nYou wanna try to finish this up or-\n&gt;&gt; We're almost finished here, yes.\n\n542\n00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:04.300\nSo we'll go ahead and-\n&gt;&gt; Keep on trucking then.\n\n543\n00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.060\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n544\n00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:10.180\nSo once we go ahead and provide that\ndeployment, then we do need to monitor.\n\n545\n00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.240\nSo this is pretty cool as well, and\nthis is where, during step four,\n\n546\n00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.618\nour monitoring phase here,\nwe can provide that continuous monitoring.\n\n547\n00:31:17.618 --> 00:31:22.300\nWhere end users can use the feedback hub,\nprovide feedback to Microsoft,\n\n548\n00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.780\nas well as provide feedback to us.\n\n549\n00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.860\nAs the admins, you can go in here and\nlook at it, and\n\n550\n00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.560\nmake sure everything is working\nthe way that you had thought it would.\n\n551\n00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.810\nOr otherwise they have\nthe opportunity to tell us, and\n\n552\n00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:34.980\nI do think that's about it Mike.\n\n553\n00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.250\nI mean, there really is so\nmuch more that you can play around and\n\n554\n00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:42.170\ndelve into here, but\nI think that's pretty good for\n\n555\n00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.300\nthis exam.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\n\n556\n00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:48.310\nwe appreciate those demonstrations and\nexplanations on upgrade readiness.\n\n557\n00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.560\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n558\n00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.460\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n559\n00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n560\n00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:55.538\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n561\n00:31:55.538 -->

She shows how to manually create a bootable USB whilst comparing the diferences between that method versus the Windows media creation tool. They also discuss methods of installation such DISM, ICD, SysPrep, WDS, and SCCM.",

[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.180\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\nWelcome to\n\n6\n00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.860\nanother exciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.040\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.220\nToday, we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n9\n00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.520\nGetting ready for that 70-698 exam.\n\n10\n00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.820\nHere with me today to talk\nabout installing Windows\n\n11\n00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.330\nis none other than Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n12\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.070\nWelcome, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.280\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Mike, how it going?\n\n14\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.980\n&gt;&gt; It's going great.\n\n15\n00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm kind of really\nexcited about this one, because\n\n16\n00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.290\nin a previous episode we looked at a way\nthat we can use the media creation tool.\n\n17\n00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.120\nAnd it was just so quick, so easy,\nthat I feel like maybe people didn't\n\n18\n00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.220\nvalue the work that went on\nbehind the scenes for that tools.\n\n19\n00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.130\nSo, I wanted to spend some time today,\nMike, and\n\n20\n00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.620\njust talk about the different ways\nthat we actually can install Windows.\n\n21\n00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.960\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And if you don't remember,\n\n22\n00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.190\nactually, let's take a look at my screen\nreal quick and I'll just show you.\n\n23\n00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.340\nAgain, I had showed you this before, but\n\n24\n00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.490\nthis is the link where you can\ndownload that and we installed it.\n\n25\n00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.260\nIt was just a couple clicks.\n\n26\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.540\nAnd you could choose if you're\ngonna be creating an ISO, or\n\n27\n00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.930\ncreating a bootable USB,\nor DVD, or flash drive.\n\n28\n00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.450\nSo, and that was it.\n\n29\n00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.000\nLike, literally, just a couple clicks.\n\n30\n00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.320\n&gt;&gt; It makes it really easy.\n\n31\n00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.750\nAnd I believe the tool goes out and\nfinds the installed media downloads and\n\n32\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.330\neverything, so it's-\n&gt;&gt; It's great.\n\n33\n00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.030\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty convenient.\n\n34\n00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.300\nAnd so, now I wanted to kind\nof talk about, first of all,\n\n36\n00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.440\nwhy we would have different\ninstallation methods.\n\n37\n00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.500\nAnd then, kind of revisiting\nthe past a little bit, so\n\n38\n00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.870\nyou could see where we came from.\n\n39\n00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.110\nSo, you really could appreciate all\nthe different tools that Microsoft\n\n40\n00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.800\nhas put together for\nyou to make this process easier.\n\n41\n00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.930\nSo, Mike, just thinking about that.\n\n42\n00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.330\nWhy would I want to have a DVD,\n\n43\n00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.040\na CD, or a flash drive to go ahead and\ninstall, right?\n\n44\n00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.720\nSo, well, sneaker netting,\nyou might not know that term.\n\n45\n00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.055\nYou might have heard it before.\n\n46\n00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:01.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what technicians do.\n\n47\n00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.180\nThey have to go round the workstations.\n\n48\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.500\nAnd in the past that's how\nwe always did things, right?\n\n49\n00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.715\n&gt;&gt; And if I'm a small shop and\nI've got ten PCs that I have to manage and\n\n50\n00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:17.027\nmaintain, I'm not gonna set up\na systems center infrastructure,\n\n51\n00:02:17.027 --> 00:02:18.304\nor WSUA, or a-\n&gt;&gt; WDS yeah-\n\n52\n00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:19.400\n&gt;&gt; Employment server-\n\n53\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have\n\n54\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.580\nto outweigh the things, right?\n\n55\n00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would cost me more,\nit just wouldn't make sense, so.\n\n56\n00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.050\nYou know those methods\nare definitely still viable.\n\n57\n00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.990\nUsing a thumb drive, or\nif you have a machine that's still, or\n\n58\n00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.030\nhas an optical drive on it,\nor using something like that.\n\n59\n00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.690\nWe have to have those\ntechniques in our tool bag.\n\n60\n00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.680\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n61\n00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.450\nWith the advent of Windows as\nthe service and you're seeing more,\n\n62\n00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.010\nand more frequent releases of\nthe operating system now that they.\n\n63\n00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.740\nIt's, with Windows 10 we see\nit being released that way,\n\n64\n00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.870\nwe have to think about making this\nprocess easier and streamlining it.\n\n65\n00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.370\nAnd maybe I am in a situation\nwhere I can't pull my updates, or\n\n66\n00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.950\nOS, over a network connection, because I\ndon't have that infrastructure available.\n\n67\n00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.170\nSo, maybe I do need to\nphysically go there.\n\n68\n00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.826\nAnd run that, so-\n&gt;&gt; Or you're in a secure environment, and\n\n69\n00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:06.312\nyou've intentionally isolated\nthat portion of the network.\n\n70\n00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:07.260\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n71\n00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.830\n&gt;&gt; From other portions of your network,\nand definitely from the WAN and\n\n72\n00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.090\ngoing outside.\n\n73\n00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.940\nSo, how do I get Windows 10 installed on\nthere if it's coming to me as a service?\n\n74\n00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.370\nHow do I get it on this machine\nthat's not connected to the internet?\n\n75\n00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.070\nSo, we definitely need these methods,\neven with the way Windows 10 is going.\n\n76\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.620\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n77\n00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.470\nAnd so, Microsoft does have\nsome step by steps here, again,\n\n78\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.250\nwe can take a look at my screen.\n\n79\n00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.150\nNow, I will say this about the page.\n\n80\n00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.625\nAnd all of these notes are included, or\n\n81\n00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:37.755\nthese links are included in the show\nnotes for you to look at them.\n\n82\n00:03:37.755 --> 00:03:41.681\nI encourage you highly to go back and look\nat each one of the tools that we're gonna\n\n83\n00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:44.150\nbe talking about in this\nshow more in depth.\n\n84\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.120\nYou don't need to be\nan expert on all these tools,\n\n85\n00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.260\nyou really need to understand when\nyou would use them and what they do,\n\n86\n00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.200\nand that's the level for this exam\nthat Microsoft wants you to be at.\n\n87\n00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.450\nSo, the first one here\nI wanted to show you,\n\n88\n00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.210\nInstall Windows from a USB Flash Drive.\n\n89\n00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.000\nNow, they have some steps here,\nand they outline what we need.\n\n90\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.520\nWe need a flash drive with\nat least 5G of free space.\n\n91\n00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.700\nLet me just talk to this for a second.\n\n92\n00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.390\nIt's important now,\nto pay attention to your source files.\n\n93\n00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.600\nSo, remember.\n\n94\n00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.710\nISOs, right?\n\n95\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.390\nSo, these are going to be and we talked\nabout source files I think before,\n\n96\n00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.950\nif not, then that's where those\ninstallation files reside.\n\n97\n00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.406\nSo, looking at your flash drives,\nmaking sure that they are like this one,\n\n98\n00:04:30.406 --> 00:04:32.733\nthis one is eight gigs\nwe'll be working with here.\n\n99\n00:04:32.733 --> 00:04:36.795\nSo, just keeping that in mind,\nand this is not an a plus class,\n\n100\n00:04:36.795 --> 00:04:41.627\nso it's kind of assumed that you know\ncertain file system limitations when\n\n101\n00:04:41.627 --> 00:04:45.250\nyou're reading this document\nthat they provide here.\n\n102\n00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.250\nSo, if I look at this part right here,\nwell, let's just go through the steps.\n\n103\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.500\nSo, number one is going to be to\nconnect a flash drive to your computer.\n\n104\n00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.180\nSo, I'm just gonna plug\none in real quick here.\n\n105\n00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.130\nSo, now I have a flash drive,\na firm drive whatever you wanna call it.\n\n106\n00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.330\nIt's plugged into my computer.\n\n107\n00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.150\nThat was step one.\n\n108\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.710\nNow, here they say open disk management,\nright click on start and\n\n109\n00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.500\nchoose disk management.\n\n110\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.770\nI like to use my start menu here.\n\n111\n00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.173\nYou can right click and hit run,\nor just hit the Windows and\n\n112\n00:05:15.173 --> 00:05:18.106\nR key at the same time and\nit will pop your red line.\n\n113\n00:05:18.106 --> 00:05:22.619\nAnd if you can see that,\nit's disk management\n\n114\n00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:26.562\ndisk.mgmt.msc and and more a head OK.\n\n115\n00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:33.460\nBack make it a little easier for\nyou to see that.\n\n116\n00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.080\nAll right.\n\n117\n00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.540\nSo, currently this disk two here,\nall right?\n\n118\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:46.990\nSo, remember 0, this is showing up as\nmy storage drive, Disk 1 as my OS here.\n\n119\n00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.140\nI have Disk 2,\nthis is my drive that I just plugged in,\n\n120\n00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.350\nthat eight-gig drive,\nmarked here NTFS, healthy.\n\n121\n00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.243\nDoesn't really matter, because we\nare going to be modifying that, and so\n\n122\n00:05:59.243 --> 00:06:01.196\nwe are going to be erasing it.\n\n123\n00:06:01.196 --> 00:06:04.551\nSo, there steps just say that we\ncan go ahead and right-click and\n\n124\n00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:06.020\nformat here within the GUI.\n\n125\n00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.750\nMike, did you ever use disk parts to\ngo ahead and create those drives?\n\n126\n00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n127\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.000\nSo, that was a way that we\ndid do that in the past.\n\n128\n00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.010\nSo, I wanted to spend sometime I\nwanted to show you the steps here, but\n\n129\n00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.030\nalso know that there is another\nway that we used to do things, so\n\n130\n00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.110\njust you're not thrown off by that also.\n\n131\n00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:33.690\nAnd it's kinda the nerdy, or geeky way,\nbecause, it takes more steps, it's\n\n132\n00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.880\nnot as easy to use as that Media Creation\nTool that Microsoft has created for us.\n\n133\n00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.470\nBut I want you to know it does exist and\n\n134\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.160\nwe'll look at other ways we can go\nahead and get Windows installed also.\n\n135\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.080\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n136\n00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so everything that you see here,\nwhat we're gonna be doing is performing\n\n137\n00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.880\nthese same functions within disk part,\nwhich is a command line utility.\n\n138\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.470\nSo, let me just go ahead and\ntype in cmd to pull that up.\n\n139\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.720\nNow, it is important to make sure you\nare in Administrative Command prompt, so\n\n140\n00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.028\nlet's right click and\nselect run as Administrator, all right.\n\n141\n00:07:08.753 --> 00:07:11.572\nHopefully you can see that\nwe are gonna go ahead and\n\n142\n00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:15.804\ntype in disk parts to go ahead and\ninitialize, and start that utility, and\n\n143\n00:07:15.804 --> 00:07:20.060\nyou can see that it is noted here\nto the left where it says diskpart.\n\n144\n00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.520\nNow, this is a big thing.\n\n145\n00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.190\nYou wanna make sure that you're choosing\nthe correct disk to go ahead and\n\n146\n00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.110\nprep it for that installation.\n\n147\n00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:32.860\nSo, you're not really modifying your\nactual hard disk in your operating system.\n\n148\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.730\nAnd that just wouldn't\nbe a great day there.\n\n149\n00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.470\n&gt;&gt; And easy to do with DiskPart.\n\n150\n00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.610\nThis is one of those tools that\nassumes you know what you're doing if\n\n151\n00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.830\nyou're in here.\n\n152\n00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.210\nSo, it doesn't give you a lot of warnings,\nif you choose the wrong drive and\n\n153\n00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.690\nyou say format.\n\n154\n00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.787\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't ask you twice give you\n\n155\n00:07:48.787 --> 00:07:52.210\na pretty pop up window say,\nare you sure you wanna do that.\n\n156\n00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.973\nIt just formats.\n&gt;&gt; Right, because here, great point, Mike,\n\n157\n00:07:54.973 --> 00:07:57.122\nin the GUI right-click you go to format.\n\n158\n00:07:57.122 --> 00:07:58.005\nAnd it'll give you a warning.\n\n159\n00:07:58.005 --> 00:08:00.259\nI can zoom in, you'll see that.\n\n160\n00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:04.246\nThis is the active partition on this disk.\n\n161\n00:08:04.246 --> 00:08:06.060\nAll the data on this\npartition will be lost.\n\n162\n00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.420\nI know it's a little fuzzy,\nbut that's why I'm reading it.\n\n163\n00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.310\nAre you sure you wanna\nformat this partition?\n\n164\n00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.001\nGUI gives you a bit of a heads up.\n\n165\n00:08:12.001 --> 00:08:18.421\nYou don't get that here in Disk Part, so\nthat's why it's, it's pretty important.\n\n166\n00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:24.703\nEven I know that this is going to be\ndisk number two, I saw it in the GUI.\n\n167\n00:08:24.703 --> 00:08:28.459\nWell, you might just wanna make sure and\nverify those sizes.\n\n168\n00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:29.202\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't hurt.\n\n169\n00:08:29.202 --> 00:08:30.948\n&gt;&gt; It's definitely worth\nit to check twice.\n\n170\n00:08:30.948 --> 00:08:31.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n171\n00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:35.480\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna type out list disk, and\n\n172\n00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.320\nthis is just another representation of\nwhat we saw in disk management, and\n\n173\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.960\nyou can see here Disk 0,\nDisk 1, and Disk 2.\n\n174\n00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.390\nYou can look at the sizes,\nhere it's obvious,\n\n175\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.690\nI see my 8 GB drive right here as Disk 2.\n\n176\n00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.290\nSo what I'm gonna do at this\npoint is select Disk 2.\n\n177\n00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.223\nSo the next command that\nI'll use is select disk.\n\n178\n00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:02.095\nOops, I clicked too early.\n\n179\n00:09:02.095 --> 00:09:03.809\n[LAUGH] Okay.\n\n180\n00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:06.043\nI just hit my up arrow\nto bring that back up.\n\n181\n00:09:06.043 --> 00:09:08.905\nSelect disk 2, and then hit enter.\n\n182\n00:09:08.905 --> 00:09:13.555\nNow, Disk 2 is now the selected disk,\nso we know we're working with the right\n\n183\n00:09:13.555 --> 00:09:17.923\ndrive, and if I go ahead and type in\nclean, this is going to be scrubbing or\n\n184\n00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:20.759\nerasing the information\nthat's on that disk.\n\n185\n00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:23.310\nIt's not formatting it yet,\nit's just cleaning it.\n\n186\n00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.237\nSo we'll hit enter to go ahead and\nperform that clean.\n\n187\n00:09:27.237 --> 00:09:29.645\n&gt;&gt; And that's one of the gotchas there\nI think that we should point out.\n\n188\n00:09:29.645 --> 00:09:33.865\nIt's like, when you said clean you're not\nspecifying what dives you wanna clean,\n\n189\n00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:36.302\nit's the one that you\nalready have selected, so\n\n190\n00:09:36.302 --> 00:09:40.120\nfrom now on all commands are gonna be\nissued against that particular drive.\n\n191\n00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.857\n&gt;&gt; Right we're working in that drive, and\nactually that's another great point Mike,\n\n192\n00:09:44.857 --> 00:09:49.460\nbecause if you flip back here to the GUI,\nwhenever you are working with a particular\n\n193\n00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.933\ndrive in the disk management interface\nhere, when you click on it you'll notice\n\n194\n00:09:53.933 --> 00:09:57.748\nthose dashed lines, so that's\nthe drive that has your attention and\n\n195\n00:09:57.748 --> 00:10:00.577\nanytime you're gonna be\nworking with that drive,\n\n196\n00:10:00.577 --> 00:10:04.311\nthose commands are executed on\nthe drive that has this dash lines.\n\n197\n00:10:04.311 --> 00:10:07.299\nSo again, you don't have that\nhere in the command prompt, or\n\n198\n00:10:07.299 --> 00:10:10.413\non disk part, but we know that\nbecause we've selected disk 2.\n\n199\n00:10:10.413 --> 00:10:13.587\n&gt;&gt; And I tell you, one of the commands\nthat I like to use at this point,\n\n200\n00:10:13.587 --> 00:10:15.368\ncuz I'm one those triple checkers.\n\n201\n00:10:15.368 --> 00:10:17.487\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know in the chat room we got the old\n\n202\n00:10:17.487 --> 00:10:20.044\nadage about measure twice,\ncut ones for jam.\n\n203\n00:10:20.044 --> 00:10:21.730\n&gt;&gt; That's a good one.\n\n204\n00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.507\n&gt;&gt; It's one of my favorite little saying,\n\n205\n00:10:24.507 --> 00:10:27.749\nadage as you go\n&gt;&gt; I like to do another list disk at this\n\n206\n00:10:27.749 --> 00:10:29.215\npoint,-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n207\n00:10:29.215 --> 00:10:32.173\n&gt;&gt; And what you'll see is that\nthe currently selected disk, or\n\n208\n00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:35.537\nthe active disk for commands,\nis gonna have an asterik next to it.\n\n209\n00:10:35.537 --> 00:10:36.453\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there it is.\n\n210\n00:10:36.453 --> 00:10:38.373\n&gt;&gt; And I hope you guys can see that.\n\n211\n00:10:38.373 --> 00:10:40.314\n&gt;&gt; I t's over on the left-hand side,\nit's a little bit off.\n\n212\n00:10:40.314 --> 00:10:41.920\nHere, let me move it so you can see that.\n\n213\n00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.356\n&gt;&gt; Just another way to double check and\nmake sure you're using the right drive,\n\n214\n00:10:46.356 --> 00:10:49.701\ncuz you do not want to format\nyour operating system drive,\n\n215\n00:10:49.701 --> 00:10:54.340\nyour data drive with all of your files,\nand VMs, or whatever the case may be, and\n\n216\n00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:58.638\nit's easy to check now, it's hard to\ngo back and fix things if you happen to\n\n217\n00:10:58.638 --> 00:11:02.295\nselect the wrong drive later on,\nso just a way to double check.\n\n218\n00:11:02.295 --> 00:11:07.588\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, this process is only like\na handful, less than a dozen steps here,\n\n219\n00:11:07.588 --> 00:11:12.500\nbut it doesn't take too long, but\nhaving to bring in your recovery image and\n\n220\n00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.676\neverything that could put you\nbehind schedule for the day, so.\n\n221\n00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.473\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you hate to\nformat the wrong drive.\n\n222\n00:11:18.473 --> 00:11:22.982\nIt's a lot easier to double check what\ndrive you have selected versus trying\n\n223\n00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:26.228\nto restore your data if you\nformatted the wrong drive.\n\n224\n00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:31.088\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually I did that here,\nwhat you're talking about Mike, and\n\n225\n00:11:31.088 --> 00:11:34.004\nyou can see on my screen, *Disk 2 there.\n\n226\n00:11:34.004 --> 00:11:35.918\nSo it is better to be safe than sorry.\n\n227\n00:11:35.918 --> 00:11:36.896\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n228\n00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:38.194\n&gt;&gt; So, for sure.\n\n229\n00:11:38.194 --> 00:11:42.766\nOkay, so now once we have that drive\nselected, and let me just fullscreen this\n\n230\n00:11:42.766 --> 00:11:46.670\nagain, we can go ahead and\nselect create the primary partitions.\n\n231\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.260\nSo we're gonna say create\npartition primary.\n\n232\n00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.930\nNow, if you want to kinda shorthand it,\nyou can.\n\n233\n00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.860\nCreate, part, pri.\n\n234\n00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.307\nWe'll hit Enter.\n\n235\n00:11:58.307 --> 00:12:02.270\nNow it says that it succeeded in\ncreating that primary partition.\n\n236\n00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:07.190\nSo if you wanna, again,\njust measure twice here, we'll say, List,\n\n237\n00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.610\nactually it's list part, P-A-R-T,\nfor that partition, and you\n\n238\n00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:18.730\ncan see here that it is partition 1 noted\nas primary, that we just created there.\n\n239\n00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.579\nYou can assign a drive letter,\nwe're not going to, it's not necessary.\n\n240\n00:12:23.579 --> 00:12:27.427\nBut we do need to format at this point,\nand this is what I really wanted to\n\n241\n00:12:27.427 --> 00:12:31.472\ntalk about when we started getting just\nshowing you the webpage there, and\n\n242\n00:12:31.472 --> 00:12:35.093\nI said pay attention to the size,\nbecause this is important here.\n\n243\n00:12:35.093 --> 00:12:40.496\nSo let's go ahead and\nformat the file system to fat32 and\n\n244\n00:12:40.496 --> 00:12:44.023\nyou could leave it just like this, but\n\n245\n00:12:44.023 --> 00:12:48.543\nwhat will happen is a full\nformat will go ahead and\n\n246\n00:12:48.543 --> 00:12:52.861\nstart and initiate, and it'll take awhile.\n\n247\n00:12:52.861 --> 00:12:55.615\nSo if you wanna just shorten\nthe time just go ahead and\n\n248\n00:12:55.615 --> 00:12:58.130\ntype in quick to perform\na quick installation.\n\n249\n00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.842\nYou'll see it happen very quickly here,\nhence the term.\n\n250\n00:13:01.842 --> 00:13:06.730\nBut formatting with FAT32, and\nlet me switch back to the website so\n\n251\n00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.597\nyou can see what Microsoft recommends,\n\n252\n00:13:09.597 --> 00:13:15.434\nyou have limitations with that file system\nwhere your files can only be up to 4GB.\n\n253\n00:13:15.434 --> 00:13:19.973\nNow, the iSO that we're working with\nis pretty close, it's like 3.95, so\n\n254\n00:13:19.973 --> 00:13:21.864\nyou wanna pay attention to that.\n\n255\n00:13:21.864 --> 00:13:27.149\nIf you had a really large iSO,\nI don't know like let's just say 12 GB,\n\n256\n00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:32.001\nyou would have to go ahead and\nsplit that image into smaller files to\n\n257\n00:13:32.001 --> 00:13:36.682\nhave it bootable, and here you can\nsee that the DCIM tool is being\n\n258\n00:13:36.682 --> 00:13:41.010\nused they provide step by\nstep to do this right there.\n\n259\n00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.577\nNow, sounds like a lot a work, right?\n\n260\n00:13:43.577 --> 00:13:44.905\nIt is.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n261\n00:13:44.905 --> 00:13:48.902\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, I do not expect them to\nask you how to do this on the exam.\n\n262\n00:13:48.902 --> 00:13:52.822\nI do expect them to ask you what tool\nwould you use, and that would be\n\n263\n00:13:52.822 --> 00:13:57.582\nthat media creation tool, because they've\nalready put a lot of resources, and\n\n264\n00:13:57.582 --> 00:14:02.349\ntheir developer's working on that tool for\nyou to circumvent of this nonsense.\n\n265\n00:14:02.349 --> 00:14:05.504\nSo there maybe times where\nyou do need to do that, but\n\n266\n00:14:05.504 --> 00:14:07.797\nI just wanted to show you this also, so\n\n267\n00:14:07.797 --> 00:14:11.687\nif you do have certain situations\nyou know how to do this as well.\n\n268\n00:14:11.687 --> 00:14:13.787\nNow that's about it here.\n\n269\n00:14:13.787 --> 00:14:16.680\nWe do need to go ahead and\nmark this partition as active.\n\n270\n00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.560\nSo we'll go ahead and select active,\nall right, and then you can exit.\n\n271\n00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.860\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, so now that we\ngot our drive prepared, what's next?\n\n272\n00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:29.084\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so Mike, you do have to copy some\nfiles over depending on where you obtained\n\n273\n00:14:29.084 --> 00:14:30.260\nthose install files.\n\n274\n00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.710\nLet's take a look at my screen.\n\n275\n00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:36.760\nI have a folder with some operating\nsystems here where I store some iSOs, and\n\n276\n00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.080\nsome other things,\nlike some virtual machine files,\n\n277\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.843\nbut down here at the bottom\nI have a Windows 10, and\n\n278\n00:14:42.843 --> 00:14:47.870\nlet me zoom in so\nyou guys can see this, Win10x64EntISO.\n\n279\n00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:53.980\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and double-click\nin and show you what's in here.\n\n280\n00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.739\nSo these are gonna be those files\nthat we need to go ahead and\n\n281\n00:14:57.739 --> 00:14:59.978\nmake this a fully bootable drive.\n\n282\n00:14:59.978 --> 00:15:03.415\nSo let me just go ahead and select these.\n\n283\n00:15:03.415 --> 00:15:05.200\nI'll need to copy them over.\n\n284\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.060\nSo here we're just literally doing a copy,\nand this is my drive,\n\n285\n00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.490\nmy G drive that we just formatted here,\nso we're going to go ahead and\n\n286\n00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.960\nwe'll just, either right-click, or\nyou can go ahead and do your paste.\n\n287\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.920\nIt'll take a while for\nthese files to go ahead and\n\n288\n00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.458\ncopy, because we talked about the size,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n289\n00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:31.134\nBut then we'll go ahead and let's just\nmove on over to our other computer, and\n\n290\n00:15:31.134 --> 00:15:36.381\nget that set up like if we were going\nto our end user and working with them.\n\n291\n00:15:36.381 --> 00:15:41.035\nOkay, and just to clarify something that I\ndid say, I said the size of the iSO, but\n\n292\n00:15:41.035 --> 00:15:44.952\njust remember that there are installation\nfiles within that iSO, so\n\n293\n00:15:44.952 --> 00:15:48.665\nthat's what I was referencing there,\nand here I have my laptop,\n\n294\n00:15:48.665 --> 00:15:53.450\nthis would be the computer that I'm\nworking on for the end user, or whomever.\n\n295\n00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.843\nGot my flash drive,\nI'm gonna go ahead and plug it in here.\n\n296\n00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:01.982\nI'm going to power on the machine and\nthen I'll hit F12 so\n\n297\n00:16:01.982 --> 00:16:06.710\nyou guys can see how we enter the boot\nmenu here and change that boot order.\n\n298\n00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:11.850\nSo, instead of booting from my internal\nhard disk drive, I've got my boot\n\n299\n00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:17.150\norder that's gonna come up here and\nthis is a menu-driven interface.\n\n300\n00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:22.750\nI don't have the use of my mouse here,\nso it's kind of ironic, this is an older\n\n301\n00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.520\nmachine, so it's not as pretty as some of\nthe newer machines that you might see.\n\n302\n00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.530\nI'm gonna scroll down by\nhitting my down arrow\n\n303\n00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.440\nuntil I get to my USB Storage Device.\n\n304\n00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:37.430\nSo, essentially what I'm doing is, well\nreading off that USB drive, I hit Enter.\n\n305\n00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:42.153\nAnd this will initiate that Windows\ninstallation here for Windows 10.\n\n306\n00:16:42.153 --> 00:16:44.971\nAnd we'll give it a second so you guys\ncan see what the screen looks like but\n\n307\n00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:47.035\nthen we'll just switch over\nto my virtual machines.\n\n308\n00:16:47.035 --> 00:16:49.532\nI mean we could have done\nit in virtual machines but\n\n309\n00:16:49.532 --> 00:16:51.720\nI wanted you to see how\nyou would hit that.\n\n310\n00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.950\nNow it's not gonna be the same for\neveryone.\n\n311\n00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.740\nI selected F12.\n\n312\n00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.910\nYour hardware device may be Esc,\ncombination key with F10,\n\n313\n00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:05.270\nor something like that, but you would just\nneed to check that documentation there.\n\n314\n00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.450\nThere's a lot-\n&gt;&gt; And you just hit it once and\n\n315\n00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.231\nit works every time, right?\n\n316\n00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:09.802\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n317\n00:17:09.802 --> 00:17:10.648\n&gt;&gt; That's a joke, [LAUGH].\n\n318\n00:17:10.648 --> 00:17:12.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that is a joke.\n\n319\n00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.600\nI know one of our viewers out there,\nI think it was Mike,\n\n320\n00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.834\nout there had mentioned that, and\nprobably something we should point out.\n\n321\n00:17:17.834 --> 00:17:18.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n322\n00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.770\n&gt;&gt; Just be patient with it, it's hard\nto get the timing down sometimes.\n\n323\n00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.590\nSo if it boots into\nyour normal Windows and\n\n324\n00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:27.450\ndoesn't go to the thumb drive,\nreboot your system, try again.\n\n325\n00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.910\nYou do have to hit F12, or F10,\nor Esc, or whatever it is for\n\n326\n00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.042\nyour particular computer,\ntypically more than once.\n\n327\n00:17:34.042 --> 00:17:38.810\nI will tap it every second until\nI get the old one time boot menu\n\n328\n00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.730\npopping up to let it know I got it.\n\n329\n00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:41.864\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI kind of look like a crazy\n\n330\n00:17:41.864 --> 00:17:42.628\nperson sometimes.\n\n331\n00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:43.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n332\n00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.210\n&gt;&gt; I'm not even gonna lie.\n\n333\n00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.546\nBut it's better than having\nto wait until you reboot.\n\n334\n00:17:47.546 --> 00:17:48.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then that can get frustrating.\n\n335\n00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.930\nSo you just wanna tippity tap tap,\nthat's what I always say.\n\n336\n00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ntippity tap is a good way to describe it.\n\n337\n00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:57.480\nI will say too that I've had a situation\nwhere I was going frantically on it,\n\n338\n00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.230\nended up getting a keyboard\nerror because it was having\n\n339\n00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.030\ntrouble keeping up with the key strokes.\n\n340\n00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.530\nSo don't go as fast as you can,\njust tap, tap, tap.\n\n341\n00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.505\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n342\n00:18:07.505 --> 00:18:10.930\n&gt;&gt; Until you see it'll acknowledge that,\nokay I saw your key stroke.\n\n343\n00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:14.070\nAs soon as I get there,\nwe'll show you the one-time boot menu, so\n\n344\n00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.040\njust be patient with us.\n\n345\n00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay, this is what the screen looks\nlike, if you can look back here.\n\n346\n00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.790\nSo this is gonna ask me about the language\nthat we wanna install, the time and\n\n347\n00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.780\ncurrency format,\nas well as the keyboard input.\n\n348\n00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.100\nIt's a little difficult to see here so\nlet's hop back on over to my VM so\n\n349\n00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:28.770\nwe can set that up.\n\n350\n00:18:30.575 --> 00:18:31.690\nAll right, Mike, you know what?\n\n351\n00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:32.910\nI think I changed my mind,\n\n352\n00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.110\nbecause the installation is\ngonna take quite a bit of time.\n\n353\n00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.700\nSo we'll save that for the next episode,\n\n354\n00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.820\nwe're just gonna pick up\nright where we left off.\n\n355\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.730\nBut I do wanna spend some time,\nlike I mentioned,\n\n356\n00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.830\ntelling you about other ways that we can\ngo ahead and perform this installation.\n\n357\n00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.300\nSo let's take a look at\nmy screen again here.\n\n358\n00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.830\nNow I mentioned this also in a prior\nepisode but again I don't think\n\n359\n00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.950\nI stressed the importance enough and\nI really wanted to reiterate that.\n\n360\n00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.120\nHere you can see the ADK, all right?\n\n361\n00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.400\nThis is going to be the Windows Assessment\nand Deployment Kit.\n\n362\n00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.160\nThis is a compilation of tools.\n\n363\n00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.760\nSo it's kinda like a little tool kit\nwith some really great tools in there.\n\n364\n00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.700\nTwo that I would like to\ncall out specifically\n\n365\n00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.940\nare going to be the DISM tool.\n\n366\n00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.760\nThere's again, all of this documentation,\nthese links I'm putting in the show notes.\n\n367\n00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.220\nAnd you can spend some time to\nreally get to understand that.\n\n368\n00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.900\nAnd also, DISM is going to be\na command line interface tool that's\n\n369\n00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.070\nright here in our Command Prompt.\n\n370\n00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.440\nSo let me just go ahead and pull that\nup to show you, so you can study and\n\n371\n00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.320\nlook at both of them.\n\n372\n00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.760\nBut I wouldn't go too far in depth,\nbut I would encourage you to know for\n\n373\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.687\nexample, Mike when are some good\nuse case scenarios for DISM?\n\n374\n00:19:41.687 --> 00:19:46.020\nWhen you have an off line image, when you\nneed to split those installation files.\n\n375\n00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.820\nSo things like that just\nknowing the proper scenario\n\n376\n00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.960\nin which you would want to use\nthis tool from the ADK package?\n\n377\n00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.204\n&gt;&gt; Customizing an image comes to\n\n378\n00:19:54.204 --> 00:19:54.891\nmind as well\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n379\n00:19:54.891 --> 00:19:57.221\n&gt;&gt; If you wanna add additional packages,\ndrivers and\n\n380\n00:19:57.221 --> 00:20:01.010\nthings like that I can use DISM to mount\nthat image up and make changes to it.\n\n381\n00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.210\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, so\n\n382\n00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:06.710\nlet me just go ahead and, we'll pull up\nthis Command Prompt here like I said.\n\n383\n00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.610\nWe're gonna run it with\nan administrative Command Prompt.\n\n384\n00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.610\nAnd I just wanna show you that there\nare help files that you can look at for\n\n385\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:15.920\nthis DISM tool.\n\n386\n00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:21.300\nSo if you just go ahead and\ntype in dism /?\n\n387\n00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.590\n&gt;&gt; This should bring up\nyour list of switches so\n\n388\n00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.370\nyou could look at some of these switches.\n\n389\n00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:30.000\nAnd there are quite a few here\nto get familiar with that, but\n\n390\n00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.420\nwe do have separate shows on just\nhow to create offline images and\n\n391\n00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.010\ncustom images like Mike was saying for\nthe OS there.\n\n392\n00:20:40.275 --> 00:20:41.640\nAll right.\n\n393\n00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:47.440\nAn other tool that's inside of ADK\nis something called Imaging and\n\n394\n00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.710\nConfiguration Designer.\n\n395\n00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:53.775\nSo again, not knowing every little\ndetail about this tool, but\n\n396\n00:20:53.775 --> 00:20:57.025\nI would like you to know when\nyou should utilize this tool.\n\n397\n00:20:57.025 --> 00:21:00.715\nSo, in a previous episode we talked\nabout the term provisioning, right?\n\n398\n00:21:00.715 --> 00:21:05.420\nSo provisioning, choose your own device,\nall those different mobile devices.\n\n399\n00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.420\nSo here,\nthis would be a great tool to go ahead and\n\n400\n00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.190\nlook at if you are setting\nup mobile devices.\n\n401\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.050\nAnd that's really what they\nwant you to know about.\n\n402\n00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:18.070\nSo understanding that and then you can\ngo through and see how to build a mobile\n\n403\n00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:22.990\nimage using Windows ICD and\nbeing familiar with the user interface.\n\n404\n00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:27.650\nSo just looking at all of\nthat information would be,\n\n405\n00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.570\nI guess kind of like homework, but just to\nreally get you familiar with that as well.\n\n406\n00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.070\nNow Mike,\nthis one I think is one of your favorites.\n\n407\n00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.320\nYou talk about it a lot so, Sysprep.\n\n408\n00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.383\n&gt;&gt; Sysprep, absolutely,\nI have to have that one.\n\n409\n00:21:39.383 --> 00:21:43.767\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Mike you had a great example\nin our Windows 10 shows that you were\n\n410\n00:21:43.767 --> 00:21:45.380\ntalking about yesterday.\n\n411\n00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.560\nWe were talking about\ndifferent types of disks.\n\n412\n00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.710\nAnd I thought,\nwell that's a wonderful way to use it.\n\n413\n00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.260\nYou can use Sysprep for\na number of reasons, so\n\n414\n00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.630\nwhat sort of reasons would\nyou use Sysprep for?\n\n415\n00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.030\n&gt;&gt; Well Sysprep generalizes the image,\nright?\n\n416\n00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.710\nWe are able to remove all the uniquely\nidentifying information about that\n\n417\n00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:05.050\ninstallation so that we can duplicate that\ninstallation and start speeding things up.\n\n418\n00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.650\nI was using it to spin up test labs.\n\n419\n00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:11.650\nI'd need to spin up three or\nfour different servers, I don't want to\n\n420\n00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.780\nhave to install three or four times and\nthen update three or four times.\n\n421\n00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:20.360\nI have one image that I have installed and\nupdated and then Syspreped and\n\n422\n00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.050\nshut down, so it's generalized.\n\n423\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:26.330\nNow I can make differencing disks\nbased off of that parent disk, and\n\n424\n00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.980\nanytime I need a server I can just\nspin up a new differencing disk.\n\n425\n00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.860\nAnd I've got a machine that's already\nat the state of being installed,\n\n426\n00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:38.190\nupdated, all it has to do is the OOBE, or\nthe Out of Box Experience at that point.\n\n427\n00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.951\nSo I could have four new\nservers in a matter of minutes-\n\n428\n00:22:39.951 --> 00:22:40.860\n&gt;&gt; And I just thought that was brilliant.\n\n429\n00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:41.787\n&gt;&gt; Instead of a matter of hours.\n\n430\n00:22:41.787 --> 00:22:42.821\n&gt;&gt; Especially for studying.\n\n431\n00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:43.503\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n432\n00:22:43.503 --> 00:22:45.510\n&gt;&gt; Because minutes instead of hours.\n\n433\n00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:46.043\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n434\n00:22:46.043 --> 00:22:47.845\n&gt;&gt; And that's awesome.\nSo definitely, like Mike said,\n\n435\n00:22:47.845 --> 00:22:52.055\njust remember Sysprep is gonna\nbe that generalization tool.\n\n436\n00:22:52.055 --> 00:22:54.193\nI don't even know if that's-\n&gt;&gt; System preparation, right?\n\n437\n00:22:54.193 --> 00:22:57.225\n&gt;&gt; System preparation, yeah,\nthe name implies what it does there.\n\n438\n00:22:57.225 --> 00:23:00.575\nSo it just removes those identifiers\nthere, so like you said.\n\n439\n00:23:00.575 --> 00:23:03.555\nNow, we mentioned something earlier,\nPXE boot.\n\n440\n00:23:03.555 --> 00:23:06.635\nSo PXE boot is a pre-execution\nenvironment boot,\n\n441\n00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:09.670\nwhere you're actually booting\noff your network interface card.\n\n442\n00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:13.413\nAnd the thing is, you can't just say, I\nwant to boot off my network interface card\n\n443\n00:23:13.413 --> 00:23:15.638\nwithout any kind of\ninfrastructure to support it.\n\n444\n00:23:15.638 --> 00:23:19.734\nSo the last two I wanna talk about are\ngonna be something that we can utilize in\n\n445\n00:23:19.734 --> 00:23:20.310\nthat way.\n\n446\n00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.040\nActually, so Windows Deployment Services.\n\n447\n00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.810\nYou might even have heard\nsomeone say like a WDS.\n\n448\n00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.800\nSo like Windows Deployment Server,\nsomething like that.\n\n449\n00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:35.254\nBut the purpose of a WDS is to go ahead\nand house updates, OSs or whatever it is\n\n450\n00:23:35.254 --> 00:23:41.411\nyou're trying to push those custom images\nout to computer systems over the network.\n\n451\n00:23:41.411 --> 00:23:46.092\nSo you're actually booting from\nutilizing that method to go ahead and\n\n452\n00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:50.950\npull that, you can pull Windows\n10 that way, so that's one way.\n\n453\n00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:54.880\nNow, I will say with the evolution of our\n\n454\n00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.630\noperating systems here as a service or\nWindows as a service,\n\n455\n00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:03.860\nskill ability like I mentioned is\nat the forefront of our minds.\n\n456\n00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.887\nSo there is a ton of information.\n\n457\n00:24:06.887 --> 00:24:13.339\nAnd literally I wanted to go ahead and say\nhundreds of hours that Adam here in studio\n\n458\n00:24:13.339 --> 00:24:19.470\nhas created to spend to really explain\nSystem Center it's not the easiest.\n\n459\n00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.890\nLike you're not just gonna learn it\nright away and set up right away.\n\n460\n00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:24.630\nIt takes time, money, and effort.\n\n461\n00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:28.700\nSo, what Mike and I were talking\nabout the beginning of the show was,\n\n462\n00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.170\nthere are situations where you wanna have\n\n463\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:36.110\nthat USB drive when this type of\nimplementation is not feasible.\n\n464\n00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:40.580\nThe good news is Microsoft\nprovides tons of documentation.\n\n465\n00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:45.570\nI mean, you have got all sorts\nof files for analysis and\n\n466\n00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.090\npreparation to make sure that\nthis is the right tool for you.\n\n467\n00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.970\nVideos, all sorts of information.\n\n468\n00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:55.370\nSo just understanding what system\ncenter is and when you would use it for\n\n469\n00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:58.820\nthose larger enterprise\nenvironments I think is key here.\n\n470\n00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.590\nYou're not expected to be an expert for\nall of these tools,\n\n471\n00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.430\njust knowing as a technician\nwhen to select the right tool.\n\n472\n00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:07.650\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee.\n\n473\n00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:08.372\nGreat stuff.\n\n474\n00:25:08.372 --> 00:25:10.490\nGood to look at ways we\ncan install Windows 10.\n\n475\n00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.660\nI know we got more to do,\nwe all wanna see it in action, but\n\n476\n00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.920\nwe're gonna have to come back for\npart two for that.\n\n477\n00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.620\nSo, for now signing off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n478\n00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.280\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n479\n00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.903\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n480\n00:25:20.903 --> 00:25:26.837\n[MUSIC]\n\n481\n00:25:26.837 --> 00:25:29.879\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.500\nHello, welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.490\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.510\nToday we're installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n6\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.730\nSpecifically, in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.500\nwe're actually doing a continuation\nof part two on installing Windows 10.\n\n8\n00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.680\nHere to walk us through that process\nis none other than Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.250\nWelcome Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.060\nHow is it going Mike?\n\n11\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.480\nIt's going great, glad you're back.\n\n12\n00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.902\nYeah, thanks for having me.\n\n13\n00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:36.680\n[LAUGH] We started the installation,\nso we have to finish it now, right?\n\n14\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.390\nYeah, exactly.\n\n15\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.440\nI guess we didn't really get\ntoo far into it, though.\n\n16\n00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.280\nNo.\nWe just saw that initial screen.\n\n17\n00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.710\nSo I think that'd be a great place for\nus to go ahead and pick back up.\n\n18\n00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.000\nIf you wana take a look at my screen,\nnow this isn't exactly where we left off.\n\n19\n00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.840\nI have a virtual machine going here,\nand what you're seeing, and if I\n\n20\n00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.620\ncan zoom in a little bit, I don't know if\nit will let me at this moment in time.\n\n21\n00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.020\nWhat you're seeing is the boot order.\n\n22\n00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.980\nAnd we kind of talked about that a little\nbit, but in this virtual machine that I've\n\n23\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.100\ncreated, there is currently no operating\nsystem for this machine to look to.\n\n24\n00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.670\nSo, I'm going to be booting, change this\nboot order to boot from our SATA CD-ROM\n\n25\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.590\nand that's basically emulating a CD or\nDVD drive bay.\n\n26\n00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.910\nA lot of machines don't\nhave them even these days.\n\n27\n00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.280\nSo that's what we're doing, you might, and\n\n28\n00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.020\nit's kind of interesting,\nMike are you an artist at all?\n\n29\n00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.250\nEh, not really, no.\n\n30\n00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.758\nI'm very, what do they say,\nI'm very right,\n\n31\n00:01:34.758 --> 00:01:37.970\nwait, is it right brain creative,\nleft brain analytical?\n\n32\n00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.050\nI don't know.\nI'm left handed, so\n\n33\n00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.000\nmy right brain works, so\nmaybe it's right brain creative.\n\n34\n00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.680\nI think you might be right.\n\n35\n00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.630\nYeah, I think I'm very left-brained.\n\n36\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.622\nWe could be totally wrong with that.\n\n37\n00:01:44.622 --> 00:01:45.355\n[LAUGH] But anywho.\n\n38\n00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:46.049\nNo, I'm not an artist.\n\n39\n00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:46.578\n[LAUGH] Okay.\n\n40\n00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:51.810\n[LAUGH] So if you've ever heard the term\nmixed media, just hey, I work with oil,\n\n41\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.000\npastels, and I don't know, glitter or\nwhatever, the different types of media.\n\n42\n00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.410\nSo when you hear the term,\ninstalling from media, so here my CD or\n\n43\n00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.610\nDVD is just a form of that media,\nwhat I'm installing from.\n\n44\n00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.800\nYou could have an ISO, USB from that media\ncreation tool that we spoke about a number\n\n45\n00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.130\nof things, and we'll also look at that a\nlittle bit more as we progress with this.\n\n46\n00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.340\nSo, for now,\nI'm just gonna select our CD or DVD.\n\n47\n00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.860\nI'm going to press any key because,\nas you can see,\n\n48\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.520\nit said press any key to\nboot from that CD or DVD.\n\n49\n00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.180\nThis will go ahead and kick start\nthat initialization or installation.\n\n50\n00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.750\nSo, we're just going to go ahead and\ngive that a minute, but\n\n51\n00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.120\nthis is a fresh, clean install and\nthat's what we're looking at right now.\n\n52\n00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.670\nSo it should be like you're\nusing a virtual machine, would\n\n53\n00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.480\nit be the same thing if it was a bare\nmetal machine that you had just built.\n\n54\n00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.270\nYour boot order goes to\nthat hard drive first,.\n\n55\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.820\nThere's no operating system installed yet,\nso\n\n56\n00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.260\nthe next option on the list of the boot\norder is to see the CD ROM drive.\n\n57\n00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.940\nAs long as we got bootable\nmedia put in there or\n\n58\n00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.790\nwhether if you're doing if off of USB,\nit kinda works this way, but\n\n59\n00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.620\nit would look the same on\na bare metal machine, right.\n\n60\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.840\nRight.\nSo, yea, exactly, Mike.\n\n61\n00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.070\nAnd the first screen, this is where we\nleft off in that other show when we had\n\n62\n00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.430\nused, like Mike was saying,\nthat flash drive there.\n\n63\n00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.230\nWe were booting off that other machine.\n\n64\n00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.040\nSo, the first thing it's going to\nask is some regional settings here,\n\n65\n00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.630\nsome information about our language, which\nlanguage do you want to install, time and\n\n66\n00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.980\ncurrency format,\nas well as keyboard or input method.\n\n67\n00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.890\nI think they might have got a lot of\n\n68\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.290\nfeedback about this because they asked you\na few times, and also on the objectives,\n\n69\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.870\nmake sure you know how to change\nthat regional information as well.\n\n70\n00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.020\nSo we'll cover that a little bit later.\n\n71\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.910\nBut we'll hit next for now.\n\n72\n00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.200\nAnd notice how a little bit behind my head\nhere, I'll zoom in a little more if I can.\n\n73\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.760\nNope, that's as far as I can get.\n\n74\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.480\nYou'll see that this, or\nI'll tell you if you can't see,\n\n75\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.050\nbut this capital N is underscored.\n\n76\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.100\nSo if you didn't have a mouse\nto be able to utilize a mouse\n\n77\n00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.870\ncursor in this environment, you could Alt\n\n78\n00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.420\nthrough by hitting a keyboard shortcut\nof whatever letter is underscored or\n\n79\n00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.640\nunderlined, as well as the Alt TAb\nto continue to the next screen.\n\n80\n00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.330\nAll right,\nlet me try to zoom back out for us here.\n\n81\n00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.360\nWe're gonna hit Next.\n\n82\n00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.070\nNow, on this screen, let me zoom in again.\n\n83\n00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.450\nIt's kind of gonna be\na struggle with our zooms here,\n\n84\n00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.050\nbecause I am in that pre, I don't have\nthe zoom-it tool on this computer.\n\n85\n00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.850\nBut you'll notice, there's an option\nhere to repair your computer.\n\n86\n00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.920\nI'm not going to select that now, but\nI just want you to be aware of it,\n\n87\n00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.070\nbecause we will come back and take a look\nat all those options as well, so for\n\n88\n00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.620\ntroubleshooting, and for now, we're gonna\ngo ahead and hit this Install button.\n\n89\n00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.360\nAnd as you can see,\nthat I underscored there as well.\n\n90\n00:04:48.585 --> 00:04:51.829\nIt's kind of interesting, if you think\nabout it, we'll have some times here,\n\n91\n00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:54.290\nsome like moments where we kinda\nhave to talk about it [laughter] So,\n\n92\n00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.650\nI'll just give you a little\nbit of history lesson.\n\n93\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.660\nSo I started working with XP and\nI did a lot of installations.\n\n94\n00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.330\nAnd I will say that the way\nthat it used to be took\n\n95\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.620\na lot more interaction with\nthe technician and the system.\n\n96\n00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.834\nIt's so automated and nice nowadays, and\nso if you never worked with older systems,\n\n97\n00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:17.187\nyou don't understand the struggle or\nthe pain that we used to have.\n\n98\n00:05:17.187 --> 00:05:19.131\nBut we used to have like service packs,\nand\n\n99\n00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:22.857\neven if you were working with the media\ncenter edition, you would have additional\n\n100\n00:05:22.857 --> 00:05:26.280\nroll-ups that you had to install\nin certain sequential orders.\n\n101\n00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.390\nAnd if you forgot to interact with\na particular page or hit that button,\n\n102\n00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.960\nit would just, like we have here,\nthere are certain points in\n\n103\n00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.170\ntime during an installation that\nwill require that human interaction.\n\n104\n00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.140\nSo, for instance,\nwhat we're looking at here is our EULA,\n\n105\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.880\nit's the end-user license agreement.\n\n106\n00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.600\nAnd it's all the legal stuff\nthat Microsoft wants to\n\n107\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.510\njust make sure that they're\ngiving all that information and\n\n108\n00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.260\nbasically the liability and things\nlike that, making sure you understand.\n\n109\n00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.748\nYou might wanna go ahead and\nread all of that if you want to, but.\n\n110\n00:05:55.748 --> 00:06:00.060\n[LAUGH] If you to have\nunattended installations,\n\n111\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.130\nyou can see it goes down pretty far.\n\n112\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.640\nThere are ways that you can go ahead and\n\n113\n00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:09.440\ncreate answer files to help remove\nthe human aspect of an installation,\n\n114\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.120\nbut for now, I want to show you what\nthis process actually looks like.\n\n115\n00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.810\nSo you really only have this one option\nhere to agree with that EULA or not.\n\n116\n00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.120\nSo we're going to agree,\nand we'll hit Next.\n\n117\n00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.219\nNow, on this page, I do want to zoom\nin here so you guys can see this.\n\n118\n00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.310\nWe have a couple of options.\n\n119\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.718\nSo, number one,\nwe have the option to upgrade.\n\n120\n00:06:29.718 --> 00:06:33.430\nSo, we kinda mentioned upgrades\nversus installations already,\n\n121\n00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.630\nbut just keep that in mind.\n\n122\n00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.839\nWe will come back and\nperform an upgrade and\n\n123\n00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:41.180\nwe're gonna select custom\ninstallation at this time.\n\n124\n00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.210\nNo files or\n\n125\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.390\nsettings will be retained during this\nparticular type of a clean installation.\n\n126\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.070\nSo just keep that in mind,\nso we'll hit custom.\n\n127\n00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.950\nNow, this is interesting, this is where\nI have my drive options shown here.\n\n128\n00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.330\nThis is my 60 gig hard drive that I have\ncreated within this virtual machine.\n\n129\n00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.950\nSo this is like emulating\nmy physical hard drive.\n\n130\n00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.390\nIf I had additional partitions, or\n\n131\n00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:15.340\nif I wanted additional partitions, I could\ngo ahead and create this new option.\n\n132\n00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.040\nAnd we are gonna look at some methods\na little bit later that do require\n\n133\n00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.210\nthe use of an additional partition, so\nyou would go ahead and use this tool here,\n\n134\n00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.200\nthis option to create one.\n\n135\n00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.750\nI'm just gonna hit cancel for now,\n\n136\n00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.150\nwe're gonna keep this all on\none particular partition.\n\n137\n00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.835\nIf you had a drive that had been used in\nthe past, you may see multiple partitions\n\n138\n00:07:35.835 --> 00:07:40.500\nlisted here, you would just highlight\nthem, and then select delete.\n\n139\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.850\nYou have a couple of other options\nto extend or format as well, and\n\n140\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.550\nthen another thing here is load driver.\n\n141\n00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.704\nSo if you were utilizing like\na raid configuration, or\n\n142\n00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:56.401\nany kind of discontroller that\nneeded an additional driver,\n\n143\n00:07:56.401 --> 00:08:00.941\nthis is where you would be\nloading that additional driver.\n\n144\n00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:02.633\nAnd this is just some\nclear refresh buttons.\n\n145\n00:08:02.633 --> 00:08:08.202\nSo if you had done something,\nattached a disk per se, and were expecting\n\n146\n00:08:08.202 --> 00:08:13.976\nto see that in this menu, you could hit\nrefresh to just reignite this page.\n\n147\n00:08:13.976 --> 00:08:17.618\nLike initialize this page and\nshow any changes that you may have had.\n\n148\n00:08:17.618 --> 00:08:21.322\nSo I'm just gonna put Next.\n\n149\n00:08:21.322 --> 00:08:26.988\nAnd I probably should just mention here,\nwe're keeping this one particular drive.\n\n150\n00:08:26.988 --> 00:08:31.349\nbut there are reasons, like use\ncases why someone would want to have\n\n151\n00:08:31.349 --> 00:08:36.262\nan additional drive aside from different\ntypes of technological methods.\n\n152\n00:08:36.262 --> 00:08:39.549\nMaybe it's a preference for\nstorage or something like that.\n\n153\n00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:44.219\nMaybe you want to have all of your files\nbeing saved a different partition.\n\n154\n00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:49.325\nSo that if for some reason you're\nbooting your bootable partition\n\n155\n00:08:49.325 --> 00:08:55.447\nthat has your operating system got some\nkind of malware on it or became corrupt.\n\n156\n00:08:55.447 --> 00:08:59.413\nIt wouldn't potentially harm\nyour storage or your files, so\n\n157\n00:08:59.413 --> 00:09:02.630\nyou would have a little\nbit of segregation there.\n\n158\n00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.006\nBut that's just completely up to you or\n\n159\n00:09:05.006 --> 00:09:09.453\nyour environment that you're working in.\n&gt;&gt; That's one of the things I used to\n\n160\n00:09:09.453 --> 00:09:13.925\ndo all the time, was store all my data on\neither a second drive or second partition.\n\n161\n00:09:13.925 --> 00:09:15.960\nBecause as I was getting into this field,\n\n162\n00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.636\nyou'd be blowing away the operating\nsystem, it seemed like every month.\n\n163\n00:09:19.636 --> 00:09:23.356\nAnd I didn't wanna have to back up all\nmy files like I kept from a separate\n\n164\n00:09:23.356 --> 00:09:24.046\npartition.\n\n165\n00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:27.337\nAnd then I can just reinstall the\noperating system whenever I wanted, and\n\n166\n00:09:27.337 --> 00:09:29.739\nall my data could just stay\nthere on that other drive.\n\n167\n00:09:29.739 --> 00:09:30.783\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's nice and\n\n168\n00:09:30.783 --> 00:09:33.805\nthe thing is though, we have so\nmany other options now a days.\n\n169\n00:09:33.805 --> 00:09:36.544\nStorage isn't as expensive\nas it used to be.\n\n170\n00:09:36.544 --> 00:09:39.604\nSo even removable media is\na lot cheaper now a days, so\n\n171\n00:09:39.604 --> 00:09:41.242\na lot of people opt for that.\n\n172\n00:09:41.242 --> 00:09:44.978\nSo just knowing that, that is an option\nthat you have available to you.\n\n173\n00:09:44.978 --> 00:09:46.563\nNow, let me zoom in here.\n\n174\n00:09:46.563 --> 00:09:49.130\nI should have zoomed in while you\nwere talking, but that's okay.\n\n175\n00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.039\nI just wanna show you a few things.\n\n176\n00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:56.448\nThis process, so\nthis screen is going to take a while.\n\n177\n00:09:56.448 --> 00:10:00.232\nYou'll see that there is a progression\nnoted in percentage going through\n\n178\n00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:02.681\nthe steps that is happening\nin the background.\n\n179\n00:10:02.681 --> 00:10:05.600\nSo for instance,\nwe copied over Windows files.\n\n180\n00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.033\nWe're getting those files ready for\ninstallation.\n\n181\n00:10:08.033 --> 00:10:13.107\nYou're gonna see some features being\ninstalled as well as installing updates.\n\n182\n00:10:13.107 --> 00:10:14.810\nLet me just give you a heads up.\n\n183\n00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:19.180\nUpdates are going to be an integral\npart of this process, and\n\n184\n00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.621\nit does take a long time,\nso it's always good.\n\n185\n00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:26.158\nI will say this to start with at\nall possible, if you have a copy\n\n186\n00:10:26.158 --> 00:10:30.320\nof the operating system to make sure\nthat it is recent if at all possible.\n\n187\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.398\nSo you don't have to go\nthrough all those updates, but\n\n188\n00:10:34.398 --> 00:10:37.247\nit's gonna take time regardless.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n189\n00:10:37.247 --> 00:10:40.766\nthis is really dependent on\nthe performance of your machine as well,\n\n190\n00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:42.231\nright?\n&gt;&gt; True, yes.\n\n191\n00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:43.553\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH] You're looking at your disk IO,\n\n192\n00:10:43.553 --> 00:10:44.847\ncuz you're doing-\n&gt;&gt; Hardware.\n\n193\n00:10:44.847 --> 00:10:46.253\n&gt;&gt; A lot of unpacking,\n\n194\n00:10:46.253 --> 00:10:48.413\nall those files from that ISO.\n\n195\n00:10:48.413 --> 00:10:52.877\nAnd getting ready to install Windows,\nso if you've got a nice BFE subsystem.\n\n196\n00:10:52.877 --> 00:10:54.909\n&gt;&gt; BFE.\n\n197\n00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:55.954\n&gt;&gt; You got a lot of memory,\n\n198\n00:10:55.954 --> 00:10:58.267\nyou can really make this\nprocess go a little faster.\n\n199\n00:10:58.267 --> 00:11:02.178\nSometimes especially on any machine\nthat doesn't have a lot of memory, or\n\n200\n00:11:02.178 --> 00:11:05.405\na slower drive, or of you doing\nthis is in a virtual machine and\n\n201\n00:11:05.405 --> 00:11:08.404\nyou've got one of those\ndynamically expanding drives.\n\n202\n00:11:08.404 --> 00:11:09.396\nWell guess what?\n\n203\n00:11:09.396 --> 00:11:11.475\nThat drives gonna start up at 4 megabytes.\n\n204\n00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:16.084\nSo everything it's doing is it's unpacking\nall these files is having to stop and\n\n205\n00:11:16.084 --> 00:11:17.524\ngrow that dynamic disk.\n\n206\n00:11:17.524 --> 00:11:20.036\nSo it's definitely gonna make\nit take a little bit longer,\n\n207\n00:11:20.036 --> 00:11:23.316\nso something you have to plan for,\nyou're doing a single install like this.\n\n208\n00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:24.072\n&gt;&gt; For sure, and\n\n209\n00:11:24.072 --> 00:11:25.526\nit is going to take a while.\n\n210\n00:11:25.526 --> 00:11:29.717\nSo Mike, I think what we should do is\nmaybe do a TV time out and just come back,\n\n211\n00:11:29.717 --> 00:11:32.415\nso you guys don't have to sit here and\nwait also.\n\n212\n00:11:32.415 --> 00:11:34.538\nOkay, through the magic of TV time,\n\n213\n00:11:34.538 --> 00:11:39.069\nI'm restoring a virtual machine here\nthat was just check pointed to Cortana.\n\n214\n00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:42.994\nBecause Cortana is now a part\nof a Windows installation.\n\n215\n00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:47.120\nSo she is here, our virtual assistant\nto guide us through this process.\n\n216\n00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.793\nSo if we just take a look at my screen,\nit is still building up here.\n\n217\n00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:54.684\nBut I wanted to show you what that\ninitial screen looked like here\n\n218\n00:11:54.684 --> 00:11:56.504\nwith her saying hello.\n\n219\n00:11:56.504 --> 00:11:59.725\nI know, and if you have your speakers on,\n\n220\n00:11:59.725 --> 00:12:04.152\nyou'll an audible interaction\npossibly as well there.\n\n221\n00:12:04.152 --> 00:12:07.508\nLet me just close this,\nthis is something that you will not see,\n\n222\n00:12:07.508 --> 00:12:11.381\nit's just something that's happening\nin my virtual environment here.\n\n223\n00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:14.660\nSo this is where Cortana\nwould be talking to you.\n\n224\n00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.147\nShe's just giving a little information\nlike a little sign in here or\n\n225\n00:12:18.147 --> 00:12:21.765\ntouch a Wi-Fi there, we'll have your\nPC ready for all you plan to do.\n\n226\n00:12:21.765 --> 00:12:27.070\nShe's kind of snarky a little bit,\nI like her added to there.\n\n227\n00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.812\nYou can also turn this off if you notice\nthat there are some controls down here at\n\n228\n00:12:30.812 --> 00:12:31.441\nthe bottom.\n\n229\n00:12:31.441 --> 00:12:36.445\nAnd you do have the ability to mute\nher if that is not your cup of tea.\n\n230\n00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:40.111\nBut we're just gonna let her guide us\nthrough this process here for a moment.\n\n231\n00:12:40.111 --> 00:12:42.586\nBecause there are additional pages or\nscreens,\n\n232\n00:12:42.586 --> 00:12:46.030\nthat we will need to interact with and\ninput information.\n\n233\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.850\nSo she says, all right, let's dig in.\n\n234\n00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.228\nNow, throughout this process,\nI love when they say, just a moment.\n\n235\n00:12:52.228 --> 00:12:54.897\nBecause on that screen,\nit was just a moment.\n\n236\n00:12:54.897 --> 00:12:59.228\nBut on some of these screens that\nyou'll see, it's not just a moment.\n\n237\n00:12:59.228 --> 00:12:59.945\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n238\n00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.181\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So be ready for that one too.\n\n239\n00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:06.060\nNot this is where we'd already\nspecified our particular region, but\n\n240\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.975\nthey're wanting to verify this.\n\n241\n00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:10.818\nThis is why I said,\nthey're really pushing that, so\n\n242\n00:13:10.818 --> 00:13:14.181\nlet's verify that we are exactly here,\nin the United States.\n\n243\n00:13:14.181 --> 00:13:15.425\nIs that where we are, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; I believe\n\n244\n00:13:15.425 --> 00:13:15.928\nso.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n245\n00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:17.125\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n246\n00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:18.476\n&gt;&gt; So we'll hit Yes,\n\n247\n00:13:18.476 --> 00:13:21.013\nand this is actually the cool part.\n\n248\n00:13:21.013 --> 00:13:25.921\nIf you wanted to go ahead and respond\nverbally, you could also do that as well\n\n249\n00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:29.846\nand tell Cortana, yes, and\nwe'll just walk through this.\n\n250\n00:13:29.846 --> 00:13:32.061\nSo that was actually the first time,\n\n251\n00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:35.998\nwith Windows 10 here that we have\nthat option, at least for me.\n\n252\n00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:39.814\nI don't think any other operating systems\nutilize a virtual system at this time.\n\n253\n00:13:39.814 --> 00:13:43.962\nI could be wrong if there's some\nfringe OS, I'm not thinking about it,\n\n254\n00:13:43.962 --> 00:13:45.121\nit's pretty cool.\n\n255\n00:13:45.121 --> 00:13:48.960\nAll right, again, we're asking for\nregional settings here.\n\n256\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.647\nI do wanna have\nthe United States keyboard.\n\n257\n00:13:50.647 --> 00:13:52.959\nSo I'm going to hit Yes, or say yes.\n\n258\n00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:55.980\nAnd then if you wanted to add\nan additional or second keyboard,\n\n259\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.808\nyou do have that opportunity as well.\n\n260\n00:13:57.808 --> 00:14:00.357\nTo either add the layout, or\nthere's an option that says Skip.\n\n261\n00:14:00.357 --> 00:14:04.500\nSo we'll just hit Skip for now.\n\n262\n00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.825\nAnother, just a moment, we'll see if.\n\n263\n00:14:06.825 --> 00:14:11.596\n[LAUGH] All right, so it says,\nwe're connected, checking for any updates.\n\n264\n00:14:11.596 --> 00:14:13.387\nAgain, this is a big one,\n\n265\n00:14:13.387 --> 00:14:17.552\nyou'll see throughout this\nprocess checking for updates.\n\n266\n00:14:17.552 --> 00:14:19.739\nYeah, it is what it is, so.\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah,\n\n267\n00:14:19.739 --> 00:14:22.596\nit's got to be updated obviously,\nif we want the latest and\n\n268\n00:14:22.596 --> 00:14:25.530\ngreatest as far as security patches and\nthings like that go.\n\n269\n00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.968\nSo depending on when the ISO was created,\n\n270\n00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:30.614\nthere might be very few updates,\nor you might\n\n271\n00:14:30.614 --> 00:14:35.158\nhave a whole bunch of updates that need\nto be done to get that system up to date.\n\n272\n00:14:35.158 --> 00:14:39.038\nSo this might take a minute, might take\na few minutes, it really just depends.\n\n273\n00:14:39.038 --> 00:14:41.858\nAnd then also depends on your\nnetwork connectivity, right?\n\n274\n00:14:41.858 --> 00:14:44.642\nBecause you're gonna download\nthese from Microsoft, so\n\n275\n00:14:44.642 --> 00:14:48.404\nyour connection speed as well as, again,\nyour performance on your machine.\n\n276\n00:14:48.404 --> 00:14:51.221\nSo it is a go get a cup of coffee and\ncome back, and\n\n277\n00:14:51.221 --> 00:14:52.926\nshe should be ready.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike,\n\n278\n00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:53.885\nI think you're totally right.\n\n279\n00:14:53.885 --> 00:14:58.524\nLet's just do that, let's do another TV\ntimeout so you guys don't have to wait.\n\n280\n00:14:58.524 --> 00:15:00.926\nOkay, so here we have a login screen.\n\n281\n00:15:00.926 --> 00:15:04.947\nAnd really what they're trying to do is\nincorporate any kind of Microsoft account\n\n282\n00:15:04.947 --> 00:15:06.296\nthat you may already have.\n\n283\n00:15:06.296 --> 00:15:10.315\nSo it's asking to go ahead and\ninput an email address, or\n\n284\n00:15:10.315 --> 00:15:14.273\nif you have an account\nassociated with an Xbox account.\n\n285\n00:15:14.273 --> 00:15:18.210\nIt's not mandated or\nrequired, it is preferred.\n\n286\n00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.687\nYou'll see that they\nreally try to push that.\n\n287\n00:15:19.687 --> 00:15:24.561\nBut for right now, if you notice\nhere on the bottom left corner,\n\n288\n00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:26.826\nit says domain join instead.\n\n289\n00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:29.846\nSo if you are working in\na domain based environment and\n\n290\n00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:32.540\nyou wanna have those\nlocal credentials there.\n\n291\n00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:38.986\nYou can go ahead and set one up either\nwith domain or local admin users here.\n\n292\n00:15:38.986 --> 00:15:45.514\nNow, we're gonna go ahead and\nset this computer up for Barbara.\n\n293\n00:15:45.514 --> 00:15:47.100\nThis is Barbara Roberts,\n\n294\n00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.714\nthat's Barbie's full name.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n295\n00:15:49.714 --> 00:15:50.455\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n296\n00:15:50.455 --> 00:15:52.989\nYou're telling me that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] anyways, so\n\n297\n00:15:52.989 --> 00:15:53.883\nwe'll hit Next.\n\n298\n00:15:53.883 --> 00:15:58.051\nNow it says,\ncreate a super memorable password.\n\n299\n00:15:58.051 --> 00:16:01.499\nWe're just gonna use the generic one for\nnow.\n\n300\n00:16:01.499 --> 00:16:02.569\nAll right.\n\n301\n00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:06.004\nAnd you can see here,\neven when I hit tab, it kind of moved\n\n302\n00:16:06.004 --> 00:16:10.780\nme over to the left instead of moving me\nover to the right to continue, it says.\n\n303\n00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.170\nOr even better, use an online account.\n\n304\n00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.810\nThey're really trying to push that.\n\n305\n00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.919\nYou don't have to though,\nlet's just go ahead and hit next,\n\n306\n00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:24.340\nconfirm that password and\nwe'll check my typing skills here.\n\n307\n00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:28.530\nAnd if you forget your password,\nI'm just gonna put PW in here,\n\n308\n00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.820\nsomething generic for now.\n\n309\n00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.577\nBut it might be a good idea\nto go ahead and have that.\n\n310\n00:16:32.577 --> 00:16:38.015\nAnd the reason it is important if you're\nnot incorporating it to like a live\n\n311\n00:16:38.015 --> 00:16:44.080\naccount or something like that, is because\nit can't send you a reset option here.\n\n312\n00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:49.250\nSo just keep that in mind,\nmake sure you have that memorized.\n\n313\n00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.582\nWe'll hit Next.\n\n314\n00:16:50.582 --> 00:16:52.340\nAnd it'll take just a moment here, and\n\n315\n00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.510\nwe still have a couple more privacy\nsettings that we need to take a look at.\n\n316\n00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.050\nThey are introducing us to Cortana,\n\n317\n00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.590\nwhich is kinda funny because they\ndidn't introduce her before.\n\n318\n00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.290\nShe just kinda came and\nintroduced herself, right?\n\n319\n00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:08.604\nBut this is the page that allows\nyou to continue to use her.\n\n320\n00:17:08.604 --> 00:17:13.090\nOr if you want to go ahead and\ngive her, you know, the one two and\n\n321\n00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:15.627\nget out-\n&gt;&gt; The switch kick and all [LAUGH]-\n\n322\n00:17:15.627 --> 00:17:17.127\n&gt;&gt; So you have the option to go and\n\n323\n00:17:17.127 --> 00:17:19.440\nlearn more in the bottom left corner.\n\n324\n00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.770\nAnd then, on the right hand side over\nhere, you have the option to No,\n\n325\n00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:27.030\nwhich is continuing without her, Or\nto hit Yes, to continue with her.\n\n326\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.170\nSo we'll hit No for now.\n\n327\n00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:35.640\nAnd if we zoom in here, let me just,\nI'm gonna make it a little bit larger for\n\n328\n00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.580\nus to take a look at these options.\n\n329\n00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.380\nThese are our privacy settings for\nthis device.\n\n330\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.860\nAnd this is kind of a new one, too, Mike.\n\n331\n00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.080\nWe always didn't have this option and\n\n332\n00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.730\nI don't know how I feel about\nall of these settings here.\n\n333\n00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.370\nAnd you might have the same\nconcerns that I do and\n\n334\n00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.080\nyou're like, well,\nwhy do we need to share our location?\n\n335\n00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.280\nWell, they actually have reasons why and\nif you go ahead and\n\n336\n00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.570\nturn these off, Microsoft gives you\na message, reminding you like, hey,\n\n337\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.210\nif you disabled this particular option\nto let us know where you're located,\n\n338\n00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:14.420\nthings like certain Windows applications\ncan't find your location to provide you\n\n339\n00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.910\nweather, directions.\n\n340\n00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:20.020\nAnd here's a big one for me, I don't know\nif you're like me at all, I lose things,\n\n341\n00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:24.370\nkeys, phones, tablets, etc., mind.\n\n342\n00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.230\nYou can hit Find My Device.\n\n343\n00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:30.800\nSo there's kind of,\nyou have to look at your options and\n\n344\n00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.840\nweigh them out here if you\nwanna go ahead and enable that.\n\n345\n00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.120\nAnd most likely, so on the personal use\nof things that's totally up to you,\n\n346\n00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.180\nbut in a work environment, then you'll\nalready have, should already have\n\n347\n00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.240\na security policy that establishes this\nand leaves the guesswork out of it.\n\n348\n00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.300\nHere is one, Diagnostics.\n\n349\n00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:54.300\nSo if you wanna go ahead and allow that\ncommunication to send your any kind\n\n350\n00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.710\nof log, error, any kind of report\nthat may be generated on this system,\n\n351\n00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.510\nsend them back to Microsoft so that\ntheir developers and troubleshoot staff,\n\n352\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.060\nlike they can sort through all of this and\nthen make the system better for you.\n\n353\n00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.590\nHere's an interesting one, Relevant Ads.\n\n354\n00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.050\nDid you ever think there would be a day\nwhere you had an option about ads during\n\n355\n00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.860\nan installation process?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n356\n00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.760\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; Anyways.\n\n357\n00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.025\n&gt;&gt; But it turns out, it's, well,\n\n358\n00:19:19.025 --> 00:19:22.075\nI'm trying to think of\na good way to say this.\n\n359\n00:19:22.075 --> 00:19:26.025\nBut the start menu has almost become a\nlittle advertisement board for Microsoft.\n\n360\n00:19:26.025 --> 00:19:27.425\nYou will see-\n&gt;&gt; And they say that.\n\n361\n00:19:27.425 --> 00:19:31.575\nThere are gonna be ads regardless,\nit says that right here.\n\n362\n00:19:31.575 --> 00:19:35.915\nLet apps use advertising ID to make ads\nmore interesting to you based on your\n\n363\n00:19:35.915 --> 00:19:36.585\napp usage.\n\n364\n00:19:36.585 --> 00:19:39.982\nIf I go ahead to turn this off and let's\nsay I don't I want it, and it say here,\n\n365\n00:19:39.982 --> 00:19:43.250\nlook Cherokee, you're not gonna reduce\nthe number of ads that you see.\n\n366\n00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.980\nIt's just that they're probably\nnot gonna be relevant to you.\n\n367\n00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.860\nSo, that's-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n368\n00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.070\nwhat if what this is really telling you,\nyou have to read between the lines.\n\n369\n00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.260\nAnd they're saying, hey, do you want\nus to track what you're doing so\n\n370\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.980\nthat we can give you ads\nthat are related to that?\n\n371\n00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.900\nIf you went to Office.com, or\nofficedepot.com, or some big box store's\n\n372\n00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:06.030\nwebsite and look at filing cabinet, do\nyou want ads related to filing cabinets?\n\n373\n00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.860\nOr do you want ads related to.\n&gt;&gt; Shoes.\n\n374\n00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.056\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Shoes, or something like that.\n\n375\n00:20:11.056 --> 00:20:12.918\nSo you're still gonna get the ads.\n\n376\n00:20:12.918 --> 00:20:16.184\nIt's whether or\nnot we know what you like and we can give\n\n377\n00:20:16.184 --> 00:20:19.780\nyou ads that you might find more useful.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so I don't know how you feel\n\n378\n00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.070\nabout that by the way.\n&gt;&gt; Which means we now have to track you.\n\n379\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.220\nWe have to know what you like if I'm\ngonna how you ads that are relevant.\n\n380\n00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.810\nSo I look at that as,\n\n381\n00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:31.160\nhow much do you want me to see about what\nyou do on your machine on a daily basis.\n\n382\n00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.160\nSo I'm all about turning\nthat one off myself.\n\n383\n00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.880\nCuz you're not gonna reduce,\nyou're still as you said,\n\n384\n00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.330\nyou're still gonna get\nthe same number of ads.\n\n385\n00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.625\nAnd I don't need them to be relevant\nbecause I'm gonna ignore them either way.\n\n386\n00:20:41.625 --> 00:20:43.520\n[LAUGH] But\nthat's just my two cents on ads.\n\n387\n00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.118\n&gt;&gt; And it's definitely worth mentioning,\n\n388\n00:20:46.118 --> 00:20:50.600\nbecause this is kind of, it is\na newer thing that we're seeing here.\n\n389\n00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:55.470\nSo we just have some additional\ntailored experiences,\n\n390\n00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:56.222\nlike you were saying.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n391\n00:20:56.222 --> 00:20:56.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So that's how they\n\n392\n00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.140\nwanna go ahead and spin that one.\n\n393\n00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.000\nEnabling speech recognition and\nso forth there.\n\n394\n00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.910\nAnd so\nI encourage you just to go ahead and\n\n395\n00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:09.280\nspend some time looking at that and\nthen letting you decide, you know.\n\n396\n00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:14.000\nSo we'll go ahead and hit Accept\nif I can get my cursor down there.\n\n397\n00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:22.600\nAnd this portion right here there's just,\nagain, another exploratory process.\n\n398\n00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.880\nIt says this is the last step.\n\n399\n00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.750\nWe need to get a few more\nthings polished for you.\n\n400\n00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.300\nIt may take a few moments.\n\n401\n00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.870\nAnd this is really about,\nMike, I think the last thing\n\n402\n00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:35.310\nthat they will prompt us for is going\nto be when we go ahead and log in.\n\n403\n00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:39.390\nAnd the first time you log in it may\ntake a few minutes, but they'll ask\n\n404\n00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:43.670\nabout network settings like, do you want\nother computers to be able to find you?\n\n405\n00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.530\nIs this a private network?\n\n406\n00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:46.330\nThings like that.\n\n407\n00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.040\nBut it may take a few minutes.\n\n408\n00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.040\nI don't know if it's worth waiting for\n\n409\n00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.080\nall of this just to show you that\nparticular screen because really,\n\n410\n00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.790\nthat's about it here.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n411\n00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.250\nSo we got Windows installed.\n&gt;&gt; Windows is installed,\n\n412\n00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.950\nMike.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n413\n00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.318\nWell, great demonstration there.\n\n414\n00:22:02.318 --> 00:22:06.390\nReally good at from beginning to end\non getting that Windows 10 installed on\n\n415\n00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.920\nour machines.\n\n416\n00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.240\nWe thank you for that.\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n417\n00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.370\n&gt;&gt; We hope everybody out there enjoyed\n\n418\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.340\nwatching this one.\n\n419\n00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.260\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n420\n00:22:13.260 -->

00:00:12.259\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n4\n00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.170\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.430\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.580\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n7\n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.400\nIn this episode, we're doing a part\nthree to installing Windows.\n\n8\n00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.500\nSo if you missed the first two,\nmake sure you go back and check those out.\n\n9\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.250\nBut continuing in the install process\nwith us today is Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.900\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Mike, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.810\n&gt;&gt; Good, how are you doing?\n\n12\n00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.170\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n13\n00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.980\nWe talked about how to\ncreate installation media.\n\n14\n00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.300\nIn the last show, we installed a fresh or\nclean installation.\n\n15\n00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.980\nSo today in this show we're gonna be\ntaking a look at, well, how to upgrade.\n\n16\n00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.330\nSo there are a lot of different situations\n\n17\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.960\nwhere this would be a viable option for\nyou.\n\n18\n00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.890\nMaybe you have an older operating system,\nlike Windows 7,\n\n19\n00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.720\nWindows 8.1, something like that.\n\n20\n00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.070\nAnd you're trying to\nupgrade to Windows 10.\n\n21\n00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.740\nThere are also situations\nwhere Windows 10,\n\n22\n00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.420\nnow Windows being software as a service or\nWindows as a service.\n\n23\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.380\nYou have updates instead of they said,\nI remember when Microsoft\n\n24\n00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.000\nfirst announces Windows 10 is going\nto be our last operating system,\n\n25\n00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.990\nand I thought that is insanity.\n\n26\n00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.564\nBut, they've stayed true to that, so\n\n27\n00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:22.918\nwhat they're doing now is\npushing those updates,\n\n28\n00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:28.080\nthose changes out through updates instead\nof having newer versions of the OS.\n\n29\n00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.170\nSo, we'll also take a look and\n\n30\n00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.000\nI'll show you links where you can get\ninformation to learn more about your\n\n31\n00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.820\nspecific situation because you are going\nto need to do some planning and research.\n\n32\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.100\nA lot of different\nsituations are different.\n\n33\n00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.010\nThere are a lot of different variables\nhere, so we'll take a look at some\n\n34\n00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.880\nof the most common, and\nwhere you can get that information.\n\n35\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.540\nSo on my screen here,\nI have something called upgrade paths.\n\n36\n00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.840\nThis is super helpful when you're trying\nto determine if, well, number one,\n\n37\n00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.250\nif your system, your current system,\ncan even support an upgrade.\n\n38\n00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.380\nAnd if it doesn't,\nthen that may be where you decide,\n\n39\n00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.250\nokay, this is where I need to\nperform a clean installation.\n\n40\n00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.720\nSo what would be the benefits?\n\n41\n00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.212\nWhy would someone choose and\nupgrade over a clean installation?\n\n42\n00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:15.317\nWe've already looked at it, it was\npretty simple, pretty straightforward.\n\n43\n00:02:15.317 --> 00:02:19.701\nWell, we're formatting that hard disk\nthere, so we're getting rid all of that\n\n44\n00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:23.760\ninformation, the data,\nthe user settings, and things like that.\n\n45\n00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.710\nSo, with upgrades, it is supposed\nto retain all of that information,\n\n46\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.570\nso I would always recommend doing a backup\n\n47\n00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.993\nbefore you get started\nwith this process always.\n\n48\n00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:40.036\nBut the other is they're saying,\n\n49\n00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:42.950\nlook, we're gonna retain\nthat information for you.\n\n50\n00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.140\nThere are exceptions as to when certain\ninformation will not be retained.\n\n51\n00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.160\nSo we'll take a look at those, but\n\n52\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.760\nagain, you always need to\nresearch your exact situation and\n\n53\n00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.890\nupgrade path prior to execution.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n54\n00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.255\nthere's definitely times where you might\nhave certain software installed or\n\n55\n00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:04.440\nyou've got a lot of data on there\nthat you don't want to try to remove.\n\n56\n00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.805\nAn upgrade is nice because it\ndoes leave all of that in place.\n\n57\n00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:13.130\nYou're just basically swapping out the\noperating system files, so theoretically\n\n58\n00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.195\nyou can be up and running a lot faster.\n&gt;&gt; Well, right Mike.\n\n59\n00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:17.915\nApplications are a great example of that.\n\n60\n00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:21.295\nAnd we've talked about looking at\ndifferent types of tools that Microsoft\n\n61\n00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:24.985\ndoes provide us, to check to make sure\nthat those applications are ready to go.\n\n62\n00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:28.080\nBecause not all applications\nare going to be compatible.\n\n63\n00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.940\nAnd you have to, they may retain those\napplication settings, but you may need to\n\n64\n00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.810\ngo ahead and reinstall the application, or\nget a newer version of the application.\n\n65\n00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.330\nSo just be cognizant of that and\nI think you'll be good to go here.\n\n66\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.180\nBut understanding what an upgrade path is,\nis really important.\n\n67\n00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.376\nLuckily, Microsoft outlines\nall of this for us,\n\n68\n00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:50.973\nI do want to point something out though.\n\n69\n00:03:50.973 --> 00:03:56.200\nRight here, oops not there,\nwhere it says Windows\n\n70\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.927\n10 LTSC/LTSB,\nthere are some naming changes here.\n\n71\n00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:07.764\nSo, LTSC, long-term service\nchannel versus service branch,\n\n72\n00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:10.650\njust be familiar with that.\n\n73\n00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.460\nIt's a variation of the operating system\nthat doesn't receive updates as often as\n\n74\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.730\nother versions of\nthe operating system will.\n\n75\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.210\nIt's usually used in embedded systems.\n\n76\n00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.957\nLike maybe you have\na manufacturing company and\n\n77\n00:04:23.957 --> 00:04:28.150\nit's embedded into a machine\nthat's on the manufacturing floor.\n\n78\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.070\nSo, there will be some exclusions for\nthat type of installation there.\n\n79\n00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.700\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n80\n00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.470\nAnd if you do see documentation\nwithout name, without acronym changes,\n\n81\n00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.510\nit's just because they changed\nthe acronym or name a long the way.\n\n82\n00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.550\nAnd I don't want that to confuse you.\n\n83\n00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.910\nThere are different types here for\nthe Windows N and KN based on regions.\n\n84\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.080\nBut, if you're working\nin the United States,\n\n85\n00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.270\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n86\n00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.940\nIf you aren't, you need to research\nthat a little more, as well.\n\n87\n00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.780\nNow, looking at this chart here,\n\n88\n00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.670\nI have a check that means\nan upgrade is possible.\n\n89\n00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.220\nAnd so on the left side,\nso the vertical axis here,\n\n90\n00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.030\nwe're gonna look at the current state,\nso that's your current operating system.\n\n91\n00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.800\nOn the top and on your y-axis,\nyou see where you want to go, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.800\nSo that's your final destination,\nyour desired destination.\n\n93\n00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.050\nSo, D is going to be representing\nan addition downgrade.\n\n94\n00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.740\nAnd you might think, well,\nwhy would anyone ever want to do that?\n\n95\n00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.550\nBut, honestly, it happens and\n\n96\n00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.350\nespecially in business environments,\nif I'm looking at a licensing issue.\n\n97\n00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.410\nBecause you do have to pay for\n\n98\n00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.680\nthe use of these operating systems, maybe\nit's just not cost beneficial to you.\n\n99\n00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.090\nMaybe I find a particular user is not\n\n100\n00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.320\nfully utilizing an operating system to\nits fullest capability and I'm paying for\n\n101\n00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.330\nthese additional features and\ncapabilities.\n\n102\n00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.470\nSo let's go ahead and downgrade them and\n\n103\n00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.480\nmaybe give that operating system to\nsomeone who would fully utilize it.\n\n104\n00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.230\nSo, just things like that\nto keep in mind as well.\n\n105\n00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.100\nWhat we're gonna do as a demonstration\nin this show is take a look\n\n106\n00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.750\nat a Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n107\n00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.700\nAnd I think that one's\ngoing to be an 8.1 Pro.\n\n108\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.700\nSo if we look at this professional\nrow right here, we can see,\n\n109\n00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.360\nlooking at the check boxes or\n\n110\n00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.920\nthe checkmarks, which operating\nsystems we can actually upgrade to.\n\n111\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.150\nSo I wanna go ahead and I think,\nI can't remember if I have my Pro or\n\n112\n00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.930\nEnterprise on my bootable USB drive here.\n\n113\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.440\nSo if we look at Windows 10 Pro, and we\nwill look at both of them for Windows 10\n\n114\n00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.490\nEnterprise in these two columns, so\nin the second column and what is this?\n\n115\n00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.090\nThree, four, five.\n\n116\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:53.080\nSo, looking at those we'll see if we can\nactually perform this particular upgrade.\n\n117\n00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.150\nSo here one, two, three, four, five, so I\ngot a checkbox or checkmark here and here.\n\n118\n00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.474\nSo, regardless whichever one I did throw\non that USB drive, we're good to go and\n\n119\n00:07:03.474 --> 00:07:05.073\nwe can perform this upgrade.\n\n120\n00:07:06.842 --> 00:07:10.200\nThere are additional considerations\nto think about here.\n\n121\n00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.562\nSo, Microsoft just wants\nyou to be aware of those.\n\n122\n00:07:14.562 --> 00:07:17.473\nLike I said,\nthis requires a lot of planning here.\n\n123\n00:07:17.473 --> 00:07:21.485\nSo, let me see, I'm trying to think.\n\n124\n00:07:21.485 --> 00:07:25.600\nApplication compatibility toolkit.\n\n125\n00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.450\nLike we were talking about, Mike and I\nbefore just to make sure everything would\n\n126\n00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.850\nbe copacetic when you\ndo perform the upgrade.\n\n127\n00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:39.220\nNow, I will say this, this article\nwas written in November of 2017 here.\n\n128\n00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:47.570\nThe migrate with Windows Easy Transfer\nUtility is not available with Windows 10.\n\n129\n00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.364\nSo, in previous versions of Windows\nyou do have that option but\n\n130\n00:07:51.364 --> 00:07:54.022\nyou don't see that here with Windows 10.\n\n131\n00:07:54.022 --> 00:07:59.008\nAnd just know that that term\nmigrate means you're migrating,\n\n132\n00:07:59.008 --> 00:08:05.422\nyou're moving from one Previous version or\none system to another system there.\n\n133\n00:08:05.422 --> 00:08:08.534\nYou do have another option and\n\n134\n00:08:08.534 --> 00:08:14.290\nlet me see if I can zoom in so\nyou guys can see these here.\n\n135\n00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.937\nUSMT, User State Migration Tool,\nthis is gonna be an automation tool\n\n136\n00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:23.763\nto help assist migrations typically,\nused during large deployments.\n\n137\n00:08:23.763 --> 00:08:28.360\nAnd they use these XML files to go\nahead and setup configuration settings.\n\n138\n00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.760\nSo, for personal use this\nwould not be the best option,\n\n139\n00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.380\nwe're really looking at those\nlarger deployments there.\n\n140\n00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.700\nLet me see, any other considerations\nI'm forgetting about here?\n\n141\n00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.580\nI have this link in the show notes so\n\n142\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.280\nthis will help you through your research\nprocess before you get started.\n\n143\n00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.300\nThere are just some very fringe type\nissues as well if you're gonna be using\n\n144\n00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.860\nerror handling there is\na script that you have to run.\n\n145\n00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.650\nBut I really wouldn't work about that\nunless you know about pre existing\n\n146\n00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.190\nrequirements for your organization there.\n\n147\n00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.580\nNow, with the advent of\nWindows as a service,\n\n148\n00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.360\nhere you see the Windows\n10 Edition upgrades.\n\n149\n00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.440\nSo this is just kind of,\nI guess, more recent in time.\n\n150\n00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.950\nSo you're not going back to previous\nversions of your operating systems but\n\n151\n00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:24.310\nthey're looking at really,\nwith the choose your own device.\n\n152\n00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:31.170\nSo what kind of installation would be\nbest for the type of device that I have?\n\n153\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.540\nSo that's why I really like this chart.\n\n154\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.560\nI would definitely encourage you to take a\nlook at this, because if you are studying\n\n155\n00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.730\nfor the exam, some things you would want\nto know would be, okay, what are some\n\n156\n00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:47.470\noptions that I have for deployment,\nor for this installation, or upgrade?\n\n157\n00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:52.633\nAnd you can see that being denoted here\nwith the checks and the Xs as well.\n\n158\n00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:55.185\nAnd I won't go into extreme\ndetail into all of these.\n\n159\n00:09:55.185 --> 00:10:00.467\nBut I do want to scroll down and show you\nthat they do provide good documentation\n\n160\n00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:05.430\nto help guide you through this process and\ngive you some best practices for\n\n161\n00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.031\nusing things like MDM,\nmobile device management for\n\n162\n00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:13.940\nthose mobile device deployments or\nutilizing a provisioning package.\n\n163\n00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.546\nSo this is something that we do\nagainst the enlarger enterprises.\n\n164\n00:10:17.546 --> 00:10:21.910\nThey use the .ppkg file extension for\n\n165\n00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:26.900\nprovisioning packages to really customize\nenvironments for your end users.\n\n166\n00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.910\nSo just, I wouldn't worry about knowing\nevery single step to walk through these,\n\n167\n00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.590\nbut just understanding\nwhy I would use them and\n\n168\n00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.800\nin what particular situation\nthere using a command line tool\n\n169\n00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.850\nas well as upgrade by manually\nentering a product key.\n\n170\n00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.950\nThe option that I choose for us today is\ngoing to be using the media creation tool\n\n171\n00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.630\nand I have an external USB drive here.\n\n172\n00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.180\nSo let me just go ahead and\npull that machine up.\n\n173\n00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.188\nThis is going to be my Windows\n8.1 Pro that you see here.\n\n174\n00:10:58.188 --> 00:10:59.740\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n175\n00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.910\nIt's not the prettiest but [LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.680\n&gt;&gt; It is recognizable so\n\n177\n00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.650\nthat what we're working with here.\n\n178\n00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:11.610\nAnd what I also wanted to do is\nshow you a particular file here.\n\n179\n00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.750\nI just created something,\nwhere did I put it, under My Documents.\n\n180\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:20.737\nBecause normally, this is where people\nare going to have information and if I,\n\n181\n00:11:23.175 --> 00:11:28.370\nOkay you can see that it's a little zoomed\nin crazily, but it says existing doc.\n\n182\n00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.100\nSo I just wanted to kinda replicate\n\n183\n00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.050\nwhat should happen here when\neverything is all said and done.\n\n184\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.284\nThat file should be remaining there,\nbecause that's the whole purpose of an in\n\n185\n00:11:38.284 --> 00:11:42.391\nplace upgrade, to retain those user\nsettings as well as our documents here,\n\n186\n00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:50.661\nfiles.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n187\n00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:53.313\nit's nice not having to\nback up all of your,\n\n188\n00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:55.690\nyou still should back up all your data.\n\n189\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.180\nLet me not say it that way.\n\n190\n00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.200\nIf you're doing an upgrade, you wanna back\nup your data in case something goes wrong.\n\n191\n00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.920\nBut it is nice to where when I finish that\nupgrade process, now my new operating\n\n192\n00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.200\nsystem, I can click on My Documents,\neverything is still there you know it.\n\n193\n00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.070\nAs an end user,\nthat's a very stressful time.\n\n194\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.380\nThey are supposed to be coming\ninto the work, doing their job,\n\n195\n00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:20.240\nto make the company money, that's gotta\nbe sales, marketing, HR whatever, not IT.\n\n196\n00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.220\nSo that upgrade time, when we are telling\nhim, hey, when you are come in Monday,\n\n197\n00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.080\nyou're gonna be running Windows 10,\nvery stressful.\n\n198\n00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.040\nIf they can open up their My Documents and\n\n199\n00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.740\neverything's still there,\nmuch easier on them.\n\n200\n00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.200\nIf they can open up their browser,\n\n201\n00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.290\nall their favorites are still there,\nmuch less stress on them.\n\n202\n00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.700\nAnd that's really what we're trying to\ndo is eliminate some of that stress and\n\n203\n00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.340\nthat anxiousness when we\ndo those kind of upgrades.\n\n204\n00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.570\nKeep our team productive.\n\n205\n00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.755\n&gt;&gt; Woosah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n206\n00:12:47.755 --> 00:12:50.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so,\n\n207\n00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.070\nhere I have that USB drive\nthat I have plugged in.\n\n208\n00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.958\nI'm just gonna go ahead and open that and\nthen double click on the setup,\n\n209\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.136\nto go ahead and kickstart this upgrade.\n\n210\n00:13:02.886 --> 00:13:08.140\nI get my UAC just to verify that I do\nwant to perform these changes here.\n\n211\n00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.892\nSo I can just go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n212\n00:13:12.481 --> 00:13:13.890\nGive it a second.\n\n213\n00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.690\nMy USB drive is just\nblinking to go ahead and\n\n214\n00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.650\nlet me know that it is\nlooking at these files.\n\n215\n00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.990\nIt will take a minute here just\nto go ahead and pull them all in.\n\n216\n00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.110\nBut again,\nlike we saw with our clean install,\n\n217\n00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.760\nit does take a little bit of set up.\n\n218\n00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.680\nActually you have some set\nup here that we didn't\n\n219\n00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.700\nhave with the clean installation because\nit has to check system requirements and\n\n220\n00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.670\nreally prepare the OS for\nthis upgrade, so it's a little bit.\n\n221\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.760\nYou see it right here, it says preparing.\n\n222\n00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.910\nSo this is gonna be a step.\n\n223\n00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.372\nIt's kind of moving along quickly here.\n\n224\n00:13:46.372 --> 00:13:50.930\nI was thinking about doing a TV\ntimeout but I think we will be okay.\n\n225\n00:13:54.592 --> 00:13:56.330\nAll right, it didn't too long there.\n\n226\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:01.180\nNow, I'm not gonna go ahead and\ntry to obtain my updates right now,\n\n227\n00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.410\nit will take some time.\n\n228\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:06.540\nHere it says, do you want to go ahead and\ndownload and install the updates now,\n\n229\n00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.040\nwhich is recommended.\n\n230\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.719\nBut I'm just gonna go ahead and\nsay not right now.\n\n231\n00:14:13.104 --> 00:14:14.786\nIf I can get my cursor, there it is,\n\n232\n00:14:14.786 --> 00:14:20.130\nall right.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely a good idea, right?\n\n233\n00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.950\nThis is a demonstration.\n\n234\n00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.930\nSo we're not gonna do the updates for\ntime consideration.\n\n235\n00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.810\nBut as a end user or something, you will\n\n236\n00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.073\ndefinitely wanna get your updates.\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n237\n00:14:30.073 --> 00:14:31.559\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] the latest and greatest..\n\n238\n00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:32.215\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\n\n239\n00:14:32.215 --> 00:14:34.070\nit's gonna take a few minutes here.\n\n240\n00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.090\nI think we'll go ahead and\ndo that TV timeout I was talking about.\n\n241\n00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.570\nThis would be more appropriate place,\n\n242\n00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:42.970\nthat we'll just come back whenever we're\nfinished with this particular screen.\n\n243\n00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:47.550\nOkay, so here we have a page where\nit's asked me about a product key.\n\n244\n00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.790\nWhich is important to know about and\nunderstand.\n\n245\n00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.210\nProduct key is going to\nbe your licencing key\n\n246\n00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:59.230\nthat verifies to Microsoft that you have\nin fact purchased this Operating System.\n\n247\n00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.760\nIn the last show,\nit didn't ask me to enter a product key\n\n248\n00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.190\nwhen we were performing\nour clean installation.\n\n249\n00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:11.120\nI did download that ISO from their trial\nversion, so that step was omitted.\n\n250\n00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.420\nThis version, again,\nthis is not a paid product right now,\n\n251\n00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.580\nI just downloaded from their site as well.\n\n252\n00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.150\nBut Microsoft does provide\nsomething called KMS keys.\n\n253\n00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.950\nAnd let me just show you\nwhere I can find those.\n\n254\n00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:26.460\nI did put them in the show notes for you.\n\n255\n00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:33.120\nNow this is a temporary, it's really meant\nto be used for evaluation purposes here.\n\n256\n00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.890\nAnd so you have some temporary keys\nthat we can use for this demonstration.\n\n257\n00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:38.780\nNow the key,\n\n258\n00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.950\nthe key [LAUGH] is which version did\nI install on my USB thumb drive.\n\n259\n00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.780\nI'm not really too sure about that.\n\n260\n00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.812\nI think I just grabbed my Windows 10 Pro,\nso let's do that.\n\n261\n00:15:49.812 --> 00:15:53.998\nAnd I'm just gonna copy and paste here and\nput that into our product line.\n\n262\n00:15:57.845 --> 00:16:01.005\nIf I can get my little cursor down there,\nthere we go.\n\n263\n00:16:01.005 --> 00:16:02.646\nAnd we'll hit Next.\n\n264\n00:16:07.546 --> 00:16:12.374\nAll right, we're getting a notice of\nour notices and license terms here, so\n\n265\n00:16:12.374 --> 00:16:14.914\nwe're just going to Accept or Decline.\n\n266\n00:16:14.914 --> 00:16:21.270\nIn order to continue with this upgrade,\nyou have to Accept, so that's we'll do.\n\n267\n00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.300\nNow, this is kind of interesting here.\n\n268\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:29.463\nFor this particular page,\nno [LAUGH] it went right past that.\n\n269\n00:16:29.463 --> 00:16:33.880\nYou might have seen that real quick and\nasked what do you want to keep?\n\n270\n00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.780\nThat was super fast and\nI didn't get an option there.\n\n271\n00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:45.550\nI'm thinking it's because,\nI don't know why it went so fast there.\n\n272\n00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:51.460\nI'm upgrading here from Windows\n8.1 Pro to Windows 10 Pro,\n\n273\n00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.285\nlet me just give you a heads up.\n\n274\n00:16:54.285 --> 00:16:59.235\nSo, if you are changing the edition,\nso maybe if I wanted to\n\n275\n00:16:59.235 --> 00:17:04.315\nchange to Windows 10 Home or some\nedition like that, an edition variation.\n\n276\n00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.270\nYou are limited as to\nexactly what you can keep,\n\n277\n00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:13.140\nso just keep that in mind,\nyou don't have a full range.\n\n278\n00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.410\nSo here, I'm assuming that, since it\ndidn't even give me a second to respond,\n\n279\n00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.980\nusually it will ask you\nwhat you wanna keep.\n\n280\n00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.110\nIf you wanna keep all files,\nor applications and\n\n281\n00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.680\nalso applications, files, and settings.\n\n282\n00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.550\nSo just be aware of that and I'm assuming\nit's going to let me keep everything\n\n283\n00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.480\nbecause it went so fast there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.160\n&gt;&gt; So that's the end goal.\n\n285\n00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.040\nSo it's just making sure that\nwe are ready to install.\n\n286\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.310\nNow this process does take quite a while,\nI've had it take, and\n\n287\n00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.730\nagain, like Mike said,\ndepending on your hardware,\n\n288\n00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.130\nthat will influence this length duration,\nas well.\n\n289\n00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.430\nBut I think, for now, we can go ahead and\ndo another TV timeout so\n\n290\n00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.470\nyou don't have to sit here and watch that.\n\n291\n00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.475\nAll right, and\nwe're back with that screen.\n\n292\n00:17:54.475 --> 00:17:56.509\nIt's kind of funny, during the TV timeout,\n\n293\n00:17:56.509 --> 00:17:59.400\nwe were chatting with some\npeople here in ITProTV.\n\n294\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.979\nAnd because this is an iterative process,\nnow Windows constantly changing their\n\n295\n00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:08.637\nupgrade and installation methods, it may\nbe a little slightly different for you.\n\n296\n00:18:08.637 --> 00:18:12.578\nBecause depending on, like I said,\nthose preexisting variables like what\n\n297\n00:18:12.578 --> 00:18:16.290\nenvironment you are moving from,\nit might be slightly different.\n\n298\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.746\nLike i said additions and\n\n299\n00:18:17.746 --> 00:18:21.905\nif you're moving from Windows 10\nto a newer version of Windows 10,\n\n300\n00:18:21.905 --> 00:18:25.880\nyou might have a little flexibility\nwith exactly what you can keep.\n\n301\n00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.862\nBut I wanted to show you this screen\nbecause It says that we are now ready to\n\n302\n00:18:29.862 --> 00:18:30.460\ninstall.\n\n303\n00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.160\nSo the system has been prepped and\n\n304\n00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.440\nwe're about to really begin\nthat installation process.\n\n305\n00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.260\nBut there is a hyperlink here, or\na clickable link I should say.\n\n306\n00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.946\nWhere it says Change what to keep, so you\nguys saw how I went really fast to that\n\n307\n00:18:42.946 --> 00:18:46.381\npage where it gave me the option,\nit really didn't give me the option.\n\n308\n00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:51.378\nBut It looks like here, look let's\ntest this out here before we proceed\n\n309\n00:18:51.378 --> 00:18:56.059\nif we want to go back and really\nchange what we can keep like it says.\n\n310\n00:18:58.576 --> 00:19:03.812\nI'll zoom out a little bit so\nwe can navigate here.\n\n311\n00:19:05.949 --> 00:19:08.271\nI'll go ahead and click on that.\n\n312\n00:19:08.271 --> 00:19:12.522\nIt looks like a fail, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n313\n00:19:12.522 --> 00:19:15.047\n&gt;&gt; So okay, okay, there it goes.\n\n314\n00:19:15.047 --> 00:19:17.238\nIt wasn't a fail,\nit was me failing, not the thing,\n\n315\n00:19:17.238 --> 00:19:18.640\nthat's what happened.\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n316\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is what I wanted to show\n\n317\n00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.930\nyou guys, and I do need to zoom in\na little bit so you can see that.\n\n318\n00:19:28.377 --> 00:19:32.160\nChoose what to keep, so these\nare the options that I was talking about.\n\n319\n00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.070\nSo I do have the ability,\nit just didn't give me that\n\n320\n00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.020\nin line ability I had to kind of\nmanually go back and check it.\n\n321\n00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.720\nThis is what it says,\nKeep your personal files and apps so\n\n322\n00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.667\nyou'll be able to manage your\nWindows settings afterwards.\n\n323\n00:19:43.667 --> 00:19:47.690\nAnd here you can Keep personal\nfiles only or nothing.\n\n324\n00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:52.160\nWhich, why, I don't know but\nyou have the option to do that.\n\n325\n00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.842\nI don't know why you'd want\nto keep nothing, but still,\n\n326\n00:19:54.842 --> 00:19:56.280\nthere may be some situations.\n\n327\n00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.480\nWe're gonna hit Next, I like keeping\nmy personal files and applications,\n\n328\n00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.900\nthat's why I wanted to\ndo the upgrade here.\n\n329\n00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.110\nSo let's hit Next.\n\n330\n00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.190\nAnd it's just making sure, they're really,\n\n331\n00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.700\nreally making sure everything's\nready to install here.\n\n332\n00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.170\nThey went through that process, but\nagain, this is a good point, actually.\n\n333\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.200\nSo making sure your PC has enough space.\n\n334\n00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:23.050\nSo looking at any subsequent or new\noperating systems, the sizes may change,\n\n335\n00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.530\nwe don't know what Microsoft is\ngoing to be doing in the future.\n\n336\n00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.660\nSo examining what your current system has,\nhow many files you have,\n\n337\n00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.100\nmaking sure that you have free space\non your hard drive to accommodate\n\n338\n00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.046\nthat new OS,\nis going to be essential as well.\n\n339\n00:20:36.046 --> 00:20:40.970\nSo they're just checking, the wizard here\nis checking to make sure that my my PC can\n\n340\n00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:48.417\nactually handle this upgrade.\n&gt;&gt; Good question in the chat\n\n341\n00:20:48.417 --> 00:20:51.950\nroom there about the different upgrade\npaths that we talked about earlier.\n\n342\n00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.580\nYou showed that upgrade matrix on\nWindows 10 from Microsoft's site, so\n\n343\n00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.060\ndefinitely something worth looking at.\n\n344\n00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.488\nTypically I was with,\nI think it was Jim in our chatroom,\n\n345\n00:21:01.488 --> 00:21:03.623\ntalking about going from Home to Pro.\n\n346\n00:21:03.623 --> 00:21:07.918\nAnd way back in Windows 7 you\ncouldn't because you'd be getting\n\n347\n00:21:07.918 --> 00:21:11.833\nfeatures that you didn't have,\nthat you didn't pay for.\n\n348\n00:21:11.833 --> 00:21:15.028\nBut when you look at\nthe Windows 10 upgrade matrix,\n\n349\n00:21:15.028 --> 00:21:17.665\nas I think Mike Stephens said,\nit is a maze.\n\n350\n00:21:17.665 --> 00:21:22.203\nAnd there are some options for\ngoing from Windows 7 Home Basic to\n\n351\n00:21:22.203 --> 00:21:27.500\nWindows 10 Pro Education, for\nexample, is going to be allowed.\n\n352\n00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.340\nSo there's some really weird ones and it's\nvery case specific, something that you'd\n\n353\n00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.120\nhad to research for sure.\n&gt;&gt; And now, for\n\n354\n00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.828\nsure and that's the big key.\n\n355\n00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:41.070\nIs with any kind of IT project, you always\nwant to look at your environment and\n\n356\n00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.690\nplan accordingly, so it's specific to you.\n\n357\n00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:48.260\nBut the good thing is that Microsoft does\nprovide that matrix so that you can look\n\n358\n00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.340\nat those different charts and\nget additional documentation if need be.\n\n359\n00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.950\nWhile Mike explaining that,\n\n360\n00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:57.640\nI did just hit the kick start\nthis installation process here.\n\n361\n00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.550\nNow, a lot of this moving forward will\nlook similar to what you've seen in that\n\n362\n00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:03.740\nclean installation already.\n\n363\n00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:07.770\nSo after, your PC will check for\n\n364\n00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:12.080\nupdates, it'll reboot a few times, so\nwe really don't need to see all of that.\n\n365\n00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:17.600\nEssentially what will happen is, you will\nbe prompted for your regional settings\n\n366\n00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.850\nlike we saw in the clean installation, as\nwell as inputting your Microsoft account.\n\n367\n00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.315\nAnd we talked about that too, you don't\nhave to have a Microsoft account but\n\n368\n00:22:26.315 --> 00:22:29.417\nthat's really the way that they're\npushing that, and what else?\n\n369\n00:22:29.417 --> 00:22:32.537\nI did want to go ahead,\nwe will do one more TV time out, and\n\n370\n00:22:32.537 --> 00:22:36.047\nI'll show you the final product,\nbecause I do want to verify and\n\n371\n00:22:36.047 --> 00:22:38.720\nmake sure that those files\nwere retained there.\n\n372\n00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.010\nSo let's just go ahead and\ntime out, we're at 1% now,\n\n373\n00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:42.400\nyou don't want to wait for all that.\n\n374\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.710\nOkay, and there you have it,\nwe have our login screen for our new,\n\n375\n00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.228\nour fresh Windows 10 installation.\n\n376\n00:22:50.228 --> 00:22:55.258\nBarbara there, I'll go ahead and\nlogin here, swipe up.\n\n377\n00:22:55.258 --> 00:23:00.154\nIt's kind of interesting when\nwhen this page first came up,\n\n378\n00:23:00.154 --> 00:23:06.013\nthat ugly yellow was there behind\nthe time, it has the time right there.\n\n379\n00:23:06.013 --> 00:23:11.013\nBut then it changed to this beautiful\nphoto, so that's kind of a good indication\n\n380\n00:23:11.013 --> 00:23:16.275\nthat everything went well there.\n&gt;&gt; This was the upgraded machine, right?\n\n381\n00:23:16.275 --> 00:23:21.360\nThe frsh, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm yeah, and so you can tell\n\n382\n00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:26.250\nhere that this is our Windows 10\nenvironment and everything is good to go.\n\n383\n00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.914\nThe only thing,\nI wanted to verify those files and\n\n384\n00:23:28.914 --> 00:23:31.273\nthen just show you a few\nmore settings here.\n\n385\n00:23:31.273 --> 00:23:38.310\nSo let me just pull that file\nexplorer up here, I double clicked.\n\n386\n00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:43.145\nBut under our Documents section,\nwe had that just text file that said\n\n387\n00:23:43.145 --> 00:23:46.740\nexisting.doc, so\nthat's what we're looking at right there.\n\n388\n00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:52.771\nStill existing, so that's why you would\nwant to go ahead and retain that.\n\n389\n00:23:52.771 --> 00:23:55.388\nOops, let me get rid of this thing,\nit's driving me nuts.\n\n390\n00:23:59.147 --> 00:24:03.649\nNow, On the exam objectives,\nthey do mention to go ahead and\n\n391\n00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:07.712\nlook at things like being\nable to configure Windows for\n\n392\n00:24:07.712 --> 00:24:11.370\nadditional regional and language support.\n\n393\n00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:14.520\nI told you they were really\nwanting us to know about that.\n\n394\n00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.560\nSo I wanna show you where you\nwould go ahead and set those.\n\n395\n00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:23.550\nIf you would like to add additional\nsupport, cuz that is important,\n\n396\n00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:27.420\nwe don't have just our\ninternational customers here.\n\n397\n00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:31.380\nSo a couple different ways we could do\nthis, if I wanted to just type in my\n\n398\n00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:36.550\nsearch bar feature, In our Cortana bar.\n\n399\n00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.130\nApparently I missed a few letters.\n\n400\n00:24:43.337 --> 00:24:44.667\nThere we go.\n\n401\n00:24:44.667 --> 00:24:45.624\n[COUGH]\n\n402\n00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.389\n&gt;&gt; Not yet?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n403\n00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:50.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the indexing takes a little\n\n404\n00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:51.490\nbit of time to-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n405\n00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:52.520\nI don't think we're quite there yet.\n\n406\n00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.250\nSo you know what?\n\n407\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.190\nLet's go to Control Panel,\nI wanted to show you that way.\n\n408\n00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:00.390\nYou can type in feature but\nit is a little bit limited in that menu.\n\n409\n00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:02.700\nIf you wanna go back to the old\nschool way of doing that,\n\n410\n00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.840\nyou can also jut pull\nup control panel here.\n\n411\n00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.940\nLet's see if it'll find that, yeah,\nso that should be good to go.\n\n412\n00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:15.600\nAnd there's actually a sub category\nhere under clock, language, and region.\n\n413\n00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.090\nAnd we can click on that and it's from\nthis screen where you're able to cite\n\n414\n00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:24.956\nyour date and time, add a language,\nand also change the region there.\n\n415\n00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:27.840\nSo there are a couple different\nways that you can do that from,\n\n416\n00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.420\nthis is the older way.\n\n417\n00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.710\nThe newer way is with just\nusing Cortana search and\n\n418\n00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.815\nthen pulling up that fly out action menu.\n\n419\n00:25:34.815 --> 00:25:38.290\nIt might not seem like a big deal but\n\n420\n00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:43.280\nit really is because a lot of network\nservices and even capabilities\n\n421\n00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:48.350\nto log on to a domain require\ncorrect time and date information.\n\n422\n00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.080\nSo that's something that's very important.\n\n423\n00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.030\nIt might not seem like a big deal but\nit definitely is.\n\n424\n00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:59.965\nNow when we're looking at\nour Windows features here,\n\n425\n00:25:59.965 --> 00:26:05.330\nyou see that feature option come\nout from the fly out menu but\n\n426\n00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.810\nit's not comprehensive.\n\n427\n00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.020\nIt only shows those regional settings.\n\n428\n00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.630\nIt's kind of misleading whereas\nan actual Windows feature\n\n429\n00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:17.120\nis not available from that flyout menu.\n\n430\n00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.600\nSo now that we're in control panel,\n\n431\n00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.530\nI think this would be a good place\nto show where we could actually,\n\n432\n00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:27.440\nlet me just go back here, show you how you\ncould install additional features here.\n\n433\n00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:35.200\nSo go under Programs, and here if we\ngo under Programs, it says Programs and\n\n434\n00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.848\nFeatures and I'll try to zoom in\na little bit so you guys can see this.\n\n435\n00:26:38.848 --> 00:26:41.457\nAll right,\n\n436\n00:26:43.131 --> 00:26:47.790\nWe uninstalled a program,\nturn a Windows feature on or off.\n\n437\n00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.890\nYou can look at other things like view\nthe installed programs but if you click on\n\n438\n00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:58.730\nthis option right here, it'll go ahead and\nbring up kind of our old school window.\n\n439\n00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.930\nI'm trying to sort it out for\nyou so you can see it.\n\n440\n00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.020\nAnd like Mike said, give it a second for\nthis index thing here because it\n\n441\n00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.510\nwill populate this list of different\nWindows features that are available.\n\n442\n00:27:13.634 --> 00:27:14.482\nOkay, yeah so\n\n443\n00:27:14.482 --> 00:27:18.870\nI'm not sure how well you can see that\nhere since we just installed the OS.\n\n444\n00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:24.165\nBut it's a list of different Windows\nfeatures and there are little squares,\n\n445\n00:27:24.165 --> 00:27:27.935\nsome of the squares have plus\nsymbols to the left of them.\n\n446\n00:27:27.935 --> 00:27:32.425\nIf you see one with the plus symbol, you\ncan go ahead and left click on the plus\n\n447\n00:27:32.425 --> 00:27:36.995\nsymbol to expand out any kind of\nsubcategories that are available that\n\n448\n00:27:36.995 --> 00:27:41.285\nmay be dependencies or support the actual\nfeature that you are trying to install.\n\n449\n00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.450\nHere in the GUI it's pretty easy.\n\n450\n00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:49.319\nYou see those dependencies, you can click\non the box and or dependencies here as\n\n451\n00:27:49.319 --> 00:27:54.058\nwell to make sure that you're selecting\neverything that you want to select.\n\n452\n00:27:54.058 --> 00:27:58.260\nSo for example, I just picked\nthe first thing on the list for\n\n453\n00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.380\nour .NET Framework 3.5.\n\n454\n00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.370\nAnd all you would do is simply hit OK to\ngo ahead and get those features installed.\n\n455\n00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.580\nOf course if it were something that\nrequired to be pulled down from\n\n456\n00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.970\nthe Internet, you would need to\nhave Internet activity as well.\n\n457\n00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:14.590\nI'm just going to hit cancel for now so\nthat we can look at one more way.\n\n458\n00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:19.560\nI know we're coming short on time here\nMike, but I do want to pull up some power,\n\n459\n00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.740\nWindows Power Shell here and\nshow you one way to do that.\n\n460\n00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.570\nNow I just searched for\nPowerShell in the search fields.\n\n461\n00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:29.500\nI am gonna select Run as Administrator.\n\n462\n00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:34.230\nCertain programs and features will\nrequire that elevated permission.\n\n463\n00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:40.321\nSo we are gonna go ahead and\nmake sure we're running as an admin here.\n\n464\n00:28:40.321 --> 00:28:45.137\nAll right, so the first thing that\nwe can do is search for features or\n\n465\n00:28:45.137 --> 00:28:48.190\njust verify to see if they're installed.\n\n466\n00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.371\nBut I think for right now,\nsince we are short on time,\n\n467\n00:28:51.371 --> 00:28:55.614\nwe'll just go ahead an type in enable\nbecause I don't, this is fresh,\n\n468\n00:28:55.614 --> 00:28:59.030\nyou guys saw and let me change\nthis a little bit so we can see\n\n469\n00:29:03.815 --> 00:29:09.883\nThe actual size, we'll change our fonts,\nmaybe 18 will work for\n\n470\n00:29:09.883 --> 00:29:15.820\nus here.\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n471\n00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.980\nlike 18.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n472\n00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:20.620\nwe are inside of our\nlittle tiny OSBox here.\n\n473\n00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:24.532\nSo all right, now since this is fresh,\nHyper-V hasn't been enabled, so\n\n474\n00:29:24.532 --> 00:29:27.090\nthat's what we're gonna\nbe working with here.\n\n475\n00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:32.067\nSo the command is gonna be enable-windows\n\n476\n00:29:32.067 --> 00:29:37.299\nOptional Feature And\n\n477\n00:29:37.299 --> 00:29:41.167\nif you are familiar with working\nin PowerShell and server side,\n\n478\n00:29:41.167 --> 00:29:45.595\nthe syntax is going to be different\njust to make things fun for us here.\n\n479\n00:29:45.595 --> 00:29:49.265\nSo do be aware of that if you're\ncomfortable with server side,\n\n480\n00:29:49.265 --> 00:29:52.085\nit's not the same here in the client OS.\n\n481\n00:29:52.085 --> 00:29:58.560\nSo this one is going to be\ngetwindowsoptionalfeature -online,\n\n482\n00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.444\nand I think that one is -feature name,\n\n483\n00:30:02.444 --> 00:30:07.166\nlet's see if the syntax\nis correct: Microsoft\n\n484\n00:30:11.796 --> 00:30:12.711\n&gt;&gt; Oops check that.\n\n485\n00:30:12.711 --> 00:30:15.230\n&gt;&gt; No, yeah.\n\n486\n00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:19.340\nMicro S-O-F-T does help to\nspell things correctly guys,\n\n487\n00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.600\nif not it will bark at you and-\n&gt;&gt; And I don't think it let's you tab\n\n488\n00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:27.030\nautofill the names of the features\nwhich is sad, one of my favorite\n\n489\n00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:30.590\nthings about PowerShell is tab autofill.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the tab, now\n\n490\n00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:36.330\nit's kind of running off the screen but I\nwill put this syntax into the show notes.\n\n491\n00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:40.610\nI'm not quite finished yet because it\nsays enable Windows optional feature-\n\n492\n00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.340\nonline feature name Microsoft Hyper V.\n\n493\n00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:48.080\nRemember how I said some boxes will have\na little plus symbol with dependencies?\n\n494\n00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:53.020\nSo any kind of management tools and\nPowerShell commandlets that are utilized\n\n495\n00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:58.010\nin conjunction with the Hyper V feature,\nthat needs to be installed as well.\n\n496\n00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:02.098\nSo we'll just hit space dash all and\nthen hit enter.\n\n497\n00:31:02.098 --> 00:31:06.000\nAnd it's kind of cool that Microsoft\nnow works in this manner because\n\n498\n00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.580\nthey don't give you\na bloated operating system.\n\n499\n00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:13.260\nThey utilized features on demand to really\ngive us the opportunity to pick and\n\n500\n00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.560\nchoose that we want to install,\n\n501\n00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:20.350\nplus providing great information on the\nweb to help walk us through this process.\n\n502\n00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:23.230\nIt will be different for different\nfeatures that you are installing but\n\n503\n00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.280\nthese are pretty common and we'll be\nworking with Hyper-V in a little bit.\n\n504\n00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.880\nSo we might as well get this\nmachine set up and running.\n\n505\n00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.860\nYou can see these little circles\nto give you a status bar and\n\n506\n00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.830\nhelp guide you through the process.\n\n507\n00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:39.380\nNow, Hyper-V is one of the ones\nthat do require a reboot here,\n\n508\n00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.120\ncertain features may or\nmay not require reboots.\n\n509\n00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.580\nSo you do wanna keep that in\nmind whenever you're planning\n\n510\n00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.270\nthese future installations.\n\n511\n00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.830\nYou may need to that during\na maintenance or service window just so\n\n512\n00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:54.110\nyou do not disrupt production or\nif it's your personal computer,\n\n513\n00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:58.310\nthen it's not as big of an issue but\njust something to think about there also.\n\n514\n00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:01.490\nSo I think that's about it, Mike,\nwe looked at the clean installation\n\n515\n00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:04.240\nhere, we looked at the upgrade.\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, we're getting\n\n516\n00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.180\na little short on time, anything else\nyou wanna throw in this episode?\n\n517\n00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.630\nYou know Mike, I think that's about it.\n\n518\n00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.590\nI do see here on my screen, you might\nwanna take a look at this guys, it's\n\n519\n00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:16.530\njust asking about that restart if we wanna\ngo ahead and perform it now or later.\n\n520\n00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:20.870\nSo just keeping that in mind,\nmanaging your time wisely there.\n\n521\n00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:24.560\nBut we've looked at installing those\nfeatures, performing that upgrade,\n\n522\n00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.460\nI think we're good to go, so that's it.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Cherokee,\n\n523\n00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:32.260\ngreat demonstrations there as we saw\nthe upgrade process for Windows 10.\n\n524\n00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.430\nWe appreciate that, hope everybody\nout there enjoyed watching this one.\n\n525\n00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:38.240\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n526\n00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:38.900\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n527\n00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:39.596\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n528\n00:32:39.596 --> 00:32:40.953\n&gt;&gt; Bye.\n\n529\n00:32:40.953 --> 00:32:46.389\n[MUSIC]\n\n530\n00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:49.553\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:05.753\nComing at you live from San Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:05.753 --> 00:00:08.403\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:12.341\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:14.511\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another exciting\n\n7\n00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:16.051\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:17.171\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:21.281\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10, preparing for\n\n10\n00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:23.210\nthat 70-698 exam.\n\n11\n00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.865\nIn this episode,\nwe're continuing on preparing for\n\n12\n00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:29.707\ninstallation of Windows 10 and back in\nthe studios is Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n13\n00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:32.120\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Hey Mike, thanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.886\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n15\n00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:36.842\nSo what do you got lined up for us today?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so this one is interesting\n\n16\n00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:42.000\nbecause the actual domain objectives\nsay to install on bootable USB.\n\n17\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.130\nWell, we've already seen how\nto install from bootable USB.\n\n18\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.740\nSo what does that mean?\n\n19\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.470\nSo in the past,\nwe would take a flash drive,\n\n20\n00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.450\nUSB drive, or more than one, depending\non the size of those installation files.\n\n21\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.340\nAnd then we would go ahead and\nuse command line tools such as Dizzom and\n\n22\n00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.540\nRBCD Boots there to go ahead and\n\n23\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.860\npartitioning formatted drive\nutilizing Window to use\n\n24\n00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.530\nthe WIND-PE environment, in conjunction\nwith the Windows ATK toolkit.\n\n25\n00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.750\nSo a lot of moving parts to that and\n\n26\n00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.846\nlet me just tell you the syntax\nwasn't hard, it was just a lot.\n\n27\n00:01:23.846 --> 00:01:27.621\nSo you had to make sure you had to\nfollow those steps to the t, and\n\n28\n00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:29.629\nthere's always room for error.\n\n29\n00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:32.497\nSo if you've ever done that,\nyou'd know what I'm talking about.\n\n30\n00:01:32.497 --> 00:01:36.690\nHowever, Microsoft has this great\nnew tool called Windows To Go.\n\n31\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like it.\n\n32\n00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.610\n&gt;&gt; So what is Windows To Go?\n\n33\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.290\nWindows To Go is going to be while\ntaking that US to be with you to go.\n\n34\n00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.940\nAnd it's kind of cool because if you think\nabout the way we do business nowadays,\n\n35\n00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.420\na lot of people work from home,\nthey go into the office every month or so.\n\n36\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.840\nI mean there's just a lot\nof opportunities out there.\n\n37\n00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.910\nThe way with the Internet and\n\n38\n00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.330\nhow, I know I'm sounding crazy\ntalking about this new life we have.\n\n39\n00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.720\nBut it's true, right?\n\n40\n00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.460\nSo we're flying,\nwe're all over the country, international.\n\n41\n00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.710\nWe might not wanna pack a lot so\ninstead of lugging my laptop,\n\n42\n00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.102\nI mean, our laptops are rather large Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n43\n00:02:18.102 --> 00:02:18.884\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you're familiar with-\n\n44\n00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:19.791\n&gt;&gt; Heavy.\n\n45\n00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:20.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, heavy.\n\n46\n00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.230\nA particular humans,\ncreatures of habit right,\n\n47\n00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.700\nwe like to have a particular\noperating system.\n\n48\n00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.590\nWhen I go into headquarters or\nto the corporate office, or\n\n49\n00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.705\nwhatever office I have to go into, I don't\nwanna use their Windows 7 machine or\n\n50\n00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:42.390\n8.1 or maybe I have things set\nup in just they way I like them.\n\n51\n00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.880\nWell that's when Windows To Go does for\nus, it allows us to have a mobile version\n\n52\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.180\nof the operating system so\nwe can take with us.\n\n53\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.870\nNow, we do have to set it up on our end,\nhowever, Windows does have\n\n54\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.160\na Windows To Go wizard that helps make\nthat creation a lot less painful.\n\n55\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.840\nYou do have the option, still, to go back\nand really customize that as well and\n\n56\n00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.860\nwe'll take a look at\nthe power shell syntax for\n\n57\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.480\nthat once we really just dive in here.\n\n58\n00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.751\nSo let's take a look at what\nare these Windows To Go feature,\n\n59\n00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:16.640\nwhat it looks like, right?\n\n60\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.681\nSo this is going to be\napplying to Windows 10 OSs,\n\n61\n00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:24.091\nyou have to have at least a Windows 10\nmachine to go ahead and set this up.\n\n62\n00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:28.299\nAnd looking at the end product.\n\n63\n00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.734\nSo whatever OS you wanna have\nrunning on that mobile drive,\n\n64\n00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:35.870\nwe're gonna be talking about Windows\n10 Enterprise edition there.\n\n65\n00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.710\nSo that's where you Pro Enterprise,\nyou kinda wanna have your mindset,\n\n66\n00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.550\nwe're not doing this for\nthe home editions there.\n\n67\n00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.920\nSo just keeping that in mind.\n\n68\n00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.250\nAll right so,\nbefore we get to the differences,\n\n69\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.290\nI do wanna point out one thing.\n\n70\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.264\nLooking at the hardware here,\nyou have to have, and there's a link and\n\n71\n00:03:58.264 --> 00:04:01.322\nI will share this with you if\nI can find them somewhere.\n\n72\n00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:03.480\nGive me a second.\n\n73\n00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.580\nMicrosoft has an approved list,\nit might've been on that first link there.\n\n74\n00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.260\nAn approved list of drives\nthat you can use, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.080\nSo let's see, hardware considerations,\nit's probably under that section.\n\n76\n00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.610\nYes, so this is going to\nbe the list of drives that\n\n77\n00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.360\nMicrosoft has already tested and\nhas given their stamp of approval.\n\n78\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.620\nIt's kind of cool knowing that they\nwill vouch for this configuration.\n\n79\n00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.720\nBut with that being said,\n\n80\n00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.530\nthe drive that I have for\ndemonstration is not one on this list, but\n\n81\n00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.540\nyou do need to think about things like\nyour read write speeds of that drive.\n\n82\n00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.980\nBecause if you can get\nthe operating system on that drive,\n\n83\n00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.630\nyou also have to think about performance.\n\n84\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.400\nBecause if you're really doing this\nto have things your way, is your\n\n85\n00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.710\nway really sitting there waiting for your\nOS to load and dealing with all of that.\n\n86\n00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.313\nSo we have to look at the pros and cons\njust making sure you're setting things up\n\n87\n00:05:00.313 --> 00:05:02.830\nahead of time.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's a lot different from say\n\n88\n00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.850\ncopying files to and from a thumb\ndrive and using it at a storage.\n\n89\n00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.070\nTalking about running our operating\nsystem off of that removable media,\n\n90\n00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.200\nwhich means thousands of inputs,\noutputs a second.\n\n91\n00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.680\nSo it does have to be a special drive.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n92\n00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.730\nyou'll see that here with these drives\nif you go to look at some of them.\n\n93\n00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:25.950\nThey're not all, I won't say they're not\nall cheap but they are kind of pricy.\n\n94\n00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.610\nBut you do get what you pay for.\n\n95\n00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.260\nSo you're looking at that better hardware.\n\n96\n00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.880\nI mean, you see this I don't know\nif that's steel or aluminum.\n\n97\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.490\nBut anyways, it's not plastic, right?\n\n98\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.740\nFor those enclosure types and\n\n99\n00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.440\nyou even have the ability to still\nmaintain some security as well.\n\n100\n00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.350\nNow it is a little bit different,\nyou have to use something\n\n101\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.050\ncalled Spyrus to integrate\nthe security with the chipset there.\n\n102\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.720\nBut then this company,\nthey take that USB, fill it with epoxy so\n\n103\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.060\nthat the actual chipsets inside\nthat drive cannot be tampered with.\n\n104\n00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.690\nSo we're talking like even military grade\nor some type of high level security here,\n\n105\n00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.990\nnot just to run of the mill\nbox store flash drive, so\n\n106\n00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.670\njust keeping that in mind.\n&gt;&gt; And we've done it around here,\n\n107\n00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.550\nCherokee, you and I both,\n\n108\n00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.390\nI think have installed Windows To Go\non drives that weren't on this list.\n\n109\n00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.010\nSo it's not that it can't be done,\nit's not gonna be supported and\n\n110\n00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.255\nthe performance might not be there, right?\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and\n\n111\n00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:25.433\nthat's what we're gonna be doing\nright in this show actually.\n\n112\n00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:27.413\nI'm trying to think about\nall these different things.\n\n113\n00:06:27.413 --> 00:06:32.132\nYou know what, let's just take\na look at differences between\n\n114\n00:06:32.132 --> 00:06:37.300\nthe regular OS versus Windows To Go,\nhow that's set up.\n\n115\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.950\nSo there are some slight differences\nthat you should be aware of.\n\n116\n00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.990\nSo if I go ahead and I set this up, and\nI have my Windows To Go on a drive,\n\n117\n00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.060\nI need to be aware that my\ninternal disks are offline.\n\n118\n00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.740\nSo let's think about that for a second.\n\n119\n00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.787\nSo I take an external drive,\nmaybe I'm going on a work trip, right?\n\n120\n00:06:55.787 --> 00:06:59.280\nAnd my company has put me up into a hotel.\n\n121\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.030\nSo maybe there's a section down in the\nlobby that has computers provided for me.\n\n122\n00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.580\nI go down into the lobby,\nI take my Windows To Go drive with me, and\n\n123\n00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.650\nit's already configured with access.\n\n124\n00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.369\nMaybe I have some bookmarks to web apps\nthat I utilize that stores up in the cloud\n\n125\n00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:17.384\nso I have everything ready to go.\n\n126\n00:07:17.384 --> 00:07:23.276\nWell, when I plug my drive into\nthe hotel's lobby computer to maintain\n\n127\n00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:29.757\nisolation, to protect that host computer\nas well as my Windows To Go edition,\n\n128\n00:07:29.757 --> 00:07:34.176\nthen there's gonna be\nsegregation of those drives so\n\n129\n00:07:34.176 --> 00:07:40.990\nI will not see the physical hard drives\nthat are inside of that hotel computer.\n\n130\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.740\nI will see my drive for\nthe Windows To Go instance there,\n\n131\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.060\nso just make sure you are aware of that.\n\n132\n00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.959\nYou can't navigate through\nFile Explorer and expect to see that or\n\n133\n00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:53.630\nuse other utilities.\n\n134\n00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:59.052\nTPM, because TPM,\nTrusted Platform Module, is a hardware.\n\n135\n00:07:59.052 --> 00:08:03.926\nFeature, and I don't have a TPM\nchip in this particular drive.\n\n136\n00:08:03.926 --> 00:08:05.950\nI'm not gonna be able to leverage that.\n\n137\n00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:06.530\nLike I said,\n\n138\n00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:12.160\nsecurity is not all lost if you do use\nthat SPYRUS option that you can look at.\n\n139\n00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.743\nIf that's a big concern for you to still\nprovide that additional authentication.\n\n140\n00:08:15.743 --> 00:08:21.007\nBut just know that you can't use a TPM\nchip if the TPM chip isn't there for\n\n141\n00:08:21.007 --> 00:08:22.140\nthese drives.\n\n142\n00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.620\nHibernate, by default, is disabled.\n\n143\n00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.720\nWhat does that mean?\n\n144\n00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.952\nWell, whenever we're creating and\nwriting to the hiberfil file, right.\n\n145\n00:08:33.952 --> 00:08:38.200\nSo it takes a portion of that hard disk\ndrive and we're writing to that drive.\n\n146\n00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.160\nThere can be issues coming\nout of hibernation sometimes.\n\n147\n00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.160\nEven on my regular PC, I've experienced\nand how to troubleshoot those as well.\n\n148\n00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.370\nSo, Microsoft by default has just\n\n149\n00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.845\ndecided not to allow the system to\nbehave that way and go into hibernation.\n\n150\n00:08:56.845 --> 00:09:01.780\nWe'll see that when we look at some\nconfiguration files, the actual XML files.\n\n151\n00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.252\nNow Mike, I don't know if\nyou've played around with this,\n\n152\n00:09:05.252 --> 00:09:10.238\nI haven't actually omitted that portion of\nthe XML files to maintained hibernation.\n\n153\n00:09:10.238 --> 00:09:10.889\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n154\n00:09:10.889 --> 00:09:12.782\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I really don't see a need\n\n155\n00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:17.650\nto do that which but just potentially you\ncould because XML files are configurable.\n\n156\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.538\nAnd we'll see that, but.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n157\n00:09:19.538 --> 00:09:22.824\nI have enough trouble with hibernation\non a physical machine sometimes,\n\n158\n00:09:22.824 --> 00:09:26.116\ngetting it to wake up, getting everything\nto come back the way it should.\n\n159\n00:09:26.116 --> 00:09:30.907\nSo using it on a portable system, if you\nthink about it, you might hibernate it\n\n160\n00:09:30.907 --> 00:09:35.880\nwhile connected to that machine down\nin the business office at one hotel.\n\n161\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.050\nAnd then when you go home and\nyou plug it into your system at home and\n\n162\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.490\ntry to wake it up,\nyou're talking different drivers,\n\n163\n00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.700\ndifferent hardware,\nit's trying to come out of hibernation.\n\n164\n00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.690\nJust sounds like all kinds of problems.\n\n165\n00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.527\nIt might work but there's a reason\nMicrosoft disables it by default.\n\n166\n00:09:51.527 --> 00:09:52.051\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n167\n00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:54.568\nyou know what, you bring up\na really good point Mike about\n\n168\n00:09:54.568 --> 00:09:58.090\nthose drivers because if you think about\nhow does Windows to go handle drivers.\n\n169\n00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.614\nBecause if I'm using\nthe hotel lobby computer,\n\n170\n00:10:00.614 --> 00:10:02.961\nhow will Microsoft know\nwhat drivers to use?\n\n171\n00:10:02.961 --> 00:10:07.127\nWell, we talked about drivers\nin a different episode, and\n\n172\n00:10:07.127 --> 00:10:10.640\nMicrosoft utilizes\nuniversal driver packages.\n\n173\n00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.950\nAnd so there are generic drivers\nthat Microsoft will try to pull.\n\n174\n00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:18.120\nJust be aware that if you're looking for\nsome esoteric driver,\n\n175\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.830\nsomething very specific to an application\nyou have, there may be issues.\n\n176\n00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:26.470\nBut Windows To Go will maintain\nthose driver profiles for\n\n177\n00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:31.270\neach system that you log into\nwith the Windows To Go drive.\n\n178\n00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.630\nSo that's pretty cool\nto give you that there.\n\n179\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.800\nAlso, to think about\nworking ahead of time.\n\n180\n00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.200\nIf I were going on this business trip,\nwhenever I create my drive, I\n\n181\n00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.860\nalso need to look for updates as well, but\nwe'll talk about that whenever I show it.\n\n182\n00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.902\nSo it's kind of like packing\nwhen you're going on a trip.\n\n183\n00:10:47.902 --> 00:10:51.543\nYou wanna do all the work ahead of time\nto make sure you're good to go and\n\n184\n00:10:51.543 --> 00:10:53.842\nhave your successful business trip there.\n\n185\n00:10:53.842 --> 00:10:56.460\nAll right, what else do we have here for\nour differences?\n\n186\n00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.430\nWindows Recovery Environment\nis not available.\n\n187\n00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.560\nSo let's think about this for a second.\n\n188\n00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.850\nWe're putting the OS on a mobile drive.\n\n189\n00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:09.040\nAnd if I have any kind of instability or\ncrashes here,\n\n190\n00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.230\njust know that the recovery\noption is not available.\n\n191\n00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.730\nMicrosoft says we should re-image\nwith a fresh image of Windows.\n\n192\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.450\nSo that's the solution or\nrecommendation for that situation.\n\n193\n00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.180\nRefresh, refreshing or resetting a\nWindows To Go workspace is not supported.\n\n194\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.980\nSo this will be an option that you have\nin order to go ahead and refresh or\n\n195\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.130\nreset, again,\n\n196\n00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:36.200\njust similarly to the Recovery Environment\nthat's not gonna be available either.\n\n197\n00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.940\nAgain, go ahead and try to re-image,\nor you should re-image.\n\n198\n00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.570\nUpgrading to Windows To Go\nright here is not supported.\n\n199\n00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.965\nOlder Windows 8 or\n\n200\n00:11:46.965 --> 00:11:51.700\n8.1 Windows To Go workspaces cannot be\nupgraded to a Windows 10 workspace.\n\n201\n00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.110\nSo just keep that in mind there.\n\n202\n00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.910\nYou can update, but we're not talking\nabout a full-blown upgrade for\n\n203\n00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.430\nthis particular install.\n\n204\n00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:05.200\nAll right, now the actual setup here is\npretty easy, what they have done for us.\n\n205\n00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.740\nSo, if you just use your\nsearch bar here for\n\n206\n00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.000\nCortana, you can type in Windows To Go.\n\n207\n00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.830\nActually, I wanted to show you if\nyou type a little bit more, and\n\n208\n00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:16.870\nI don't see it here.\n\n209\n00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.490\nIt's probably because, it's right here.\n\n210\n00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:22.950\nThere is an option,\n\n211\n00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:27.570\nthis is not the one you want to select\nin order to initiate that wizard.\n\n212\n00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.500\nBut I'm gonna click on it to\nshow you what it is anyways.\n\n213\n00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.310\nIt says,\nChange Windows To Go startup options.\n\n214\n00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:38.140\nSo if we clicked on that, and\nit'll bring up this window here,\n\n215\n00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.799\nWindows To Go Startup options.\n\n216\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.280\nSo what we're doing is we're changing\nthat boot configuration here.\n\n217\n00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.510\nOn the physical machine,\nit says, do I wanna change it?\n\n218\n00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:54.480\nSome of our drives can harm the PC,\nversus No,\n\n219\n00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.900\nyou might need to change your PC's\nfirmware to make use of this workspace.\n\n220\n00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.830\nSo what we're doing is\nwe're basically saying,\n\n221\n00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.548\nhey, the next time,\nI power on this machine,\n\n222\n00:13:04.548 --> 00:13:09.243\nI want you to boot to that external drive\ninstead of my internal hard disk drive.\n\n223\n00:13:09.243 --> 00:13:10.739\nYou might wanna do that.\n\n224\n00:13:10.739 --> 00:13:16.015\nHowever if you think about the logic\nbehind why Windows To Go was created.\n\n225\n00:13:16.015 --> 00:13:20.278\nYou're probably not going\nto want to adversely\n\n226\n00:13:20.278 --> 00:13:24.080\neffect anyone else's machine\nother than your own.\n\n227\n00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.142\nSo this is, in my opinion, a pretty\ninvasive type of setting change that you\n\n228\n00:13:28.142 --> 00:13:32.145\nprobably shouldn't be messing with there,\nbut that's just my opinion.\n\n229\n00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.350\nI'm just gonna hit Cancel.\n\n230\n00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.537\nAnd then if we go back down to\nthat search, the other option for\n\n231\n00:13:38.537 --> 00:13:42.571\nWindows To Go is what we want to\ngo ahead and launch right here.\n\n232\n00:13:44.594 --> 00:13:46.957\nAll right, so this is the wizard,\n\n233\n00:13:46.957 --> 00:13:51.530\nit looks like this line is a little\nfunky there, but that's okay.\n\n234\n00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:58.030\nBecause what's really important is the\nfact that it's already detected the drive.\n\n235\n00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:03.210\nI have an external drive that's\nplugged in here, 2 TB drive\n\n236\n00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:08.190\nthat I want to use to go ahead and\nset up with that operating system on it.\n\n237\n00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.920\nAnd notice here how it does say,\n\n238\n00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.250\nWindows performance might be\nimpacted if you use this drive.\n\n239\n00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:20.910\nFor best results use a Windows To Go\ncertified USB 3.0 drive.\n\n240\n00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:25.970\nSo remember when Mike and I were telling\nyou, hey look, it can be, you can\n\n241\n00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:31.500\nuse uncertified drives, they're not gonna\nvouch for that particular configuration.\n\n242\n00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.840\nAnd also,\nbe aware of size limitations also.\n\n243\n00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.540\nSo you have to be cognizant of, well how\nbig is my image and things like that.\n\n244\n00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:46.624\nI'm trying to think,\nI originally had tried awhile ago\n\n245\n00:14:46.624 --> 00:14:52.589\nthis configuration with a 16 GB drive,\nthat was way too small.\n\n246\n00:14:52.589 --> 00:14:55.738\nI can't remember the smallest drive,\nmaybe 32, but\n\n247\n00:14:55.738 --> 00:14:59.030\nthat's something you definitely\nwanna check out here.\n\n248\n00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:03.383\nI don't have to worry about that with the\nsize drive but you also remember you have\n\n249\n00:15:03.383 --> 00:15:07.692\nto think about the read/write performance,\nthe speeds of that drive as well.\n\n250\n00:15:07.692 --> 00:15:09.785\nAll right, so\nthis is the driver we are gonna select.\n\n251\n00:15:09.785 --> 00:15:10.715\nWe'll hit Next.\n\n252\n00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:20.095\nAnd this is my, the system, Windows To Go\nalready detected a WIM file here.\n\n253\n00:15:20.095 --> 00:15:22.615\nSo if you have a WIM file,\n\n254\n00:15:22.615 --> 00:15:26.365\nan installation file, on your PC,\nyou need to think about that.\n\n255\n00:15:26.365 --> 00:15:29.925\nThat's the image that you're\ngonna be deploying to this drive.\n\n256\n00:15:29.925 --> 00:15:32.840\nAnd if you have multiple\nWIM files on your system,\n\n257\n00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.920\nthen you might want to verify that\nthis is in fact the correct one.\n\n258\n00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.570\nYou can alsolike look, and drill down.\n\n259\n00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.944\nSo, I think I had one\nsitting on my C drive here.\n\n260\n00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:46.380\nLet me zoom out.\n\n261\n00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:51.240\nMaybe, I deleted it, I can't remember but\nyou can also navigate to that location for\n\n262\n00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.300\nthat WIM file as well.\n\n263\n00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.961\nI will point something out here.\n\n264\n00:15:54.961 --> 00:15:56.356\nIt does say select folder.\n\n265\n00:15:56.356 --> 00:16:01.898\nSo if you're trying to click on\nthe individual file, the WIM file,\n\n266\n00:16:01.898 --> 00:16:08.530\nJust be aware that you actually select\nthe folder in which that win file resides.\n\n267\n00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:09.950\nYeah, right behind my head, right there.\n\n268\n00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.146\nSo you just want to be aware of that.\n\n269\n00:16:12.857 --> 00:16:13.924\nBut you know what,\n\n270\n00:16:13.924 --> 00:16:17.810\nthe file that the system already has\nnoted here is the one I wanna use.\n\n271\n00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.690\nSo that's pretty cool, I don't have\nto go searching [LAUGH] for all that.\n\n272\n00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.340\nWe'll go ahead and select Next.\n\n273\n00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.989\nNow, the type of win file that you\nhave here could be just the default\n\n274\n00:16:27.989 --> 00:16:29.468\ninstallation file.\n\n275\n00:16:29.468 --> 00:16:34.306\nOr you can also customize that with,\nthere are a plethora of different tools\n\n276\n00:16:34.306 --> 00:16:39.297\navailable to me to add any kind of custom\napplications or driver packages, and\n\n277\n00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:40.526\nthings like that.\n\n278\n00:16:40.526 --> 00:16:45.349\nAll right, so if I wanted to go ahead and\nset a BitLocker password,\n\n279\n00:16:45.349 --> 00:16:48.380\nthen I have the ability\nto do that as well.\n\n280\n00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.835\nYou would go ahead and put in your\npassword, I'm gonna just hit skip for\n\n281\n00:16:51.835 --> 00:16:53.570\nright now for this demonstration.\n\n282\n00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.818\nAnd then, let me zoom in so\nyou guys can see this.\n\n283\n00:16:59.345 --> 00:17:02.229\nIt says your Windows To Go\nworkspace will be created on, and\n\n284\n00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:03.450\nthen it lists the drive.\n\n285\n00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.250\nRemember that they are formatting\nthe drive that I have attached here.\n\n286\n00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.020\nSo any kind of data like with\nany kind of format will be\n\n287\n00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:11.645\nlost,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n288\n00:17:11.645 --> 00:17:13.100\n&gt;&gt; You have to keep that in mind.\n\n289\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.230\nLooking at the type of install\non your hardware that you have,\n\n290\n00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.570\nit's probably gonna take\nabout 30 minutes or so.\n\n291\n00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:26.120\nSo it doesn't happen real quick, I mean\nyou are running with an installation here.\n\n292\n00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.630\nWe're gonna hit Create,\nso it'll take some time.\n\n293\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.370\nIn the meantime, what I'll do is switch\nover to a different machine where there is\n\n294\n00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:39.370\nalready a drive that we have set up\nhere on another machine to show you\n\n295\n00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:43.620\nwhat that boot up or what that\ninstall process actually looks like.\n\n296\n00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.510\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, so\n\n297\n00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.910\nwe can do a little bit of TV magic,\nput the uncooked turkey in and\n\n298\n00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.922\npull the fully cooked turkey\nright back out we love it.\n\n299\n00:17:50.922 --> 00:17:51.540\nAll right Cherokee, so\n\n300\n00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.150\nwhat do you got for us?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what we're doing now is we're\n\n301\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.990\nsimulating what would happen if\nwe went into that hotel lobby.\n\n302\n00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.510\nI'm going to, if you can see here,\nI've already plugged that drive in.\n\n303\n00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.160\nNow this is a drive that Mike has\nalready set up with Windows To Go.\n\n304\n00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.130\nSo I'm kinda borrowing it from him here,\n\n305\n00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.000\nyou guys didn't wanna\nwatch that 30 minutes.\n\n306\n00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.950\nI'm just powering it on, right?\n\n307\n00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:17.240\nAnd so, as this machine boots up we\nare just waiting here to see the hardware,\n\n308\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.840\nwe'll look to the drive here for that OS.\n\n309\n00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:26.980\nSo that's what we are waiting on,\nall right now, we see a BitLocker screen.\n\n310\n00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:31.160\nIf you recall during our creation\nof our Windows To Go drive,\n\n311\n00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.960\nwe decided to admit this process.\n\n312\n00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.740\nBut of course,\nMike being the security guy that he is,\n\n313\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:40.580\nI am sure he put this BitLocker on\nhere for just a lot of protection.\n\n314\n00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:45.143\nSo, let's go ahead and\nput in his top secret password there.\n\n315\n00:18:45.143 --> 00:18:46.668\n&gt;&gt; Of course, the downside is I had to\n\n316\n00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:48.370\nshare my password with Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n317\n00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:49.970\n&gt;&gt; So now I have to change it everywhere.\n\n318\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:50.480\n&gt;&gt; And everyone just\n\n319\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.800\nsaw me typing on my keyboard.\n\n320\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.685\nSo they probably know\nyour password now too.\n\n321\n00:18:53.685 --> 00:18:55.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yep, that's crazy.\n\n322\n00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.110\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n323\n00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:00.321\nso now really I just wanted to show\nyou how simple and easy that was.\n\n324\n00:19:00.321 --> 00:19:04.566\nI did wanna mention again reiterate\nthe fact about those updates because,\n\n325\n00:19:04.566 --> 00:19:08.483\nif you have an Internet connection,\nwhen this machine does boot up.\n\n326\n00:19:08.483 --> 00:19:10.033\nIt will try to grab those, and\n\n327\n00:19:10.033 --> 00:19:15.390\nyou'll be stuck through that process if\nyou didn't think about that ahead of time.\n\n328\n00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.670\nBut that's Windows To Go, Super easy,\n\n329\n00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.160\na heck of a lot easier than\nrunning through all of the syntax.\n\n330\n00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.880\nBut, I do want to show you that\nthere is an option via PowerShell,\n\n331\n00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.110\nif you wanted to go through that syntax.\n\n332\n00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.290\nAnd really customize things you\nstill have the ability to do so.\n\n333\n00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.230\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, and\n\n334\n00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:36.110\nyou see it's taken a minute\nto actually get booted up.\n\n335\n00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:40.070\nRemember, it's being plugged in to new\nhardware that it's never seen before.\n\n336\n00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:42.630\nSo it does have to do some\nhard work check, try and\n\n337\n00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:46.370\nload up the appropriate drivers or this\nnew laptop that is getting plugged into.\n\n338\n00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.250\nThe cool thing about Windows To Go though,\n\n339\n00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.750\nis it will remember the different\nequipment that has been plugged into.\n\n340\n00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.690\nAnd it go, I remember this laptop, these\nare the drivers that I need to load up for\n\n341\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.850\nthis one, or I remember this desktop,\n\n342\n00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.780\nI've been here before, these\nare the drivers that I need to load up.\n\n343\n00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:05.290\nSo, the first time you plug\na Windows To Go drive into a computer,\n\n344\n00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:10.030\nexpect that boot process to take a little\nbit longer as it detects the hardware, but\n\n345\n00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.390\nafter that, it'll be much faster.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n346\n00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.680\nwe can take a look at my screen,\n\n347\n00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.290\nI did want to share those PowerShell\ncmdlets with you and just walk you through\n\n348\n00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:22.080\nthat process here, of course you have the\ndocumentation to rely on with Microsoft.\n\n349\n00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.357\nBut it's always good to kind\nof see what that looks like,\n\n350\n00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:29.750\nbecause you may be seeing this in the\nfuture if you are sitting for that exam.\n\n351\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:34.029\nAnd on the same page that I showed you\nearlier, it will the link would be in\n\n352\n00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:38.383\nthe show notes that you can look right\nhere Windows PowerShell equivalent\n\n353\n00:20:38.383 --> 00:20:42.970\ncommands, so, this is manually doing\nwhat that wizard has just done for us.\n\n354\n00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.920\nSome of the steps here are not\nneeded per say, for instance,\n\n355\n00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.959\nthis first option dollar sign disk, you're\ncreating an alias where the disk object,\n\n356\n00:20:52.959 --> 00:20:57.541\nso you're calling on the system to look\nat those disks greater than 20 gigs.\n\n357\n00:20:57.541 --> 00:21:00.952\nBecause like those limitations\nwe spoke about first before,\n\n358\n00:21:00.952 --> 00:21:05.477\nyou're not gonna be able to use smaller\ndrive because you are housing an OS there,\n\n359\n00:21:05.477 --> 00:21:08.770\nso you do wanna only look at\nthe drive that can support that.\n\n360\n00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.730\nNow, scrolling down like\nI said in the past,\n\n361\n00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.810\nyou're able to use DSAM which\nyou still are to go ahead and\n\n362\n00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.660\nperform the same function, but\nbecause PowerShells really the way to go.\n\n363\n00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:25.610\nThis is what I would probably practice\nwith if I were you, just knowing that you\n\n364\n00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:31.350\ncan also use disk part, a disk command\nline utility within your CLI there,\n\n365\n00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:35.220\nthat can also perform a lot of these\nfunctions, like clearing the disk, right?\n\n366\n00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.620\nSo we can do that in disk part,\nbut also here in PowerShell.\n\n367\n00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.310\nNow, you'll need to\ninitialize the disk and\n\n368\n00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:46.310\nthen take a look at creating\nsome system partitions.\n\n369\n00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.725\nIn the past,\nearlier versions builds of Windows,\n\n370\n00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:54.060\nyou're only able to format\nthose externals with FAT32,\n\n371\n00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:59.800\nwhich would pose an issue when it\ncame to larger installation files.\n\n372\n00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.640\nIf we were creating custom images and\nso forth, and\n\n373\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:08.470\nwe would have to actually have multiple or\nat least like two external USB drives.\n\n374\n00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.010\nHowever, with version 1709,\n\n375\n00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:16.890\nyou're able to partition one\ndrive with FAT32 as well as NTFS.\n\n376\n00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:22.020\nAnd we know that NTFS will\nraise the roof on that,\n\n377\n00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.950\ndidn't mean to say that but I did.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n378\n00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.280\n&gt;&gt; Will lift that limitation there, and\n\n379\n00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.760\nallow you to how those\nlarger installation files.\n\n380\n00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.410\nSo just making sure you are creating those\npartitions and getting those setup and\n\n381\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.230\nready to become bootable there.\n\n382\n00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.524\nAnd that's what these commands\nare really walking us through.\n\n383\n00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:43.523\nYou'll notice here for the file-system,\nit is a little bit different,\n\n384\n00:22:43.523 --> 00:22:47.500\nit's that UFD file system when\nthey create and format that drive.\n\n385\n00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:53.400\nNow, scrolling down a little bit this\nis going to be the application of\n\n386\n00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:58.740\nthose WIM files, utilizing DISM which\nis an older command line utility,\n\n387\n00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.100\nstill has its place here to go ahead and\napply that image.\n\n388\n00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:06.190\nYou're navigating to the location\nwhere that WIM file is being saved.\n\n389\n00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:09.890\nSo that's what they're referencing\nhere for this syntax, sorry.\n\n390\n00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:14.349\nAnd if you haven't ever worked with DISM,\ndon't worry we do have shows on that as\n\n391\n00:23:14.349 --> 00:23:15.141\nwell,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n392\n00:23:15.141 --> 00:23:15.729\n&gt;&gt; In our course library.\n\n393\n00:23:18.718 --> 00:23:23.560\nNow, talking about those custom XML files.\n\n394\n00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.630\nSo XML files are going,\nthat's the file extension, and\n\n395\n00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:29.780\nthere are configuration files here.\n\n396\n00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:34.800\nAnd specifically, you're gonna be\nworking with a san policy.xml file.\n\n397\n00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:40.570\nThis is going to be the policy that will\nexclude those internal hard disk drives,\n\n398\n00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:46.820\nand is really telling that machine how\nto handle with that external drive.\n\n399\n00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:52.590\nSo you can see the settings here,\nand also copy and paste them there.\n\n400\n00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.990\nI wouldn't really modify this,\nunless you have a specific purpose or\n\n401\n00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:58.785\nyou've worked with xml files before.\n\n402\n00:23:58.785 --> 00:24:06.310\nThere's another XML file here that is\nspecific to that hibernation options.\n\n403\n00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:10.920\nSo or excuse me, disables the use of\nthe Windows Recovery Environment, so\n\n404\n00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.470\nthat's what this one is doing,\nnot the hibernation there.\n\n405\n00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:16.930\nI think it might actually be in\nthe syntax somewhere in here,\n\n406\n00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:21.160\nif you dig through all that but\njust know that that's what you're\n\n407\n00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.730\ndoing manually by adding this and\nlook Mike, oobeSystem.\n\n408\n00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.680\nThis is that Microsoft out of the box\n\n409\n00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.580\nexperience.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n410\n00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.323\n&gt;&gt; One of our Microsoft gurus,\n\n411\n00:24:30.323 --> 00:24:32.499\nMr Mike Stephens just told us that,\n\n412\n00:24:32.499 --> 00:24:35.062\nat Microsoft they call this OOBE.\n&gt;&gt; I like\n\n413\n00:24:35.062 --> 00:24:35.970\nit.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n414\n00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.100\n&gt;&gt; A lot easier than saying\n\n415\n00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.450\nOOBE.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n416\n00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And what fun, say it with us, OOBE.\n\n417\n00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.212\n&gt;&gt; OOBE, [LAUGH].\n\n418\n00:24:43.212 --> 00:24:45.580\nAll right, but those are those XML files.\n\n419\n00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:50.880\nJust know that you have the ability\nto really customize that image,\n\n420\n00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:56.630\nand set this up but in all honesty,\nit's so much easier with the wizard.\n\n421\n00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:01.330\nI will note one thing right here, so\nwhen you're looking at those actual set up\n\n422\n00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.320\nfiles, there's a panther\nfolder under your system root.\n\n423\n00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.590\nIf you have let's say,\nyou've set up the drive one way,\n\n424\n00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:14.590\none week and then you have a different\nflavor of the week set up customization.\n\n425\n00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.171\nAnd you go and redo it,\n\n426\n00:25:16.171 --> 00:25:21.332\nyou'll need to look at removing that\nold setup file just because you wanna\n\n427\n00:25:21.332 --> 00:25:26.592\nmake sure you have the right setup\nconfiguration in those XML files there.\n\n428\n00:25:26.592 --> 00:25:29.745\nOtherwise, it may default and\nrevert back to the old, so\n\n429\n00:25:29.745 --> 00:25:31.530\nyou can't just keep stacking.\n\n430\n00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:35.460\nYou need to keep your drive\nclean in that respect.\n\n431\n00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.810\nBut I think that's about it,\nI mean use the wizard.\n\n432\n00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:42.120\nThat's what it's there for, in certain\nsituations, you may need to fall back on\n\n433\n00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.280\nthis but you have it, so.\n&gt;&gt; Very good, all right, Cherokee,\n\n434\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.770\ngreat look there at Windows To Go from\nstart to finish, getting that set up.\n\n435\n00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:52.430\nSo we appreciate that, hope everybody\nout there enjoyed watching this one.\n\n436\n00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:55.201\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Roderick.\n\n437\n00:25:55.201 --> 00:25:56.147\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n438\n00:25:56.147 --> 00:25:56.919\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n439\n00:25:58.691 -->

00:00:08.164\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:12.790\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.910\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.080\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.090\nToday, we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n8\n00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.260\nSpecifically in this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.300\nwe're actually continuing\non with installing Windows.\n\n10\n00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.830\nSo if you missed the previous parts, make\nsure you go back and check those out, but\n\n11\n00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.510\nhere to continue that thought process with\nus is none other than Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n12\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.530\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.650\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\n\n14\n00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.520\nexcited to see what you got for us today.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we've already\n\n15\n00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.150\ntalked about different ways that we\ncan install and work with Windows 10.\n\n16\n00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.100\nWe're kind of graduating and thinking\nabout a little, I feel like these topics\n\n17\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.495\nare a little more advanced in the Way you\ncan conceptualize and understand them.\n\n18\n00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:52.502\nSo guess what?\n\n19\n00:00:52.502 --> 00:00:56.917\nI've got some visual aids with us today.\n&gt;&gt; All right,we love visual\n\n20\n00:00:56.917 --> 00:00:57.847\naids.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n21\n00:00:57.847 --> 00:01:00.093\nWhat I wanted to do, first of all,\n\n22\n00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:03.837\nwas just talk about\n&gt;&gt; because I really wanna make sure you\n\n23\n00:01:03.837 --> 00:01:04.890\nunderstand it.\n\n24\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.120\nAnd then,\nwe'll walk through different scenarios and\n\n25\n00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.260\nhow you can actually set up and\nconfigure native boot.\n\n26\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.820\nSo native boot is going to\nbe the ability to boot.\n\n27\n00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.610\nWe'll create a VHD or a VHDX here, and\n\n28\n00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.770\nwe're going to utilize that\nvirtual disc to go ahead and\n\n29\n00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.850\nboot to the operating system,\nso it's a bootable VHD or VHDX.\n\n30\n00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.622\nSorry-\n&gt;&gt; It's an interesting concept, right?\n\n31\n00:01:32.622 --> 00:01:35.678\nCuz normally, we're thinking of\nyou boot your physical hard,\n\n32\n00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:39.020\nyou've installed your operating\nsystem on your hard drive.\n\n33\n00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.810\nAnd you're booting up your laptop, or your\ndesktop, we understand that we can run\n\n34\n00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.150\na hypervised run there and create virtual\nmachines that rely on virtual hard drives.\n\n35\n00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.401\nBut native boot is talking about\ntaking a physical machine and\n\n36\n00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:54.293\nbooting to a virtual hard drive, so\nit's almost like combining the two.\n\n37\n00:01:54.293 --> 00:01:54.864\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n38\n00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:58.869\nI didn't want people to get this concept\nconfused because there are different ways\n\n39\n00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.527\nwhere we can have dual-booting,\n\n40\n00:02:00.527 --> 00:02:04.320\nwhere we're actually partitioning off\nportions of our physical hard drive.\n\n41\n00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.900\nAnd we're putting two operating\nsystems on that physical hard drive.\n\n42\n00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.110\nIt's similar to that, but here we're\nactually leveraging the VHDX files.\n\n43\n00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.796\nSo we have a file residing on a partition\ninstead of actually just having\n\n44\n00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:24.186\ntwo hardware partitions on the disc.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n45\n00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:25.305\n&gt;&gt; If that makes sense, and\n\n46\n00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:27.340\nthat's why I know it's a little confusing.\n\n47\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.110\nSo I do wanna take a moment to\njust show you these blocks here.\n\n48\n00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.690\nAnd so, these blocks are gonna be kind of\n\n49\n00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.830\nmimicking what you had seen\nin the Type II Hypervisor.\n\n50\n00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.030\nSo here I have my hardware.\n\n51\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.870\nSo my physical machine, my desk, my CPU,\nmotherboard all the good stuff, right?\n\n52\n00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.290\nOn this hardware, we're gonna go ahead and\ninstall operation system.\n\n53\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.920\nThen we'll install a hypervisor, which\nwill allow us to have multiple machines\n\n54\n00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.850\nrunning XP if you really wanted to,\nWindows 10, Linux.\n\n55\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.660\nSo we've got some layers of abstraction\nhere and there's a lot going on.\n\n56\n00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.980\nThis Linux machine has to\ngo through the hypervisor,\n\n57\n00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.500\nthrough the OS to communicate\nwith this hardware.\n\n58\n00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.160\nSo with native boot,\n\n59\n00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.490\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nremove some of this abstraction layer.\n\n60\n00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.980\nThis hypervisor, we don't need that and\nwhat we're kind of doing instead of\n\n61\n00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.840\nlike I said, segmenting that physical\ndisk, we're kind of taking our VHDX.\n\n62\n00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.825\nSo in our demonstration, we're gonna\nhave Windows 10 as our host OS.\n\n63\n00:03:29.825 --> 00:03:30.713\nAnd then will also,\n\n64\n00:03:30.713 --> 00:03:32.440\nsince this is Windows 10 show.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n65\n00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.520\n&gt;&gt; We'll go ahead, and we'll create a VHD\n\n66\n00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.420\nand just keep it there in the host OS,\nso that it's kind of like at the very,\n\n67\n00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.750\nvery bottom, it's in between\nthe hardware and the host OS.\n\n68\n00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.020\nSo that when we go to boot, we have\nthe option to boot either to this host\n\n69\n00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.710\noperating system or to the virtual\nhard disk that we've created there.\n\n70\n00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.982\nSo I hope that helps,\nI don't know if it does, [LAUGH]\n\n71\n00:03:55.982 --> 00:03:56.811\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH] I tell you,\n\n72\n00:03:56.811 --> 00:03:58.090\nI really like this method.\n\n73\n00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.690\nIt's something that you can use, as you\nsaid, to do the dual-boot scenarios.\n\n74\n00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.916\nProblem you have with doing\nthe old-school way of dual-boot,\n\n75\n00:04:05.916 --> 00:04:09.212\nwhere you have to create a separate\npartition on your hard drive.\n\n76\n00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:11.609\nAnd then,\nyou install your operating system, one,\n\n77\n00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.320\nyou kinda have to plan ahead, right?\n\n78\n00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.015\nIf you've already installed\n\n79\n00:04:14.015 --> 00:04:14.925\nan operating system-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n80\n00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:16.537\n&gt;&gt; That takes up the entire hard drive,\n\n81\n00:04:16.537 --> 00:04:19.501\nnow you go to somehow shrink that\npartition, which back in the day,\n\n82\n00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:20.440\nwas very difficult.\n\n83\n00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.810\nI know Windows 10 will let me\nresize some of my OS partitions.\n\n84\n00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.355\nBut you had to plan ahead, or you had\nto do a lot of work to get that second\n\n85\n00:04:27.355 --> 00:04:29.661\npartition to install the operating system.\n\n86\n00:04:29.661 --> 00:04:31.392\nThen you had to think about space.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n87\n00:04:31.392 --> 00:04:32.830\n&gt;&gt; And how much space do I give up for\n\n88\n00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.299\nthis second operating system, that's\ngonna reduce the space available for\n\n89\n00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:39.680\nmy first operating system\n&gt;&gt; I wanna do more than two\n\n90\n00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.640\nit really becomes a nightmare.\n\n91\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.616\nAnd a lot of times that second\nOS is a temporary thing,\n\n92\n00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:49.200\nsomething you wanna test out, something\nyou just wanna try or run occasionally.\n\n93\n00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.508\nAnd I always hated giving up 60 gb for\n\n94\n00:04:51.508 --> 00:04:55.890\na second operating system\ninstalled that I rarely boot into.\n\n95\n00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.239\nWith native boot, I can store a whole\nbunch of these VHDs that are sized\n\n96\n00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:02.901\nappropriately on my existing partition.\n\n97\n00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:04.275\nAnd then,\njust choose to boot to them when I\n\n98\n00:05:04.275 --> 00:05:04.909\nneed to.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's crazy.\n\n99\n00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:05.535\n&gt;&gt; So it's really great.\n\n100\n00:05:05.535 --> 00:05:09.356\nYou could have up to 512\ndifferent VHD access in your,\n\n101\n00:05:09.356 --> 00:05:13.177\nas a bootable for\nthe native boot configuration here, so\n\n102\n00:05:13.177 --> 00:05:14.754\nit's a little crazy.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n103\n00:05:14.754 --> 00:05:17.121\n&gt;&gt; I'd get so confused with that many, or\n\n104\n00:05:17.121 --> 00:05:19.202\njust-\n&gt;&gt; Could you imagine your boot menu,\n\n105\n00:05:19.202 --> 00:05:21.889\nif you had to choose between\n512 different installs?\n\n106\n00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.101\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know.\n\n107\n00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:24.856\nBut at least you have that option there,\nand\n\n108\n00:05:24.856 --> 00:05:26.995\nMike you did bring up some\nreally good Good points.\n\n109\n00:05:26.995 --> 00:05:32.025\nI think situations that would benefit\nthe most from this type of configuration\n\n110\n00:05:32.025 --> 00:05:36.585\nwould be if you're already\nutilizing VHDs in your environment,\n\n111\n00:05:36.585 --> 00:05:38.025\nbecause you already have\nthem laying around.\n\n112\n00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:39.925\nMaybe that's how you deploy, so\n\n113\n00:05:39.925 --> 00:05:44.495\nit's a very dynamic way of\nbeing able to like Mike said.\n\n114\n00:05:44.495 --> 00:05:48.115\nSo maybe I'm a developer and I wanna spin\nup a machine temporarily, bring it down or\n\n115\n00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:50.720\nhave multiples\n&gt;&gt; Without worrying so\n\n116\n00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.930\nmuch about that space.\n\n117\n00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.060\nI will say, though space is something\nto consider because when you\n\n118\n00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.927\ncreate your here, with your\nnative boot scenario of your VHD.\n\n119\n00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:04.064\nThe page file is going\nto be stored separately.\n\n120\n00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:07.249\nSo that is going to be,\nI know page files are small, but\n\n121\n00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:09.482\nit is something to keep in mind there.\n\n122\n00:06:09.482 --> 00:06:13.528\nSo you still have to keep in consideration\nabout your actual physical disc size\n\n123\n00:06:13.528 --> 00:06:14.030\nas well.\n\n124\n00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.084\nBecause we're not gonna be\nworking with dynamic discs here.\n\n125\n00:06:18.084 --> 00:06:20.180\nWe're gonna be looking at our fixed discs,\nso\n\n126\n00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.070\nthat is something to keep in mind as well.\n\n127\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.550\nBut I mean, it is what it is, so-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n128\n00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.040\nAnd I know we used to use this in\na scenario, way back in the day,\n\n129\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.820\nat another company I worked for.\n\n130\n00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.130\nWe actually ran a testing center for\ncertification exams, two different\n\n131\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.650\nvendors, two completely different\nset-ups for the test environment.\n\n132\n00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.494\nBut we only had so many machines to\nallow people to come and take tests.\n\n133\n00:06:41.494 --> 00:06:45.858\nAnd so what we did was take advantage of\nthat native boot and we had two VHDs, each\n\n134\n00:06:45.858 --> 00:06:50.553\nwith the different testing platforms and\nsetup required to administer those tests.\n\n135\n00:06:50.553 --> 00:06:54.825\nAnd so when our test center when we came\nin in the morning morning, we would see\n\n136\n00:06:54.825 --> 00:06:59.263\nwhat was on our schedule for that day,\nwe'd pick the appropriate VHD to boot to.\n\n137\n00:06:59.263 --> 00:07:01.248\nAnd it was very, very easy to do and\n\n138\n00:07:01.248 --> 00:07:05.110\nI could make adjustments to that\nVHD offline somewhere else.\n\n139\n00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.690\nAnd then, just replace the VHD with his\nnew VHD, swap it out in the boot order and\n\n140\n00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.380\nwe were good to go so\nit kept our test centre up and running.\n\n141\n00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.442\nAnd allowed us to run with less physical\nequipment and still have multiple But\n\n142\n00:07:17.442 --> 00:07:21.863\nstill very separate configuration because\nthat was one of the things in our case in\n\n143\n00:07:21.863 --> 00:07:25.964\nthe testing center, they couldn't be\nconfigured the same on one machine.\n\n144\n00:07:25.964 --> 00:07:29.871\nYou see some different scenarios when\nwe run into situations like that.\n\n145\n00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:33.715\nWe have to have that isolation.\n&gt;&gt; It's actually a perfect way to explain\n\n146\n00:07:33.715 --> 00:07:38.004\nthat Mike, and it will make some sense if\nwe can correlate it with this page that I\n\n147\n00:07:38.004 --> 00:07:38.644\nhave here.\n\n148\n00:07:38.644 --> 00:07:42.958\nSo here I just have my Windows document or\nMicrosoft document's page and\n\n149\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:47.506\nit says deploy Windows with a VHDX,\nhere we are talking about native boot.\n\n150\n00:07:47.506 --> 00:07:51.800\nAnd if I scrolled down to this\ncommon scenario section here,\n\n151\n00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.445\nwhat Mike was saying there is\nexactly what they have listed here.\n\n152\n00:07:56.445 --> 00:08:00.822\nSo for example, one of their common\nscenarios would be mounting reference to\n\n153\n00:08:00.822 --> 00:08:03.935\nthe VHDX images or\nremote shares for image servicing.\n\n154\n00:08:03.935 --> 00:08:08.426\nSo it's a really Easy way\nto service images without\n\n155\n00:08:08.426 --> 00:08:12.506\nhaving to have direct\naccess to that machine.\n\n156\n00:08:12.506 --> 00:08:14.390\nSo it's pretty cool there.\n\n157\n00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:19.020\nA couple of other common scenarios here,\nlike Mike had said.\n\n158\n00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:25.160\nUsually, in a very dynamic environment or\neven I know a lot of people that\n\n159\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.210\nuse this even on their personal computers,\nbecause it's an easy way.\n\n160\n00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.980\nThey don't have to worry\nabout their operating system.\n\n161\n00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.460\nEspecially if they're\nplaying around a lot.\n\n162\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:40.031\nAnd they've always got their VHD file to\nfall back on if things get messed up.\n\n163\n00:08:40.031 --> 00:08:43.005\nSo just a few things to consider here.\n\n164\n00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:45.095\nConfiguring the HDX files for\n\n165\n00:08:45.095 --> 00:08:47.975\nnative boot without requiring\na full parent installation.\n\n166\n00:08:47.975 --> 00:08:50.797\nSo just again,\ntake a look at this common scenarios.\n\n167\n00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:54.327\nYou might see something like that in the\nfuture, just make sure you understand why\n\n168\n00:08:54.327 --> 00:08:57.227\nor how this process works\nbefore we get started here.\n\n169\n00:08:57.227 --> 00:09:01.048\nI want you to really take a look\nalso at requirements, all right?\n\n170\n00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:05.693\nSo you have to think about the local\ndisk that we're working with must\n\n171\n00:09:05.693 --> 00:09:07.838\nhave at least two partitions.\n\n172\n00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:12.788\nSo we need to have a bootable\nenvironment in some capacity.\n\n173\n00:09:12.788 --> 00:09:16.399\nIt doesn't necessarily mean an operating\nsystem has to be on it, but you must have\n\n174\n00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:20.379\nsome form of bootable environment,\nmaybe like a WinPE environment.\n\n175\n00:09:20.379 --> 00:09:23.659\nIn our demonstrations we're gonna\nbe running with Windows 10,\n\n176\n00:09:23.659 --> 00:09:27.919\nbut just know that you have to have\nat least those two partitions there.\n\n177\n00:09:29.414 --> 00:09:30.524\nAnd what else?\n\n178\n00:09:30.524 --> 00:09:34.194\nAgain, just harkening what we were talking\nabout here with the local disk partition,\n\n179\n00:09:34.194 --> 00:09:36.484\nmaking sure we have enough free space for\n\n180\n00:09:36.484 --> 00:09:41.484\nthat expanding VHDX if we're\ngonna have a maximum size there.\n\n181\n00:09:41.484 --> 00:09:47.324\nAnd again, just note that the page\nfile is created outside the VHDX file,\n\n182\n00:09:47.324 --> 00:09:50.470\nso you do need to take\nthat into consideration.\n\n183\n00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.930\nLots of benefits here as\nwe've already talked about.\n\n184\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.810\nLet's take a look at\nsome of the limitations.\n\n185\n00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.980\nI feel like,\nfrom may be a testing stand point,\n\n186\n00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:04.060\nthis is what Microsoft really\nwants you to understand.\n\n187\n00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:10.400\nWith that being said, I don't 100% agree\nwith all of these limitations, and\n\n188\n00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.270\nthat's simple because I've broken them.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.390\n&gt;&gt; So know that these are,\n\n190\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.830\nI guess these would probably\nbe like preferences.\n\n191\n00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.920\nSo for the elementations here.\n\n192\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.820\nSo looking at what they are doing in\ndemonstration with nested virtualization.\n\n193\n00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.150\nBut just knowing that production\nenvironments is not recommended to go\n\n194\n00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.780\nahead and run nested virtualization, but\n\n195\n00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.140\nthat's what we will be\nlooking at here today.\n\n196\n00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:38.660\nAlso don't let this confuse you,\nbecause we were just talking about\n\n197\n00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:44.400\nhow convenient it was to go ahead and\nservice those image from an SMB share.\n\n198\n00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.844\nAnd here you like, well, this limitations\nsays that native HDX boot is not supported\n\n199\n00:10:48.844 --> 00:10:51.550\nover server messaging block shares.\n\n200\n00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:55.660\nIt means those are not contradictory,\nin fact they just means,\n\n201\n00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.140\nlook you can't boot from across\nthe network from that SMB share, but\n\n202\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.900\nyou can service that remotely that way.\n\n203\n00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.210\nSo just keeping that in mind,\njust take a look at those limitations, and\n\n204\n00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:06.940\nI think you'll be good to go.\n\n205\n00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:12.768\nA complimentary show is gonna be any\nof our shows about virtual hard disks.\n\n206\n00:11:12.768 --> 00:11:16.131\nBecause you really need to understand\nwhat a virtual hard disk is and\n\n207\n00:11:16.131 --> 00:11:20.181\nhow they function in order to really,\nI feel like, grasp this concept.\n\n208\n00:11:20.181 --> 00:11:22.865\nSo you might wanna watch this show and\n\n209\n00:11:22.865 --> 00:11:26.915\nthen go watch the virtual hard\ndisk show and then come back and\n\n210\n00:11:26.915 --> 00:11:30.710\nlook at that information\nholistically before you start a lab.\n\n211\n00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.476\nI'm just throwing that out there as well.\n\n212\n00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:35.800\nSo we're not gonna spend a lot of\ntime in this show, but just so\n\n213\n00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.580\nthat there are resources for you.\n\n214\n00:11:38.912 --> 00:11:42.400\nAll right, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my virtual machine here.\n\n215\n00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.830\nI have just a Windows 10 box and\nwhat we're gonna do first is we're gonna\n\n216\n00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.290\ncreate a virtual hard disc to go ahead and\nset that up.\n\n217\n00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.050\nAnd another thing,\n\n218\n00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:57.140\non that limitations page, it did say VHDX\nis what you should be working with here.\n\n219\n00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.160\nI have done this with VHDs in the past.\n\n220\n00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.895\nI don't know if that's a feature that they\nkinda want us to not utilize in here and\n\n221\n00:12:04.895 --> 00:12:07.750\nkinda work more with VHDX extensions.\n\n222\n00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.970\nBut that's just something\nto keep in mind as well.\n\n223\n00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.040\nThere are a number of ways where\nyou can create a virtual machine.\n\n224\n00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.600\nAnd like I said this really\nisn't the show for that.\n\n225\n00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:22.200\nSo I'm just gonna create one, an easy way\nthat I like to go about getting there.\n\n226\n00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.810\nAnd again, you can just go straight\nfrom your settings here and\n\n227\n00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.060\ntype disk management.\n\n228\n00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.605\nAnd it's kinda funny how it says\ncreate and format, let me zoom in, so\n\n229\n00:12:33.605 --> 00:12:35.440\nyou guys can see that.\n\n230\n00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:41.000\nCreate and format hard disk partitions,\nwhich will bring us to disk management.\n\n231\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.910\nAlternatively, you could launch that\ncomputer management either from the run\n\n232\n00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.170\nline or a search or a control panel.\n\n233\n00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.390\nThere's a number of ways we\ncan get to these things here.\n\n234\n00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.080\nBut I'm just gonna close out of here and\nthen bring up that run line,\n\n235\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.590\nso you can see my favorite\nway of getting there.\n\n236\n00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.960\nSo we'll just go ahead and type run and\nif you can see, I have diskmgmt.msc,\n\n237\n00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.890\nI think that's just because it's super\nfast to go ahead and type that and\n\n238\n00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.190\npull up this management.\n\n239\n00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.506\nI might have clicked it twice, we'll see.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n240\n00:13:16.506 --> 00:13:19.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, so\n\n241\n00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.560\nthis is the graphical interface\nthat allows you to create and\n\n242\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.280\nwork with hard disk drives,\ndisk management, hence the name.\n\n243\n00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.340\nWhat we're gonna do here\nfrom top right-hand corner.\n\n244\n00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:36.870\nWe'll go ahead, under the action menu,\nand we're gonna create VHD, all right.\n\n245\n00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.398\nSo we're creating a VHD.\n\n246\n00:13:37.398 --> 00:13:42.347\nNow remember the term VHD is\nkinda like an umbrella term for\n\n247\n00:13:42.347 --> 00:13:47.510\neither VHD or VHDX, so\nit's just kinda short hand for that.\n\n248\n00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.940\nIt's not saying hey,\nwe're only creating VHD versions.\n\n249\n00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.040\nYou can see that right here I have\nthe ability to create VHD or VHDX.\n\n250\n00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.200\nSo we're gonna stick with VHDX files in\nthis demonstration that's what Microsoft\n\n251\n00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.420\nrecommends, and they're great.\n\n252\n00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:07.630\nThey have a lot of features\nthat VHD files don't have.\n\n253\n00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:12.230\nSo we're gonna go ahead and select\na fixed size for our particular drive.\n\n254\n00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.690\nAnd we need to specify a location.\n\n255\n00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:18.340\nI can't remember if I've created a folder\nfor this already, so let's go ahead and\n\n256\n00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.860\nbrowse.\n\n257\n00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.281\nI try to stay organized, because I\ncan barely keep track of a few VHDs.\n\n258\n00:14:23.281 --> 00:14:23.794\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n259\n00:14:23.794 --> 00:14:25.225\n&gt;&gt; And like I said,\n\n260\n00:14:25.225 --> 00:14:28.225\nwith 512 that would be insane.\n\n261\n00:14:28.225 --> 00:14:31.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That would be a little nightmare.\n\n262\n00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let's see here,\n\n263\n00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.530\nlet me zoom out a little bit.\n\n264\n00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.710\nOkay, so I actually don't have\nthe folder that I wanna have.\n\n265\n00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.140\nSo let me just go ahead and create this\nnew folder and we're gonna call this VHD.\n\n266\n00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.050\nAnd then from in here, we'll go ahead and\n\n267\n00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:52.370\ncreate demo for our demo VHDX here.\n\n268\n00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.380\nAnd we can see that VHDX is selected\nthere, so we'll go ahead and hit save.\n\n269\n00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.700\nWe do need to specify a size, so I'm\njust gonna go ahead and change this one.\n\n270\n00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.370\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nput 60 gigs here for this machine.\n\n271\n00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.850\nAnd I think we should be all set there,\nwe'll go ahead and create that.\n\n272\n00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.110\nIt may take a few moments to go ahead and\nactually create this virtual disk.\n\n273\n00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.560\nSo what I'm gonna do is,\nlet's go ahead and do a TV timeout.\n\n274\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.130\nAnd then when it comes back,\nwe'll be all set to go.\n\n275\n00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.090\nOkay, so we have created that VHDX.\n\n276\n00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.590\nWe don't see it in Disk Management yet.\n\n277\n00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:33.150\nSo the operating system\nisn't recognizing it as\n\n278\n00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.530\nbeing attached there\nwe're gonna get to that.\n\n279\n00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.700\nBut I do wanna show you\nthat it is in fact created\n\n280\n00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.630\nunder the directory that we had chosen.\n\n281\n00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.990\nSo here under our C drive.\n\n282\n00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.860\nUnder our VHD folder.\n\n283\n00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.960\nWe can see that demo VHDX\nfile that we created.\n\n284\n00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.050\nAnd see the size there, all right.\n\n285\n00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:57.977\nSo now that we have this virtual hard\ndisk, what if we wanna go ahead and\n\n286\n00:15:57.977 --> 00:16:00.660\ninstall a clean copy of Windows 10?\n\n287\n00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.311\nHow would we do that?\n\n288\n00:16:02.311 --> 00:16:05.345\nWell, what I've done is\nI've attached a USB drive.\n\n289\n00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:07.077\nAnd you can see that noted right here.\n\n290\n00:16:07.077 --> 00:16:08.912\nThis is my removable disk.\n\n291\n00:16:08.912 --> 00:16:14.276\nAnd it's already been formatted utilizing\nthe media Creation tools so it's ready\n\n292\n00:16:14.276 --> 00:16:19.272\nto go to slap a Windows 10 install on\nthis VHDX that we've already created.\n\n293\n00:16:19.272 --> 00:16:23.590\nSo what I'm going to do\nis reboot this machine.\n\n294\n00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:29.331\nAnd because this USB stick is plugged in,\nit's going to look to that and begin and\n\n295\n00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:35.002\ninitiate the installation process which\nyou should already be familiar with.\n\n296\n00:16:35.002 --> 00:16:37.260\nNow we've done quite a few times.\n\n297\n00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:42.013\nBut when we get to the actual page to\nselect the disc where we want to install\n\n298\n00:16:42.013 --> 00:16:47.163\nthe Windows 10 OS, that's where things\nare going to get a little different.\n\n299\n00:16:47.163 --> 00:16:50.418\nSo we'll see how quick it takes here for\nthis restart.\n\n300\n00:16:50.418 --> 00:16:52.542\nIt shouldn't take too long but\nthen we will go ahead and\n\n301\n00:16:52.542 --> 00:16:57.758\nwalk through that process.\n&gt;&gt; It'll take longer since we're watching,\n\n302\n00:16:57.758 --> 00:16:58.554\nI'm sure.\n&gt;&gt; Of course it\n\n303\n00:16:58.554 --> 00:16:59.186\nwill.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:02.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just like the last time out,\n\n305\n00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.312\nMike.\n\n306\n00:17:03.312 --> 00:17:04.718\nAlways, yeah, but\n\n307\n00:17:04.718 --> 00:17:10.436\nthere are a lot of different ways that we\ncan configure our native boot scenarios.\n\n308\n00:17:10.436 --> 00:17:12.197\nAnd so this is just one.\n\n309\n00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:16.913\nAnd there really are a lot of different,\nyou can kind of get creative with it.\n\n310\n00:17:16.913 --> 00:17:20.516\nSo I'm just showing you some\nsituations where I would use it, and\n\n311\n00:17:20.516 --> 00:17:22.623\nthat's what we're looking at here.\n\n312\n00:17:22.623 --> 00:17:27.319\nWe'll also perform another\ndemonstration where we actually apply\n\n313\n00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:31.447\nthe operating system to the VHDX\nin a different way as well.\n\n314\n00:17:31.447 --> 00:17:35.140\nSo just a couple different\nways to get this done.\n\n315\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.545\nSo this will be just like\na regular installation.\n\n316\n00:17:41.545 --> 00:17:44.746\nLike I said,\nit's going to go through that process.\n\n317\n00:17:44.746 --> 00:17:47.228\nAnd you know what I think we might\njust go ahead and do a TV timeout so\n\n318\n00:17:47.228 --> 00:17:48.594\nyou guys don't have to watch this.\n\n319\n00:17:48.594 --> 00:17:50.266\nWe'll get to the page that matters.\n\n320\n00:17:50.266 --> 00:17:55.320\nSo you'll get to your regional settings,\nselecting your language and all of that.\n\n321\n00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.484\nBut once you get to the screen\nwhere it displays the disks and\n\n322\n00:17:58.484 --> 00:18:02.545\nasks you where you want to install it,\nthat's where we'll come back at it.\n\n323\n00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:06.584\nOkay, so here we have it.\n\n324\n00:18:06.584 --> 00:18:08.475\nThe screen we were all waiting for.\n\n325\n00:18:08.475 --> 00:18:11.547\nI see my disks,\nI've already accepted my ULA.\n\n326\n00:18:11.547 --> 00:18:15.098\nI don't see the virtual hard\ndisk that we've just created, so\n\n327\n00:18:15.098 --> 00:18:17.640\nwhat I need to do is actually attach it.\n\n328\n00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.857\nIn order to do so\nI need to utilize disk utility.\n\n329\n00:18:20.857 --> 00:18:25.010\nLet's go ahead and\nhold down your Shift key and\n\n330\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.321\nhit F10 and then type in disk part.\n\n331\n00:18:28.321 --> 00:18:30.156\nSo now we're in disk part and\n\n332\n00:18:30.156 --> 00:18:34.760\nwhat we need to do is to actually select\nthe disk that we wanna work with.\n\n333\n00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.265\nSo if we say select, and then VDISK,\nand we need to specify the file\n\n334\n00:18:39.265 --> 00:18:43.781\nlocation because remember virtual\nhard drives are in fact files.\n\n335\n00:18:43.781 --> 00:18:48.390\nSo if we say file =, and\nremember that was on our C:.\n\n336\n00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.426\nAnd then we had a folder with vhd, and\n\n337\n00:18:50.426 --> 00:18:52.933\nthen the actual name\nof that was demo.vhdx.\n\n338\n00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:58.160\nOops, what did I type wrong?\n\n339\n00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.805\nI've made that typo before\nwith an e instead of a t, so\n\n340\n00:19:01.805 --> 00:19:05.856\nwe wanna make sure we have that,\nand then we'll hit enter.\n\n341\n00:19:05.856 --> 00:19:10.218\nAnd right here you can see that\ndisk part successfully selected\n\n342\n00:19:10.218 --> 00:19:12.800\nthe virtual disk file.\n\n343\n00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.497\nSo that's cool.\n\n344\n00:19:13.497 --> 00:19:17.645\nWhat we need to do now is actually attach\nit so the OS can work with it, or so\n\n345\n00:19:17.645 --> 00:19:20.914\nthat we can actually install\nthe operating system on it.\n\n346\n00:19:20.914 --> 00:19:25.717\nSo all we're going to type is attach and\nthen VDisk.\n\n347\n00:19:25.717 --> 00:19:27.600\nWe'll hit Enter.\n\n348\n00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.984\nAnd then you can see that disk\npart successfully attached\n\n349\n00:19:30.984 --> 00:19:32.405\nthe virtual disk file.\n\n350\n00:19:32.405 --> 00:19:34.650\nSo let's exit out of here.\n\n351\n00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.474\nYou'll need to actually double X it\nbecause we were inside of Disk Utility\n\n352\n00:19:39.474 --> 00:19:41.288\ninside of that command prompt there.\n\n353\n00:19:41.288 --> 00:19:43.050\nNow, we don't see it yet,\n\n354\n00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:47.700\nwhat we need to do is actually\nhit the Refresh button down here.\n\n355\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.709\nAnd it does say that Windows\ncan´t be installed on Drive 0.\n\n356\n00:19:50.709 --> 00:19:54.055\nWe´re not gonna worry about that yet,\nwe´re going to hit Refresh and\n\n357\n00:19:54.055 --> 00:19:56.958\nthen we´re going to select that\ndrive that we just created.\n\n358\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:59.549\nSo give it a second here.\n\n359\n00:19:59.549 --> 00:20:05.538\nAnd now we can see Drive 2, this is our\n60-gig VHDX file that we just created.\n\n360\n00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:09.834\nAnd we'll go ahead and hit Next, and\nproceed with the installation process.\n\n361\n00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:12.630\nNow you guys know that\nthis does take some time.\n\n362\n00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:16.958\nSo again, were gonna do another TV\ntimeout, and I 'll show you what it looks\n\n363\n00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:19.521\nlike during that final reboot there.\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n364\n00:20:21.736 --> 00:20:22.269\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n365\n00:20:22.269 --> 00:20:24.476\nhere we can see that we have our window.\n\n366\n00:20:24.476 --> 00:20:28.671\nAnd I actually have two separate\ninstances of Windows 10, and\n\n367\n00:20:28.671 --> 00:20:31.670\nit prompts me to choose\nan operating system.\n\n368\n00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:33.797\nNow, I could have installed\na different operating system.\n\n369\n00:20:33.797 --> 00:20:36.366\nI just chose Windows 10 because\nI'm not too creative and\n\n370\n00:20:36.366 --> 00:20:38.380\nwe're in a Windows 10 show.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n371\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.132\n&gt;&gt; So we have the different volumes that\n\n372\n00:20:40.132 --> 00:20:40.873\nwe can select.\n\n373\n00:20:40.873 --> 00:20:43.489\nSo this is essentially\nwhat native boot is.\n\n374\n00:20:43.489 --> 00:20:47.834\nSo we'll go ahead and\nselect one of our instances here.\n\n375\n00:20:47.834 --> 00:20:51.839\nAnd if I were a developer and\nI wanted to test my code,\n\n376\n00:20:51.839 --> 00:20:54.941\nI could simply just restart my machine.\n\n377\n00:20:54.941 --> 00:21:00.569\nSo once I had attached multiple,\nup to 512, virtual hard disks, I could run\n\n378\n00:21:00.569 --> 00:21:06.203\nthrough that list and then begin testing\nmy app or whatever it was I had created.\n\n379\n00:21:06.203 --> 00:21:10.964\nSo it's just gonna take a little bit of\ntime here because just like with any new\n\n380\n00:21:10.964 --> 00:21:16.035\nfresh Windows installation it's got to\nload all the files associated with that.\n\n381\n00:21:16.035 --> 00:21:20.400\nBut you can see here, look,\nthis is a different interface here.\n\n382\n00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.337\nNot that copy of Windows 10\nthat we were working with.\n\n383\n00:21:23.337 --> 00:21:25.813\nAnd that's one way you can go ahead and\n\n384\n00:21:25.813 --> 00:21:28.804\nutilize Native Boot.\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, Cherokee.\n\n385\n00:21:28.804 --> 00:21:29.464\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n386\n00:21:29.464 --> 00:21:33.890\nso I do think that we'll go ahead and look\nat another method that we can utilize.\n\n387\n00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:38.881\nBut let me close out of this machine\nbecause I have a separate virtual\n\n388\n00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:41.169\nmachine that I wanna use here.\n\n389\n00:21:41.169 --> 00:21:43.925\nSo let me just shut\nthis down gracefully so\n\n390\n00:21:43.925 --> 00:21:47.435\nwe don't break anything.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Always\n\n391\n00:21:47.435 --> 00:21:48.596\nnice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n392\n00:21:48.596 --> 00:21:51.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n393\n00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.672\n&gt;&gt; Actually, it might take a second to go\n\n394\n00:21:52.672 --> 00:21:54.194\nahead and boot this other machine up.\n\n395\n00:21:54.194 --> 00:21:57.070\nSo let me just see what we've got here.\n\n396\n00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.890\nI created some snapshots, and\nlet's see, we'll go to show_ready.\n\n397\n00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.385\nHopefully, that's the right one.\n\n398\n00:22:05.385 --> 00:22:11.128\n[LAUGH] And then wait for\nthis one to go ahead and\n\n399\n00:22:11.128 --> 00:22:14.615\nboot up here, power it on.\n\n400\n00:22:14.615 --> 00:22:18.292\nSo this is just going to be another\nway that we could go ahead and\n\n401\n00:22:18.292 --> 00:22:19.655\nutilize Native Boot.\n\n402\n00:22:19.655 --> 00:22:24.440\nWe're gonna use different tools here,\nthough, a little different method.\n\n403\n00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.022\nI do want to show you diskpart, but\n\n404\n00:22:26.022 --> 00:22:28.489\nthere are a lot of different\nways that you can do this.\n\n405\n00:22:28.489 --> 00:22:30.106\nSo this is just, again,\n\n406\n00:22:30.106 --> 00:22:34.459\njust another way that I like to do that.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, that was pretty\n\n407\n00:22:34.459 --> 00:22:36.539\ncool, what do you have for us next?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n408\n00:22:36.539 --> 00:22:39.797\nso Mike, that was one way\nwe can utilize Native Boot.\n\n409\n00:22:39.797 --> 00:22:44.293\nHowever, I do wanna show you guys other\ntypes of scenarios just in case you might\n\n410\n00:22:44.293 --> 00:22:45.647\nsee that in the future.\n\n411\n00:22:45.647 --> 00:22:48.974\nSo one way that Windows likes to, I guess,\n\n412\n00:22:48.974 --> 00:22:54.170\nmake sure we understand is by\nutilizing command line utilities.\n\n413\n00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:57.856\nSo I know we've been working in diskpart\nquite a bit but I do wanna show you\n\n414\n00:22:57.856 --> 00:23:01.377\ndifferent ways that we can actually\ncreate a Native Boot situation.\n\n415\n00:23:01.377 --> 00:23:03.415\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\n\n416\n00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:08.713\nin the past demo we actually utilized disk\nmanagement to create that virtual disk.\n\n417\n00:23:08.713 --> 00:23:11.454\nHere I want to actually utilize diskpart.\n\n418\n00:23:11.454 --> 00:23:13.390\nSo we'll go ahead and start that up.\n\n419\n00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.661\nI just have an administrative\ncommand prompt and\n\n420\n00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:21.301\nI'm typing in diskpart to go ahead and\nenter that diskpart utility.\n\n421\n00:23:21.301 --> 00:23:25.730\nSo you can see,\njust give it a second there, okay.\n\n422\n00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.230\nWhenever you see this little portion here\nbefore that caret that'll let you know\n\n423\n00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.527\nthat you're in the utility.\n\n424\n00:23:30.527 --> 00:23:34.904\nNow I've copied the syntax back here.\n\n425\n00:23:34.904 --> 00:23:40.155\nLet me just go ahead and grab that for\nus, and we'll paste that in.\n\n426\n00:23:40.155 --> 00:23:43.750\nLet me make sure it did paste.\n\n427\n00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:49.228\nI think I saw something,\nwhoops, let me see.\n\n428\n00:23:49.228 --> 00:23:50.620\nScroll up and see what it's telling me.\n\n429\n00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:58.037\nInside my virtual machine sometimes my\ncursor doesn't work the way I want it to.\n\n430\n00:23:58.037 --> 00:23:59.108\nSo let me just go up.\n\n431\n00:23:59.108 --> 00:24:00.951\nYou know what,\nlet me just clear out of here.\n\n432\n00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.029\nOkay, and we'll do that again.\n\n433\n00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:09.705\nAll right, okay, that was my fault.\n\n434\n00:24:09.705 --> 00:24:16.766\nWe're gonna hit Cancel because I\naccidentally hit the X, so Copy.\n\n435\n00:24:16.766 --> 00:24:19.211\nAnd then we'll go ahead and\npaste this in here.\n\n436\n00:24:19.211 --> 00:24:23.830\nAll right, so let me see if I can zoom\nin so we can talk about this real quick.\n\n437\n00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:26.270\nI'll just explain to you\nwhat I have typed, and\n\n438\n00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:29.021\nI'll also put this in the show notes for\nthis syntax.\n\n439\n00:24:29.021 --> 00:24:30.571\nIt actually makes a lot of sense, Mike.\n\n440\n00:24:30.571 --> 00:24:35.570\nSo what we're doing here is we're\nsaying create V disk, not just disks.\n\n441\n00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.135\nSo remember, this is a virtual disk.\n\n442\n00:24:37.135 --> 00:24:40.111\nAnd then we're specifying\nthe file like we saw,\n\n443\n00:24:40.111 --> 00:24:42.514\nleveraging that path in the last demo.\n\n444\n00:24:42.514 --> 00:24:48.500\nSo you say file = c:\\vhd.\n\n445\n00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:53.703\nSo this is the folder that I want\nto house that actual VHDX file in.\n\n446\n00:24:53.703 --> 00:24:57.765\nSo then I create another back slash to\ntype the name of the VHDX here, and\n\n447\n00:24:57.765 --> 00:25:00.410\nI'm just gonna call this one demo disk.\n\n448\n00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:04.894\nAnd then I go ahead and\nset my maximum size for that drive.\n\n449\n00:25:04.894 --> 00:25:09.800\nAnd so I wanted to create a 25-gig drive.\n\n450\n00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.382\nSo what I did was just added a little\nbit of space here for that page file.\n\n451\n00:25:13.382 --> 00:25:17.431\nSo if you guys remember, in your real\nworld scenarios you would need to have\n\n452\n00:25:17.431 --> 00:25:19.620\na little bit of flux room there.\n\n453\n00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.473\nI also want to indicate that the type\nof drive that I'm creating is fixed, so\n\n454\n00:25:23.473 --> 00:25:25.355\nwe'll go ahead and hit Enter there.\n\n455\n00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.206\nOkay, so what happened here was\nI had been playing around and\n\n456\n00:25:33.206 --> 00:25:35.724\nI started creating this actual drive.\n\n457\n00:25:35.724 --> 00:25:41.300\nSo all we need to do is\nchange the name of this disk.\n\n458\n00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:48.833\nAnd hopefully I have enough physical disk\nspace to go ahead and create this drive.\n\n459\n00:25:48.833 --> 00:25:51.090\nSo you guys wouldn't see that error.\n\n460\n00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:54.938\nThe reason that I have it is because I had\nalready started creating it at one point\n\n461\n00:25:54.938 --> 00:25:57.076\nin time and\nit still had that info retained.\n\n462\n00:25:57.076 --> 00:26:00.990\nBut this is just like creating\na virtual disk in your GUI.\n\n463\n00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.957\nSo it will take some time.\n\n464\n00:26:02.957 --> 00:26:05.920\nI don't know if we have enough\nof that here to spare, Mike.\n\n465\n00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.393\nYeah, we're a little short so\nI tell you what.\n\n466\n00:26:07.393 --> 00:26:09.860\nWe'll go ahead and let that process run.\n\n467\n00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.263\nAnd then in our next part, we'll come\nback, we'll see that disk is finished and\n\n468\n00:26:13.263 --> 00:26:14.225\nwe'll go from there.\n\n469\n00:26:14.225 --> 00:26:16.086\nSound like a plan?\n&gt;&gt; It does sound like a plan, thank you.\n\n470\n00:26:16.086 --> 00:26:16.590\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n471\n00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:19.318\nwell I hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one then.\n\n472\n00:26:19.318 --> 00:26:22.083\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n473\n00:26:22.083 --> 00:26:22.886\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n474\n00:26:22.886 --> 00:26:23.868\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n475\n00:26:23.868 -->

you live from San Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:07.770\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.202\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:15.960\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.130\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.607\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10, getting ready for\n\n9\n00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:23.204\nthat 70-698 exam.\n\n10\n00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:26.625\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at installing Windows.\n\n11\n00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:28.030\nThis is a part six.\n\n12\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.560\nThere's a lot to installing Windows, a lot\nof different ways we can go about it.\n\n13\n00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.870\nHere to keep us on track and and\n\n14\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.540\nshow us what else we need to know is\nnone other than Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n15\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.230\nWelcome, Cherokee.\n\n16\n00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n17\n00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.470\nAnd you said something\nreally interesting there.\n\n18\n00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.530\nThere are a lot of different ways so\nI do want you guys to keep that in mind.\n\n19\n00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.040\nThese are just ways that I'm showing you,\nways that I think are probably gonna,\n\n20\n00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.040\nit'd be helpful or\nbeneficial to you in the future.\n\n21\n00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.430\nBut just keep in mind, if you're like,\nwell, why did she do it that way?\n\n22\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.830\nI would probably have done it this way.\n\n23\n00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.463\nWell, that's totally fine too because\nthere are a lot of different ways that you\n\n24\n00:00:56.463 --> 00:00:58.399\ncan get this operating system installed.\n\n25\n00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.571\nI'm just trying throughout multiple\nscenarios so that you're ready to\n\n26\n00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:04.757\nhit the ground running if you're\nfaced with a certain situation there.\n\n27\n00:01:04.757 --> 00:01:06.657\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nI wonder how could be on the exam, right?\n\n28\n00:01:06.657 --> 00:01:08.181\nWe gotta know different methods and\n\n29\n00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:10.225\ndifferent scenarios\nneed different methods.\n\n30\n00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:13.959\nIf you're doing one computer,\nthree computers versus a hundred or 500,\n\n31\n00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:16.035\nyou're gonna choose a different method.\n\n32\n00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:17.138\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n33\n00:01:17.138 --> 00:01:19.338\nThis is actually our last show.\n\n34\n00:01:19.338 --> 00:01:22.806\nIt's probably gonna be shorter for\nthis particular segment here, for\n\n35\n00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:26.020\nthis domain objective, so\nwe'll go ahead and get started.\n\n36\n00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.990\nThis is a follow up to a previous episode\nat the part five where we started\n\n37\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.470\ncreating a virtual hard disk, and\n\n38\n00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.170\nso what we're gonna be doing\nis just picking right back up.\n\n39\n00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.800\nOkay, so our disk has been created.\n\n40\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.390\nWhat we need to do now is attach the disk.\n\n41\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.410\nSo we're just gonna type attach and\nthis a vdisk so\n\n42\n00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.830\nwe're gonna go ahead and oops,\nI can spell that correctly.\n\n43\n00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.441\nLet's go ahead and select or\ntype attach vdisk.\n\n44\n00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:52.470\nWe'll hit Enter.\n\n45\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.640\nAnd we can see that this part\nsuccessfully attached the virtual disk.\n\n46\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.500\nNow, in the last episode we went into\ndisk management and worked with the drive\n\n47\n00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.870\na little bit, but I'd like to do it\nall from the command prompt here.\n\n48\n00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.340\nSo what we're going to do is,\nwe're going to create a partition and\n\n49\n00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.380\nwe're gonna go ahead and\ntype in create part or partition primary.\n\n50\n00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.265\nAnd you could also just type\nin part pry if you wanted to,\n\n51\n00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:25.593\nI just wanted to show a little mixing and\nmatching.\n\n52\n00:02:25.593 --> 00:02:28.194\nAgain, remember whatever works best for\nyou.\n\n53\n00:02:28.194 --> 00:02:31.289\nSo, now that we have that\npartition on the drive,\n\n54\n00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.250\nthe next thing we need to\ndo is format the drive.\n\n55\n00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.400\nSo I'm also gonna add a label just\nto make sure I remember that this is\n\n56\n00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.900\nin a fact a vhdx file.\n\n57\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.521\nSo what I'm going to type\nhere is format quick.\n\n58\n00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:54.997\nAnd then I'm going to say label = and\njust put vhdx.\n\n59\n00:02:54.997 --> 00:03:04.840\n[INAUDIBLE] All right,\nshouldn't take too long.\n\n60\n00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.090\nYep, that was pretty quick there, so just\nwe went ahead and formatted that disk.\n\n61\n00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.010\nThe next thing,\n\n62\n00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.226\nthis is pretty important here, I'm\ngoing to assign a letter to this drive.\n\n63\n00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:16.821\nAnd I'm going to be using that\nletter in a little bit, so\n\n64\n00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:19.880\nit's important to remember\nwhatever letter you choose.\n\n65\n00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.120\nI just chose V, because in a lot\nof Microsoft documentation,\n\n66\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.140\nlike with their Steps and\nHow To, they choose V, so\n\n67\n00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.380\nit might help you if you're\nlooking at that document.\n\n68\n00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.010\nBut just keep in mind that it's whatever\nyou have to insert that in the syntax for\n\n69\n00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.320\nwhatever you choose, so\njust write it down and\n\n70\n00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.800\nremember it if you're not\ngoing to be able to remember.\n\n71\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.677\nSo here, we'll say assign letter,\ngoodness gracious, all right,\n\n72\n00:03:43.677 --> 00:03:45.780\nwhat I'm typing today.\n\n73\n00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.030\nAnd the letter here is going to be V,\nso it's assign letter V and\n\n74\n00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.140\nwe'll go ahead and hit Enter, and\nreally that's it at this point in time.\n\n75\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.960\nSo we can go ahead and\nexit out of diskpart.\n\n76\n00:04:01.093 --> 00:04:03.300\nAnd let me just minimize that.\n\n77\n00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.570\nI do want to pull up\nDisk Management to show you\n\n78\n00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.570\nthat drive now that we've actually\nassigned a letter to it there.\n\n79\n00:04:23.775 --> 00:04:25.145\nAnd again, like I said,\n\n80\n00:04:25.145 --> 00:04:28.490\nit's really easy to work with\nthese disks in the GUI as well.\n\n81\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.720\nNotice how disk one here is blue, and\n\n82\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.990\nthat's just going to be an indication that\nthis is an actual virtual disk whereas my\n\n83\n00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.200\nphysical disk here is\ngoing to be noted in grey.\n\n84\n00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.010\nAnd so if I wanted to work\nwith this disk let's say,\n\n85\n00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.670\nI could just right click on it and\nthen I would be able to go ahead and\n\n86\n00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.540\nmodify the properties to change the later\nif I wanted to or anything like that.\n\n87\n00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.970\nSo just play around in there,\nwe will spend time in Disk Management\n\n88\n00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.400\nworking with disks in our later shows,\nso just don't worry about that for now.\n\n89\n00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.680\nAnother thing I wanted to show\nyou guys is, real quick, and\n\n90\n00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.970\nthen again, this is a show on disks.\n\n91\n00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.525\nBut I would like to show how to\ncreate a disk in PowerShell.\n\n92\n00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:17.122\nSo we're just gonna create a very\nsimple disk, a small disk.\n\n93\n00:05:17.122 --> 00:05:20.320\nWe're not gonna be working with it so\nI'm not too worried about the size here.\n\n94\n00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.110\nSo the syntax and again, this is\nan administrative PowerShell window, so\n\n95\n00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.680\nI'm gonna type in New,\nif I can get my cursor going, all right.\n\n96\n00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.130\nSo this going to be New-vhd,\nand remember we're not saying,\n\n97\n00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.000\nhey we're only gonna create a vhd\nextension, it can also be vhdx, the actual\n\n98\n00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.060\nname of that file is where you'll\ndetermine that type there.\n\n99\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.980\nSo we're gonna type in vhd and\nthen specify the path.\n\n100\n00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.660\nAnd if you recall, I've just been\nputting things under the C drive here so\n\n101\n00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.340\nI'm going to stick with that theme and\nwe'll go ahead and type in C.\n\n102\n00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.690\nAnd then I have that vhd folder so\nI'll just put that folder and\n\n103\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.430\nthen the actual name of the disk, so\nsince already have demo disk two,\n\n104\n00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.600\nmaybe I'll just call\nthis one demo disk three.\n\n105\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.240\n&gt;&gt; Well, I like it.\n\n106\n00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.910\n&gt;&gt; All right and so we'll say,\nthis is a vhdx file.\n\n107\n00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.670\nA couple of required parameters\nhere I'm going to specify\n\n108\n00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.180\nthat this drive here is fixed, and\nthen I will also indicate the size,\n\n109\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.610\nand the size in bytes here.\n\n110\n00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.960\nAnd that's going to be, although it does\nsay bytes, you can put GB for 5 gigs.\n\n111\n00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.340\nAnd so this is just another way.\n\n112\n00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.380\nSo we've looked at creating a drive\nthrough the graphical user interface.\n\n113\n00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.840\nAlso through disk part, and\nthen now here in PowerShell.\n\n114\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.050\nSo just to kinda get familiar with that.\n\n115\n00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.160\nAnd I still got my cursor going there.\n\n116\n00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.950\nAnd you can see the progression now.\n\n117\n00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.760\nSo it shouldn't take too long\nwith it being a small drive but\n\n118\n00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.770\nI just wanted to show you guys how\nyou would go about doing that.\n\n119\n00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.320\nBut we're not finished with demo disk\nnumber two, not quite yet, almost though.\n\n120\n00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.500\nWe need to actually apply\nan image to that disk, so\n\n121\n00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.330\nwe're gonna be using a tool that\nyou're probably familiar with now.\n\n122\n00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.690\nWe've been working with it quite a bit.\n\n123\n00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.480\nIt's the DISM tool.\n\n124\n00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.020\nSo I'm just going to minimize this as it's\ncontinuing to complete in the background\n\n125\n00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.940\nthere, and\nwe'll bring back our command prompt.\n\n126\n00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.850\nI'm just going to clear my screen so\nwe can have a nice, fresh palette here.\n\n127\n00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:38.100\nAlright, so the commune that I'm going\nto be using is going to be DISM/get and\n\n128\n00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:43.477\nthis is going to have a little hyphen,\nImageInfo.\n\n129\n00:07:43.477 --> 00:07:48.118\nAnd the reason again I'm typing this first\ncommand here, you guys may recognize this\n\n130\n00:07:48.118 --> 00:07:52.180\nfrom before, we've used this before,\njust to make sure I have the correct\n\n131\n00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.810\ninformation for the actual files\nthat I'm gonna be working with.\n\n132\n00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.380\nI don't wanna grab the wrong ones.\n\n133\n00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:11.657\nThis one's demo and my install.wim,\nremember that was extracted from my ISO,\n\n134\n00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:17.760\nand I just have it sitting inside of a\nfolder called Demo Sitting on my C drive.\n\n135\n00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.059\nSo I wanna get the information associated\nwith that particular Wim file,\n\n136\n00:08:22.059 --> 00:08:23.247\nso I'll hit Enter.\n\n137\n00:08:23.247 --> 00:08:27.192\nAnd I'm just checking because I'm\ngoing to use that index number for\n\n138\n00:08:27.192 --> 00:08:28.630\nthe next line of syntax.\n\n139\n00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.500\nSo I wanna make sure that I do\nhave the correct information here.\n\n140\n00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.810\nJust give it a second.\n\n141\n00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.790\nSo just checking the system.\n\n142\n00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.410\n&gt;&gt; It's thinking about it.\n\n143\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.069\n&gt;&gt; Almost.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n144\n00:08:46.069 --> 00:08:47.632\n&gt;&gt; And that's the thing guys,\n\n145\n00:08:47.632 --> 00:08:50.500\nalso with a lot of these\ndemos that I've been doing,\n\n146\n00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.596\nwe've been doing those TV timeouts.\n\n147\n00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:55.947\nSo just keep that in mind when you're\nrunning through these steps and\n\n148\n00:08:55.947 --> 00:08:57.000\ngoing through that.\n\n149\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.145\nSome of the things may take like 10, 15\nminutes, just depending on your hardware\n\n150\n00:09:01.145 --> 00:09:05.260\nand the status of the images, and\nfiles that you're working with.\n\n151\n00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.240\nBut here we go, we see index one here and\n\n152\n00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.950\nalso, remember this is\na Windows 10 Enterprise.\n\n153\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.160\nThis is that eval version,\nso we're good to go there.\n\n154\n00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:21.461\nNow, to actually apply the image,\nwe're again gonna be using DISM and\n\n155\n00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:26.925\nthe command here is going to\nbe /Apply-Image /ImageFile,\n\n156\n00:09:26.925 --> 00:09:29.567\nso I have to specify the file.\n\n157\n00:09:29.567 --> 00:09:33.990\nAnd that's why I had verified that\nthe other image was in fact there,\n\n158\n00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.143\nand got all that.\n\n159\n00:09:35.143 --> 00:09:41.639\nSo we'll say C:\\demo, so we're just\nmapping back to that location for\n\n160\n00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:46.877\nthat install.wim, and\nthis is where that index comes in,\n\n161\n00:09:46.877 --> 00:09:52.672\nso /index, and that was going\nto be index:1 that we verified.\n\n162\n00:09:52.672 --> 00:09:57.676\nAnd then /, and this is going to be apply,\nand the directory there.\n\n163\n00:09:57.676 --> 00:10:03.930\nSo :v, this is where that\ndrive comes in handy, right?\n\n164\n00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.800\nRemember we said that's the letter that\nwe had assigned to that vhdx there, and\n\n165\n00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.470\nwe'll hit \\.\n\n166\n00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.540\nAnd this will take a moment here,\nso we made you a TV timeout here.\n\n167\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.300\nAgain, probably about 12 minutes or\nso, for me, anyways.\n\n168\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.890\nAgain, different, depending on what\nyou're working with, to go ahead and\n\n169\n00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.720\nactually apply that Wim to this vhdx.\n\n170\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:30.630\nSo in the last demonstration,\nwe utilized the external\n\n171\n00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:35.250\nUSB to go ahead and\nboot that way and then install.\n\n172\n00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.610\nHowever, we're just going about it\na different way in this scenario.\n\n173\n00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.050\nSo we will go ahead and\nwe will do that timeout so\n\n174\n00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.560\nyou guys don't have to wait for this.\n\n175\n00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.320\nBut when we come back,\nthat image should have been applied.\n\n176\n00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:52.148\nOkay, so we're finally finished here and\nwe've applied that image.\n\n177\n00:10:52.148 --> 00:10:56.570\nThe last step that we need\nto do is actually create or\n\n178\n00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.030\nput breathable files onto that disk.\n\n179\n00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.520\nSo again, a couple of different\nways that you can do that.\n\n180\n00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.360\nI chose the easiest method, and\nthat's utilizing a tool called BCD boot.\n\n181\n00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.570\nSo we're a command line here.\n\n182\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:14.150\nSo we'll just go ahead and say bcdboot and\nit's really short as far as syntax goes.\n\n183\n00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.250\nAgain, you just need to remember\nthat drive that you've specified so\n\n184\n00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:22.640\nwe're gonna say v:\\ and\nthen we're applying our Windows\n\n185\n00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.400\nand our boot files there, so\nwe'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n186\n00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.840\n&gt;&gt; Check that, I think bcdboot might have\nan extra character in there or something.\n\n187\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.944\n&gt;&gt; It does, an extra B.\n\n188\n00:11:32.944 --> 00:11:33.520\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n189\n00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.400\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n190\n00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.135\n&gt;&gt; There's a C at\nthe beginning it looks like.\n\n191\n00:11:36.135 --> 00:11:40.068\n&gt;&gt; Ugh, jeez, all right,\nthis is just getting out of hand here.\n\n192\n00:11:40.068 --> 00:11:42.731\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; b, c, d,\n\n193\n00:11:42.731 --> 00:11:46.431\nlooking they're all crazy here.\n\n194\n00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:49.580\nbcdboot.\n\n195\n00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.928\nI said it was easy and then it took\nme three times there to get that.\n\n196\n00:11:51.928 --> 00:11:54.973\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyways, it really is easy and\n\n197\n00:11:54.973 --> 00:11:58.917\nI mean it'll go ahead and\ninstall those files for you.\n\n198\n00:11:58.917 --> 00:12:03.382\nIn the past you would have to and I mean\nyou still can, you can actually point to\n\n199\n00:12:03.382 --> 00:12:08.057\na reference point where those files are\ncontained, those boot files and copy and\n\n200\n00:12:08.057 --> 00:12:11.580\nmove them over, but\nthis is just a little bit easier for you.\n\n201\n00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.110\nOr at least I say that and\nthen you see me struggle there.\n\n202\n00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.920\nBut you can see that the boot\nfiles were successfully created.\n\n203\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:23.147\nSo let me just close out of here, and\nwhat I wanna do is perform a restart so\n\n204\n00:12:23.147 --> 00:12:26.510\nyou guys can see what\nit actually looks like.\n\n205\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.410\nAgain, we'll have the ability and it looks\nlike that I kind of locked myself up.\n\n206\n00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.390\nJust give it a second there.\n\n207\n00:12:32.745 --> 00:12:36.160\nWe'll have the ability to choose\nwhich operating system we want\n\n208\n00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.050\nto boot into like we saw\npreviously in that last demo.\n\n209\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.140\nAnd again,\nwe've only added one additional,\n\n210\n00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.000\nso we'll see both of\nthose Windows 10 options.\n\n211\n00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.520\nBut remember, you have, you can attach\nup to 512, so quite a bit there.\n\n212\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.530\nNot really sure why this\nis hanging up on me here.\n\n213\n00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.500\nStill just a little bit slow.\n\n214\n00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.840\nI think I already have this to a point.\n\n215\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.630\nWhy don't we just do another TV magic?\n\n216\n00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.000\nI'll restart the system so\nyou don't have to worry about that, but\n\n217\n00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.785\nI do wanna show you what it looks like\nwhere you have the option to choose\n\n218\n00:13:10.785 --> 00:13:12.309\nbetween different operating systems.\n\n219\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.920\nOkay, so this is what the screen\nlooks like whenever you go ahead and\n\n220\n00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.230\nrestart the system.\n\n221\n00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.022\nAgain, we only,\nwe're working with Windows 10 but\n\n222\n00:13:21.022 --> 00:13:23.886\nyou could install different\noperating systems there.\n\n223\n00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:27.850\nAnd I think that really does that,\nMike, for this demonstration.\n\n224\n00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:28.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, really cool.\n\n225\n00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.925\nI like that, being old school.\n\n226\n00:13:30.925 --> 00:13:35.049\nI'm sure a lot of you remember how\ndifficult it was or what a challenge it\n\n227\n00:13:35.049 --> 00:13:39.658\nwas sometimes to setup a multi-boot\nsystems, separate partitions, all that\n\n228\n00:13:39.658 --> 00:13:44.800\ngood stuff, working with the boot, making\nsure everything would boot properly.\n\n229\n00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.078\nThis is a very easy way to do it.\n\n230\n00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:48.840\nAnother cool thing that I don't think\nwe've mentioned is the fact that it's\n\n231\n00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.080\nportable, right?\n\n232\n00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.230\nIt is a virtual hard drive so technically,\nI could take that virtual hard drive,\n\n233\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.490\ncopy it to a thumb drive removable media,\ntake it to another machine,\n\n234\n00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.390\nadd it to the boot order and\nboot that machine to that VHD.\n\n235\n00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.610\nSo very, very cool stuff.\n\n236\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very handy.\n\n237\n00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.850\nEspecially, I think we did mention with,\nlike if you use system prep,\n\n238\n00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:11.730\nsys prep in combination with that,\na super easy way to go ahead and\n\n239\n00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:15.140\nhave a generic image there and\njust go around for deployment as well.\n\n240\n00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.880\n&gt;&gt; We use this option at one point when\nour sales team was using a particular\n\n241\n00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.640\napplication that couldn't run side by\nside with other current applications.\n\n242\n00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.611\nSo we created everybody a VHD with\nthe Windows image on it in that particular\n\n243\n00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:28.437\napplication.\n\n244\n00:14:28.437 --> 00:14:31.039\nWhen they needed it,\nthey could boot to that and use that, so\n\n245\n00:14:31.039 --> 00:14:33.020\nwe had a lot of really cool applications.\n\n246\n00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did see a lot of different\nways we can install Windows but\n\n247\n00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.680\nI think that's about it for now.\n\n248\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.250\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Cherokee,\nwe appreciate those great demonstrations.\n\n249\n00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.710\nI hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n250\n00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.450\nSigning off for

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.363 --> 00:00:15.815\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:16.965\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:22.566\nToday, we are installing and configuring\nWindows 10 preparing for that 70-698 exam.\n\n7\n00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:26.902\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ninstalling and configuring devices and\n\n8\n00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:27.810\ndrivers.\n\n9\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.880\nAnd here to help us with that is\nnone other than Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.470\nWelcome, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.580\n&gt;&gt; What's up, Mike, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.405\n&gt;&gt; It's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:32.405 --> 00:00:36.653\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so drivers, here we are, and I\nwas thinking, this will be an easy topic.\n\n14\n00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:40.937\nBut there was so much that I've\nforgot about drivers, and really so\n\n15\n00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:43.130\nmuch more to learn about drivers.\n\n16\n00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.020\nWe've seen a lot happening\nover the years here.\n\n17\n00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.518\nSo this is gonna be interesting.\n\n18\n00:00:47.518 --> 00:00:52.950\nWe're probably gonna have a part two here\nbecause there is a lot to cover but,\n\n19\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.710\ndrivers.\n\n20\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.800\nWhat is a driver, right?\n\n21\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.239\nA driver is going to be like an\ninstruction set that your operating system\n\n22\n00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.384\ncan use to communicate with the hardware,\nright?\n\n23\n00:01:02.384 --> 00:01:03.617\nYeah, Mike's over there driving.\n\n24\n00:01:03.617 --> 00:01:05.414\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say,\nnot driving Miss Daisy.\n\n25\n00:01:05.414 --> 00:01:06.455\nThat's not what we're talking about,\nright?\n\n26\n00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:07.523\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n27\n00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:09.771\nthat's exactly what they're doing.\n\n28\n00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:14.010\nThey're sending the information,\nthe instructions allowing that\n\n29\n00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.037\ncommunication to happen for us,\nto go ahead and use our devices.\n\n30\n00:01:18.037 --> 00:01:22.384\nAnd it was crazy, back in the day, I do\nremember installing operating systems and\n\n31\n00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:25.345\nalways trying to get the network\nadaptor driver first so\n\n32\n00:01:25.345 --> 00:01:29.460\nthen I can have connectivity to go\ndownload all those other drivers.\n\n33\n00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.640\nBut Windows 10 really takes an extra\neffort to obtain those drivers for you.\n\n34\n00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.520\nNumber one,\nwe see a more secure operating system.\n\n35\n00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.210\nSo Windows 10 is more secure than\nprevious versions of Windows.\n\n36\n00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.020\nBecause now they're requiring\nour drivers to be signed.\n\n37\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.442\nSo, well, what is a signed driver, right?\n\n38\n00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:53.604\nI was gonna try out a bad joke.\n\n39\n00:01:53.604 --> 00:01:54.899\nBut just know, no.\n\n40\n00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.852\nNo, [LAUGH] a signed driver is\nbasically going to be a driver that\n\n41\n00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:03.040\nthe manufacturer submits to Microsoft for\nsome testing, right?\n\n42\n00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.037\nSo they run it through the paces, they\nmake sure that it isn't going to cause any\n\n43\n00:02:07.037 --> 00:02:09.615\nkind of unstability within\nthe operating system.\n\n44\n00:02:09.615 --> 00:02:13.296\nAnd hopefully that they're checking for\nany kind of malware.\n\n45\n00:02:13.296 --> 00:02:15.670\n&gt;&gt; There's no malware or\nanything in there, exactly.\n\n46\n00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.559\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's kinda crazy though,\nwe have to think about all this nowadays,\n\n47\n00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:20.596\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; For a while,\n\n48\n00:02:20.596 --> 00:02:22.858\nthat was a very easy avenue attack for\nthe bad guys.\n\n49\n00:02:22.858 --> 00:02:25.086\nBecause we had to go out and\nwe had to find these drivers.\n\n50\n00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:28.419\nSo we'd do an Internet search,\nyou'd find some website,\n\n51\n00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.655\nDrivers R Us, and they'd have-\n&gt;&gt; For free.\n\n52\n00:02:30.655 --> 00:02:33.590\n&gt;&gt; All these drivers we could download for\nfree, exactly.\n\n53\n00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.590\nBut what you didn't know is what\nthey were bundling with that driver.\n\n54\n00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.562\nIt might have been spyware,\npotentially even worse types of malware.\n\n55\n00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:46.258\nSo by signing a driver, Microsoft\ntests the driver, looks to make sure\n\n56\n00:02:46.258 --> 00:02:50.892\nthere's no bad content or\nanything that's gonna harm your machine.\n\n57\n00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:52.900\nAnd then they apply a digital signature.\n\n58\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.892\nAnd what that does for us is it allows\nus to verify that the driver hasn't been\n\n59\n00:02:57.892 --> 00:03:00.322\nchanged since Microsoft tested it.\n\n60\n00:03:00.322 --> 00:03:03.521\nBecause then if somebody tries to\nadd something after the fact or\n\n61\n00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:07.149\nmodify that code in that driver,\nthe signature will be no longer match.\n\n62\n00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:11.411\nAnd your system will recognize that,\nand say, hey look, driver is invalid.\n\n63\n00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:12.930\nYou need to go to get a new copy of it.\n\n64\n00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.350\nSo it's a great to keep us safe and\n\n65\n00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.060\nprotect us from people doing\nbad things to our systems.\n\n66\n00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.020\n&gt;&gt; Right, most definitely.\n\n67\n00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.870\nAnd there are even utilities,\n\n68\n00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.300\nwe'll take a look at a little bit later,\nMike, where we can check for\n\n69\n00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.720\nwhat he was just mentioning by utilizing\nhashes for that driver verification.\n\n70\n00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.180\nAnd a hash, just looking to make sure that\n\n71\n00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.640\nthose driver packages\nhave not been modified.\n\n72\n00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.840\nAnd you may hear that term driver package,\nand\n\n73\n00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.180\nit simply means any kind\nof supporting files.\n\n74\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.200\nBecause usually you'll see a .inf file\nextension for a particular driver.\n\n75\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.852\nSometimes you'll see a folder\nwith additional files for\n\n76\n00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:49.457\na driver package there.\n\n77\n00:03:49.457 --> 00:03:57.620\nAnd Microsoft has also built upon\nthat INF file structure extension.\n\n78\n00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.551\nAnd they created a variation of it,\nspecifically, INFs specifically for\n\n79\n00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:05.304\nwhat they call their universal drivers.\n\n80\n00:04:05.304 --> 00:04:11.868\nAnd that's going to be a driver that can\nwork across platforms as well as devices.\n\n81\n00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:14.790\nBecause now with the concept\nof bringing your own device,\n\n82\n00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.020\nchoose your own device,\nwe have mobile devices, HoloLenses.\n\n83\n00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.315\nAll kinds of cool stuff that\nwe can interact with, and\n\n84\n00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:25.280\nthose drivers should work\nseamlessly across those platforms.\n\n85\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.630\n&gt;&gt; Really simplifies the driver\ndevelopment process for\n\n86\n00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.690\nthose vendors because they can now\nwrite a single driver package.\n\n87\n00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.600\nThey don't have to have a separate one for\nWindows 10 desktop,\n\n88\n00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.270\nWindows 10 on the phone or\nWindows on the phone and things like that.\n\n89\n00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.869\nSo it makes it a lot easier,\nand easier for\n\n90\n00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:43.984\nus cuz we've got one driver to manage for\nthat device.\n\n91\n00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:46.517\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we were talking\nabout this before the show, Mike.\n\n92\n00:04:46.517 --> 00:04:50.385\nEven with the advent of this Windows\nuniversal driver, you still need to think\n\n93\n00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:53.390\nabout the architecture of your\noperating systems, right?\n\n94\n00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.478\nSo when you talk about drivers,\nlet's say I have a print server and\n\n95\n00:04:57.478 --> 00:04:59.305\nI have it set up on my network.\n\n96\n00:04:59.305 --> 00:05:01.106\nIf you don't know what a print server is,\n\n97\n00:05:01.106 --> 00:05:03.529\nit's basically just a repository\nwhere I can go ahead.\n\n98\n00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:07.202\nAnd if I have access to multiple\nprint devices in my office,\n\n99\n00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:11.681\nmaybe I work in an office space and\nwanna connect it to the color printer or\n\n100\n00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:16.145\nthe printer on the second story,\nwhatever, I can easily do that.\n\n101\n00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:20.855\nBut let's say Mike has a 32 bit operating\nsystem and I have a 64 bit operating or\n\n102\n00:05:20.855 --> 00:05:23.725\nvice versa,\nthat is something you have to think about.\n\n103\n00:05:23.725 --> 00:05:28.131\nBecause the drivers are specific to that\narchitecture, and you don't wanna mix and\n\n104\n00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:29.133\nmatch that thing.\n\n105\n00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:29.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great point.\n\n106\n00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.246\nWhen they say it's cross-platform,\n\n107\n00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:36.399\nthey're not talking about architecture,\n32 bit, 64 bit.\n\n108\n00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:40.459\nYou have to get a driver specific for\nthat, but cross-platform meaning different\n\n109\n00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:43.340\ndevice types,\nwe can use a single driver across them.\n\n110\n00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.422\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Anything that\n\n111\n00:05:44.422 --> 00:05:47.112\nsupports the Universal Windows Platform or\nUWP.\n\n112\n00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:48.050\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n113\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.200\nYeah, and we really are.\n\n114\n00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.494\nAnd it's not just the different\ntypes of devices, but\n\n115\n00:05:52.494 --> 00:05:56.690\nwe do see more types of devices\nthat can be detected as well.\n\n116\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.100\nLet's think about that for a second.\n\n117\n00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.562\nSo we talked about what driver is,\nbut how do we get drivers, right?\n\n118\n00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:06.682\nWell, you can manually go out and download\nthem from a manufacturer's website.\n\n119\n00:06:06.682 --> 00:06:08.430\nWe may even do that here in the show.\n\n120\n00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.650\nThat is going to be one method of\ndoing it and that was, I would say,\n\n121\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.960\nmore popular a while ago.\n\n122\n00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.290\nBut now it's more likely for the Windows\noperating system to go ahead and\n\n123\n00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.920\nobtain that information,\nthat driver package, for you.\n\n124\n00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.992\nSo how does that happen?\n\n125\n00:06:26.992 --> 00:06:33.060\nWell, if a hardware manufactures\nworking on a new driver package and\n\n126\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.468\nthey submit to Microsoft, what will\nusually happen is, it'll get queued up for\n\n127\n00:06:37.468 --> 00:06:39.600\ntheir next version of updates.\n\n128\n00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.634\nSo now with Windows as a service,\nwe're going to get larger update packages\n\n129\n00:06:44.634 --> 00:06:49.684\nthan what we may have seen in the past\ninstead of idividual smaller updates.\n\n130\n00:06:49.684 --> 00:06:55.941\nSo it's difficult to [LAUGH]\nstop Windows updates now, right?\n\n131\n00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:57.518\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're gonna give them to us.\n\n132\n00:06:57.518 --> 00:07:00.870\nWe can delay those and also here,\n\n133\n00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.460\nactually, let me see if\nI can find the link.\n\n134\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.980\nI do have it in the notes.\n\n135\n00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.180\nLet's see.\n\n136\n00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.460\nHow to temporarily prevent a Windows\nupdate from reinstalling in Windows 10.\n\n137\n00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.410\nSo let me see, what is the particular,\n\n138\n00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.180\nI think it's just view installed updates,\nyou type in your search bar, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.593\nAnd that link is gonna be useful as well.\n\n140\n00:07:22.593 --> 00:07:28.561\nBut for now, let's go to view\ninstalled updates, all right?\n\n141\n00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:35.794\nSo if you look at the view installed\nupdate history section right here,\n\n142\n00:07:35.794 --> 00:07:37.413\nyou can click on that, and\n\n143\n00:07:37.413 --> 00:07:42.760\nit'll show you some updates that have\nrecently been installed on this system.\n\n144\n00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.470\nNow if I can narrow it down,\nI'm troubleshooting and\n\n145\n00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.590\nI decide, I think it was this update right\nhere because my computer was working fine\n\n146\n00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:55.140\nup until this particular date,\nthen you can uninstall those updates here.\n\n147\n00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.254\nI'm not gonna do that.\n\n148\n00:07:56.254 --> 00:08:01.590\nThis is my actual machine, but you could\nreally go through and uninstall that\n\n149\n00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:07.171\nNow to prevent it from coming back to your\nsystem in that next release of updates,\n\n150\n00:08:07.171 --> 00:08:12.015\nthere is a show/hide utility that\nMicrosoft has available to us, and\n\n151\n00:08:12.015 --> 00:08:13.927\nlet me pull that up for you.\n\n152\n00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:18.950\nI believe the link, yes, the link is\nhere to go ahead and download that.\n\n153\n00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.690\nYou can see just download\nit right from there.\n\n154\n00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.490\nI've already put the link in\nthe show notes for you, and\n\n155\n00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.930\nI've already downloaded\nthat particular utility.\n\n156\n00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:27.970\nSo let me pull that up.\n\n157\n00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.711\n&gt;&gt; And that's funny cuz it's like they're\nbringing back capabilities that we\n\n158\n00:08:32.711 --> 00:08:33.340\nhad before.\n\n159\n00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.350\nBack when you were getting the indiviudal\nupdates, you'd go check for updates and\n\n160\n00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.900\nyou'd see all the available updates, and\n\n161\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.350\nyou could pick which update you wanted\nto install and which ones you didn't.\n\n162\n00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.510\nYou could right-click on them and\nhide update,\n\n163\n00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.650\nand it wouldn't show up\nin your list anymore.\n\n164\n00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.790\nBut now that they're doing\nthese cumulative updates,\n\n165\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.440\nas Cherokee was explaining, you can't\njust go and see the individuals and pick.\n\n166\n00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.340\nSo they have to give us a separate utility\nto bring back functionality that we\n\n167\n00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.010\nused to have in the operating system.\n\n168\n00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:58.868\n&gt;&gt; Go figure, Mike.\n\n169\n00:08:58.868 --> 00:09:00.252\nI don't come up with this stuff.\n\n170\n00:09:00.252 --> 00:09:03.490\nI just [LAUGH] try to sift through it all.\n\n171\n00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.500\nSo this is going to be show or\nhide updates.\n\n172\n00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.150\nYou hit Next, so once you install\nthat little file there, executable,\n\n173\n00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.150\nit shouldn't take too long.\n\n174\n00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.000\nAnd it says detecting problems, so\n\n175\n00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.710\nit's looking to see if there\nare any pre-existing problems.\n\n176\n00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.660\nJust give it a couple minutes here.\n\n177\n00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.110\nAnd what should happen is any kind of\nissues that have happened, or updates\n\n178\n00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.920\nthat are queued up, that are ready to get\nput in that package, will be displayed.\n\n179\n00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.580\nNow, I currently have\nnot hidden any updates.\n\n180\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.850\nSo if I were to select, Show hidden\nupdates, we wouldn't see anything.\n\n181\n00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.740\nBut there are a few that\nare sitting there waiting.\n\n182\n00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.280\nI've got a Dell driver and\na cumulative update, and so forth.\n\n183\n00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.125\nSo if I see this particular driver,\n\n184\n00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:47.580\nI've already been working with\nother systems in my environment.\n\n185\n00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.620\nI'm like, this is the one\nthat's causing me problems.\n\n186\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.080\nThen I can go ahead and click it, and\njust walk through this process here.\n\n187\n00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.027\nAnd offset that installation\nuntil a fix has been resolved,\n\n188\n00:10:00.027 --> 00:10:05.170\nso that's the ideology\nbehind that one there.\n\n189\n00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:13.690\nAnd you can disable\nupdates across the board.\n\n190\n00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.460\nIt's not a good idea, though.\n\n191\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.120\nSo let me just see here.\n\n192\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.780\nLet's go to Control Panel.\n\n193\n00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.510\nJust know that it is an option here,\nControl Panel.\n\n194\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:29.150\nAnd that's going to be under our\nHardware and Sound, Devices and\n\n195\n00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.950\nPrinters, and this my PC.\n\n196\n00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.420\nYes, it's BETSY over here.\n\n197\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:40.880\nAnd if you right-click on top of that,\nyou'll get some options, and\n\n198\n00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.060\nDevice installation settings\nis what I'm selecting here.\n\n199\n00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.455\nAnd it says, look,\ndo you wanna automatically download\n\n200\n00:10:49.455 --> 00:10:52.600\nmanufacturers' apps and\ncustom icons available for your device?\n\n201\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.930\nSo that's what I was talking about.\n\n202\n00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:57.910\nWhen windows gets notification that this\nmanufacturer has created an update to\n\n203\n00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.160\na particular device,\nthen it's gonna push it out to me.\n\n204\n00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.390\nI can prevent that from happening.\n\n205\n00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.370\nIs that ideal?\n\n206\n00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.550\nNo, but\njust know that it is possible there.\n\n207\n00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.500\nAll right, so what is another way\nthat we would go ahead and manage?\n\n208\n00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.990\nSince I'm already in Control Panel, I'm\njust gonna back up a couple levels there.\n\n209\n00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.430\nAnd you can see under Devices and\nPrinters, well, I say you can see but\n\n210\n00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.730\nlet's check on that.\n\n211\n00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.510\nAll right, Devices and Printers,\nover on the right is my Device Manager.\n\n212\n00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:33.270\nSo this is an MMC,\nlike a Microsoft Snap in here.\n\n213\n00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.880\nAnd, it's been around for a while.\n\n214\n00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.723\nAnd it's kind of funny, because if you\nthink about plug and play devices,\n\n215\n00:11:39.723 --> 00:11:43.490\nthat's been around, plug and\nplay, at least 20 years, right?\n\n216\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.450\nPlug and play simply means, I take\na device, I plug it into my computer.\n\n217\n00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:53.360\nThe way that the IRQs are handled with\nplug and play devices differently.\n\n218\n00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.830\nI don't have to manually schedule that.\n\n219\n00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.244\nSo the computer handles that for\nme, and it will detect when\n\n220\n00:11:59.244 --> 00:12:03.010\nthose devices are plugged in and\nwe can play with them, right?\n\n221\n00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.970\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; And Windows has a huge driver cab or\n\n222\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.032\ndriver store.\n\n223\n00:12:09.032 --> 00:12:11.489\nBut a lot of times,\nit's already got a driver.\n\n224\n00:12:11.489 --> 00:12:14.790\nIt might not be the best driver,\nbut it's got a driver.\n\n225\n00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.561\nSo when you plug in that camera or\nthat mp3 player or whatever it is,\n\n226\n00:12:18.561 --> 00:12:22.993\ngood chance that it has an A driver that\nit can use, a Microsoft generic driver,\n\n227\n00:12:22.993 --> 00:12:25.400\nto start communicating with that device.\n\n228\n00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.802\nAnd then, we can come in here and\nwe can work with what driver is there and\n\n229\n00:12:28.802 --> 00:12:31.200\nwe can look at maybe updating a driver,\nright?\n\n230\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.800\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n231\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:38.256\nWe're talking from USB 1.0 to 3.1,\neven legacy technology.\n\n232\n00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:39.935\nI know you were joking around,\n\n233\n00:12:39.935 --> 00:12:43.560\nlike older devices that you would\nplay around with before, Mike.\n\n234\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.120\nAnd even newer devices like NFC and\nMiracast,\n\n235\n00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.665\nnow too to have those\ndevices being detected and\n\n236\n00:12:51.665 --> 00:12:54.895\nget that ball rolling with\nthe driver installation there.\n\n237\n00:12:54.895 --> 00:12:59.215\nBut let's take a look at what we can\ndo here inside of our Device Manager.\n\n238\n00:12:59.215 --> 00:13:01.402\nSo I'll just zoom in a little bit more.\n\n239\n00:13:01.402 --> 00:13:05.382\nNow this is kind of funny,\nif you just go through the different tabs,\n\n240\n00:13:05.382 --> 00:13:07.872\nyou've got some options.\n\n241\n00:13:07.872 --> 00:13:09.192\nDisk Cleanup there.\n\n242\n00:13:09.192 --> 00:13:15.832\nIt's kind of strange, this is a context\naware type management console.\n\n243\n00:13:15.832 --> 00:13:20.130\nSo what that means is, for instance,\nif I were to click on Action,\n\n244\n00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.240\nyou can see Help is being noted here.\n\n245\n00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.810\nAnd you're like, and all it does is take\nyou out to a website with some help links.\n\n246\n00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.860\nAnd then,\nI have an actual category for help.\n\n247\n00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.530\nAnd then there's help topics.\n\n248\n00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.660\nBut if you actually click on\na particular device category,\n\n249\n00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.200\nthen your action menu\nwill change slightly.\n\n250\n00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.850\nSee, this is the same thing\nthat I just hit there.\n\n251\n00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.660\nBut I do have additional options.\n\n252\n00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.300\nSo I can scan for hardware changes.\n\n253\n00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.738\nSo maybe I've replaced the device or\nadded a device, deleted a device whatever,\n\n254\n00:13:48.738 --> 00:13:51.760\nI'm looking to get that\nproper driver there.\n\n255\n00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.772\nIf I wanted to add legacy hardware,\nI do have the ability to go ahead and\n\n256\n00:13:55.772 --> 00:13:56.799\nadd that as well.\n\n257\n00:13:56.799 --> 00:14:01.448\nThere's that nice little wizard here, so\nit's kinda crazy that they care that much\n\n258\n00:14:01.448 --> 00:14:04.790\nabout backwards compatibility\nall the way back until then.\n\n259\n00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.065\nBut they do, and\nyou have that option, so that's cool.\n\n260\n00:14:07.065 --> 00:14:13.760\nShoot, what else do we wanna look\nat here under the Action menu?\n\n261\n00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:19.710\nDevices and Printers, so\na lot of settings go hand-in-hand.\n\n262\n00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.175\nEspecially when you're studying,\n\n263\n00:14:21.175 --> 00:14:23.450\nyou'll see that here with\nDevice Manager and Printers.\n\n264\n00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:28.752\nAnd that's probably just because\nprinters are most likely the devices\n\n265\n00:14:28.752 --> 00:14:33.639\nthat you'll be installing and\nmanaging through your IT career.\n\n266\n00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:34.995\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n267\n00:14:34.995 --> 00:14:35.660\n&gt;&gt; And printers\n\n268\n00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.630\nare the one type of device you really\ndon't manage through Device Manager.\n\n269\n00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.601\nIt's got its own separate window,\nits own console.\n\n270\n00:14:39.601 --> 00:14:42.730\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's got its own thing,\nbut they really are grouped together.\n\n271\n00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And it's kind of crazy actually.\n\n272\n00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:45.740\nAnd you brought up a really good point,\nMike.\n\n273\n00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:50.917\nI'm just gonna randomly click\non one of these drivers here.\n\n274\n00:14:50.917 --> 00:14:55.350\nAnd on the individual device, you can see\nI have the option to update the driver.\n\n275\n00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:59.310\nSo maybe the manufacturer has come\nup with a better, newer driver, so\n\n276\n00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.620\nyou wanna go ahead and update it.\n\n277\n00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.720\nI can check for that.\n\n278\n00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.540\nSo I just right-clicked\non top of this particular\n\n279\n00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.160\nAJA device that I have here in\nthe background for display.\n\n280\n00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.860\nAnd if I left-highlight and\nthen left-click,\n\n281\n00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.780\nit's going to say, look, how do you\nwant us to search for these drivers?\n\n282\n00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.330\nSo the operating system will\n\n283\n00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.040\nintrinsically try to search\nlocally prior to calling out.\n\n284\n00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.040\nBut whenever I initiate something\nlike this, it's asking me.\n\n285\n00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.715\nSo I have to tell it either on my local\ncomputer, browse for this driver or\n\n286\n00:15:30.715 --> 00:15:34.871\nsearch automatically through\ntheir updated driver software.\n\n287\n00:15:34.871 --> 00:15:37.881\nSo if I had it located on\nmy computer somewhere,\n\n288\n00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:41.340\nI could just point and\nnavigate to it there.\n\n289\n00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.997\n&gt;&gt; She might have downloaded it from\nthe manufacturer prior to this and\n\n290\n00:15:43.997 --> 00:15:47.320\nyou're just gonna point it to that folder\nwhere you've extracted everything out.\n\n291\n00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.360\n&gt;&gt; And they make it really easy too.\n\n292\n00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.996\nUsually on the manufacturer's website,\nif it's HP or Epson for your printers,\n\n293\n00:15:53.996 --> 00:15:57.959\nyou can type in the model name and\nthen usually just drivers after it and\n\n294\n00:15:57.959 --> 00:16:00.263\nthen find your specific make and model.\n\n295\n00:16:00.263 --> 00:16:01.877\nAnd you know, Mike, you and\n\n296\n00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:06.540\nI were talking about this also before the\nshow about different types of families.\n\n297\n00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.204\nRight?\n\n298\n00:16:07.204 --> 00:16:10.416\nAnd for their driver classes.\n\n299\n00:16:10.416 --> 00:16:14.127\nAnd so, it seems like you might have\nhad better luck than I have and\n\n300\n00:16:14.127 --> 00:16:16.082\nI know and this was a while ago, but\n\n301\n00:16:16.082 --> 00:16:19.470\nI had issues with not getting\nthe specific driver model.\n\n302\n00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.270\nIt was in the same family class,\nbut some features,\n\n303\n00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.220\nI didn't have, if I didn't pick\nthe exact driver that was for\n\n304\n00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:31.350\nmy specific printer, but,\na lot of them nowadays are more forgiving.\n\n305\n00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:35.450\nThey're like you're my brother, we do a\nlot of the same brotherly type functions,\n\n306\n00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.130\nso they work together.\n\n307\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.200\nAnd no pun intended,\nlike a brother printer,\n\n308\n00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.670\nbut I'm just saying [LAUGH],\nthey are in similar families there so.\n\n309\n00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n310\n00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.370\nWhen they went from, cuz version 3 drivers\nwere very specific to the model, and\n\n311\n00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:52.420\nfor a vendor, they had to have separate\ndrivers built for each printer.\n\n312\n00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.370\nThey've got five different models.\n\n313\n00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.630\nThat's five different drivers\nthey have to maintain.\n\n314\n00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.750\nAnd then each platform.\n\n315\n00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.810\nSo there's two, that's ten drivers.\n\n316\n00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.960\nWith version four drivers,\nthere are more of a driver class and\n\n317\n00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.560\nnow those drivers can support a class of\nprinters, whereas they've got three or\n\n318\n00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.290\nfour models that are very similar that can\nsupport all the base functionality and\n\n319\n00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.690\nstill pick up the extra functionality\nthat one or two of those devices have.\n\n320\n00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:20.210\nSo, it does make it a lot easier from\nthe vendors perspective, and from ours.\n\n321\n00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:26.450\nBecause now you can go still search for\nyour specific model, but many times,\n\n322\n00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.150\nyou'll find links for two different model,\npoint back to the same download.\n\n323\n00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.700\nBecause there's one driver for\n\n324\n00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.400\nall of those printers that\nare very similar in capabilities.\n\n325\n00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really great for\nthem to be able to help us that way.\n\n326\n00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.100\nWe do see, like I said, this is,\nwe've come a long way with drivers.\n\n327\n00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.270\nAll right, so\nwhat else do I wanna show you here?\n\n328\n00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.280\nLet's just go ahead and hit cancel.\n\n329\n00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.730\nI will do the same thing\nthat I did before,\n\n330\n00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.160\nright click to pull up\nthis action menu here.\n\n331\n00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.680\nNow, I have the option to, and\nlet me just zoom in a little bit.\n\n332\n00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.510\nYou can see, disable this advice,\ndevice, not advice.\n\n333\n00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.570\nBut sometimes you wanna do that too,\nright.\n\n334\n00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:06.676\nBut disabling it temporarily, and okay,\nI'm not gonna do that right now because\n\n335\n00:18:06.676 --> 00:18:11.862\nI'm actually using this particular device\nto show you [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] my screen.\n\n336\n00:18:11.862 --> 00:18:15.148\nYeah, but, so you'll notice a little icon,\n\n337\n00:18:15.148 --> 00:18:20.770\nI think it's an exclamation point that\ngoes on top of the little monitor.\n\n338\n00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.490\nLet me pick a different one so\nI can show you.\n\n339\n00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.915\nI am not using my speakers right now.\n\n340\n00:18:24.915 --> 00:18:27.640\n[LAUGH] So let me go ahead and\ndisable that one.\n\n341\n00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.970\nSo it just asked me,\nif I want to disable behind my head.\n\n342\n00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:35.030\nI'm just going to hit yes there and,\nokay, so it's a down arrow.\n\n343\n00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.430\nThe yellow exclamation, Mike,\nI've seen that before and\n\n344\n00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:38.640\nI think it means there's an issue.\n\n345\n00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.710\n&gt;&gt; Has a problem with it, yep.\n\n346\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.540\n&gt;&gt; Yep, you just need to go ahead and\ninvestigate that.\n\n347\n00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.010\nBut I'm going to go ahead and enable now.\n\n348\n00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:49.060\nI do have this option now,\nso that's not permanent.\n\n349\n00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.250\nIf we're talking permanent like,\nI hate these speakers and\n\n350\n00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:57.290\nI just want them off my machine, then I\nhave the option to go ahead and uninstall.\n\n351\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.660\nNow, I will be prompted.\n\n352\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.720\nIt says, warning, danger, you're about to\nuninstall this device from your system.\n\n353\n00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.760\nIt does get removed from your system.\n\n354\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.560\nThere is an option where it says,\nshow hidden devices,\n\n355\n00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.650\nsomewhere in this little section here.\n\n356\n00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:16.020\nI've got to think about it for a second,\nbut essentially what that will do is if\n\n357\n00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:22.150\nthere are registry entries still residual,\nit will show those.\n\n358\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.250\nBut you can permanently remove that there.\n\n359\n00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.330\nSo if you have a problematic device.\n\n360\n00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've used that several\ntimes when troubleshooting, right.\n\n361\n00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.981\nIf you disable the device and\nyour problem goes away,\n\n362\n00:19:33.981 --> 00:19:37.545\nit kiinda leads you to believe that that\ndevice might be causing the problem.\n\n363\n00:19:37.545 --> 00:19:40.540\nSo disable's temporary,\nyou can always re-enable it.\n\n364\n00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.540\nAnd then as you said, though,\n\n365\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.480\nuninstalling it, I've had a problem where\nthe driver was having an issue, and\n\n366\n00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.440\none of the easiest ways to, I don't want\nto open up my case, you know, power down,\n\n367\n00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.410\nopen up the case, remove the device,\nadd the device back.\n\n368\n00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.380\nYou can simply come in here,\nuninstall the device.\n\n369\n00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.610\nThat removes any information\nabout that device from Windows.\n\n370\n00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.050\nIt doesn't know about the device anymore.\n\n371\n00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.840\nAnd then click scan for\nhardware changes, and\n\n372\n00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.625\nit sees the device that you just\nuninstalled and says, look, a new device.\n\n373\n00:20:07.625 --> 00:20:10.925\nAnd it'll go through and\ninstall the driver all over again and\n\n374\n00:20:10.925 --> 00:20:14.055\nhopefully maybe fix your\nproblems that you were having.\n\n375\n00:20:14.055 --> 00:20:17.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and another thing that you can\nuse to help with that trouble shooting\n\n376\n00:20:17.125 --> 00:20:21.965\nprocess, like Mike was talking about,\nis something called a rollback option.\n\n377\n00:20:21.965 --> 00:20:26.735\nSo, I don't have that here on any of\nthese drivers because I haven't recently\n\n378\n00:20:26.735 --> 00:20:27.425\nupdated them.\n\n379\n00:20:27.425 --> 00:20:32.810\nSo if you had recently, well, if you had\nupdated them, you do have the ability\n\n380\n00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:37.350\nto roll back or revert to the previous\nversion of that particular driver.\n\n381\n00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.871\nI don't see that here,\nbecause I haven't done that, but\n\n382\n00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:41.730\njust know that that is an option, as well.\n\n383\n00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.760\nYou're like, well,\nI know this thing worked last week and\n\n384\n00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.940\nthen, all of a sudden, after my updates,\nit's not functioning or whatever.\n\n385\n00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.740\nThose are just a few things there.\n\n386\n00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great option.\n\n387\n00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.660\nA user thinks they're doing the right\nthing, and they think that they're\n\n388\n00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.900\nhelping and they're like, look,\nthere's a new driver for my video card.\n\n389\n00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:58.860\nI'm gonna go install it.\n\n390\n00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:03.230\nAnd they install the wrong one, or\nit causes problems with something else.\n\n391\n00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:06.902\nAnd now the problem is,\nthey've already updated the driver, and\n\n392\n00:21:06.902 --> 00:21:10.540\nnow you've gotta figure out, well,\nwhat driver was working before this.\n\n393\n00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.496\nAll right, well, Windows remembers\nthe last used driver, and\n\n394\n00:21:13.496 --> 00:21:15.370\nyou can simply choose roll back driver.\n\n395\n00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.580\nAnd it'll go back to that\npreviously used driver.\n\n396\n00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.897\nBut a key point that you made,\nCherokee, and a good test point,\n\n397\n00:21:20.897 --> 00:21:25.190\nthe roll back driver option is only\navailable if you've updated the driver.\n\n398\n00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.960\nIf you've never updated it,\nthere's nothing to roll back to.\n\n399\n00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.960\nSo sometimes you won't see that button,\nwhy isn't there?\n\n400\n00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.020\nWell, that because that\ndrivers never been updated.\n\n401\n00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.370\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nMike I'm trying to think about,\n\n402\n00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.320\nthere's a few more things\nthat I wanna show you guys.\n\n403\n00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.700\nI know we're getting low on time.\n\n404\n00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:43.010\nI think will be good though,\nbecause I want to talk about,\n\n405\n00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:48.280\nwell what if Microsoft, what if that\nupdate process happens at the most\n\n406\n00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.228\ninopportune time, right when you want to\nshow someone a cat video or who knows.\n\n407\n00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:53.179\nI know.\n\n408\n00:21:53.179 --> 00:21:55.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n409\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:59.780\nmaybe you're using a wireless connection,\nsome kind of metered connection, and\n\n410\n00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:05.697\nyou don't want to waste your precious\nbandwidth on things like drivers, right.\n\n411\n00:22:05.697 --> 00:22:10.931\nSo let's take a look at\nwhere we can go ahead and\n\n412\n00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:14.296\nset up metered connections.\n\n413\n00:22:14.296 --> 00:22:16.730\nSo if we open up network and\ninternet settings.\n\n414\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:22.020\nAnd the reason I'm showing you this\nfirst is, you have to have this\n\n415\n00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:27.240\nhave a network signified as\na metered network, in order for\n\n416\n00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.470\nit to to apply to the section where\nthe other setting is, if that makes sense.\n\n417\n00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:36.441\nSo let's see, if I go under like Wifi or\nEthernet settings here,\n\n418\n00:22:36.441 --> 00:22:41.790\nit'll be a little bit different, but\nright now I'm connected to ITProTV.\n\n419\n00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:46.860\nAnd if I scroll down, you can see\nthe option here for metered connections.\n\n420\n00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:51.420\nSo if this is one where I'm getting\ncharged on a per use basis then, and\n\n421\n00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.320\nI was playing around.\n\n422\n00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.500\nI already turned my toggle switch\nto on but you can turn it off.\n\n423\n00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:00.060\nBut it would need to be on in order to go\nahead and show you this next step here.\n\n424\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.880\nAnd if I can remember where\nthat particular one is,\n\n425\n00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.920\nthat's going to be under\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n426\n00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.780\nthis whole metered connection thing,\nit is important.\n\n427\n00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:15.940\nI get spoiled I know sometimes, cuz I\nhave high speed connectivity at home,\n\n428\n00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.610\nbut I know one of our others, Ronnie, for\n\n429\n00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:23.080\nexample, lives in a place where that high\nspeed, always on cable is not available.\n\n430\n00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.443\nSo he's on satellite.\n\n431\n00:23:24.443 --> 00:23:28.031\nSo if you go beyond a certain,\nI forget what his cap is,\n\n432\n00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:31.078\nbut he's got a cap on how\nmuch data you can use.\n\n433\n00:23:31.078 --> 00:23:34.246\nAnd at that point it slows\nhis service down a lot, so\n\n434\n00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:38.240\nyou don't want updates occurring\non that particular network.\n\n435\n00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.670\nSo you can turn that on and\n\n436\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:43.770\nWindows will defer those until you\nconnect to a non-metered network.\n\n437\n00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:44.600\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n438\n00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.940\nOkay, I found it, Mike.\n\n439\n00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.090\nIt's under settings, so\neither way you wanna get there,\n\n440\n00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.500\nI'm just gonna click on\nthe little cog here.\n\n441\n00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.180\nAnd so that should, oops,\nI'm already in there.\n\n442\n00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.490\nI gotta back out from where I was before.\n\n443\n00:23:55.490 --> 00:24:01.995\nBut that's going to be under,\nlet's see, let me go to my home here.\n\n444\n00:24:01.995 --> 00:24:03.412\nIt should be under devices.\n\n445\n00:24:03.412 --> 00:24:09.277\nDevices And then let's see here,\nprinters and scanners,\n\n446\n00:24:09.277 --> 00:24:14.446\nI think, hold on,\nlet me just check, okay, yeah.\n\n447\n00:24:14.446 --> 00:24:19.017\nNow, and again, it's kind of an odd\nplace here, but under the printers and\n\n448\n00:24:19.017 --> 00:24:20.310\nscanners, it says.\n\n449\n00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.111\nAnd let me zoom in a little bit so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n450\n00:24:22.111 --> 00:24:24.468\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it says,\n\n451\n00:24:24.468 --> 00:24:28.140\ndownload over metered connections.\n\n452\n00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.842\nSo, by, I think, by default,\n\n453\n00:24:29.842 --> 00:24:34.267\nbecause the first time I had ever checked\non this option here, it was not selected.\n\n454\n00:24:34.267 --> 00:24:37.810\nBut this is definitely something\nthat you want to check for as well.\n\n455\n00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:41.082\nSo, it says to help prevent extra charges,\nkeep this off.\n\n456\n00:24:41.082 --> 00:24:42.386\nSo device software for\n\n457\n00:24:42.386 --> 00:24:46.990\nnew device won't download while your\nmeter on metered internet connections.\n\n458\n00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:51.776\nSo, I think it's going to have\nit by default not to, but,\n\n459\n00:24:51.776 --> 00:24:54.239\nyou just want to verify that.\n\n460\n00:24:54.239 --> 00:24:57.467\nAnd make sure you set it under\nyour network settings also.\n\n461\n00:24:57.467 --> 00:25:02.104\nAll right, so, we've talked quite\na bit about being safe, you know,\n\n462\n00:25:02.104 --> 00:25:04.440\nsafety first and everything.\n\n463\n00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.882\nThere are a couple different ways that you\nwant to verify that these drivers are in\n\n464\n00:25:08.882 --> 00:25:09.481\nfact not.\n\n465\n00:25:09.481 --> 00:25:12.130\nAny kind of Trojan horses or malware.\n\n466\n00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:15.110\nAny kind of free type drivers there for\nyou.\n\n467\n00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:21.820\nSo, there are a couple of command line\nutilities that we can use to verify.\n\n468\n00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:26.209\nAnd there's also another one, you know\nMike talking here about security and\n\n469\n00:25:26.209 --> 00:25:28.312\nwe're talking about this earlier.\n\n470\n00:25:28.312 --> 00:25:32.910\nDriver installation and\nremoval is an administrative function.\n\n471\n00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:36.285\nSo you do have to have\nthat elevated permission.\n\n472\n00:25:36.285 --> 00:25:39.550\nWe don't always wanna give\nour end users that, right?\n\n473\n00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:45.315\nSo there is a PnPUtil dot, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n474\n00:25:45.315 --> 00:25:47.307\n&gt;&gt; Can you bump up the font on that for\nus?\n\n475\n00:25:47.307 --> 00:25:49.998\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me do that, [LAUGH] okay.\n\n476\n00:25:49.998 --> 00:25:52.753\n&gt;&gt; I can't read that from here [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] It's okay,\n\n477\n00:25:52.753 --> 00:25:56.200\nI can't even read it apparently,\nI'm typing all sorts of craziness [LAUGH].\n\n478\n00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.101\nAll right, so let's change it to\n[INAUDIBLE] and we'll go with 20,\n\n479\n00:26:00.101 --> 00:26:00.987\nthat may help.\n\n480\n00:26:00.987 --> 00:26:01.675\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n481\n00:26:01.675 --> 00:26:02.356\n&gt;&gt; A little bit better?\n\n482\n00:26:02.356 --> 00:26:02.858\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n483\n00:26:02.858 --> 00:26:03.495\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n484\n00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:07.895\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; So PnPUtil.exe, this is going\n\n485\n00:26:07.895 --> 00:26:12.697\nto be my PnPUtil, let me just go /?\n\n486\n00:26:12.697 --> 00:26:16.300\nSo we can see the difference\nswitches available with that.\n\n487\n00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.024\nSo, this particular utility,\nadding a drivers, so Mike,\n\n488\n00:26:20.024 --> 00:26:21.784\nwe were talking about this.\n\n489\n00:26:21.784 --> 00:26:27.180\nIf I know that I'm going to have to\nhave a particular device on my network.\n\n490\n00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.352\nSo, and I'm the admin,\nmaybe I will go ahead and pre-stage or\n\n491\n00:26:31.352 --> 00:26:34.284\npre-load a driver to a particular system.\n\n492\n00:26:34.284 --> 00:26:39.050\nSo that the engines have to worry\nabout those credentials there.\n\n493\n00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:43.031\nSo, actually, let me show you\nthat drivers store is located.\n\n494\n00:26:43.031 --> 00:26:46.036\nSo under our C drive, and\n\n495\n00:26:46.036 --> 00:26:51.057\nour windows folder and then System 32.\n\n496\n00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:57.163\nAnd then there is going\nto be a driver store.\n\n497\n00:26:57.163 --> 00:26:59.470\nAnd I will zoom in so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n498\n00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.958\nSo there's a couple\ndifferent driver options.\n\n499\n00:27:01.958 --> 00:27:07.560\nYou wanna get driver, capital D,\ncapital S, we'll double-click that.\n\n500\n00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.136\nAnd this is going to be a location\nwhere we have our file repository here.\n\n501\n00:27:12.136 --> 00:27:15.480\nNow, for whatever,\nthese are all driver packages.\n\n502\n00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.120\nYou see the folders there,\nand you can double-click and\n\n503\n00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.488\nyou see those INF files\nthat we were talking about.\n\n504\n00:27:20.488 --> 00:27:27.390\nSo we can go ahead and pre-stage those\nby utilizing this PnPUtility here.\n\n505\n00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.307\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is very handy.\n\n506\n00:27:28.307 --> 00:27:32.142\nThink about like, a marketing department,\nwhere you've got a camera that everybody\n\n507\n00:27:32.142 --> 00:27:35.090\ngets to use, and\nthey've got to plug it into their system.\n\n508\n00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.243\nBut when they do,\nit has to install a driver.\n\n509\n00:27:37.243 --> 00:27:40.569\nYou're not gonna make everybody\nadmins on their system to allow that.\n\n510\n00:27:40.569 --> 00:27:42.005\nBut what you could do,\n\n511\n00:27:42.005 --> 00:27:46.420\nis pre-load that driver using\nPnPUtil into the driver store.\n\n512\n00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.622\nNow, it's already installed, per say.\n\n513\n00:27:48.622 --> 00:27:52.150\nSo, and when a user goes\nin to plug in that camera.\n\n514\n00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:55.215\nIt checks that driver, so he say,\nlook, I've already got a driver.\n\n515\n00:27:55.215 --> 00:27:57.800\ncan just start using this, and\nthey don't need administrative access.\n\n516\n00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.285\nSo, it kinda shared devices\nthat roam around the office.\n\n517\n00:28:01.285 --> 00:28:04.844\nOr that are temporarily plugged\ninto different computers.\n\n518\n00:28:04.844 --> 00:28:07.450\nPre-loading that driver\ncan make a big difference.\n\n519\n00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:08.962\nIt'd make it easier on your end user,\n\n520\n00:28:08.962 --> 00:28:12.075\nthey don't have to come find somebody\nwhen it's time to install the driver.\n\n521\n00:28:12.075 --> 00:28:16.612\n&gt;&gt; That's correct, and Mike, sorry I had\nto switch to my virtual machine here,\n\n522\n00:28:16.612 --> 00:28:19.938\nbecause I had a location for\na driver pre-staged there.\n\n523\n00:28:19.938 --> 00:28:21.710\nLet me just pull that driver path up.\n\n524\n00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:26.397\nI wanted to show real quick how\nto go ahead and open that up.\n\n525\n00:28:26.397 --> 00:28:30.990\nSo, if I can remember the syntax here,\nI think it was PnPUtil.\n\n526\n00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.171\nAnd then, go ahead and put add.\n\n527\n00:28:37.171 --> 00:28:37.743\n&gt;&gt; Or slash.\n\n528\n00:28:37.743 --> 00:28:38.618\n&gt;&gt; Okay, forward slash.\n\n529\n00:28:38.618 --> 00:28:39.909\n&gt;&gt; Forward slash [INAUDIBLE].\n\n530\n00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:44.811\n&gt;&gt; Add dash driver, and then,\nspecify the location, and\n\n531\n00:28:44.811 --> 00:28:48.580\nthat's what I had back here in my notepad.\n\n532\n00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.232\nI'm just going to copy and paste that.\n\n533\n00:28:50.232 --> 00:28:54.736\nSo, this is essentially what I'm doing is,\nI'm copying the path that where\n\n534\n00:28:54.736 --> 00:28:58.630\nI just showed you under my System 32,\nmy driver's store.\n\n535\n00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:03.209\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n536\n00:29:03.209 --> 00:29:07.978\ncopy and then get that in here.\n\n537\n00:29:07.978 --> 00:29:12.070\nAnd put that, oops, I do not have\na space there after my C drive.\n\n538\n00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:16.680\nLet me go ahead and\ngive that a little bit of a space.\n\n539\n00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.348\nAnd so, what we're doing is we're\njust kind of getting that ready for\n\n540\n00:29:20.348 --> 00:29:21.791\nthat installation there.\n\n541\n00:29:21.791 --> 00:29:25.010\nSo, it says,\nadding driver package for USB device.\n\n542\n00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:28.887\nThat INF, and\nthe driver package was added successfully.\n\n543\n00:29:28.887 --> 00:29:34.670\nNow, sometimes it may be\ndifficult to remove drivers.\n\n544\n00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.078\nAnd this driver installation and\n\n545\n00:29:37.078 --> 00:29:43.103\nremoval process does need to have restarts\nin between each one of these processes.\n\n546\n00:29:43.103 --> 00:29:48.700\nSo, keep that in mind, if a driver is\nstill being stubborn and is staying there.\n\n547\n00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.378\nThen you may need to go ahead and use this\nPnPUtility to go ahead and remove it and\n\n548\n00:29:52.378 --> 00:29:53.566\ntake care if that there.\n\n549\n00:29:53.566 --> 00:29:54.683\n&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely.\n\n550\n00:29:54.683 --> 00:29:58.060\n&gt;&gt; I know, we're running out of time,\nbut a couple other things.\n\n551\n00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.223\nWe have like two more types\nof command line utilities,\n\n552\n00:30:01.223 --> 00:30:02.955\nsince we're all ready here.\n\n553\n00:30:02.955 --> 00:30:06.840\nOne is called sigverification.ext.\n\n554\n00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:12.354\nAnd so that is just going to\nbe S-I-G-V-E-R-I-F dot E-X-E,\n\n555\n00:30:12.354 --> 00:30:15.119\nand we'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n556\n00:30:15.119 --> 00:30:18.840\nAnd let me zoom a little bit more for\nyou there.\n\n557\n00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.667\nSo this is saying,\n\n558\n00:30:19.667 --> 00:30:22.886\nto maintain the integrity of your\nsystem it's checking critical files.\n\n559\n00:30:22.886 --> 00:30:26.411\nSo basically, it's just making sure\nthat your drivers all have been\n\n560\n00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:29.050\ndigitally signed,\nthat they are good to go.\n\n561\n00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:31.650\nSo you can just go ahead and\nrun that there.\n\n562\n00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.350\nI'm not going to do that right now.\n\n563\n00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:37.389\nAll my drivers are signed but if some were\nnot, then it would generate a report.\n\n564\n00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:40.200\nAnd let you know and\nyou can investigate further.\n\n565\n00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.319\nNot too in depth with\nthis particular tool,\n\n566\n00:30:43.319 --> 00:30:46.869\nI will show you one that I\ndo like a little bit more.\n\n567\n00:30:46.869 --> 00:30:53.979\nAll right, and that one is going to be,\nwhere is that particular, verifier.exe.\n\n568\n00:30:58.456 --> 00:31:03.830\nOkay, so this you can think of more as,\nit can be used for a number of things.\n\n569\n00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:07.470\nBut it's really great for\na little bit outside our wheelhouse here.\n\n570\n00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:13.043\nBut it's good for developers and\nstress testing these particular devices,\n\n571\n00:31:13.043 --> 00:31:16.070\nor drivers that they may be working on.\n\n572\n00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:20.163\nWorking with their API's to make\nsure the environment works smoothly.\n\n573\n00:31:20.163 --> 00:31:24.160\nSo, what we would do here is\ncreate standard settings.\n\n574\n00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.191\nAnd then go through, and select next.\n\n575\n00:31:28.191 --> 00:31:31.550\nLet me zoom in a little bit so\nyou can see that.\n\n576\n00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.725\nNow, you do have a couple\ndifferent options here.\n\n577\n00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:37.150\nYou can automatically select\ndrivers built for older versions.\n\n578\n00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.617\nSelect them from a list,\nlet's just choose this option here.\n\n579\n00:31:41.617 --> 00:31:47.990\nSo basically, I'm just selecting which\ndrivers I want to apply this test to.\n\n580\n00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:50.398\nSo it might take a second\nto populate that list.\n\n581\n00:31:50.398 --> 00:31:54.650\nAnd then, I'll also need to designate\nthe type of test that I wanna select.\n\n582\n00:31:54.650 --> 00:32:01.650\nSo like, I don't know, I'm just gonna pick\nthis first one on my list, let's see here.\n\n583\n00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:06.475\nAll right, add currently not loaded\ndrivers to the list, we'll hit Finish.\n\n584\n00:32:06.475 --> 00:32:08.365\nOkay, so\nit's telling me I do need to restart.\n\n585\n00:32:08.365 --> 00:32:13.163\nUsuall, you'll also be able to\nspecify in some of those options.\n\n586\n00:32:13.163 --> 00:32:16.470\nProbably, it's not gonna be,\nit is a little bit more advanced for\n\n587\n00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:17.668\nthis particular exam.\n\n588\n00:32:17.668 --> 00:32:21.366\nBut I do want you to know that\nyou have the ability to check\n\n589\n00:32:21.366 --> 00:32:24.919\nverification there as well\nas running stress tests.\n\n590\n00:32:24.919 --> 00:32:26.745\nYou don't wanna leave it running, though.\n\n591\n00:32:26.745 --> 00:32:29.310\nYou do wanna go back and\ndisable that because it does,\n\n592\n00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:31.193\nyou'll see some system performance.\n\n593\n00:32:31.193 --> 00:32:35.600\nBecause it is kinda just hammering\nthose drivers there for you.\n\n594\n00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.818\nThe more you pick, obviously,\n\n595\n00:32:37.818 --> 00:32:42.180\nthe more substantial performance\nissues you would see there.\n\n596\n00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.331\nBut that's a lot with drivers,\nunfortunately,\n\n597\n00:32:44.331 --> 00:32:47.210\nI don't think we're finished\ntalking about drivers yet, Mike.\n\n598\n00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:48.956\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, I think we'll just go ahead and\n\n599\n00:32:48.956 --> 00:32:49.906\ntable that for now.\n\n600\n00:32:49.906 --> 00:32:50.845\n&gt;&gt; That sounds good,\n\n601\n00:32:50.845 --> 00:32:54.260\nthat means we're gonna come back\nwith more information on drivers.\n\n602\n00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.866\nBut for now, we're gonna wrap this one up.\n\n603\n00:32:55.866 --> 00:32:57.990\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n604\n00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:00.640\nSigning off for IT ProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n605\n00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.543\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n606\n00:33:01.543 --> 00:33:04.006\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n607\n00:33:04.006 --> 00:33:10.054\n[MUSIC]\n\n608\n00:33:10.054 --> 00:33:16.648\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

ITPRO.TV, I'm your host,\n\n6\n00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:17.087\nMike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:17.087 --> 00:00:20.570\nToday, we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10,\n\n8\n00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.370\ngetting ready for that 70-698 exam.\n\n9\n00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.830\nIn this episode, we're going to be taking\na look at configuring devices and drivers.\n\n10\n00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.710\nNow this is a part two, so if you missed\nthe first part, make sure you go back and\n\n11\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.350\ncheck that out.\n\n12\n00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.200\nBut here with us back in studios\nagain is none other than Ms.\n\n13\n00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.510\nCherokee Boose, welcome back, Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n15\n00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.550\nI know, hopefully you're not sick\nof hearing about drivers because\n\n16\n00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.060\nwe still have a lot to cover here,\na whole lot of driver talk.\n\n17\n00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.340\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, drivers are great,\nthey allow us to interact with all\n\n18\n00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.000\nthe different pieces of hardware\nwe want to put in our machines.\n\n19\n00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.100\nAnd for the most part, Windows deals with\nthem, and we don't have to anymore, right?\n\n20\n00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.070\nIt's come a long way since back in\nthe Windows 9X days, and things like that.\n\n21\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.980\nBut there are some things we need\nto understand when Windows can't do\n\n22\n00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.880\nwhat we want it to.\n\n23\n00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.797\nOr we want it to do something\nit's not really designed to do.\n\n24\n00:01:02.797 --> 00:01:06.214\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those good old error messages,\nwhen those pop up and you're like,\n\n25\n00:01:06.214 --> 00:01:09.320\nhey, you can't install this driver,\nit's not signed, right?\n\n26\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.115\nAnd we talked about having that additional\nsecurity there here with our kernel mode\n\n27\n00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.445\ndrivers needing to have that signature.\n\n28\n00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:20.205\nBut what if you really need to get that\ndriver installed, well, what do you do?\n\n29\n00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:23.815\nWell, luckily there are several different\noptions that you have available\n\n30\n00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:26.065\nto allow those drivers to be installed.\n\n31\n00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:27.795\nSo I think that's what we'll do here.\n\n32\n00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:32.355\nBut let's start in the GUI before we\nmove to some command line options and\n\n33\n00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:34.455\ntake a look at how we can\nget those drivers installed.\n\n34\n00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:37.400\nSo, here on my screen,\nI'm just going to go ahead and\n\n35\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.520\npull up my Start menu\nby right clicking here.\n\n36\n00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.520\nAnd now if I hold down my shift key,\n\n37\n00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.900\nwhen I go to shut down or sign out,\nI'm going to go ahead and select Restart.\n\n38\n00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.060\nSo I'm holding down my shift key,\nand what that will do for\n\n39\n00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.540\nme is it'll allow me to boot up\ninto Advanced mode options here.\n\n40\n00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.180\nThis screen that you see right here.\n\n41\n00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.181\nThe boot process is so fast for Windows\n10 machines that it's kind of hard to get\n\n42\n00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:10.421\ninto otherwise, so\nthat's just a little trick there.\n\n43\n00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:15.441\nAnd so what we're going to do here\nis we're going to go ahead and\n\n44\n00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:17.838\nunder our Advanced options.\n\n45\n00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:21.630\nWe're going to go into our\nTroubleshooting section, and\n\n46\n00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.189\nfrom Troubleshooting,\nyou'll see your Advanced options.\n\n47\n00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.430\nNow when you get in here, we're going to\nnotice that we have a couple different\n\n48\n00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.160\noptions to go ahead and select.\n\n49\n00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.140\nBut the one that we want to go into\nis going to be our Startup Settings,\n\n50\n00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.310\nover here in the bottom right hand corner.\n\n51\n00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.370\nNow once you get into your Startup\nSettings, and I can't really zoom in,\n\n52\n00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.160\nbut we'll take a look at what\nwe need to look at here.\n\n53\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.640\nWe have some options that it's going\nto give us after the machine restarts.\n\n54\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.870\nSo really, this is the only option\nI have at this moment in time, so\n\n55\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.810\nI just have to hit Restart.\n\n56\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.870\nAnd then once the machine restarts,\nI'll have a menu driven interface.\n\n57\n00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.220\nVery similar to what it looks like here,\nsame like UI design, but\n\n58\n00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.370\ninstead of using the keyboard,\nI'll use a function key.\n\n59\n00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.710\nSo just giving this system\nhere a second to go ahead and\n\n60\n00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.180\nboot into those advanced boot options,\nif that makes sense.\n\n61\n00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.090\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you can get there\nthrough the newer control panel.\n\n62\n00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.440\nYou can get into your\nstartup options from there,\n\n63\n00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.610\nas well as the tricks she showed you with\nthe holding shift while choosing Restart.\n\n64\n00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.550\nAnother way to get in here,\n\n65\n00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.530\nand Cherokee, this isn't something\nthat we have to do a lot, right?\n\n66\n00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.240\nI mean, installing an unsigned\ndriver is not a super common thing.\n\n67\n00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's the thing,\nMike, that's what you were saying.\n\n68\n00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.650\nIt's something that we don't even really\nhave to work with drivers all that often.\n\n69\n00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.470\nBut when you do have those\nsituations where you have to install\n\n70\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.850\nan unsigned driver.\n\n71\n00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.940\nBut I will say this, for\nthis method here, it only holds or\n\n72\n00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.520\nretains this setting during\nthe one restart there.\n\n73\n00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.770\nSo, you have to think about that\n\n74\n00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.680\nif you have multiple unsigned drivers\nthat you want to be working with.\n\n75\n00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.710\nFor instance, if you're a developer and\n\n76\n00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.010\nyou're working with those\ndrivers quite often.\n\n77\n00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.390\nThen this is not going to be the option\nthat you choose, this is for a one and\n\n78\n00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.070\ndone type situation.\n\n79\n00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.940\nAnd we can see here from that list, you\ncan enter debugging mode which would be,\n\n80\n00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.190\ndebugging mode would allow for continual\nunsigned driver installations there.\n\n81\n00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.940\nAnd I'll show you a couple other\nways here in the command line.\n\n82\n00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.910\nBut for right now,\nyou're going to use your F keys,\n\n83\n00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.280\nyour function keys to go ahead and\nselect an option there.\n\n84\n00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.990\nOkay, so if you hit that F7 key,\n\n85\n00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.150\nit will allow you that one time bypassing\nbasically that driver enforcement.\n\n86\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.710\nSo I don't want to do that right now,\n\n87\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.190\nI do want to show you something\nhere in my virtual machine.\n\n88\n00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.240\nWe are going to jump into\na command line option as well.\n\n89\n00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.510\nSo I'm pulling up an administrative\ncommand prompt and\n\n90\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.600\nI'm going to be utilizing\nthe bcdedit tool.\n\n91\n00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.260\nSo here we're going to type in bcdedit,\nto go ahead and\n\n92\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.958\nbring that up, and it's a dash,\nnot forward slash like in PowerShell.\n\n93\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.158\nBut we're going to use the parameter here,\nset, and\n\n94\n00:05:02.158 --> 00:05:04.730\nthen we're going to turn on test signing.\n\n95\n00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.670\nSo if you're a developer and\nyou want to be testing often, so\n\n96\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.550\nthat's why you're turning this option on.\n\n97\n00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.500\nI know the wording is kind of\nstrange because you are kind\n\n98\n00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.100\nof bypassing something.\n\n99\n00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.200\nSo we will go ahead and type in test\nS-I-G-N-I-N-G, signing on and hit enter.\n\n100\n00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.660\nAnd so\nnow this puts me in a particular mode or\n\n101\n00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.320\nstate that will allow me\nto restart the computer.\n\n102\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.240\nI don't have to worry about it if\nI were doing this multiple times.\n\n103\n00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.320\nAnd the key thing here to remember\nthat you do need to turn this off\n\n104\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.270\nwhen you're finished using it because for\nobvious security reasons.\n\n105\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.304\nYou don't want to allow\nunsigned drivers to be,\n\n106\n00:05:42.304 --> 00:05:47.120\nmaybe your system becomes compromised,\nso you always want to turn that off.\n\n107\n00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.670\n&gt;&gt; Before you do that,\ncan you run bcdedit?\n\n108\n00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.750\nJust by itself, just bcdedit?\n\n109\n00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.390\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.930\n&gt;&gt; And show them how they can see that,\ntell whether their system in that mode,\n\n111\n00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.290\nthat very last, it should be in there.\n\n112\n00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.450\n&gt;&gt; Policy for the standard,\nlet's see here.\n\n113\n00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.970\n&gt;&gt; Testsigning, about five up.\n\n114\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.530\n&gt;&gt; Right here, so, yeah,\nyou can check that, too.\n\n115\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.770\nSo, that's a good option as well, Mike.\n\n116\n00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.390\nSo if you're coming onto\na system that maybe\n\n117\n00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.520\nyou're working with a partner in\na dev environment or something?\n\n118\n00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.330\n&gt;&gt; Or did I remember to turn that back on,\nlet's make sure, yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n119\n00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so, because you said\nthat, let's go ahead and do that, Mike.\n\n120\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.080\nSo I'm just going to go ahead and\nhit my up arrow here, and\n\n121\n00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.700\nthis is that syntax that\nwe had originally used.\n\n122\n00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.660\nAnd I'm just going to turn that from on\nto off, and we'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n123\n00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.510\nNow there's also another option\nthat Windows does offer us and\n\n124\n00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.830\nit's going to be able to\ndisable integrity checks.\n\n125\n00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.350\nSo integrity checks are going\nto be utilized for validation.\n\n126\n00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.106\nSo, I honestly can't think of a really\ngood use case scenario why you\n\n127\n00:06:49.106 --> 00:06:51.079\nwould want to disable that.\n\n128\n00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:56.713\nUnless you were a developer and\nyou were testing,\n\n129\n00:06:56.713 --> 00:07:01.809\nso bcdedit, and\nthat's going to be -set and\n\n130\n00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:04.910\nthen no integrity checks.\n\n131\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.730\nFor this syntax, and you're going\nto go ahead and turn that off.\n\n132\n00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.360\nAnd then, alternatively, you will\njust go ahead and change that to on\n\n133\n00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.396\nto get those integrity\nchecks back on there.\n\n134\n00:07:20.396 --> 00:07:23.033\nSo a couple of different options for you.\n\n135\n00:07:23.033 --> 00:07:27.370\nNow let's say you are in\na development mode.\n\n136\n00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.300\nOr maybe you're just in an environment\nwhere you're installing and\n\n137\n00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.300\nuninstalling drivers often.\n\n138\n00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.990\nWell, sometimes what happens is the\nresidual elements from those installations\n\n139\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.450\nget left behind.\n\n140\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:43.270\nSo in order to remove unnecessary\ncomponents or files on your system.\n\n141\n00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.300\nYou can go ahead and think about\nthat a couple of different ways.\n\n142\n00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.094\nSo, number one, you could utilize the GUI,\nand we'll start there.\n\n143\n00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:54.974\nIf you just go in your search bar and\ntype in disk cleanup,\n\n144\n00:07:54.974 --> 00:08:00.477\nall right, so we're going to go ahead and\nselect disk cleanup.\n\n145\n00:08:00.477 --> 00:08:03.915\nOops, not from the internet there.\n\n146\n00:08:03.915 --> 00:08:05.940\nI am on a roll with my Start menu today.\n\n147\n00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.010\nLet me just go ahead and get out of that.\n\n148\n00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.020\nAll right, so disk, okay there we go.\n\n149\n00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.880\nThe desktop app, clicked on the wrong one.\n\n150\n00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.080\nSo this will automatically launch and\nstart analyzing your system.\n\n151\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.620\nAnd you can see that,\nthat was pretty quick.\n\n152\n00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.050\nIt went really fast.\n\n153\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.380\nThe reason being is this\nis a virtual machine and\n\n154\n00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.760\nI don't have a lot of residual files for\nit to check.\n\n155\n00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.740\nSo what the system was doing\nis just running through and\n\n156\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.740\nchecking to see if there\nwere residual files.\n\n157\n00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.090\nIf you in fact did have a lot of files,\n\n158\n00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.830\nit would take longer to go ahead and\nrun that.\n\n159\n00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:03.540\nNow, you can use disk cleanup to remove\nany kind of left over files, but\n\n160\n00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.650\nspecifically, we wanna look at any\nkind of driver package remnants.\n\n161\n00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.290\nSo, if you select this option here\nthat says clean up system files,\n\n162\n00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.530\nthat will take you to the page where you\nactually, it's gonna go ahead and scan and\n\n163\n00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:22.340\ncheck, analyze, for the system files here,\nand then bring you to the option to see if\n\n164\n00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.820\nyou have any driver packages that you can\nget rid of there, and just take a second.\n\n165\n00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:33.000\nAnd again, depending on the health\nstatus of your hard drive to begin with,\n\n166\n00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.540\nthen it might take a little bit longer.\n\n167\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.648\nThis one shouldn't be too bad.\n\n168\n00:09:36.648 --> 00:09:44.120\nAll right, [COUGH]\nnow in this window you'll have to\n\n169\n00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.710\nscroll down a little bit and you can see\nthat it's already checked by default here.\n\n170\n00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.640\nIt says, device driver packages,\ncurrently,\n\n171\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.170\nI don't have any additional driver\npackages that need to be removed,\n\n172\n00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.640\nbut if I did, this is where I\nwould go ahead and remove that.\n\n173\n00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.930\nAnd it also shows you the amount\nof size that you would,\n\n174\n00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.050\nthe storage space that you would\nregain by actually deleting those.\n\n175\n00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.970\nSo we'll just hit OK here.\n\n176\n00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.130\nActually, we'll just hit Cancel so\nit'll be quick for us.\n\n177\n00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.050\nBut that's where you would go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n178\n00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.398\nNow, another tool that I want to go\nahead and bring up is going to be my,\n\n179\n00:10:18.398 --> 00:10:25.478\n[COUGH] let me zoom back out here,\nis going to be our DISM tool.\n\n180\n00:10:25.478 --> 00:10:27.503\n&gt;&gt; Dism.\n\n181\n00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:32.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah And You know what,\n\n182\n00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.770\nlet me just pull up an administrative,\nI'm all over the place today.\n\n183\n00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.285\nThe thing about DISM is\nit's a lot of syntax, so,\n\n184\n00:10:39.285 --> 00:10:44.143\nyou'll be glad to know that I did\nhave my syntax already pre-typed,\n\n185\n00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:48.497\nMike, so that's going to help\nus out a little bit actually and\n\n186\n00:10:48.497 --> 00:10:53.150\nlet me shrink this window a little bit so\nI can just copy and paste.\n\n187\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.962\nThat will help us or help me at least.\n\n188\n00:10:56.962 --> 00:11:01.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're probably laughing and\n\n189\n00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.150\nhaving a good time with that.\n\n190\n00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.060\nAll right.\n\n191\n00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.700\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n\n192\n00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.790\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; We also know how\n\n193\n00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.420\nthis\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n194\n00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.512\n&gt;&gt; It's no fun typing while people are you\n\n195\n00:11:08.512 --> 00:11:09.270\nwatching you.\n\n196\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.310\n&gt;&gt; It never happens when\nyou're by yourself, ever.\n\n197\n00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.712\nOkay, so the first line of syntax\nthat I'm gonna take right here,\n\n198\n00:11:17.712 --> 00:11:20.492\nwe'll just go ahead and copy this on over.\n\n199\n00:11:25.253 --> 00:11:27.550\nAll right, and let's take a look\nat what's happening here.\n\n200\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.508\nSo to do some online clean up,\n\n201\n00:11:29.508 --> 00:11:34.050\nanalyze component store,\nlet's talk about that for a second.\n\n202\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.460\nWell, what's your component store?\n\n203\n00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.700\nThis is going to be your Windows\nsxs your side by side store.\n\n204\n00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.460\nThis is where all those installations and\nfeature files are going to be stored.\n\n205\n00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.210\nYou never want to go in and\nactually delete that particular file.\n\n206\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.610\nThat's not what we are doing here.\n\n207\n00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.520\nWe're actually gonna be,\nI'm gonna hit enter,\n\n208\n00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:57.050\nhere we're gonna be analyzing that area of\nthe system, so what it's doing is checking\n\n209\n00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:02.190\nto see if hey maybe I installed\na driver package, a later version,\n\n210\n00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:07.040\nand then I don't need\nthe previous redundant copies of\n\n211\n00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.170\nwhatever files in that SXS store,\nso that's what they're doing here.\n\n212\n00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.340\nIt's checking to see if there's\nanything that we can get rid of.\n\n213\n00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.300\nAnd again, you saw with our, well,\n\n214\n00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.740\nI guess you didn't see,\nbecause there really wasn't a lot in my,\n\n215\n00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:28.870\nit really is contingent upon how much\nhow many files you have remaining.\n\n216\n00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:29.990\nSo, if you don’t have a lot,\n\n217\n00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.800\nyou’re not goinna be gaining\na whole lot through this process.\n\n218\n00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.370\nSo really, in situations where\nyou're low on disk space, and\n\n219\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:42.530\ndisk space was critical for you, then\nthat’s when you would run this, and we\n\n220\n00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:47.620\ncan see here that currently I don’t even\nhave any number of reclaimable packages,\n\n221\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.850\nso there wasn't a whole lot,\nthat I would be gaining.\n\n222\n00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.570\n&gt;&gt; So, Cherokee that really looks like the\nsame kind of information we were getting\n\n223\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.910\nback from the wizard in a GUI.\n\n224\n00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so, really we're getting\nthat analysis back from them, but\n\n225\n00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.270\nwe haven't done anything yet.\n\n226\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.580\nSo, we're just getting that info.\n\n227\n00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.090\nIf you actually wanna act on that,\n\n228\n00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.430\nwe do have another command that\nwe would need to run, Mike.\n\n229\n00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.770\nSo we'll go ahead and copy that in.\n\n230\n00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:16.580\nSo once we go ahead and run our\nanalysis and everything checks out, we\n\n231\n00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:21.500\nfeel that it would be beneficial for us,\nthen we can go ahead and run this command.\n\n232\n00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.496\nYou see it's DISM and\nlet me just make this a little bit larger.\n\n233\n00:13:24.496 --> 00:13:30.830\nDISM, online, cleanup-image,\nStartComponentCleanup.\n\n234\n00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.010\nAnd then reset to your base.\n\n235\n00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.190\nI'll also include the syntax\nin the show notes there, so\n\n236\n00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.240\ndon't worry about trying to\nwrite that all down real quick.\n\n237\n00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.490\nAnd again, because my system was\nrelatively clean to begin with,\n\n238\n00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.668\nit didn't take very long.\n\n239\n00:13:44.668 --> 00:13:47.949\nAnd you could see here\nby that progression bar,\n\n240\n00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:52.796\njust depending on how clean your\nsystem was that'll take extra time.\n\n241\n00:13:55.446 --> 00:13:59.677\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nclear out my screen because DISM, not only\n\n242\n00:13:59.677 --> 00:14:04.220\nis good for this analysis and cleanup DISM\ncan be used for a lot of different things.\n\n243\n00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:09.300\nAnd one of the things that Windows wants\nus to be aware of is driver packages,\n\n244\n00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.800\nwhat if we have images that\nare offline and we wanna go ahead and\n\n245\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.420\ninstall driver packages to that image for\nan easier deployment?\n\n246\n00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.550\nThis DISM tool is going to be one\nof the ways that you can do that.\n\n247\n00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.580\nSo a few things first,\nI have to actually have an image, so\n\n248\n00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.300\nlet me just pull up file explorer and tell\nyou what I've done here on this system.\n\n249\n00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.980\nSo, I have a demo folder.\n\n250\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:41.140\nInside of my demo folder is going to be\nmy installation file, my source files.\n\n251\n00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.250\nIt was under my source files.\n\n252\n00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:46.250\nUnder the ISO that I downloaded and\nit's a .win file.\n\n253\n00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:50.850\nI will say this, so\nat least in my experience by default,\n\n254\n00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:55.690\nthe settings here if we go under our\nproperties and look at those permissions,\n\n255\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:00.300\nit was noted as a read only file,\nthis is gonna cause some problems\n\n256\n00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.850\nwhenever we go to utilize this WIN file.\n\n257\n00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.980\nSo what we wanna do is just make\nsure we uncheck that read only file.\n\n258\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.660\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nselect Apply or OK or both.\n\n259\n00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.991\nWe're just gonna apply it to\nthe subfolder, there aren't any, and\n\n260\n00:15:16.991 --> 00:15:18.260\nI am logged in as an admin.\n\n261\n00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.080\nYou saw that UAC saying hey,\nyou will need those permission, so\n\n262\n00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.350\njust know that as well in order\nto perform these functions here.\n\n263\n00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.030\nOkay.\n\n264\n00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.180\nAnd the other thing that I\nhave here sitting on my root\n\n265\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.830\nis going to be a folder called drivers.\n\n266\n00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:37.625\nSo, and that's why I didn't want to leave\nany of those settings persistent to allow\n\n267\n00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:42.283\nme to run unsigned drivers because I want\nto show you here utilizing the DISM tool,\n\n268\n00:15:42.283 --> 00:15:45.481\nwhat that would look like if\nyou encountered a problem.\n\n269\n00:15:45.481 --> 00:15:49.185\nSo that's gonna be my unsigned\ndriver in this folder here,\n\n270\n00:15:49.185 --> 00:15:51.045\njust a basic display driver.\n\n271\n00:15:51.045 --> 00:15:54.040\nNothing really crazy there.\n\n272\n00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:59.215\nAll right So the first command\n\n273\n00:15:59.215 --> 00:16:05.090\nthat I wanna go ahead and use here\nis gonna be gism, or [LAUGH] gism?\n\n274\n00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.240\nDism get I'm combining things here.\n\n275\n00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.425\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n276\n00:16:09.425 --> 00:16:13.986\nuse the Get-ImageInfo and\nwe're specifying the path.\n\n277\n00:16:13.986 --> 00:16:16.592\nNow, although I am\nproviding you this syntax,\n\n278\n00:16:16.592 --> 00:16:19.360\nyou do need to tailor\nthis to your environment.\n\n279\n00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.490\nI just that demo folder with\nthe installation file on my C: drive for\n\n280\n00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:24.710\neasy access.\n\n281\n00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.880\nYou will need to navigate.\n\n282\n00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.680\nAfter this first semicolon,\n\n283\n00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.650\nyou'll need to specify the path to\nyour actual installation file there.\n\n284\n00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:39.882\nAnd also, using this dism command is\na little different than what you might\n\n285\n00:16:39.882 --> 00:16:45.462\nbe familiar with if you've used PowerShell\na lot, it's gonna be : c : there.\n\n286\n00:16:45.462 --> 00:16:48.150\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nhit Enter there.\n\n287\n00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:53.260\nSo what this is doing is\nactually looking for other, so\n\n288\n00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:58.400\nit's looking for the information\nassociated with that path that I provided.\n\n289\n00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.050\nSo if I had multiple WIN files, it's\nsomething you kinda have to think about,\n\n290\n00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.950\nbecause you wanna make sure you're\nworking with the proper WIN file.\n\n291\n00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.750\nWhenever I'm using Dism,\nI'm using the syntax, I can call out and\n\n292\n00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.150\nspecify it a couple of\ndifferent ways here.\n\n293\n00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.910\nI could specify by index so\n\n294\n00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:18.960\nI know that now, this image is going\nto be referenced by index number one.\n\n295\n00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.130\nI could also utilize, if I wanted to type\na little bit more, the full name here.\n\n296\n00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:28.030\nAnd so, this particular win file is for\nmy Windows 10 enterprise evaluation.\n\n297\n00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.710\nSo either way, just knowing\nthat you do have those options.\n\n298\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.290\nAnd I think, yep, I did, I went the lazy\nroute and I just used my index,\n\n299\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:39.640\nbecause that's less typing there I'm going\nto go ahead and run this next command.\n\n300\n00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.420\nLet's take a look at what's\nhappening here with that syntax.\n\n301\n00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.770\nI have dism mount wim.\n\n302\n00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.380\nWe're taking that wim, we're actually\nmounting it to the operating system and\n\n303\n00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.899\nI'm specifying from where I'm mounting.\n\n304\n00:17:56.899 --> 00:18:01.086\nOkay, so I am mounting it from that\ninstallation where I showed you in that c\n\n305\n00:18:01.086 --> 00:18:02.832\ndrive under that demo folder.\n\n306\n00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:06.801\nAnd I'm specifying that particular\nwhim like making sure I'm not going to\n\n307\n00:18:06.801 --> 00:18:08.825\nbe working with some other win files.\n\n308\n00:18:08.825 --> 00:18:12.013\nSo this is going to be index one\nalternatively you could use that name if\n\n309\n00:18:12.013 --> 00:18:15.599\nyou wanted to type that it out you just\nhave to make sure to use your quotations.\n\n310\n00:18:15.599 --> 00:18:19.380\nSo that it sees it as one\nwhole string of syntax.\n\n311\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.800\nAnd then, we would go ahead and\nmount this to another folder that I had.\n\n312\n00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.230\nThis is going to be\na demo off line folder.\n\n313\n00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.800\nSo we'll go ahead and hit Enter there.\n\n314\n00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:31.970\nAnd you know what?\n\n315\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:36.770\nI said another folder that I have,\nbut I might not have created it.\n\n316\n00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:38.330\nLet's go ahead and check in PowerShell.\n\n317\n00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.160\nSo that's fine.\n\n318\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.888\nYou guys can see what might\nhappen if you don't have that.\n\n319\n00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:47.630\nI'm just gonna look under my C drive,\nand I don't have an offline folder.\n\n320\n00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.000\nSo let's just go ahead and\ncreate a new folder.\n\n321\n00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.070\nWe'll name this off line.\n\n322\n00:18:55.482 --> 00:19:00.970\nAll right, and now I'm just gonna rerun\nthat syntax that we saw here before.\n\n323\n00:19:07.368 --> 00:19:09.117\nLet me see.\n\n324\n00:19:09.117 --> 00:19:10.850\nDemo offline.\n\n325\n00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.818\nI put it on the root,\nthat was my mistake, sorry guys.\n\n326\n00:19:13.818 --> 00:19:19.180\n[LAUGH] Hold on,\nlet's move that guide just under our demo,\n\n327\n00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.220\nit wasn't straight off the The root there.\n\n328\n00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.140\nSo now, third time's the charm,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n329\n00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.080\nrun this and it'll go ahead and\nmount it to that location.\n\n330\n00:19:30.192 --> 00:19:31.800\nAll right,\nit just takes a second here, but\n\n331\n00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.580\nyou can see by that blinking\ncursor that it In fact\n\n332\n00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.740\nit is actually doing something here, just\ngive it a second to go ahead and mount.\n\n333\n00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:44.400\nAnd so what mounting does for us is it\nbasically gives us access to that WIM.\n\n334\n00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.510\nSo once this WIM will mount,\nthen we can go ahead and modify it.\n\n335\n00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:54.290\nAnd you can actually use this descent\ntool and mount these images and\n\n336\n00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.660\nWIM files for a number of different\nthings but here specifically.\n\n337\n00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.510\nSince we're talking about drivers,\nthat's what we're gonna be doing,\n\n338\n00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.740\nis adding that driver package\nto this particular file.\n\n339\n00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.190\nIt may take a little minute here,\nbut let's see.\n\n340\n00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.040\nIf it takes too long,\nwe'll do a time out, but\n\n341\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.715\nit's kind of chugging along there, Mike.\n\n342\n00:20:10.715 --> 00:20:11.670\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, slowly but surely.\n\n343\n00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:16.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a lot in IT, is you\njust gotta like hurry up and hurry up and\n\n344\n00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.100\nthen wait, and then\n&gt;&gt; Try to calculate how much time you\n\n345\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.200\nspend watching progress\nbars in the world of IT.\n\n346\n00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.350\nThere's a lot of time spent watching\neither spinning Cheerios or dots or?\n\n347\n00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.648\n&gt;&gt; You can, like kind of, look.\n\n348\n00:20:29.648 --> 00:20:32.799\nI've got 47% so you can kind of\nmeasure it in some way, sometimes.\n\n349\n00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:34.036\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n350\n00:20:34.036 --> 00:20:37.140\n&gt;&gt; So other times the progress\nbars are completely inaccurate.\n\n351\n00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.833\n&gt;&gt; I remember the first time I saw\na progress bar in a command prompt and\n\n352\n00:20:39.833 --> 00:20:41.143\nI thought that's really cool.\n\n353\n00:20:41.143 --> 00:20:42.997\nI know it's a geeky thing\nto get excited about.\n\n354\n00:20:42.997 --> 00:20:43.855\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n355\n00:20:43.855 --> 00:20:47.290\n&gt;&gt; But normally at a command prompt,\nyou don't see a whole lot like that.\n\n356\n00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.411\n&gt;&gt; And at least you have something\nto look forward to there.\n\n357\n00:20:49.411 --> 00:20:49.986\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n358\n00:20:49.986 --> 00:20:54.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and with that being said we are\nat 72% and we are almost finished here.\n\n359\n00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:00.790\nAnd also mounting this image here,\ndepending on how big the image is or\n\n360\n00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:05.631\nthat win file will also dictate how\nlong you're waiting as well as your\n\n361\n00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:08.440\nhardware for this particular process.\n\n362\n00:21:11.444 --> 00:21:12.076\n&gt;&gt; Almost there.\n\n363\n00:21:12.076 --> 00:21:13.312\n&gt;&gt; We're getting stuck at 78.\n\n364\n00:21:13.312 --> 00:21:14.953\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There it goes, look at it-\n\n365\n00:21:14.953 --> 00:21:17.821\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay cool, we're not stuck.\n\n366\n00:21:17.821 --> 00:21:19.910\nAll right, so what are we gonna do next?\n\n367\n00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:24.304\nOnce we go ahead and we get this image\nmounted what we're gonna be doing is we're\n\n368\n00:21:24.304 --> 00:21:28.123\ngoing to be specifying the path for\nthat driver That driver package.\n\n369\n00:21:28.123 --> 00:21:30.370\nThat's what we are going to do next.\n\n370\n00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.170\nAnd what we are waiting on this, I'll\njust copy my syntax and get that ready,\n\n371\n00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.850\nand we can look at that.\n\n372\n00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:45.359\n99 and then it's just like hanging there,\n\n373\n00:21:45.359 --> 00:21:47.346\nwaiting [CROSSTALK] I know [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n374\n00:21:47.346 --> 00:21:52.195\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You can do it.\n\n375\n00:21:52.195 --> 00:21:54.830\n&gt;&gt; That last percent always\ntakes twice as long as the rest.\n\n376\n00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:58.700\n&gt;&gt; It's okay, we'll talk about our syntax,\nwhat we're doing here.\n\n377\n00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.540\nI'll just have to zoom in so\nyou guys can see that one here.\n\n378\n00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:05.660\nSo what we're doing here under\nthis particular image, and\n\n379\n00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.600\nI have the image and\nWim interchangeably that you can use.\n\n380\n00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.440\nA lot of this syntax is variable\nlike you can use it interchangeably.\n\n381\n00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.370\nYou just look at the link online.\n\n382\n00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.280\nI do have that also in show notes.\n\n383\n00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:22.010\nAnd you could always just do the forward\nslash question mark to get additional help\n\n384\n00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.220\non how to use this tool\nin a number of ways.\n\n385\n00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.612\nBut we're gonna be using\nthe Add-Driver parameter and\n\n386\n00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:32.159\nthen we're gonna be specifying the\nlocation of that driver package where I\n\n387\n00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:35.334\nalready showed you in that\ndriver's folder there.\n\n388\n00:22:35.334 --> 00:22:37.715\nSo that's what we're gonna be doing.\n\n389\n00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:42.341\nAnd it does point all the way down\nto the actual inf that's sitting\n\n390\n00:22:42.341 --> 00:22:45.130\ninside of that driver package folder.\n\n391\n00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.430\nSo that's what we're looking out here.\n\n392\n00:22:48.564 --> 00:22:52.844\nOkay, and we are completed successfully,\nso I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n393\n00:22:52.844 --> 00:22:56.910\ncopy that syntax in,\nthat command and we'll hit Enter.\n\n394\n00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:01.280\nAnd essentially it's doing everything that\nI just explained what it should be doing.\n\n395\n00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.809\nJust give it some time,\nyou see that blinking\n\n396\n00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:08.080\ncursor there allowing the system to\nactually perform it's function here.\n\n397\n00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.210\nNow [COUGH]\ngive is one second,\n\n398\n00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:19.760\nOkay, this is what I wanted to.\n\n399\n00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.208\nOops, let me see here.\n\n400\n00:23:21.208 --> 00:23:22.419\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n401\n00:23:22.419 --> 00:23:25.360\n&gt;&gt; Log cannot be found.\n\n402\n00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.620\nLet me check that location.\n\n403\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.770\n&gt;&gt; Right there, yep.\n\n404\n00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:32.050\n&gt;&gt; C drivers.\n&gt;&gt; It's telling you it's not signed.\n\n405\n00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:33.320\n&gt;&gt; Where does it say that,\nright here, perfect.\n\n406\n00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.340\nThat's what I wanted to show you guys,\nsorry about that.\n\n407\n00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.150\nThe reason that I wanted\nto show this is because\n\n408\n00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.890\nif you were actually doing this in a real\nlife envrionment you may come across that.\n\n409\n00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.750\nLook this driver isn't signed and\nI'm getting an error here.\n\n410\n00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:52.750\nThen thing that you can do to\nkind of get around that is to\n\n411\n00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:56.469\nforce a particular signing of a driver.\n\n412\n00:23:56.469 --> 00:23:59.520\nAnd you just add a parameter,\nor a switch, here.\n\n413\n00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.843\nAnd I'll show you that, as well.\n\n414\n00:24:01.843 --> 00:24:04.919\nIt's actually just forceunsigned.\n\n415\n00:24:04.919 --> 00:24:10.785\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll hit the up arrow to go ahead.\n\n416\n00:24:10.785 --> 00:24:13.183\nActually, clear my screen because\nit looks a little messy here.\n\n417\n00:24:18.645 --> 00:24:22.602\nAll right, so we're gonna hit the up\narrow to pull that command back in.\n\n418\n00:24:22.602 --> 00:24:26.549\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\npaste that switch towards the end.\n\n419\n00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:29.669\nSo we're doing the same thing, but\nnow we're telling the system look,\n\n420\n00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:31.783\nyou're gonna go ahead and\ninstall the drivers.\n\n421\n00:24:31.783 --> 00:24:35.227\nSo that's what we see here by\nthe forceunsigned, and we'll go ahead and\n\n422\n00:24:35.227 --> 00:24:35.798\nhit Enter.\n\n423\n00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.920\nAnd then again,\njust give it a second there.\n\n424\n00:24:44.053 --> 00:24:48.575\nOkay, I might need to go back and\ncheck the location of that, too.\n\n425\n00:24:48.575 --> 00:24:50.305\nCuz that's what I was\nlooking on that first error.\n\n426\n00:24:50.305 --> 00:24:52.688\nI also saw that location,\nso that's kind of a clue.\n\n427\n00:24:52.688 --> 00:24:54.789\nLet me see here.\n\n428\n00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:58.528\n&gt;&gt; If you bring your last command back,\ncls ended up at the end of your pathname.\n\n429\n00:24:58.528 --> 00:25:00.193\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; When you tried to clear the screen,\n\n430\n00:25:00.193 --> 00:25:01.141\nto the end of your filename.\n\n431\n00:25:01.141 --> 00:25:01.883\n&gt;&gt; I do see it, yep.\n\n432\n00:25:01.883 --> 00:25:03.126\nLet me go ahead and get that off of there.\n\n433\n00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.166\nOkay, got it.\n\n434\n00:25:07.166 --> 00:25:12.808\n[LAUGH] Now when this actually happens,\nand you can see that it does happen here.\n\n435\n00:25:12.808 --> 00:25:16.303\nIt says the operation completed\nsuccessfully at the bottom.\n\n436\n00:25:16.303 --> 00:25:23.147\nThat's not the last step, and let me just\nget this last step going here for us,\n\n437\n00:25:23.147 --> 00:25:30.119\nand copy that over,\nWhat we're taking a look at here is, it's\n\n438\n00:25:30.119 --> 00:25:34.401\nkind of you have to have some commitment\nat this particular point in time.\n\n439\n00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:36.993\nYou're like look, okay so\nI just added this driver package.\n\n440\n00:25:36.993 --> 00:25:39.044\nThis This is what I want to do.\n\n441\n00:25:39.044 --> 00:25:43.354\nYou could use recurse option if\nyou wanted to add more drivers.\n\n442\n00:25:43.354 --> 00:25:48.721\nYou would just put all the driver packages\nin one folder and then it would add all\n\n443\n00:25:48.721 --> 00:25:54.410\nthe driver packages that were contained in\nthat folder, if you wanted to add more.\n\n444\n00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:59.795\nIf you wanted to create more modifications\nwith the DISM tool you could.\n\n445\n00:25:59.795 --> 00:26:04.810\nIf we were perfect and set and\nready to go, we would type unmount.\n\n446\n00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:07.352\nSo this is actually the same\ncommand that we used to mount.\n\n447\n00:26:07.352 --> 00:26:11.207\nBut instead we don't have to specify\nwhere we want to mount it to.\n\n448\n00:26:11.207 --> 00:26:15.475\nWe're just saying okay, we specified\nthe location and then we're committing.\n\n449\n00:26:15.475 --> 00:26:20.424\nSo we're saying this is the change I\nwant to be applied to this actual WIM\n\n450\n00:26:20.424 --> 00:26:21.256\nfile here.\n\n451\n00:26:21.256 --> 00:26:24.979\nAlternatively, you could type\nDiscard instead of Commit,\n\n452\n00:26:24.979 --> 00:26:28.340\nif you wanted to get rid of\nthose changes that you made.\n\n453\n00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.408\nBut we're just gonna go ahead and\nhit Commit here, and\n\n454\n00:26:32.408 --> 00:26:36.397\ngive it a second to actually commit and\nthen unmount.\n\n455\n00:26:36.397 --> 00:26:39.906\nThis is something that you have to do\nin order to be able to go ahead and\n\n456\n00:26:39.906 --> 00:26:40.716\nuse that file.\n\n457\n00:26:40.716 --> 00:26:46.143\nBut it's really cool if you think about it\nbecause if you use a tool like sysprep and\n\n458\n00:26:46.143 --> 00:26:47.961\nyou get a generalized WIM.\n\n459\n00:26:47.961 --> 00:26:50.710\nSomething that can be\nused a number of times.\n\n460\n00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:55.420\nAnd I go ahead and add my drivers, my\npackage to this WIM file, create it, and\n\n461\n00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.695\nreally make it in a way that I need for\nmy environment.\n\n462\n00:26:58.695 --> 00:27:01.761\nI could go ahead and\ndeploy this a number of times and\n\n463\n00:27:01.761 --> 00:27:06.766\nI wouldn't have to go to each individual\nmachine and install that driver package.\n\n464\n00:27:06.766 --> 00:27:11.329\nSo it is really cool when you think about\njust doing it once and getting it set up.\n\n465\n00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:14.647\nAnd then not having to do it several\ntimes later on down the road.\n\n466\n00:27:14.647 --> 00:27:19.300\nAll All right and it looks like we are\ngood to go and I think that's about it.\n\n467\n00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:23.074\nAs far as drivers go for\nnow there is another tool and Micah and\n\n468\n00:27:23.074 --> 00:27:24.554\nI'll just mention it.\n\n469\n00:27:24.554 --> 00:27:29.379\nI was kind of debating on mentioning it or\nnot but it's the [INAUDIBLE] tool.\n\n470\n00:27:29.379 --> 00:27:29.944\nright?\n\n471\n00:27:29.944 --> 00:27:33.672\nAnd so this particular tool allows\nyou to create provisioning packages.\n\n472\n00:27:33.672 --> 00:27:35.518\nAnd I'm sure we'll look at it again.\n\n473\n00:27:35.518 --> 00:27:40.180\nWe've already talked about it before, but\nwith previous versions you were able to\n\n474\n00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.319\nadd driver packages to actual\nprovisioning packages.\n\n475\n00:27:43.319 --> 00:27:47.203\nWith the newest version,\nthey don't have that setting, so\n\n476\n00:27:47.203 --> 00:27:50.564\nI don't expect you to worry about that for\nthe exam.\n\n477\n00:27:50.564 --> 00:27:52.598\nBut just kinda keep an eye out for it.\n\n478\n00:27:52.598 --> 00:27:56.439\nThey may in subsequent versions\nadd that feature back in.\n\n479\n00:27:56.439 --> 00:27:58.958\n&gt;&gt; You say, do you have another name for\nit by chance?\n\n480\n00:27:58.958 --> 00:28:00.142\nYou said, the WCD tool?\n\n481\n00:28:00.142 --> 00:28:02.337\n&gt;&gt; The WCD tool, the ICD, yeah.\n\n482\n00:28:02.337 --> 00:28:09.755\nSo WCD is like the nickname that because\nWindows, the Configuration Designer.\n\n483\n00:28:09.755 --> 00:28:14.309\nSo I'm missing an I there but, yeah,\nthe acronym actually spells out WCD, so\n\n484\n00:28:14.309 --> 00:28:15.967\nyep, and that's the tool.\n\n485\n00:28:15.967 --> 00:28:17.958\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\n\n486\n00:28:17.958 --> 00:28:19.609\nwell great look there at\nworking with drivers,\n\n487\n00:28:19.609 --> 00:28:22.310\ngetting those drivers installed, and\nthen working with unsigned drivers.\n\n488\n00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:26.570\nSometimes we need to install the driver in\na test environment that maybe hasn't gone\n\n489\n00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:27.955\nthrough that process yet.\n\n490\n00:28:27.955 --> 00:28:32.517\nAlso interesting to see that Windows 10\nenforces that driver signing even when\n\n491\n00:28:32.517 --> 00:28:35.211\nyou're working with offline images, right?\n\n492\n00:28:35.211 --> 00:28:37.211\nDISM had to be told hey, go ahead and\n\n493\n00:28:37.211 --> 00:28:40.831\nallow this driver to be installed\neven though it's not signed.\n\n494\n00:28:40.831 --> 00:28:42.840\nSo good stuff there,\nI appreciate those demonstrations.\n\n495\n00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.941\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n496\n00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:47.542\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Roderick.\n\n497\n00:28:47.542 --> 00:28:48.563\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n498\n00:28:48.563 --> 00:28:51.012\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n499\n00:28:51.012 --> 00:28:57.028\n[MUSIC]\n\n500\n00:28:57.028 --> 00:28:59.859\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're\n\n4\n00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:10.749\nwatching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and\n\n5\n00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:15.285\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:17.060\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.000\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n8\n00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.560\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ntaking a look at some post installation\n\n9\n00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.510\nconfiguration.\n\n10\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.440\nHere to show us the way\nis Miss Cherokee Boose,\n\n11\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.720\nwelcome back Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me.\n\n12\n00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.630\nSo I'm really excited about this\nshow because a lot of times in IT,\n\n13\n00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.740\nwe don't get to express\nour creativity as much.\n\n14\n00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.780\nSure you can create network diagrams,\nand design networks,\n\n15\n00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.800\nand configure things and be creative\nwith your trouble shooting and what not.\n\n16\n00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.930\nBut we don't always get the pretty\nthings that the graphic designers get,\n\n17\n00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.060\nthe colors and all the UI elements.\n\n18\n00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.370\nSo we're gonna be looking\nat some customization here.\n\n19\n00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.660\nWe've already taken a look at different\nways that we can install Windows 10.\n\n20\n00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.110\nAnd in this show we're gonna be\ntaking a look at how to customize it.\n\n21\n00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.540\nSo it's gonna be fun.\n\n22\n00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.090\nI'm excited.\n[LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.590\n&gt;&gt; I am too.\n\n24\n00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.100\nLooking forward to it.\n\n25\n00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let's go ahead and\n\n26\n00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.950\nstart with the Start menu.\n\n27\n00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.590\nIf we take a look at my screen here,\non the bottom left-hand corner\n\n28\n00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.810\nthis is going to be the Windows logo here.\n\n29\n00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.960\nAnd that's going to be the button that'll\ngive us access to our start menu.\n\n30\n00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.200\nSo my computer and\nMike we actually have the same one here,\n\n31\n00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.880\nthis is going to be a,\nmy zoom is kind of stuck,\n\n32\n00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.136\nhold on give me one second.\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm\n\n33\n00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:40.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we have this in computer.\n\n34\n00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.750\nit's a touchscreen and so, I don't know\nif you use your touchscreen that often,\n\n35\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.452\nto be honest I really don't.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I forget about it half the time.\n\n36\n00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:50.037\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:01:50.037 --> 00:01:50.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I really do.\n\n38\n00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.829\n&gt;&gt; The cool news is\n\n39\n00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.647\nthat Microsoft recognizes that a lot of\nusers actually do use a touchscreen and\n\n40\n00:01:56.647 --> 00:01:59.640\nespecially for tablet users and so forth.\n\n41\n00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.550\nSo the operating system is\npretty flexible in that way.\n\n42\n00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.920\nSo a lot of the things I will show you,\nwill be demonstrated here on this laptop.\n\n43\n00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.250\nSome of the things, I will show\nthe differences with touchscreen.\n\n44\n00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.740\nBut just know that there are so\n\n45\n00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.830\nmany little pieces to this operating\nsystem in the configuration.\n\n46\n00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.060\nI wasn't really, I haven't utilized\nall the features, let's just say that.\n\n47\n00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.680\nI really don't care about having\ncustom backgrounds and colors.\n\n48\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.240\nSome people might, and that's fine.\n\n49\n00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.770\nSo I just never really messed with\nall the tiles and everything.\n\n50\n00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.960\nI think I got stuck in that mentality\nwhere with XP it was great.\n\n51\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.300\nIt just had the very simple interface and\nI liked that.\n\n52\n00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.590\nAnd then Windows 7, again, great.\n\n53\n00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.090\nIt had everything that I needed.\n\n54\n00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.437\nAnd when it came to with the advent\nof when we saw Windows 8,\n\n55\n00:02:53.437 --> 00:02:56.780\n8.1 and we had these tiles everywhere.\n\n56\n00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.680\nPeople were like, what's going on and\nI never really got on board with that.\n\n57\n00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.280\nSo here in Windows 10 we kind\nof see a hybrid of the two.\n\n58\n00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.740\nSo we have the functionality that we love,\nplus the individuals who really have\n\n59\n00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.110\nthe like to leverage those\ntouch screen capabilities and\n\n60\n00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.640\nlook at those tiles at a glance.\n\n61\n00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.550\nWe have both of those,\nthe best of both worlds here in Windows\n\n62\n00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.501\n10.\n&gt;&gt; I'll say that I have come to really\n\n63\n00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.270\nenjoy the new start menu.\n\n64\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.630\nIt's, as you said, I like the way\nyou put it, kind of a hybrid.\n\n65\n00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.440\nThey went a little too far, maybe, or\nway out there at one point with Windows 8,\n\n66\n00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.810\nreined it back in and\nkind of gave us the best of both worlds.\n\n67\n00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.090\nI think it's one of those things\nyou either love it or hate it.\n\n68\n00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.400\nJust the other day, I mean,\nthis is literally last week,\n\n69\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.690\nI had somebody come to me with\na fresh install off Windows 10.\n\n70\n00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.400\nHow do I turn this back into Windows 2000?\n\n71\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.960\nHow do I get that old classic start menu?\n\n72\n00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.660\nAnd there is a feature.\n\n73\n00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.600\nMicrosoft will let you do that.\n\n74\n00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.360\nI think once you get used to\nthe new menu it's really it's nice.\n\n75\n00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.480\nIt's got a lot of things right\nthere at your fingertips.\n\n76\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.565\nThe live tiles.\n\n77\n00:03:57.565 --> 00:04:02.110\n[COUGH] Once you customize it and\nget it set up to the stuff that you use,\n\n78\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.900\nit can give you a lot of information\nright there at your fingertips.\n\n79\n00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.850\nSo it takes a little getting used to, but\n\n80\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.010\nI do like it.\n&gt;&gt; For sure,\n\n81\n00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.010\nso let's take a look at some of those\nfeatures because then you can go in and\n\n82\n00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.410\nplay around with them and see what it\nis that you wanna take advantage of.\n\n83\n00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.880\nAnd what you might just wanna remember for\nthe exam and\n\n84\n00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.110\nthen never really mess with it again.\n\n85\n00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.290\nI don't know. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; And\nthey did make it very customizable.\n\n86\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.269\nThat was the nice thing that\nthey done with Windows 10.\n\n87\n00:04:25.269 --> 00:04:26.918\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can't believe all these options\n\n88\n00:04:26.918 --> 00:04:28.940\nwe have.\n&gt;&gt; Everything you can customize on it.\n\n89\n00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.\n\n90\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.520\nAll right, so talking about\nhybrids lets just kinda stick\n\n91\n00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.628\nwith that theme for a second.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n92\n00:04:35.628 --> 00:04:38.192\n&gt;&gt; If we look at our start button here we\n\n93\n00:04:38.192 --> 00:04:41.360\nhave two different views\nof the start menu.\n\n94\n00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.180\nWe have a left click view and\na right click view.\n\n95\n00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.600\nSo first of all, let me show you guys\nwhat the left click view looks like and\n\n96\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.030\nwe can see this is the hybrid.\n\n97\n00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.260\nSo over here on the lefthand side,\nwe see applications.\n\n98\n00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.480\nAnd then this is an actual scroll bar.\n\n99\n00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.140\nAnd you can scroll down through\nall these applications here.\n\n100\n00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.040\nAnd we do have other options that\nwe'll take a look at as well.\n\n101\n00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.082\nNow over on the righthand side here, this\nis what Mike and I were talking about for\n\n102\n00:05:12.082 --> 00:05:16.970\nthat Windows 8,\n8.1 feel with the live tiles here.\n\n103\n00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:23.110\nNow, one way that I like to remember this,\nthe left click, it's large.\n\n104\n00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.320\nOkay, so left large.\n\n105\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.830\nI don't know if that helps you, but let's\ntake a look at the right click option.\n\n106\n00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.630\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and right click.\n\n107\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.780\nAnd here I see more of that\ntraditional menu, and you know what,\n\n108\n00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.710\nwhen I go to use my zoom it here,\nI forget about this too.\n\n109\n00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.460\nZoom It won't zoom in on the actual\npop up menu here, the action menu.\n\n110\n00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.690\nBut if you want to just go ahead and\nfollow along and do this with me,\n\n111\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.760\nit's Apps and features, Mobility Center,\npower options, event viewer system,\n\n112\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.210\nDevice Manager, network connections,\ndisk management, computer management.\n\n113\n00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.850\nPower Shell is right here on the menu so\n\n114\n00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.060\nthat's pretty cool too that they\nput that automatically in there.\n\n115\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.350\nA lot more options and\nwe'll take a look at a lot of these.\n\n116\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.270\nAnother quick way to go ahead and\naccess this menu here.\n\n117\n00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.950\nIf you go ahead and\nhold down just the Windows key.\n\n118\n00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.860\nSo if you hit the Windows key,\nactually not that menu,\n\n119\n00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.670\nit'll pull up the large or\nthe left-click option.\n\n120\n00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:32.041\nSo if you wanna go ahead and\ntake a look at the right-click option,\n\n121\n00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:35.510\nand the Windows Key will also minimize\nthis, so just hit the Windows Key and\n\n122\n00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.830\nit brings it back down.\n\n123\n00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.530\nBut if you wanna bring it up\nwith the right click option,\n\n124\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.080\nhold down the Windows Key with the W,\noops I always do this,\n\n125\n00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.550\nit's, Windows Key an I, not W, all right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.050\n&gt;&gt; My Workspace there,\n\n127\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.710\nI don't know why I get those two confused.\n\n128\n00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.540\nSo, if we hold down the Windows key and\nthe X button at the same time,\n\n129\n00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.820\nthis is going to go ahead and create\nthat right-click option for us, as well.\n\n130\n00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:06.100\nAll right, so now that we've taken a look\nat the left-click versus right-click,\n\n131\n00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.200\nlet's talk about a couple different other\noptions that we have available to us.\n\n132\n00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.360\nIf we utilize another keyboard shortcut,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n133\n00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.410\nselect the Windows key plus the I.\n\n134\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.460\nAnd what this will do is\nbring up my Windows settings.\n\n135\n00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.790\nAnd this is a nice little menu.\n\n136\n00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.320\nIt's kind of reminiscent but\na new more modern feel of\n\n137\n00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.060\nthe older Control Panel with access\nto all those Control Panel applets.\n\n138\n00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.040\nBecause Microsoft will take a lot of\nthose settings and categorize them.\n\n139\n00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.100\nSo we'll be poking around\nhere in Personalization.\n\n140\n00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.890\nAnd that's where we're gonna start,\n\n141\n00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.010\nwhere we'll continue to look\nat a lot of these settings.\n\n142\n00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.140\nLet me close out of here real quick\nbecause I also wanna show you, if I pull\n\n143\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.747\nup either one of these options here,\nwell if you left-click on the Windows key,\n\n144\n00:07:51.747 --> 00:07:55.314\ndown at the bottom left hand corner,\nthere's a little gear.\n\n145\n00:07:55.314 --> 00:07:56.900\nIt's like a cog.\n\n146\n00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.940\nAnd if you hover over it you can\nsee that it said settings there,\n\n147\n00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.910\nand you click on that,\nit will bring you to the same place.\n\n148\n00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.720\nI just wanted to show you\na couple different ways,\n\n149\n00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.520\nthere's always going to be, I say always,\nbut most likely more than one or\n\n150\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.370\neven two different ways to go ahead and\naccess something here.\n\n151\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.690\nSo, let's take a look at\npersonalization here.\n\n152\n00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.620\nAnd this is an option that\nwe do have available to us.\n\n153\n00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.480\nI'm trying to think if I want to go into,\n\n154\n00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.830\nyeah, let's just keep\ngoing with our start menu.\n\n155\n00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.690\nAnd they're just so many different\nlike customizations that it's hard for\n\n156\n00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.010\nme to think about which ones\nI wanna show you first, but\n\n157\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.650\nI'm trying to stick with a start menu and\ngo that way.\n\n158\n00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.110\nSo, let's look at this.\n\n159\n00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:43.742\nUnder the start menu options, you have the\nability to show more tiles on start, okay?\n\n160\n00:08:43.742 --> 00:08:47.190\nSo you were probably thinking,\nI don't know, maybe not, I can't assume.\n\n161\n00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.897\nBut I was already thinking there's a lot\nof different tiles on the start menu.\n\n162\n00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:53.223\nAnd I didn't really put them there, right?\n\n163\n00:08:53.223 --> 00:08:57.458\nA couple of them I did, but\nlet's just hit our Windows key here and\n\n164\n00:08:57.458 --> 00:08:59.230\ntake a look at what we have.\n\n165\n00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.339\nSo, and this is one way I was trying\nto play around with this, and\n\n166\n00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:07.826\nsee how many tiles are we gonna get.\n\n167\n00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:10.735\nI already see a lot of tiles here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n168\n00:09:10.735 --> 00:09:12.728\n&gt;&gt; If we turn this toggle off, and\n\n169\n00:09:12.728 --> 00:09:15.420\nthen we'll go ahead and pull it up again.\n\n170\n00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:21.231\nNotice how, if I look down at the bottom\nof my task bar here, right above my\n\n171\n00:09:21.231 --> 00:09:26.420\ncommand prompt that I have pinned to\nthe task bar, that's where the end stops.\n\n172\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:31.801\nAnd we if go ahead and turn on more tiles,\nand we'll pull our start menu up again,\n\n173\n00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:35.378\nyou can see that it extends\npast that command prompt.\n\n174\n00:09:35.378 --> 00:09:39.659\nSo, you're just gaining more\nstart menu real estate by\n\n175\n00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:43.154\nutilizing that toggle there.\n&gt;&gt; So is that actually changing\n\n176\n00:09:43.154 --> 00:09:44.718\nthe number of tiles on the start?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n177\n00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:47.010\nit's just giving you more space I think.\n\n178\n00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.660\nSo if you wanted to add more tiles,\nthen you would have that space.\n\n179\n00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.150\nOkay, the next one I wanna take a look at\nis showing the app list in the start menu.\n\n180\n00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:59.040\nThis one's pretty self-explanatory, again,\nwe'll just go ahead and launch that.\n\n181\n00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.780\nNow, over here on the left hand\nside I do see my applications and\n\n182\n00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.270\nthey are categorized by\nlike recently added, and\n\n183\n00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.660\nwe will also see these options\nhere under the start menu as well.\n\n184\n00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:13.120\nBut, let's look at what that actually\nlooks like when we take that toggle and\n\n185\n00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.170\nturn it off.\n\n186\n00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:20.050\nSo if I bring it back up,\nyou'll notice that those apps are gone.\n\n187\n00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.510\nAlternatively, you have, and\nI know, I can't zoom it here.\n\n188\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.320\nMaybe if I just use my\nWindows magnifying tool.\n\n189\n00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.800\nOkay, that works.\n\n190\n00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.830\nYou guys can see, I think, these little\nsymbols over on the left hand side.\n\n191\n00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.320\nSo alternatively,\nif you didn't want to go under settings\n\n192\n00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.560\nunder personalization to toggle that,\nyou could click right here.\n\n193\n00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.785\nThis is going to be representative of\nthe view that we're currently looking at\n\n194\n00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:47.730\nwithout those applications.\n\n195\n00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.363\nIf I wanted to switch back to\nthe applications, I could click on this\n\n196\n00:10:51.363 --> 00:10:55.467\nlittle, I don't know what kind of symbol\nthat is, but on the bottom there.\n\n197\n00:10:55.467 --> 00:10:57.715\nI don't know the specific term for\nthat, but\n\n198\n00:10:57.715 --> 00:11:01.392\nit's some little horizontal lines\nwith boxes, almost like a to do list.\n\n199\n00:11:01.392 --> 00:11:05.990\nOr actually, it's little miniature\nversion of the application list here.\n\n200\n00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:11.250\nSo, yeah, so that just takes us back\nto where we were with the application.\n\n201\n00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.430\nWell, actually, let me zoom out so\nyou guys can see this a little bit better.\n\n202\n00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.290\nThis is only the application list,\nso you can toggle through that way.\n\n203\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:23.598\nSo like I said, there is so\nmany options here, it's kind of crazy.\n\n204\n00:11:23.598 --> 00:11:27.722\nAll right,\nlet's continue with our list here though.\n\n205\n00:11:27.722 --> 00:11:29.730\nAnd we'll put the apps back on there.\n\n206\n00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.550\nNow, show recently added apps,\nif you guys noticed that\n\n207\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.430\nwas the first thing that I pointed\nout to you a few seconds ago.\n\n208\n00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.120\nSo I did recently add a few applications.\n\n209\n00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:45.180\nI got like this scanner and\nthis live home 3D from the windows store.\n\n210\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.300\nThese particular applications,\nso it just shows them there and\n\n211\n00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:53.300\nyou know this is pretty straight forward,\nthat toggle will remove them.\n\n212\n00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.700\nSame thing here with our\nmost used applications.\n\n213\n00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.370\nAnd this one's kind of interesting Mike,\nfor\n\n214\n00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:02.945\nthis particular section here it says,\noccasionally show suggestions in Start.\n\n215\n00:12:02.945 --> 00:12:06.380\nLet's see if it actually\nsuggests anything.\n\n216\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.480\nSometimes I've noticed it has,\nthere will be a section, and\n\n217\n00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.790\nI don't see it now so just know that.\n\n218\n00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:20.470\nMicrosoft does look at\nyour system use behavior,\n\n219\n00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.440\nand will recommend applications\nthat they think you might enjoy.\n\n220\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:30.160\nAnd again that is, if you recall\nwith our installation of Windows,\n\n221\n00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.240\nwe did have that option there to allow\nadditional monitoring to help really\n\n222\n00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:41.510\ntailor those suggestions to your style,\nthen we had a discussion about that also.\n\n223\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:47.010\nOkay, let's skip this one right here\nwhere it says you start full screen, and\n\n224\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.510\ncircle back to that.\n\n225\n00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:52.830\nAnd then again, this one is pretty\nself-explanatory underneath that one.\n\n226\n00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:58.870\nIt says show recently opened items in\nJump Lists, on Start of the taskbar.\n\n227\n00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.800\nLet's talk about that for a second.\n\n228\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.400\nSo, in the past I had always, I don't\nknow what you called them Mike, but\n\n229\n00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.930\nany kind of pop up menu,\nI would always call an action menu.\n\n230\n00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:16.210\nBut the terminology that we wanna use here\nin Windows 10 is going to be a Jump List.\n\n231\n00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.368\nSo, let me give you an example here.\n\n232\n00:13:19.368 --> 00:13:25.264\nIf I right-click on a command prompt, and\nI have just the ability to go ahead and\n\n233\n00:13:25.264 --> 00:13:30.110\nlaunch the command prompt as\nwell as unpin from the taskbar.\n\n234\n00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.224\nThe behaviors that are displayed\nin this Jump List,\n\n235\n00:13:33.224 --> 00:13:37.699\nare going to be different depending\non well, number one the application.\n\n236\n00:13:37.699 --> 00:13:40.334\nAlso number two,\nthe type of application it is,\n\n237\n00:13:40.334 --> 00:13:43.850\nwhether it be a desktop versus\na Windows Store application.\n\n238\n00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.530\nWe'll talk a little bit\nmore about that later, but\n\n239\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.360\njust be familiar with the terminologies.\n\n240\n00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.610\nSo this is a Jump List, and\n\n241\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:54.460\nyou see Jump Lists in the start\nmenu as well as with the taskbar.\n\n242\n00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.287\nSo, it provides you the ability to\nquickly jump from one thing to another,\n\n243\n00:13:58.287 --> 00:14:02.478\nultimately hoping, I think the idea was to\njust make you a little bit faster, more\n\n244\n00:14:02.478 --> 00:14:05.428\nefficient with utilizing these features.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n245\n00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.996\nI do definitely take advantage of these.\n\n246\n00:14:06.996 --> 00:14:11.099\nWhen I think of Jump List, I see the\nactions that are available there but then,\n\n247\n00:14:11.099 --> 00:14:13.040\nlike Excel is the one that I use a lot.\n\n248\n00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.440\nAnd when I right-click on my\nExcel icon in my taskbar or\n\n249\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.980\nin my Start menu,\nI see all the recently opened documents.\n\n250\n00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:26.050\nAnd so rather than opening Excel and\nthen having to go to Recent Documents,\n\n251\n00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.730\nor browse and find a file to open,\nI can simply right click on the Excel tile\n\n252\n00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.640\nin my Start menu,\nchoose the workbook that I wanna open, and\n\n253\n00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.870\nExcel will open up with that\nworkbook already loaded.\n\n254\n00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.869\nSo I definitely like Jump List,\nit's something that you'll get used\n\n255\n00:14:40.869 --> 00:14:44.867\nto it after a little while I think.\n&gt;&gt; And definitely it's growing on me,\n\n256\n00:14:44.867 --> 00:14:46.239\nthis little interface.\n\n257\n00:14:46.239 --> 00:14:49.544\nI'm really impressed with\neverything they have to offer here,\n\n258\n00:14:49.544 --> 00:14:51.139\nI'm not gonna lie about that.\n\n259\n00:14:51.139 --> 00:14:53.000\nI realized how much I was missing out on,\nso\n\n260\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.750\nhopefully you guys learn from my mistakes\nand take advantage of these cool features.\n\n261\n00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.260\nNow, I said we would come back\nto this portion right here,\n\n262\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.820\nso you start full screen.\n\n263\n00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.743\nCurrently it's off, let's take a look at,\nwell, it's going to be full screen,\n\n264\n00:15:06.743 --> 00:15:07.482\nyou know that.\n\n265\n00:15:07.482 --> 00:15:12.316\nBut we'll hit the icon here,\nWindows key to take a look at\n\n266\n00:15:12.316 --> 00:15:17.090\nit really does expand full screen.\n&gt;&gt; Very Windows 8-esque.\n\n267\n00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.615\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n268\n00:15:17.615 --> 00:15:18.190\nyep.\n&gt;&gt; Almost, right?\n\n269\n00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.960\n&gt;&gt; So takng you back to that kinda feel.\n\n270\n00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.060\nSo, sometimes whenever you have a device,\n\n271\n00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.570\nmaybe not like ours, Mike,\nan actual laptop which just a touchscreen.\n\n272\n00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:34.256\nBut let's say we had a Surface Pro or\nsomething like that, and\n\n273\n00:15:34.256 --> 00:15:37.920\nwe had a keyboard, a detachable keyboard.\n\n274\n00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:43.522\nSo, Windows 10 should automatically detect\nwhenever I'm connecting that keyboard and\n\n275\n00:15:43.522 --> 00:15:44.621\ndisconnecting.\n\n276\n00:15:44.621 --> 00:15:46.803\nAnd it should prompt by default, hey,\n\n277\n00:15:46.803 --> 00:15:50.588\nI've noticed you know I'm not sure\nwhat the exact message it says.\n\n278\n00:15:50.588 --> 00:15:53.620\nI've noticed you've added a keyboard or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n279\n00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.742\nDo you wanna run in tablet mode or\nPC mode?\n\n280\n00:15:56.742 --> 00:15:59.324\nSo to me, this is tablet mode, and\n\n281\n00:15:59.324 --> 00:16:04.720\nI'll show you guys how we can\nswitch between the two, as well.\n\n282\n00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.630\nSo it's nice because if I wanted to\njust touch on these larger icons,\n\n283\n00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.400\nit would allow me to do so.\n\n284\n00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.260\nBut we'll go ahead and-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n285\n00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.990\nI think that's something that we miss\nsometimes when we start looking at\n\n286\n00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.280\nStart menu, we start complaining or\nthinking about what we like or don't like.\n\n287\n00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.990\nThe fact that Windows 10 runs on all\ndevices and it's the same interface-\n\n288\n00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.780\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n289\n00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.880\n&gt;&gt; Whether it's a tablet,\n\n290\n00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.478\na phone, a big old desktop.\n\n291\n00:16:26.478 --> 00:16:31.110\nSo these customizations really\nallow you to configure it, so\n\n292\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.640\nthat start menu will work on any device\nno matter how big your screen is,\n\n293\n00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.130\nno matter whether you're using touch or\n\n294\n00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:40.399\nkeyboard to navigate, it's very slick\n&gt;&gt; And even when I was perusing\n\n295\n00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:44.437\nthe Windows store looking at the different\noptions here, you're reminded of that,\n\n296\n00:16:44.437 --> 00:16:48.304\nbecause you see the little icons that they\nhave in those application descriptions\n\n297\n00:16:48.304 --> 00:16:52.192\nabout all the different devices, and it\nis really cool when you think about that.\n\n298\n00:16:52.192 --> 00:16:57.137\nAll right, let's take a look a little\nbit more at our tablet versus PC mode,\n\n299\n00:16:57.137 --> 00:17:00.072\nso if I let me just close that or\nyou could hit,\n\n300\n00:17:00.072 --> 00:17:04.865\nI was gonna use my keyboard shortcuts,\nbut also we can just hit the backs,\n\n301\n00:17:04.865 --> 00:17:09.080\nthe back arrow here to get back\ninto this screen, just depends.\n\n302\n00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.210\nWhat I wanted to take a look at,\nlet's see where is that option,\n\n303\n00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:18.047\nit's going to be under our Settings,\nand then I think it's under System.\n\n304\n00:17:18.047 --> 00:17:22.370\nSo not under Personalization, okay,\nyes, it's under System, sorry guys.\n\n305\n00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.870\nSo here on the left hand side,\n\n306\n00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:29.500\nI'm gonna be looking about\nmidway it says Tablet mode.\n\n307\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.370\nSo this is where I have the ability\nto enable or disable that option.\n\n308\n00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.130\nAnd also, I have, and let me zoom in so\nyou guys can see this.\n\n309\n00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:46.610\nThe option here to determine how\nWindows reacts to those changes.\n\n310\n00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:47.770\nThose detects.\n\n311\n00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:52.210\nSo it says, when I sign in,\nuse the appropriate mode for my hardware.\n\n312\n00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:56.740\nAnd I can go ahead and specify\neither tablet mode or desktop mode.\n\n313\n00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.300\nAnd then, for those detects here when this\n\n314\n00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.110\ndevice automatically switches\ntablet mode on or off.\n\n315\n00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.520\nSo you can see the behaviors, basically.\n\n316\n00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.280\nSo really being able to customize\nwhat you want that device to do.\n\n317\n00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.790\nWhich is kind of cool, I mean, if you\nthink about, maybe you have tablets that\n\n318\n00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:16.150\nyou use as part of a display,\nat a trade show, or something like that.\n\n319\n00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.472\nYou want them to stay in a particular mode\nor configuration, something like that.\n\n320\n00:18:20.472 --> 00:18:25.440\nAll right,\njust a couple more options there,\n\n321\n00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.270\nbut let me zoom out, and I did wanna show\nyou how we can actually change that.\n\n322\n00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.180\nOops, let me close out of that.\n\n323\n00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.400\nI'm getting click happy here.\n\n324\n00:18:35.868 --> 00:18:40.744\nOkay, all right, so when we take a look\nat tablet mode, if for whatever reason,\n\n325\n00:18:40.744 --> 00:18:44.689\nmaybe you have, you're at a help desk,\nand someone calls you and\n\n326\n00:18:44.689 --> 00:18:48.930\nsays, I don't know why I can't\nget my normal start menu.\n\n327\n00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.500\nIt might have accidentally change.\n\n328\n00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.950\nSo a really quick way that you can toggle,\n\n329\n00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.090\nif you didn't wanna go\nunder Settings right here.\n\n330\n00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:59.240\nIf you access the Action Center over\non the bottom right-hand corner.\n\n331\n00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.170\nNow this is really tiny,\nI will need to zoom in for that.\n\n332\n00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:08.060\nIt's like a little note with,\nI don't know, a crescent moon, or\n\n333\n00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.310\nsomething like that.\n\n334\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:14.233\nAnd if we go ahead and it's because\nmy notifications are muted there and\n\n335\n00:19:14.233 --> 00:19:18.826\nthat's why, but if I zoom out here,\nI can take a look at this tile,\n\n336\n00:19:18.826 --> 00:19:21.962\nthen again if I zoom in,\nit says Tablet Mode.\n\n337\n00:19:21.962 --> 00:19:26.840\nSo this will switch and\ntoggle between the two there, all right.\n\n338\n00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.990\nSo just letting you know,\n\n339\n00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.780\na couple different ways that\nwe could go ahead and do that.\n\n340\n00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.170\nI'm going to turn that off for\n\n341\n00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.620\nright now, as we continue to take a look\nat some of these other settings here.\n\n342\n00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.020\nAll right, so let's talk about tiles.\n\n343\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.370\nI told you I would, so\nlet's pull up our start menu here.\n\n344\n00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:49.890\nAnd over on the left hand side that\nI have my applications, let's see.\n\n345\n00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.410\nI don't have the scanner here.\n\n346\n00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:58.730\nSo it's really simple to move it over,\nto move the application into a tile view.\n\n347\n00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:03.860\nWe're just gonna highlight, and then right\nclick, and then select pin to start.\n\n348\n00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.850\nOkay, now you can see that, that scanner\noption has been added right here,\n\n349\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:09.700\ndown at the bottom.\n\n350\n00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:14.920\nWe do have extra options whenever\nwe're looking at our apps here.\n\n351\n00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.630\nSo again, let's just say I right click\non the scanner, I can go to more.\n\n352\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:24.440\nAnd the reason I have some of these\noptions, and I'll zoom in for that.\n\n353\n00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.740\nLet's see here, so\nmy window's plus for that one.\n\n354\n00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.670\nI have Pin to taskbar which we've done,\nI have the option to Rate and\n\n355\n00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.180\nReview, Share, Remove from this list,\nClear the list.\n\n356\n00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.200\nThe reason I have those options like for\nthe Rate and Review,\n\n357\n00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.850\nthat's going to be\na Windows Store application.\n\n358\n00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:45.860\nSo it's different,\nthe options from that particular jump list\n\n359\n00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.450\nwill be different than what we see in\nwith our desktop applications there.\n\n360\n00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.230\nNow, actually let's just look\nat the desk top app, real quick.\n\n361\n00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:58.080\nSo if I look at 7zip, right click on it.\n\n362\n00:21:01.251 --> 00:21:04.164\nHold on, let me click slack here.\n\n363\n00:21:04.164 --> 00:21:12.170\nAll right, Slack I have the option to\npin to start, uninstall, and more.\n\n364\n00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:16.560\nSo I have the ability if I go out to more,\nPin to taskbar,\n\n365\n00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.320\nRun as administrator, Open file location,\nor Don't show in the list.\n\n366\n00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:26.280\nAnd you also have the ability to go go\nahead and uninstall, and of course you\n\n367\n00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:31.210\ncan navigate through control panel to\nuninstall an application, as well.\n\n368\n00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:37.820\nSo now that I've moved the standard\napplication into tile format,\n\n369\n00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.890\nthere are a couple different\nways that we can rearrange our,\n\n370\n00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:45.610\nwell a lot of ways that we can\nrearrange our tiles, change the sizing,\n\n371\n00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:48.640\ncreate groups, and all sorts of things.\n\n372\n00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:53.000\nSo let's do that first, let's see.\n\n373\n00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.490\nActually, let's start with news,\n\n374\n00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.350\nbecause news is a little more\nexciting than the scanner one I have.\n\n375\n00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.050\nIt's what we call a live tile.\n\n376\n00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.150\nAnd we have the ability to, well,\n\n377\n00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:06.100\nsee it in real time if there's any\nkind of headlines coming through.\n\n378\n00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.760\nAnd I have an internet connection, I'll\ngo ahead and see that information there.\n\n379\n00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.650\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool Sherry,\n\n380\n00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.960\nwhat else can you do with these tiles?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we have the ability to go\n\n381\n00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.320\nahead and, well, let's talk about that for\na second with our news, so maybe I didn't\n\n382\n00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.270\nwant to have this bombardment of all\nthese headlines, or something like that.\n\n383\n00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:28.070\nSo if I right click on there,\nand go under the more option.\n\n384\n00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:32.220\nAnd let me see if I can zoom in a little\nbit there with my Windows plus key.\n\n385\n00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.910\nYou guys might be able to see that, yeah,\nso I have the ability to go ahead and\n\n386\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.580\nturn the live tile off.\n\n387\n00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.650\nI also have the option to\npin it to the task bar,\n\n388\n00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:46.200\nwe'll talk about the task bar\na little bit more, in a later show.\n\n389\n00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.770\nAnd again, we already looked at the rate\nand review, but for those live tiles,\n\n390\n00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.970\nwe didn't see that in the other\napp that I had showed you,\n\n391\n00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.460\nbecause it wasn't a live tile.\n\n392\n00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:58.650\nSo here we turn the tile off, then,\nI still have that quick accessibility\n\n393\n00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.140\nright there for my news application but I\ndon't see it flashing in front of my eyes,\n\n394\n00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.660\nso that's pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; They can sometimes get a little\n\n395\n00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.310\ndistracting, and\nI know in shows like we do.\n\n396\n00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.740\nI never know what headlines are gonna pop\n\n397\n00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.350\nup\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n398\n00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.256\nknow.\n&gt;&gt; I typically turn that off.\n\n399\n00:23:12.256 --> 00:23:12.955\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:23:12.955 --> 00:23:13.455\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n401\n00:23:13.455 --> 00:23:15.111\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm definitely gonna be purging\n\n402\n00:23:15.111 --> 00:23:18.152\na little more after looking at all\nthese features that's for sure.\n\n403\n00:23:18.152 --> 00:23:19.362\n&gt;&gt; But on my home computer, I love\n\n404\n00:23:19.362 --> 00:23:23.086\nthe live tiles like for my photos, right?\nIt just kinda cycles through photos and\n\n405\n00:23:23.086 --> 00:23:25.302\nstuff, and I love the live tiles for\nweather, because I've got\n\n406\n00:23:25.302 --> 00:23:28.240\nthree different cities listed there.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n407\n00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.400\n&gt;&gt; And it just kinda cycles through the\n\n408\n00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.805\ndifferent cities and their local forecast.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is pretty cool, especially for\n\n409\n00:23:32.805 --> 00:23:34.620\na useful, and that’s another thing,\n\n410\n00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.043\nand we’re gonna look at here in a second,\nmy gosh.\n\n411\n00:23:37.043 --> 00:23:39.103\nLike I said there's so much to look at.\n\n412\n00:23:39.103 --> 00:23:41.249\nBut you could also group\nthem into categories, so\n\n413\n00:23:41.249 --> 00:23:44.825\nmaybe if you have a useful or functional\ncategory, and then like a fun category, or\n\n414\n00:23:44.825 --> 00:23:46.312\nwhatever,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n415\n00:23:46.312 --> 00:23:47.480\n&gt;&gt; Way you wanna go ahead and\n\n416\n00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.926\nlogically organize that, But\n\n417\n00:23:48.926 --> 00:23:52.326\nlet's take a look a couple more things\nwe can do before we look at groups.\n\n418\n00:23:52.326 --> 00:23:59.440\nSo let's say I wanted to have a little\nbit larger option here for that resize.\n\n419\n00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.730\nWe do see things like small,\nmedium, wide, and large.\n\n420\n00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:05.840\nSo like Mike was saying,\nif I didn't want all these distractions,\n\n421\n00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.240\nI could,\nmaybe I really don't use news that often.\n\n422\n00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.410\nSo I don't want to remove it completely\nbecause I do like to look at the news\n\n423\n00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:18.020\nsometimes, but I just want it small, and\nnot so glaringly obvious, right there.\n\n424\n00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.190\nSo, you can see how it shrunk to a tiny,\nlittle, tiny,\n\n425\n00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.581\nbaby tile there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n426\n00:24:22.581 --> 00:24:23.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we have a couple of\n\n427\n00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.130\noptions for resizing.\n\n428\n00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:29.430\nNow, if you are using a touch screen,\nand let me just touch my screen.\n\n429\n00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.410\nLike I said,\nmy laptop does have a touch screen here.\n\n430\n00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.180\nOops, let me get rid of this\n\n431\n00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.590\nzoom feature because I don't\nknow how that behaves here.\n\n432\n00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:45.175\nIf I, okay, I'm so used to using my mouse,\nI wanna use my mouse.\n\n433\n00:24:45.175 --> 00:24:49.085\nBut if I use my touchscreen, and\nI actually touch the tile and hold it,\n\n434\n00:24:49.085 --> 00:24:53.455\nit's kind of like, I don't want to say it,\nbut an iOS interface with their\n\n435\n00:24:53.455 --> 00:24:57.495\napplications, when you touch them and they\ncan wiggle and you can delete or whatever.\n\n436\n00:24:57.495 --> 00:24:59.960\nSo if I touch and hold, and\n\n437\n00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.590\nactually, this one was probably a bad one\nto show since it's already at the bottom.\n\n438\n00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:07.460\nBut you can see an ellipse\nbutton here at the bottom-right,\n\n439\n00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.490\nwhich will bring up additional options for\nme.\n\n440\n00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.570\nAnd then,\nI also have the ability to unpin,\n\n441\n00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.850\nwhich is like a thumbtack,\nit's really tiny there.\n\n442\n00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.260\nLet's see if we can see that, yeah.\n\n443\n00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.980\nSo it's a thumbtack with a no,\nso not to unpin.\n\n444\n00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.080\nAnd then, also the ellipse button here.\n\n445\n00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.180\nSo let me try to zoom out delicately\nwithout messing that up and\n\n446\n00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.610\ntouch on my little menu.\n\n447\n00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.170\nAnd you can see that this is exactly what\nwe saw here with the mouse clicks from\n\n448\n00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:38.220\nthe desktop option as well.\n\n449\n00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:42.580\nAll right, now,\nI do have the ability to drag and\n\n450\n00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.395\ndrop to rearrange and group them that way.\n\n451\n00:25:45.395 --> 00:25:51.820\nBut if I really, I shouldn't say group\nthem, but I guess I just kind of did.\n\n452\n00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.420\nSo lt me just zoom in so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n453\n00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.000\nI can actually create and name this group.\n\n454\n00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.680\nSo I just moved that scan tile\n\n455\n00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.420\nup next to my Microsoft Edge\ntile that I have sitting there.\n\n456\n00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:11.690\nAnd so, maybe if this is work apps,\nI can go ahead and select that.\n\n457\n00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:16.050\nAnd so now, these applications\nare going to be grouped together.\n\n458\n00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.980\nSo that's just a few of\n\n459\n00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.710\nthe things that we have available to\nus here just within the Start menu.\n\n460\n00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:28.371\nAnd there really are a lot more different\nsettings to make it nice on our system so\n\n461\n00:26:28.371 --> 00:26:32.500\nthat we can customize them and\nhave them just the way we want.\n\n462\n00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.950\nOr maybe to be in adherence with our\ncorporate policy, our company policies,\n\n463\n00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.915\nmaking sure that our\nsystems are uniform and\n\n464\n00:26:38.915 --> 00:26:42.950\nset up the way that they need to be.\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good.\n\n465\n00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:43.870\nLooking forward to that.\n\n466\n00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.350\nHope everybody out there is as well.\n\n467\n00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.600\nBut for now, we are going to go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n468\n00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.950\nI've been your host, Mike Broderick.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n469\n00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:51.900\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n470\n00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.412\n[MUSIC]\n\n471\n00:26:55.412 --> 00:27:01.133\n&gt;&gt; Thank

you\n\n3\n00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:03.958\nlive from San Francisco, California.\n\n4\n00:00:03.958 --> 00:00:05.509\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.286\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.286 --> 00:00:14.426\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\nWelcome to another exciting episode here\n\n7\n00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:15.830\nat ITPRO.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.080\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.070\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n10\n00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.160\nSpecifically in this episode,\n\n11\n00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.870\nwe're actually doing a part two\non customizing our desktop.\n\n12\n00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.745\nSo here to help us and\n\n13\n00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:28.430\ncontinue on with that thought\nprocess is Miss Jerichi Wills.\n\n14\n00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.270\nWelcome back Jerichi.\n\n15\n00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me.\n\n16\n00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.512\nI kind of lied a little\nbit in the last show.\n\n17\n00:00:32.512 --> 00:00:35.213\nI didn't say that we would get creative,\nbut I talked so\n\n18\n00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:38.042\nmuch that I think we will have\nto get creative in this show.\n\n19\n00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:40.046\n&gt;&gt; Ahh, okay.\n&gt;&gt; So it will be a nice little fun escape\n\n20\n00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:40.770\nfor us here.\n\n21\n00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.270\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n22\n00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.460\nSounds good, I like it.\n\n23\n00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.910\nSo we did talk about a lot of\ndifferent settings in that last show.\n\n24\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.190\nAnd one thing that I didn't mention,\nit's not specifically called out on\n\n25\n00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.590\nthe objectives, but\nI do want to at least make note of that,\n\n26\n00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.760\nwould be the fact that you can\nutilize group policy to go ahead and\n\n27\n00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.190\npush out many of the settings\nthat we looked at, and even more.\n\n28\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.540\nSo if we take a look at my screen, I\nwould like to go ahead and show you here.\n\n29\n00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.580\nOn my local computer, my machine.\n\n30\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.380\nOne way where I can access those\npolicies to see what's available, but\n\n31\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.270\nit's not exactly the same as group policy,\nand we'll talk about that for a second.\n\n32\n00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.224\nIf I go ahead and just do my windows\nR to bring up my run line here,\n\n33\n00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:24.073\nyou can see that I've\nalready typed this in.\n\n34\n00:01:24.073 --> 00:01:26.760\nIt's a little shortcut here,\nand it's gpedit.msc.\n\n35\n00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.500\nSo we'll go ahead and hit OK or Enter.\n\n36\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.060\nAnd zoom back out a little bit.\n\n37\n00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.370\nI'm trying to find a good\nhappy medium there for us.\n\n38\n00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.480\nYou might need to pull this out so\nyou can see what you're working with.\n\n39\n00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.160\nBut this is going to be my group\npolicy management console here.\n\n40\n00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.510\nAnd let's just minimize that.\n\n41\n00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.778\nUnderneath User Configuration we have an\noption here for Administrative Templates.\n\n42\n00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.802\nSo if we expand out just by\nhitting that down arrow and\n\n43\n00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:58.793\nlooking at what we have available\nunder Administrative Templates,\n\n44\n00:01:58.793 --> 00:02:03.607\nwe're gonna go down to Start Menu and\nTaskbar to see, there's like 94 different\n\n45\n00:02:03.607 --> 00:02:04.780\nsettings in here-\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n46\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.029\n&gt;&gt; That are associated with\nthe start menu and task bars.\n\n47\n00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:10.610\n&gt;&gt; Zoom out a little bit so\nwe can take a look at all of these.\n\n48\n00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.178\nWe'll just go full screen here.\n\n49\n00:02:13.178 --> 00:02:16.640\nI know, and the desktop is changing\nbecause I was playing before the show.\n\n50\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.101\nSo it's like weird to look up and\nsee that changing.\n\n51\n00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:24.610\nOkay, so looking at all these different\nsettings we have going on here.\n\n52\n00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.080\nFor instance, if for\n\n53\n00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.310\nwhatever reason you wanted to lock\nthe taskbar for some reason, and\n\n54\n00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.540\nthere are a lot of really granular types\nof settings that we have available here.\n\n55\n00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.540\nThen you would,\nthere's really great information.\n\n56\n00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.340\nA lot of these settings you can\nsee some of the requirements.\n\n57\n00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.305\nSome of them have been around for\na long time, these policies here.\n\n58\n00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:47.335\nBut if you just right click\non the actual policy and\n\n59\n00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:52.845\nthen go to Edit, you can actually choose\nhow you want the system to behave.\n\n60\n00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:56.585\nSo let's say my end user\nis just a regular user,\n\n61\n00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:59.205\nthey're not the local admin or\nanything like that.\n\n62\n00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:03.975\nThat will prevent them from making\nthese changes on this local system.\n\n63\n00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.365\nSo right now I don't have\nanything configured, and\n\n64\n00:03:06.365 --> 00:03:08.275\nthen disabled would be the same thing.\n\n65\n00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:12.120\nBut if we wanted to enable this policy,\nthen it would prevent, and\n\n66\n00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.820\nlet me zoom in so\nwe can take a look at that.\n\n67\n00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.510\nIt would prevent things from them moving\nthe task bar from the top to the top\n\n68\n00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.410\nsides and auto hiding, and just being\nable to really manipulate it in that way.\n\n69\n00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.098\nNow because this machine is not part\nof a domain, and I'm using the local\n\n70\n00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:36.610\nGPEdit tool right here, I'm not\ndeploying it out to many computers.\n\n71\n00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.863\nWhich I do have the ability to do that,\nand customize them, and\n\n72\n00:03:40.863 --> 00:03:46.100\nselect which GPOs, which groups I'm\ngoing to be pushing this policy out to.\n\n73\n00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.560\nSo here it's only affecting\ntheir local machine, but\n\n74\n00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.520\nwill prevent those users from making any\nkind of changes that might be against what\n\n75\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.990\nyour company has already set forth,\nor something like that.\n\n76\n00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.248\n&gt;&gt; I've gone in and locked this down,\n\n77\n00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:03.618\nmy users ended up inadvertently\ndragging their taskbar to the side or\n\n78\n00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:08.462\nto the top, and then trying to figure out\nwhat they did and how to get it back.\n\n79\n00:04:08.462 --> 00:04:10.513\nAnd so I've used that to lock the taskbar.\n\n80\n00:04:10.513 --> 00:04:14.318\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are some good ones in\nthere, so I mean, and like, there really\n\n81\n00:04:14.318 --> 00:04:17.910\nare quite a few if you scroll down\n&gt;&gt; And that makes a good point,\n\n82\n00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.080\nbecause that's less tickets for\nthe help desk.\n\n83\n00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.086\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or something like that, Mike.\n\n84\n00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:26.780\nAll right, now here comes the fun stuff.\n\n85\n00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.958\nMy gosh, I feel like this is\nLion King going on right now.\n\n86\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.009\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna take a look at all these\n\n87\n00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.485\nsettings here with customizing a desktop.\n\n88\n00:04:33.485 --> 00:04:35.100\nAnd again, I have to be honest.\n\n89\n00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.160\nI am not really one who does\nall of the customizations here,\n\n90\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.240\nbut I did want to just let you know that\nthat is an option for this exam here.\n\n91\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.855\nI don't know how much we'll be covering\nit but at least you'll know, right?\n\n92\n00:04:45.855 --> 00:04:46.500\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n93\n00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what we're going to do is\nagain is just hit that windows key and\n\n94\n00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.130\nI to bring up our review here\nof our Windows settings.\n\n95\n00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.090\nAnd over on the right hand side we\nhave this personalization option.\n\n96\n00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.720\nSo that's where we'll find\nall of those fancy settings.\n\n97\n00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.020\nSo for the background option,\nlet's just go ahead and start there.\n\n98\n00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.790\nWe can see we have the ability\nto have a slide show going on,\n\n99\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.210\nwhich this is a theme and\nI'll explain what that is in a moment.\n\n100\n00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.040\nYou can select a picture, solid color.\n\n101\n00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.530\nBut we'll just keep it at\nthat slide show for now.\n\n102\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.830\nYou can also choose a custom\nphoto if you had something.\n\n103\n00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.060\nAnd again, this kinda goes back with that.\n\n104\n00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.350\nIf it's a personal computer,\nthen fine, do whatever you want.\n\n105\n00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.950\nBut if you are working for an environment,\nsome companies, especially if it's like\n\n106\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.830\na customer facing machine, they would want\nthat company logo something like that.\n\n107\n00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.150\nAnd you could go ahead and select that.\n\n108\n00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.080\nAlso checking the duration as to when,\nhow long the picture is displayed.\n\n109\n00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.880\nAnd if it's shuffled or going in\na certain order, and things like that.\n\n110\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.960\nNow this option here,\nif you have multiple monitors,\n\n111\n00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.920\nyou have the ability to span,\nwhich is pretty cool.\n\n112\n00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.080\nYou can center it,\ntile it in just a lot of little tiles,\n\n113\n00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.830\nstretch it, and fill the screen.\n\n114\n00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.890\nDifferent options there.\n\n115\n00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.765\nNow colors is kind of interesting here.\n\n116\n00:06:11.765 --> 00:06:17.345\nSo right now I have this purple color,\nit's part of a theme.\n\n117\n00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:18.365\nI didn't select it.\n\n118\n00:06:18.365 --> 00:06:21.065\nBut if you wanted to go ahead and\nselect a different color, and\n\n119\n00:06:21.065 --> 00:06:24.765\nit's kind of interesting the names\nthat they've chosen here.\n\n120\n00:06:24.765 --> 00:06:26.805\nIris Spring and all of that.\n\n121\n00:06:26.805 --> 00:06:32.160\nBut yeah, so if you wanted to go ahead and\nselect a color, you have the ability.\n\n122\n00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.340\nAnd notice how right when I hit that, it\nchanged my task bar as well as some other\n\n123\n00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:42.100\nUI elements like my start button and the\nback arrow in the top left hand corner.\n\n124\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.690\nMy links over on the right\nhand side are now blue, so\n\n125\n00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.390\nyou can see how that\naffects your system there.\n\n126\n00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.610\nYou also have the ability to create\na custom color if you wanted to do so.\n\n127\n00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.370\nAnd it has the little dropper tool,\ndroplet tool, and I believe there was\n\n128\n00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.330\none section somewhere where you\ncould add the RGB colors as well,\n\n129\n00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.950\nif you knew those number combos.\n\n130\n00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.087\nNow for transparency effects,\nif you guys remember the arrow option,\n\n131\n00:07:09.087 --> 00:07:13.120\nI think that was with Windows 7,\nor did that come with Vista?\n\n132\n00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.300\nSomewhere along the lines.\n\n133\n00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.340\n&gt;&gt; I think Vista, yeah.\n\n134\n00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:21.190\n&gt;&gt; Vista, okay, so that was the ability\nto have, like it says, transparency.\n\n135\n00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.200\nAnd it was on.\n\n136\n00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.740\nSo it's really hard to tell.\n\n137\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.730\nDown here at the bottom you can see some\nblades of grass somewhat if I zoom in\n\n138\n00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.050\non my taskbar.\n\n139\n00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.790\nAnd then if we were to go like right\nover here, you can kind of see it.\n\n140\n00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:40.106\nSo it's not as noticeable as it was with\nthose arrow options in Vista, which that\n\n141\n00:07:40.106 --> 00:07:44.880\nwas kind of strange anyways, because\nit was just more of an aesthetic thing.\n\n142\n00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.520\nAnd it would actually use CPU resources,\nso I never would use that anyways.\n\n143\n00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.357\nAll right, so just more accent colors.\n\n144\n00:07:53.357 --> 00:07:55.792\nNow this is kind of interesting\nhere down at the bottom.\n\n145\n00:07:55.792 --> 00:07:59.816\nAnd Mike, I noticed you do this\nsometimes for your browser.\n\n146\n00:07:59.816 --> 00:08:03.949\nWith the dark colors with the light text,\nto make it easier for\n\n147\n00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:05.980\npeople to see, right?\n\n148\n00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.520\nAnd they have the option here\nto choose your default app mode.\n\n149\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.490\nSo currently if I hit my Windows menu key,\n\n150\n00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.550\nI can see that it sticks\nwith this theme here.\n\n151\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.540\nIf I select this dark option, and you can\nsee right here, I don't even have to pull\n\n152\n00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.190\nup that menu, it'll automatically\ngo ahead and change that for me.\n\n153\n00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.090\nAnd we're gonna be talking about\nsomething a little bit later for\n\n154\n00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.800\naccessibility options that\nwe have available to us.\n\n155\n00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.330\nSo it's kind of cool because not only\nare we helping individuals who may\n\n156\n00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.230\nhave some sort of impairment,\nbut if you think about it,\n\n157\n00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.930\neveryone can be impaired\nin certain situations.\n\n158\n00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:49.340\nSo if I'm outside trying to work or in\na situation where there's lower lighting,\n\n159\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.510\nwith that high contrast\nwill really help be able to\n\n160\n00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.640\nkeep me productive during those times.\n\n161\n00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I really like when they've\nadded that dark options there.\n\n162\n00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.330\nNow, you saw a few apps and\nbrowsers allow you to do that.\n\n163\n00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.740\nNow that the Windows operating\nsystem allows you to do that\n\n164\n00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.540\ncuz I do a lot of my computing in\nthe evenings, and I don't need that.\n\n165\n00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.650\nYou open up something, and\nyou get this white screen, and\n\n166\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.190\nall of a sudden it's almost blinding and\nhurts your eyes.\n\n167\n00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.580\n&gt;&gt; For sure, my eyes hurt quite\na bit after working sometimes, yeah.\n\n168\n00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nI really like that dark option.\n\n169\n00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:23.080\nI will say when it first came out it was a\nlittle glitchy and not all apps recognize\n\n170\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.530\nthat, so you'll still get some that open\nup with a little bit of light color.\n\n171\n00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.530\nBut it's pretty cool.\n\n172\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is actually really cool.\n\n173\n00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.890\nI was watching a video where there was\na project manager from Microsoft teaching\n\n174\n00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.220\ndevelopers ways that they could code\n\n175\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.300\ntheir applications to make them be\nmore compatible with those options.\n\n176\n00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.690\nAll right, the next thing I want to take\na look at here is going to be the Lock\n\n177\n00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.690\nscreen.\n\n178\n00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:52.020\nAnd this Lock screen, it's not just\nan aesthetic component, because\n\n179\n00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.000\nif you think about it, it really plays\ninto the security of your organization.\n\n180\n00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.200\nAnd it's something very very\nsimple that an end user can do.\n\n181\n00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.900\nSo just the Windows key and the L button\nwill automatically lock your screen.\n\n182\n00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.070\nSo if you're going to get away,\nstanding up, away from your desk,\n\n183\n00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.370\nif you have your computer in a certain\narea you always wanna make sure\n\n184\n00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.040\nthat your screen is locked.\n\n185\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.480\nHowever, let's say you have forgetful\nend users or employees, right?\n\n186\n00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.000\nIt happens.\n\n187\n00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.910\nGuilty, myself.\n\n188\n00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:26.040\nYou could implement like a group\npolicy to go ahead and say we're\n\n189\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.850\ngonna initiate a screen saver after\nfive minutes of any kind of idle time.\n\n190\n00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.330\nSo in fact in order for\n\n191\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.010\nthe end user to come back and\nenter back into that screen saver.\n\n192\n00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.360\nWe'll see options here where they\nwould have to go ahead and log on.\n\n193\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.497\nSo you're kind of enforcing that security\neven if they're not going to comply\n\n194\n00:10:44.497 --> 00:10:45.131\nwith that.\n\n195\n00:10:45.131 --> 00:10:47.489\nSo it's pretty cool.\n\n196\n00:10:47.489 --> 00:10:51.859\nAll right, the background options\nthat we have here, Windows Spotlight,\n\n197\n00:10:51.859 --> 00:10:56.226\nI actually kind of enjoyed this, this is\nI just kept it at the default here for\n\n198\n00:10:56.226 --> 00:10:57.273\na very long time.\n\n199\n00:10:57.273 --> 00:10:59.987\nIt's different like photographers and\nshots,\n\n200\n00:10:59.987 --> 00:11:04.230\nand they have these cool little links so\nif you have Internet connectivity.\n\n201\n00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.721\n&gt;&gt; Little factoids on there, yeah.\n\n202\n00:11:05.721 --> 00:11:07.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, little facts, like hey,\ndo you like what you see?\n\n203\n00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.910\nAnd then they kind of tailor\nthose images to your liking,\n\n204\n00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.060\nso that's pretty neat there.\n\n205\n00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.128\nAgain, you have other options as well.\n\n206\n00:11:16.128 --> 00:11:20.620\nAll right,\nchoose an app to show detailed status.\n\n207\n00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.600\nLet's take a look, let's go ahead and\n\n208\n00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.320\nLock my screen real quick and bear with me\nbecause I did change my password recently,\n\n209\n00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.700\nso I have to kind of\nremember what that is.\n\n210\n00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.100\nBut this is basically the default.\n\n211\n00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.140\nAnd if we could just go full screen for\none moment here and we can go right back.\n\n212\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.640\nJust so\nyou guys can see what that looks like.\n\n213\n00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.210\nI haven't changed really anything out\nof the box at this point in time.\n\n214\n00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.880\nSo this is what Mike and I were\ntalking about, those little factoids.\n\n215\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.690\nAnd here's this photo's saying,\nthis island surface is famed for\n\n216\n00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:51.150\nits wildlife and\nnatural beauty, and so forth.\n\n217\n00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.760\nAll right, so\nthat's what it looks like currently.\n\n218\n00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.267\nI'll go ahead and log in.\n\n219\n00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:05.569\nNow if I wanted to go ahead and\nadd an application to that Lock screen,\n\n220\n00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:13.160\nso even if I had my screen locked I would\nstill be able to work in some capacity.\n\n221\n00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.320\nI'm just gonna use Pandora for\nthis example here.\n\n222\n00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.890\nIt's a music application, right?\n\n223\n00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.560\nSo I go ahead and add,\nChoose an app to show detailed status.\n\n224\n00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.630\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and launch Pandora.\n\n225\n00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.540\nWe'll bring that up here,\nmake sure my volume's off, so\n\n226\n00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.410\nyou guys don't have to\nsuffer through that.\n\n227\n00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.680\nOkay, Calvin Harris, good to go.\n\n228\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.400\nSo I'm just going to minimize this\napplication but I'll continue on and\n\n229\n00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.480\nlet it run.\n\n230\n00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.240\nSo I'll Windows Lock key my screen.\n\n231\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.030\nNow if we could go full screen again,\n\n232\n00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.740\nbehind my head you should be\nable to see this particular.\n\n233\n00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:53.210\nSo the way that this application has been\ncoded, it will display certain information\n\n234\n00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.450\npertaining, so\nthe application is still running.\n\n235\n00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:00.541\nIf I have my volume on,\nyou would still be able to hear this song.\n\n236\n00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:03.145\nSo, the application is still\nrunning in the background,\n\n237\n00:13:03.145 --> 00:13:05.602\nit's just now there's some\ninformation displayed.\n\n238\n00:13:05.602 --> 00:13:09.041\nAnd I even have some functionality,\nI can go ahead and shuffle,\n\n239\n00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:10.580\npause through these songs.\n\n240\n00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:18.334\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you are really starting to see\nthe way Windows 10 is designed to run on\n\n241\n00:13:18.334 --> 00:13:19.050\nanything.\n\n242\n00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.990\nThis might be something that's\nnot as useful on a desktop, but\n\n243\n00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.180\non my tablet, on my phone or\nsome other device.\n\n244\n00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.100\nYou see this with other mobile devices,\n\n245\n00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.600\nwhere you can interact with some of your\napps even while your device is locked.\n\n246\n00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.670\n&gt;&gt; And it is a really cool functionality\nhere, but I think I really wanted to\n\n247\n00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:42.610\nemphasize also from a security standpoint\nwhy you may or may not wanna choose these.\n\n248\n00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:46.712\nSo if you're just using, like Mike said,\na tablet or computer for\n\n249\n00:13:46.712 --> 00:13:48.703\nyour personal use, then fine.\n\n250\n00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:52.380\nAs long as you're okay with that,\nwhatever you want on that lock screen.\n\n251\n00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.860\nBut with the example that\nwe were talking about,\n\n252\n00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.230\nlike in a corporate environment sometimes\nthere may be applications that you don't\n\n253\n00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.800\nwant to have that detailed\ninformation on the screen.\n\n254\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.066\nSo, for instance, if I had my email,\nor some kind of important calendar,\n\n255\n00:14:06.066 --> 00:14:09.861\nwith maybe there was like a top\nsecret meeting that was happening or\n\n256\n00:14:09.861 --> 00:14:11.454\nsomething that like that.\n\n257\n00:14:11.454 --> 00:14:13.970\nYou just wanna kind of keep that in mind,\nas well.\n\n258\n00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:20.290\nThere is a more limited view here instead\nof having that extra detail though.\n\n259\n00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:24.970\nSo if I wanted to go ahead and\nchoose apps to show quick status so, for\n\n260\n00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:29.640\ninstance, if I go here to my calendar\nI do have the ability to go ahead and\n\n261\n00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.100\ntake a look at that.\n\n262\n00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.925\nSo, let's just go ahead and lock.\n\n263\n00:14:34.925 --> 00:14:38.182\nI don't have anything in my calendar,\nso that.\n\n264\n00:14:38.182 --> 00:14:38.819\n&gt;&gt; Do you have your weather a set up?\n\n265\n00:14:38.819 --> 00:14:39.430\nI was like the weather app.\n\n266\n00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:40.280\n&gt;&gt; The weather one.\n\n267\n00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.180\nI can do that, yeah.\n\n268\n00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.320\n&gt;&gt; It's just something I like to see\nwithout having to unlock my PC here.\n\n269\n00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.142\n&gt;&gt; That's actually a really\ngood one there Mike.\n\n270\n00:14:47.142 --> 00:14:53.292\nLet's see, so here for our alarms\nmessaging, Microsoft Store Weather.\n\n271\n00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:56.380\nAll right, so\nI think I will have to go ahead and\n\n272\n00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.790\nactually launch my weather\napp at this point, but\n\n273\n00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.892\nthen we can again just minimize that and\nthen we'll lock my screen.\n\n274\n00:15:03.892 --> 00:15:09.875\nAll right, I don't see my weather\n\n275\n00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:14.834\nthere let me try that again.\n\n276\n00:15:14.834 --> 00:15:18.918\nOops and of course this new password.\n\n277\n00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Make sure I'm typing it right.\n\n278\n00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.560\nAll right so, it might be detailed status.\n\n279\n00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.370\nSo, here, let's go ahead and\nsee if I can put the weather on now.\n\n280\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.230\nLet's check that out,\nbecause it might not.\n\n281\n00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.620\nAnd that's the other thing too, is just\nthe way that the application was coded,\n\n282\n00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.260\nit depends on what is going\nto be displayed here.\n\n283\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:42.010\nSo I'll minimize that and verify that\nmy weather app is still running there.\n\n284\n00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.860\nYep, running in the background.\n\n285\n00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.970\nWe'll go ahead and lock it again.\n\n286\n00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.338\nMaybe it was there and I just did it too\nfast, but I don't recall seeing that, but\n\n287\n00:15:51.338 --> 00:15:52.253\nI do see it there now.\n\n288\n00:15:52.253 --> 00:15:56.618\nSo you can see the temperature and\njust some basic weather info there.\n\n289\n00:15:56.618 --> 00:15:58.553\nAll right, cool stuff.\n\n290\n00:16:05.178 --> 00:16:10.025\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe'll pull backup our settings here.\n\n291\n00:16:10.025 --> 00:16:11.663\nShow lock screen on the background.\n\n292\n00:16:11.663 --> 00:16:15.773\nThis is going to be I guess\na little more generic.\n\n293\n00:16:15.773 --> 00:16:17.743\nHere I'll just show you,\nit's easier to just show you.\n\n294\n00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:22.904\nSo if I go ahead and lock it again,\nI must have already had it.\n\n295\n00:16:22.904 --> 00:16:24.442\nSo on the actual sign-in page.\n\n296\n00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:27.524\nIf you go to log in,\nit just removes that photo here.\n\n297\n00:16:27.524 --> 00:16:29.799\nSo really, that's what that does there.\n\n298\n00:16:34.583 --> 00:16:36.580\nNow, this is kind of interesting here.\n\n299\n00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.790\nAnd again, from a security standpoint,\nthis is why I wanna take some time and\n\n300\n00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.580\ntake a look at this particular section.\n\n301\n00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.729\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there has been some\nissues with this recently.\n\n302\n00:16:45.729 --> 00:16:48.628\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think that's because again,\n\n303\n00:16:48.628 --> 00:16:52.181\nfrom my usability standpoint,\nit's really cool.\n\n304\n00:16:52.181 --> 00:16:54.494\nIt's functional.\n\n305\n00:16:54.494 --> 00:16:56.283\nBut from the security standpoint,\n\n306\n00:16:56.283 --> 00:16:59.393\nI can definitely see some\npotential vulnerabilities there.\n\n307\n00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:02.130\nSo let's just take a look\nat what I'm talking about.\n\n308\n00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:08.220\nSo number one here in order for\nCortana to even respond to us,\n\n309\n00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.560\nwe have to enable her to do so.\n\n310\n00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.164\nSo it says,\nlet Cortana respond to hey Cortana.\n\n311\n00:17:14.164 --> 00:17:20.298\nNow here's the thing, there's a couple\ndifferent things actually with this.\n\n312\n00:17:20.298 --> 00:17:21.942\nWe'll look at this first.\n\n313\n00:17:21.942 --> 00:17:25.811\nWhen Cortona uses her,\nshe uses battery mode here.\n\n314\n00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:29.765\nSo if you want to leave her\nin an active listening state,\n\n315\n00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:34.562\nit is going to be something that you\nconsider as far as like if you're\n\n316\n00:17:34.562 --> 00:17:37.630\nusing a mobile laptop or something.\n\n317\n00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:43.480\nThe consumption of that service\nis going to reduce your battery.\n\n318\n00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.520\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n319\n00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.624\nNow when we're taking a look\nat how she's going to respond,\n\n320\n00:17:50.624 --> 00:17:53.527\nshe can either respond to anyone or\n\n321\n00:17:53.527 --> 00:17:57.543\nyou can go into vocal\nlessons with Cortana and.\n\n322\n00:17:57.543 --> 00:18:02.329\nShe'll be able to hopefully be able\nto discern your voice versus someone\n\n323\n00:18:02.329 --> 00:18:06.653\nelse's voice, so that she only\nwill respond to your inquiries.\n\n324\n00:18:06.653 --> 00:18:09.941\nSo that's where I said potential\nvulnerabilities there.\n\n325\n00:18:09.941 --> 00:18:13.634\nSo if you were to allow her\nto respond to anyone and\n\n326\n00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:17.611\nI'll show you what that\nlooks like here in a moment.\n\n327\n00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:21.141\nEven when that screen is locked,\nshe has the ability.\n\n328\n00:18:21.141 --> 00:18:23.781\nSo she could be actively listening.\n\n329\n00:18:23.781 --> 00:18:26.743\nAnd if you said, hey, Cortana,\nwhen is my next meeting?\n\n330\n00:18:26.743 --> 00:18:29.734\nAnd maybe I'm trying to find\nout what Mike's doing and\n\n331\n00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.434\nmaybe I really shouldn't be.\n\n332\n00:18:31.434 --> 00:18:36.733\nSo she could respond to me and let me\nknow what Mike's schedule is or whatever.\n\n333\n00:18:36.733 --> 00:18:41.204\nSo just I kind I've see it from that\nstandpoint like it's not the most secure,\n\n334\n00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:44.685\nif you have information that\nyou wanted to really lock down.\n\n335\n00:18:44.685 --> 00:18:49.321\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's been a couple of\narticles recently about being able to get\n\n336\n00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:51.804\naccess to confidential information.\n\n337\n00:18:51.804 --> 00:18:55.893\nBecause Cortana was responding or\ncould launch an app in the background.\n\n338\n00:18:55.893 --> 00:18:59.662\nThere's actually one proof of concept\nI was reading where the screen was\n\n339\n00:18:59.662 --> 00:19:00.218\nlocked and\n\n340\n00:19:00.218 --> 00:19:04.253\nthey asked Cortana to go visit a website\nthat was already set up with malware.\n\n341\n00:19:04.253 --> 00:19:05.376\nShe went and browsed that website.\n\n342\n00:19:05.376 --> 00:19:07.012\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; Blew that machine up, so yeah.\n\n343\n00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:08.181\n&gt;&gt; So yeah.\n\n344\n00:19:08.181 --> 00:19:11.091\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just wanted to let you guys know\n\n345\n00:19:11.091 --> 00:19:11.880\nabout that.\n\n346\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.036\nI'm not saying it's not\na viable option here,\n\n347\n00:19:17.036 --> 00:19:20.293\njust be cognizant of how you implement it.\n\n348\n00:19:20.293 --> 00:19:22.373\nAnd this is another thing,\nthis option here.\n\n349\n00:19:22.373 --> 00:19:27.238\nAgain, so you would actually, it's\na two-step for accessing that calendar for\n\n350\n00:19:27.238 --> 00:19:29.223\nthe situation I was explaining.\n\n351\n00:19:29.223 --> 00:19:32.235\nBut I don't think that,\nthat's applicable here,\n\n352\n00:19:32.235 --> 00:19:34.571\nthis particular checkbox to a browser.\n\n353\n00:19:34.571 --> 00:19:38.333\nSo if they already have that set.\n\n354\n00:19:38.333 --> 00:19:40.760\nYou do have the ability to\nchoose different languages.\n\n355\n00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.040\nI'm in the United States here,\nso Cortana and you might think,\n\n356\n00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.822\nokay, well, English language.\n\n357\n00:19:45.822 --> 00:19:48.133\nBut no, there are a lot of\ndifferent variations here.\n\n358\n00:19:48.133 --> 00:19:51.062\nThe UK Canadian,\nAustralian as well as India.\n\n359\n00:19:51.062 --> 00:19:55.585\nSo for whatever language you're using,\nmake sure you have\n\n360\n00:19:55.585 --> 00:20:00.650\nthe correct regional dialect as well,\nso that you can have the best\n\n361\n00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:05.914\ninteraction with Cortana there and\nwhat else do we got going on here?\n\n362\n00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:10.422\nThemes, I think is what we\nwanna take a look at next.\n\n363\n00:20:10.422 --> 00:20:12.892\nYeah, just chugging on\ndown this line here.\n\n364\n00:20:12.892 --> 00:20:15.914\nLet's take a look at some themes,\nyou heard me mention it.\n\n365\n00:20:15.914 --> 00:20:19.694\nAnd as we were looking at the colors\nthere for the backgrounds and so\n\n366\n00:20:19.694 --> 00:20:22.813\nforth, you can see how that\nwas affecting our system.\n\n367\n00:20:22.813 --> 00:20:28.293\nBut a theme is going to be a set of\npre-compiled settings for your desktop.\n\n368\n00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:33.240\nSo really, the look and the feel and\nI haven't created any custom themes.\n\n369\n00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.783\nYou do have the ability to do so.\n\n370\n00:20:34.783 --> 00:20:39.462\nI just chose one that was\nalready created from Microsoft.\n\n371\n00:20:39.462 --> 00:20:41.212\nThey have a few that\nare listed right here.\n\n372\n00:20:41.212 --> 00:20:47.025\nYou do have the ability to create and\nthen save a theme, if you choose to do so.\n\n373\n00:20:47.025 --> 00:20:49.075\nI think that's about it for themes.\n\n374\n00:20:49.075 --> 00:20:49.967\nI don't know how much we can.\n\n375\n00:20:49.967 --> 00:20:54.709\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is a cool one here I\n\n376\n00:20:54.709 --> 00:20:58.267\nlike our task view and let me just\nclose out of here for a second, so\n\n377\n00:20:58.267 --> 00:21:00.551\nwe can actually take a look at my desktop.\n\n378\n00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:02.362\nSo let me zoom in.\n\n379\n00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:07.493\nIt's a little difficult to see,\nbut this is task view.\n\n380\n00:21:07.493 --> 00:21:10.790\nSo it's like a rectangle with other\na little rectangles next to it.\n\n381\n00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.490\nIf I go ahead and select task view,\nlet's see what happens.\n\n382\n00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.727\nI currently and if you guys recall,\nwe did launch up Pandora and\n\n383\n00:21:21.727 --> 00:21:24.472\nwe also launched up that\nweather application.\n\n384\n00:21:24.472 --> 00:21:26.809\nActually, I'll show you guys here.\n\n385\n00:21:26.809 --> 00:21:33.083\nI put them in the show notes,\nbut these are pretty cool.\n\n386\n00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:34.312\nWe'll save that for another show.\n\n387\n00:21:34.312 --> 00:21:38.555\nI was working on another show looking\nat different keyboard shortcuts here.\n\n388\n00:21:38.555 --> 00:21:42.872\nSo just know that you do have\nthis option to easily access.\n\n389\n00:21:42.872 --> 00:21:44.442\nOops, I didn't want to hit that one.\n\n390\n00:21:44.442 --> 00:21:48.321\nEasily access any kinds of applications\nthat you may have running.\n\n391\n00:21:48.321 --> 00:21:52.117\nSo I have my browser and this\nparticular window whether Pandora, and\n\n392\n00:21:52.117 --> 00:21:54.024\neven our little magnifying tool.\n\n393\n00:21:54.024 --> 00:21:57.014\nAnd something that's really cool,\n\n394\n00:21:57.014 --> 00:22:02.224\nMike is if I have my laptop plugged\nin with my external monitors,\n\n395\n00:22:02.224 --> 00:22:08.011\nif I had an application hold up in\nanother monitor when I hit my task bar,\n\n396\n00:22:08.011 --> 00:22:11.982\nit will kind of pop to\nthe center of that monitor.\n\n397\n00:22:11.982 --> 00:22:16.630\nSo I think this is really great for\nkeeping your work space organized.\n\n398\n00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:20.120\nSo you can get a quick at glance\nview of everything that's going on.\n\n399\n00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.342\nA couple of different\nthings we could do here.\n\n400\n00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:28.472\nIf I started getting a really busy screen\nand it was kind of being counterproductive\n\n401\n00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:32.812\nand not keeping me organized,\nI can go ahead and create a new desktop.\n\n402\n00:22:32.812 --> 00:22:37.000\nIf we go full screen for a second, the\noption is right behind my head here and\n\n403\n00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.874\nI'll zoom in so you can see that.\n\n404\n00:22:38.874 --> 00:22:41.872\nIt says, new desktop.\n\n405\n00:22:41.872 --> 00:22:46.883\nSo if I left-click on this feature,\nI have just created a new desktop.\n\n406\n00:22:46.883 --> 00:22:51.623\nIt looks the same, because we have\nsame image as the background.\n\n407\n00:22:51.623 --> 00:22:57.285\nBut if I put back on my top view here,\nwe'll see that we have\n\n408\n00:22:57.285 --> 00:23:04.352\nlike an additional horizontal bar\nwith the desktop one and desktop two.\n\n409\n00:23:04.352 --> 00:23:08.133\nIf I hit the tab key,\nthat'll go ahead and toggle.\n\n410\n00:23:08.133 --> 00:23:10.132\nHere, you can see like the behavior.\n\n411\n00:23:10.132 --> 00:23:13.632\nIt's going through my\ndifferent machines there.\n\n412\n00:23:13.632 --> 00:23:16.789\nBut if I wanted to go, how do I say that?\n\n413\n00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:18.683\nIt's a linear function.\n\n414\n00:23:18.683 --> 00:23:23.134\nSo if I wanted to switch between\nthe actual virtual desktops,\n\n415\n00:23:23.134 --> 00:23:27.242\nI'm gonna hold down the control key,\nthe windows key and\n\n416\n00:23:27.242 --> 00:23:32.052\nthen like my right or left arrow and\nit will toggle between the two.\n\n417\n00:23:32.052 --> 00:23:38.575\nCurrently, there is not a limitation on\nhow many virtual desktops you can create.\n\n418\n00:23:38.575 --> 00:23:43.972\nHowever, there is a limit\nhere in this section.\n\n419\n00:23:43.972 --> 00:23:47.108\nIn this bar, you can have nine\nviewing in this little area.\n\n420\n00:23:47.108 --> 00:23:51.501\nAnd I haven't figured out and\nI don't know if they will be releasing\n\n421\n00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:56.215\nan easy way to navigate between like\ndesktop one, two, three and four.\n\n422\n00:23:56.215 --> 00:24:01.387\nBecause if you have a hundred different\ndesktops You would have to cycle\n\n423\n00:24:01.387 --> 00:24:08.300\nthrough to get to 99 or something like\nthat, so it's a little difficult there.\n\n424\n00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.570\nAnd again, I could go ahead and\ncreate more desktops,\n\n425\n00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:14.060\nthere's a keyboard shortcut\nto do that as well.\n\n426\n00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:19.780\nIf I hit Control, Windows and D that'll\ngenerate another desktop for me as well.\n\n427\n00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.700\nSo let's just go ahead and\nlaunch an application,\n\n428\n00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:27.653\nlet's pretend I wanna check my network\nspeed here on desktop number 3.\n\n429\n00:24:27.653 --> 00:24:33.080\nGo ahead and toggle through those,\nI can see desktop number 2, I don't think\n\n430\n00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.650\nI have anything so let's go ahead and pull\nsomething up here for desktop number 2.\n\n431\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:42.719\nThis is a fun little app I found\nin the app store the other day,\n\n432\n00:24:42.719 --> 00:24:47.600\nit's a 3D rendering app for\nhome decoration and design.\n\n433\n00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.337\nNow if I hit my task view,\nyou can really quickly see through,\n\n434\n00:24:52.337 --> 00:24:55.528\nand also your mouse and touch functions,\n\n435\n00:24:55.528 --> 00:25:00.655\nif you have a touch-enabled device,\nit's work here as well.\n\n436\n00:25:00.655 --> 00:25:05.150\nSo a lot of these things where I'm saying,\nclick and so forth, keep that in mind.\n\n437\n00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.970\nIf you do have a tablet or some kind of\ntouch-enabled device, then play with that\n\n438\n00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:13.000\nbecause there's probably a functionality\nassociated with that as well.\n\n439\n00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:18.152\nNow, but what if I wanted to ahead and\nclose out some of these desktops?\n\n440\n00:25:18.152 --> 00:25:23.230\nThis is important to know because\nif you had an application launched,\n\n441\n00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:28.630\nhere we're just checking our network\nspeed, but let's say I was here.\n\n442\n00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:33.720\nWe'll go ahead and work here with our\ndesktop, go back to our apps, and Mike,\n\n443\n00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.010\nthis one's pretty cool because I\nknow we use Markdown quite a bit.\n\n444\n00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.410\nWhere's that app?\n\n445\n00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.120\nLet me see,\nI think it started with a C, so\n\n446\n00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.150\nit should be in alphabetical order here,\nyes, code writer.\n\n447\n00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:50.240\nSo this is really nice, and I actually\nwanna play with this later today.\n\n448\n00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:55.160\nSo maybe if I had my browser pulled up and\nI was researching for a new show.\n\n449\n00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.850\nAnd I started to just go ahead and\n\n450\n00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.410\ntype something here,\nthis would be my show desktop.\n\n451\n00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:05.075\nAnd then maybe I had a shopping desktop or\nsomething like that, I don't know.\n\n452\n00:26:05.075 --> 00:26:07.578\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then you just need\nthe boss key to switch back and\n\n453\n00:26:07.578 --> 00:26:09.830\nforth between them when\nthe boss comes walking by.\n\n454\n00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.972\n&gt;&gt; Anyways,\nno don't listen to us about that,\n\n455\n00:26:14.972 --> 00:26:17.680\nI wouldn't want to lose all of my work.\n\n456\n00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.710\nSo if I were to close out of a desktop,\n\n457\n00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.725\nluckily the system still\nkeeps the application open,\n\n458\n00:26:22.725 --> 00:26:26.370\nyou don't lose anything, and\nI'll show you how that works.\n\n459\n00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:30.180\nWhat you're gonna do, is hit the Windows\nkey, control key and function 4.\n\n460\n00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:36.948\nSo again, windows, control, function 4 and\nnow let us see what happened there.\n\n461\n00:26:36.948 --> 00:26:42.040\nOops, I wanna make sure that that actually\ndid work if I hit them all correctly,\n\n462\n00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.280\nall of my keys.\n\n463\n00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:47.350\nNo, I did not, give me one more\nchance here to do that again.\n\n464\n00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:51.444\nLet me close out of File explorer here,\nlet me verify,\n\n465\n00:26:51.444 --> 00:26:53.854\nit is Windows key, control 4.\n\n466\n00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.186\nF4, sorry, all right,\nthat worked this time,\n\n467\n00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:06.045\nso if I hit my task view,\nnotice here at the bottom,\n\n468\n00:27:06.045 --> 00:27:09.668\nI only have desktop 1 and desktop 2.\n\n469\n00:27:09.668 --> 00:27:13.690\nBut the applications that we had running,\nCode Writer and\n\n470\n00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:19.620\nNetwork Speed Test are still applicable or\nopen but they're now moved to desktop 2.\n\n471\n00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:23.838\nSo it'll move those applications,\nand if we do that again, so\n\n472\n00:27:23.838 --> 00:27:26.715\nthat was going to be CTRL &gt; Windows &gt; F4.\n\n473\n00:27:26.715 --> 00:27:31.943\nNow I only have my real desktop here but\nyou can see all those applications\n\n474\n00:27:31.943 --> 00:27:37.100\nhave just been moved, so\nI don't have that organization there.\n\n475\n00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.070\nAnd you can easily close\nout of the applications\n\n476\n00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.950\nright from this window as well without-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's very cool,\n\n477\n00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:46.850\nI know we got a couple people in\nthe chat room chiming in with us here.\n\n478\n00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:49.707\nSomething I've started to\nuse a little bit more,\n\n479\n00:27:49.707 --> 00:27:52.573\nit takes a little getting\nused to the navigation.\n\n480\n00:27:52.573 --> 00:27:57.270\nI think, who was it that said shades\nof Linux workspaces up there?\n\n481\n00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:02.110\nI think Jim said that, and it is, it's\nvery similar to those types of workspaces,\n\n482\n00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:06.250\nand I know Mike was talking about\nusing it with VMs, extremely handy.\n\n483\n00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.484\nI'll have one virtual desktop that has my\nnotes program that I use to write up my\n\n484\n00:28:09.484 --> 00:28:12.020\nshow notes,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great idea.\n\n485\n00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.010\n&gt;&gt; And\nI have three monitors on my computer, so\n\n486\n00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:18.750\none desktop has the show notes,\nmy browser to do my research.\n\n487\n00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:22.905\nAnd then we typically have PowerShell or\nsomething like that on the third one and\n\n488\n00:28:22.905 --> 00:28:25.928\nthen I can switch desktops and\ni have remoted into one of my machines.\n\n489\n00:28:25.928 --> 00:28:29.340\nAnd with the remote desktop allowing\nyou to use all of your monitors,\n\n490\n00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.414\nall of a sudden it\nswitches to your other VM.\n\n491\n00:28:31.414 --> 00:28:35.988\nThe keyboard shortcut that Mike that\nmentioned there, the Control &gt; Windows key\n\n492\n00:28:35.988 --> 00:28:39.315\nleft and right arrow to switch back and\nforth between them?\n\n493\n00:28:39.315 --> 00:28:40.649\nOnce you get used to it-\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah,\n\n494\n00:28:40.649 --> 00:28:42.666\nI have that in the notes too,\nI forgot about that,\n\n495\n00:28:42.666 --> 00:28:44.698\nthat's another easy way\njust to toggle through.\n\n496\n00:28:44.698 --> 00:28:47.390\n&gt;&gt; You can get really, really productive.\n\n497\n00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.990\nYou can be really efficient with\nthis cuz you basically now have this\n\n498\n00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.510\nability to switch between\nthis set of applications.\n\n499\n00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:58.310\nAlready full screen and this set of\napplications already full screen.\n\n500\n00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:59.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and really,\n\n501\n00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.028\nMicrosoft calls it that linear design\nwith their accessibility there.\n\n502\n00:29:05.028 --> 00:29:07.620\nSo you could literally just\nbe using your keyboard, so\n\n503\n00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.960\njust giving you a lot of\ndifferent ways to access that.\n\n504\n00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.182\nSuper effective and\nconvenient there to be more efficient,\n\n505\n00:29:13.182 --> 00:29:15.150\nlike Mike was explaining with this.\n\n506\n00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:16.060\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n507\n00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.508\n&gt;&gt; Mike, looking at the time, I don't\nknow if we're gonna gonna go ahead and\n\n508\n00:29:19.508 --> 00:29:22.650\nget started on our next topic,\nI think that's pretty good for now.\n\n509\n00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:26.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, well I like it, a lot of\nthings to try out on your Windows 10\n\n510\n00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:31.050\nmachine, customize it, it might not be the\nmost technical stuff, but it's important.\n\n511\n00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:34.845\nOne, we need to be able to help our\nusers customize their user interface,\n\n512\n00:29:34.845 --> 00:29:38.690\nit makes them more productive,\nmakes them happy sitting at their machine.\n\n513\n00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:41.280\nAnd it's gonna be on the exam,\nso pay attention.\n\n514\n00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.470\nAll right, well we appreciate it,\n\n515\n00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.360\nhope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n516\n00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.070\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n517\n00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.808\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee

00:00:10.310\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.896\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n5\n00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:15.220\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.120\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.230\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n8\n00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.290\nSpecifically in this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.310\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nthe Action Center in the taskbar.\n\n10\n00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.370\nAnd here to walk us through our myriad of\noptions with those two items is none other\n\n11\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.320\nthan Ms Cherokee Boose.\n\n12\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.100\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me Mike.\n\n14\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.427\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\n\n15\n00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:34.180\nexcited to learn about the Action Center.\n\n16\n00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.171\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's action packed.\n\n17\n00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:37.618\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I get it,\n\n18\n00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:39.880\nI get it that's clever.\n\n19\n00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.626\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, no, but\nthere really are a ton of settings.\n\n20\n00:00:41.626 --> 00:00:45.546\nAnd I'm a little nervous because I'm\nafraid I'm gonna forget them all because\n\n21\n00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:46.810\nthere are so many.\n\n22\n00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.010\nI do have my notes with me, and I think\nwe'll just kinda go through the settings.\n\n23\n00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.880\nAnd again, if I forget some,\nyou guys just have to get in there because\n\n24\n00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.670\nthey are adding and changing things\nconstantly and it's pretty cool.\n\n25\n00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.580\nAction Center, just like it sounds.\n\n26\n00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.340\nThere is a lot of action going on,\nso let's take a look.\n\n27\n00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.400\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\n\n28\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.020\n&gt;&gt; A couple different ways we\ncan access the Action Center.\n\n29\n00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.206\nNow if we see at the bottom right\nhand corner, behind my head here.\n\n30\n00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:13.840\nThere is, and I'll zoom in a little bit.\n\n31\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.543\nA little tiny,\nmaybe like an index card type icon or\n\n32\n00:01:19.543 --> 00:01:23.505\nsome kind of dialogue bubble\nfrom a cartoon or something.\n\n33\n00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:24.511\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [INAUDIBLE], mm-hm.\nYeah, so\n\n34\n00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:28.170\nthat's what we're gonna\nbe focusing in on here.\n\n35\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.130\nNow, we can go ahead and left click on\nthat, and it will bring up Action Center.\n\n36\n00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.070\nAnd then also, just know that you\ndo have keyboard shortcuts here.\n\n37\n00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.843\nWe're gonna take a look at the Windows\nkey plus a to go ahead and\n\n38\n00:01:40.843 --> 00:01:43.120\nlaunch up that action center.\n\n39\n00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.730\nNow I will say this,\nthere are a ton of Windows\n\n40\n00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.700\nkeyboard shortcuts associated with the\nmaneuverability here within Windows 10.\n\n41\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.036\nAnd we'll get into why they're all there.\n\n42\n00:01:56.036 --> 00:01:58.837\nAnd, yeah, so just kind of be prepared.\n\n43\n00:01:58.837 --> 00:01:59.848\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's so many,\n\n44\n00:01:59.848 --> 00:02:02.580\nbut it's great and it's for a good reason.\n\n45\n00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.327\nNow in my action center, so\nthis is pretty much the default\n\n46\n00:02:06.327 --> 00:02:09.701\nconfiguration of how this\nwill look behind me here.\n\n47\n00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:13.865\nNow let's go through,\nI do wanna show you each one of these and\n\n48\n00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:16.200\njust kind of explain what they do.\n\n49\n00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.143\nNow you guys already know we spoke\nabout tablet mode when were looking at\n\n50\n00:02:20.143 --> 00:02:21.470\nthe Start Menu.\n\n51\n00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.050\nAnd remember that tablet\nmode would allow my\n\n52\n00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.590\nhere you can see my Start Menu\nitems to run in full screen.\n\n53\n00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.500\nAlso note that tablet mode will allow\napplications to run full screen.\n\n54\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.484\nSo if for whatever reason you get a call\nfrom the help desk and you have an end\n\n55\n00:02:40.484 --> 00:02:43.490\nuser that has an application they\ndon't know how to close out of it.\n\n56\n00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.400\nI would check one of the first\nthings here in Action Center\n\n57\n00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.240\nto make sure they haven't\naccidentally hit this option here.\n\n58\n00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.640\nBecause I mean, if you look at the actual\n\n59\n00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.670\ncolor difference between this theme that\nI have going right now on my computer.\n\n60\n00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.320\nIt's very difficult to even notice\na change between these two, so\n\n61\n00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.850\nthey may have accidentally hit that.\n\n62\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.190\nSo we'll just go ahead.\n\n63\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.990\nTap it again, and\nremember that a lot of these,\n\n64\n00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.310\njust about everything that I'm going\nto be showing you guys here today,\n\n65\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.700\nalso has a similar function that\ncan be executed with a touchscreen.\n\n66\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.400\nSo I'm not gonna be able to cover\nall of those, just know that because\n\n67\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.430\nof our different devices that Windows\n10 runs on, we do have that option.\n\n68\n00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.930\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n69\n00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.840\n&gt;&gt; Alright, the next tile here is Network.\n\n70\n00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.840\nJust like it sounds,\nit's going to go ahead and\n\n71\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.620\nbring up some networking information.\n\n72\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.780\nI can see the wireless networks\nthat are available to me.\n\n73\n00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.990\nAnd then I also have the ability to go\nahead and launch into more additional\n\n74\n00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.570\ninformation if I really wanted\nto go ahead and set up my wi-fi.\n\n75\n00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.899\nI also have the ability to turn on or\noff airplane mode.\n\n76\n00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:52.663\nSo that's going to prevent any\nkind of communication there and\n\n77\n00:03:52.663 --> 00:03:55.520\nstop that network connectivity.\n\n78\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.350\nAs well as setting up a mobile hot spot.\n\n79\n00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.497\nAll settings, just like it sounds, if you\nrecall when we were looking at this in\n\n80\n00:04:04.497 --> 00:04:09.112\nthe last couple of shows, this is that\ngrid view interface that allows us to go\n\n81\n00:04:09.112 --> 00:04:12.030\nahead and\nmake changes to our Windows settings.\n\n82\n00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.610\nAnd what else do we have here?\n\n83\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.770\nSetting our location just turning it on or\noff.\n\n84\n00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.620\nNow VPNs, we'll take a look at\nVPNs in a later episode when we're\n\n85\n00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.240\ntalking more about networking.\n\n86\n00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.140\nAnd how to configure those.\n\n87\n00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.230\nYou also have the ability to launch\nbattery saver to project your screen.\n\n88\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.190\nSo if you were in some kind of\npresentation, like I'm doing now,\n\n89\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.390\nor just wanted to connect\nto a device that you\n\n90\n00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.310\ndidn't currently have set up with any kind\nof mirror cast or something like that.\n\n91\n00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.060\nBecause you also have an option\nto connect right here.\n\n92\n00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.110\nAnd let me zoom in so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n93\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.650\nSo here you see the Connect option.\n\n94\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.177\nNow, the system is automatically\ndetecting for display and\n\n95\n00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.950\naudio devices to be able to connect to.\n\n96\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.640\nI don't know whose devices those are, so\n\n97\n00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.300\nI'm definitely not gonna connect\nto them during the show.\n\n98\n00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.018\nBut just know that that's where you\nwould go ahead and find that feature.\n\n99\n00:05:12.018 --> 00:05:18.200\nAll right, a couple more here you can see.\n\n100\n00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.425\nMy bluetooth is currently not connected,\n\n101\n00:05:20.425 --> 00:05:23.950\nI'm looking at my brightness\nhere from my display options.\n\n102\n00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.620\nNight light,\nif I'm using my computer in the dark.\n\n103\n00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.912\nQuiet hours, now,\nthis one I actually use quite often.\n\n104\n00:05:30.912 --> 00:05:35.740\nIf I turn on Quiet hours, notice down\nhere in the bottom right hand corner,\n\n105\n00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.960\nhow I have a little crescent shaped moon\ncovering this dialogue looking box, right?\n\n106\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.540\nSo that is simply going to be\nrunning from 12am to 6am, yes.\n\n107\n00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.080\nTo prevent any kind of bubble.\n\n108\n00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.140\nSo if you guys noticed,\nI did have some bubbles there, or numbers.\n\n109\n00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.710\nIt's actually technically called a badge.\n\n110\n00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.740\nSo, whenever you have an icon\nsitting in your task bar down here,\n\n111\n00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.460\nthen that is going to be a badge element.\n\n112\n00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.940\nSo it would show me the number of\nnotifications that I have sitting there.\n\n113\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.080\nAll right,\nnow let me zoom out a little bit.\n\n114\n00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.910\nIf you notice, there was an option to go\nahead and collapse some of these tiles.\n\n115\n00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.170\nSo if I go ahead and select collapse,\n\n116\n00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.110\nit'll just default down\nto these four right here.\n\n117\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.260\nBut what if I wanted to go ahead and\nchange those, right?\n\n118\n00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.780\nSo let's go back into our\nactual settings window.\n\n119\n00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.450\nSo I'll just hit the Windows\nkey plus I to bring that up.\n\n120\n00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.160\nNow from in here,\nwe're gonna go under System.\n\n121\n00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.830\nAnd then in System,\nthere's the notification.\n\n122\n00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.440\nI wanna go back to my home system,\nI've been playing around in here.\n\n123\n00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.260\nNotifications and actions,\nit's over here on the left hand side.\n\n124\n00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:56.050\nSo with this interface, it looks the same\nas what you guys saw on my Action Center.\n\n125\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.292\nSo if you notice, the top four were the\nfour that were on display whenever I hit\n\n126\n00:07:00.292 --> 00:07:01.610\nthat collapse button.\n\n127\n00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.900\nSo you can simply drag and drop these.\n\n128\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.220\nSo let's say, okay, well Cherokee uses\nquiet hours all the time, she said.\n\n129\n00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.080\nBut you know what,\n\n130\n00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.670\nsometimes she locks her computer in\ntablet mode and that's annoying.\n\n131\n00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:14.155\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we'll just put it down here at\n\n132\n00:07:14.155 --> 00:07:14.717\nthe bottom.\n\n133\n00:07:14.717 --> 00:07:17.133\nAnd then you guys can\nrerrange them however.\n\n134\n00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:19.825\nJust know that this area is where you\ncould also more gradually define how you\n\n135\n00:07:19.825 --> 00:07:21.100\nwant that Action Center to behave.\n\n136\n00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.190\nJust know that this area\nis where you could also\n\n137\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.470\nmore granularly define how you\nwant that Action Center to behave.\n\n138\n00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.384\nJust different types of calls.\n\n139\n00:07:36.384 --> 00:07:39.245\nSo you can set maybe certain things\nto give you notifications for, but\n\n140\n00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:39.984\nnot everything.\n\n141\n00:07:39.984 --> 00:07:40.960\nJust allowing you those options.\n\n142\n00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.500\nAnd you can see that on a per\napplication type basis as well,\n\n143\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.775\nso if you want to be top secret\nabout anything then there you go.\n\n144\n00:07:48.775 --> 00:07:50.572\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n145\n00:07:50.572 --> 00:07:51.527\n&gt;&gt; It is nice though,\n\n146\n00:07:51.527 --> 00:07:55.352\nto be about to control the number of\nnotifications that you get especially,\n\n147\n00:07:55.352 --> 00:07:59.680\nlike for our position, where we're using\nour computers and displaying our screen.\n\n148\n00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.940\nBut when you're working,\n\n149\n00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.460\nsometimes all those notifications\nabout stuff can really be distracting.\n\n150\n00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.050\nSo being able to turn some\nof those off that aren't\n\n151\n00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.560\nquite as important is very cool.\n\n152\n00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.050\n&gt;&gt; And that's why I use that option.\n\n153\n00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.520\nBecause you guys don't care if I have\nlike 15 notifications sitting there.\n\n154\n00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.450\nAs a matter of fact,\nI probably don't care either.\n\n155\n00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.340\n[LAUGH] That's beside the point.\n\n156\n00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.097\nAll right, the next thing I wanted talk\nabout here is going to be taskbar.\n\n157\n00:08:21.097 --> 00:08:27.742\nTaskbar has been a UI element that has\nbeen around for, well, I don't know.\n\n158\n00:08:27.742 --> 00:08:33.018\nThe last OS I can remember is Windows\n95 for me, so yeah, a very long time.\n\n159\n00:08:33.018 --> 00:08:37.760\nIf we could take a look down here, okay,\nso everything's a little bit larger,\n\n160\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.920\nlike I said, because of that\ndisplay size here for the show.\n\n161\n00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.340\nSo what we're gonna do, I'm just\ngonna right-click real quick here and\n\n162\n00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:46.870\nget rid of.\n\n163\n00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.337\nI'm going to hide Cortana.\n\n164\n00:08:48.337 --> 00:08:49.676\nI'm sorry, Cortana.\n\n165\n00:08:49.676 --> 00:08:51.557\nWe're just gonna do that for\nthe show right now.\n\n166\n00:08:51.557 --> 00:08:55.160\nBut that'll give me a little more real\nestate to show you everything that we\n\n167\n00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.860\nwanna cover in this show.\n\n168\n00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:03.830\nNow notice that I have some icons that\nare already sitting here in my taskbar.\n\n169\n00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.360\nSome were default from Microsoft and\nsome I've placed as well.\n\n170\n00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.020\nAnd it's kind of interesting,\nthey go in order.\n\n171\n00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.410\nSo I think the way that\nthe operating system groups them,\n\n172\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.830\nthey'll be like the OS installed,\nand then ones you've installed.\n\n173\n00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:24.430\nAnd then if there are any XML or\nGroup Policy pushing it out,\n\n174\n00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.550\nthen those go later.\n\n175\n00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.496\nYou can always rearrange them in\ndifferent orders, just drag and drop.\n\n176\n00:09:30.496 --> 00:09:35.999\nI say always, but unless there is a policy\nthat overrides that with Group Policy or\n\n177\n00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:41.284\nsomething or even on the local machine,\nthen you won't be able to rearrange.\n\n178\n00:09:41.284 --> 00:09:43.935\nBut usually,\nyou'll be able to rearrange there.\n\n179\n00:09:43.935 --> 00:09:48.510\nAnd most of them are applications\nthat I have sitting here.\n\n180\n00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.300\nAnd if you recall,\nif I pull up my Start menu here, let's say\n\n181\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.490\nI wanted to pin something else to the\ntaskbar, is actually really simple to do.\n\n182\n00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:00.370\nSo I can launch my apps, my alarms and\n\n183\n00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:05.370\nclock app here, and now that it's\nalready active, you can see that.\n\n184\n00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:10.020\nAs this application is active, I have\nthat little alarm icon in the taskbar.\n\n185\n00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.080\nSo you just right-click and\nthen select Pin to taskbar.\n\n186\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.830\nSo now,\nwhen I even close out of this window,\n\n187\n00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:21.245\nthat icon still resides\nthere inside the taskbar.\n\n188\n00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:26.145\nNow, like I said, if I wanted to move this\nup front here, I could do that as well.\n\n189\n00:10:26.145 --> 00:10:29.805\nAnd something that I thought was really\ncool was the ability to be able to\n\n190\n00:10:29.805 --> 00:10:31.615\nutilize keyboard shortcuts.\n\n191\n00:10:31.615 --> 00:10:34.835\nAnd I know there are a lot more than\nI'm actually showing you right now and\n\n192\n00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:36.590\neven just maneuvering through the OS.\n\n193\n00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:37.430\nBut that's okay.\n\n194\n00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.670\nWe'll get to some of those also.\n\n195\n00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.610\nIf we hit the Windows key, and\n\n196\n00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:46.120\nthen notice how now my alarm\nclock is in position number one.\n\n197\n00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.710\nIf you were to look at these,\nnumbering them, in the US,\n\n198\n00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.260\nso we go here left to right,\nas far as reading goes.\n\n199\n00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.530\nIn other countries, if you have some\nlanguage that is right to left,\n\n200\n00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.560\nthen it would correspond with that.\n\n201\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.840\nBut if I say Windows key number one,\nthen that'll go ahead and\n\n202\n00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.150\nbring up my alarm and\nclock application here.\n\n203\n00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.880\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n204\n00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.250\nAnd we'll be looking at some more ways we\ncan utilize the keyboard here, as well.\n\n205\n00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.510\n&gt;&gt; I'm a big fan of pinning\nthings to my taskbar.\n\n206\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.750\nIt's so much quicker for\nthe things that I really like to use.\n\n207\n00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:25.270\nI've been trying to jump into Windows\n10 and pin things to my Start menu.\n\n208\n00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.744\nBut something about pinning them\nto the taskbar just comfortable.\n\n209\n00:11:27.744 --> 00:11:28.568\nIt's the way I've always done that.\n\n210\n00:11:28.568 --> 00:11:29.068\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n211\n00:11:29.068 --> 00:11:29.740\n&gt;&gt; Like we said,\n\n212\n00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.227\nit's been around forever.\nSo\n\n213\n00:11:31.227 --> 00:11:34.309\ncan't teach an old dog a new tricks,\nright, Mike?\n\n214\n00:11:34.309 --> 00:11:35.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know about that,\n\n215\n00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.720\nbut we can try at least.\n\n216\n00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.051\nBut yeah, I do get to the point where\nmy taskbar is full of icons and\n\n217\n00:11:41.051 --> 00:11:42.998\nthen you drop it down to smaller size.\n\n218\n00:11:42.998 --> 00:11:46.318\nPretty soon, you have to start purging and\nremoving some things, but-\n\n219\n00:11:46.318 --> 00:11:48.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you know what?\n\n220\n00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.710\nTalking about old school\nversus new school,\n\n221\n00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.768\nlet's take a look at something that\nwe have right here available to us.\n\n222\n00:11:53.768 --> 00:11:55.920\nIf I right-click on the taskbar,\n\n223\n00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.180\nhere I see more of that modern\nUI context menu that appears.\n\n224\n00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.520\nAnd let me just do it again so\nit's not right behind my head, so\n\n225\n00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.550\nyou guys can see what that looks like.\n\n226\n00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:08.270\nAnd we'll go through each one of these\nelements here because they are important.\n\n227\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.260\nBut now, that was just\n\n228\n00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.680\na regular right-click when I had\nmy mouse hovered over the taskbar.\n\n229\n00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:21.190\nNow, if I hold down the Shift key and\nright-click, oops, I'm sorry.\n\n230\n00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.450\nIt doesn't do it for\nthe actual taskbar context menu, but for\n\n231\n00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:28.520\napplications it'll switch between\nold school and new school there.\n\n232\n00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.952\nAnd I don't know if that's\nthe technical term, probably not.\n\n233\n00:12:30.952 --> 00:12:36.635\nBut [LAUGH] if you right-click on\nlike here for my Chrome application,\n\n234\n00:12:36.635 --> 00:12:42.720\nI have this little jump list, which is\na type of context menu that appears.\n\n235\n00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.662\nAnd it shows different websites\nthat I've recently visited, right?\n\n236\n00:12:46.662 --> 00:12:48.862\nSo that was just a regular right-click.\n\n237\n00:12:48.862 --> 00:12:52.899\n[COUGH] But like I said, when I hold\ndown the Shift key and right-click,\n\n238\n00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:56.950\nI have that traditional menu that\nyou would've seen in the past there.\n\n239\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:01.620\nSo you still have some extra\noptions available to you.\n\n240\n00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.950\nAll right, let's actually look at\nthat context menu that we brought up\n\n241\n00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.210\nby right-clicking on the taskbar.\n\n242\n00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:11.794\nLet's focus in on Toolbars,\nthis is actually pretty cool.\n\n243\n00:13:11.794 --> 00:13:15.290\nSome of them you may use,\nsome of them you may not, but\n\n244\n00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.080\nat least you'll know they're there.\n\n245\n00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:22.250\nNow addresses, if I wanted to go ahead and\n\n246\n00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.632\nuse this a quick way to browse\nthe Internet and type in addresses,\n\n247\n00:13:26.632 --> 00:13:28.520\nI definitely could do that.\n\n248\n00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:36.060\nAnd a complementary toolbar here,\nlet me see I gotta find an open space now.\n\n249\n00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.799\nI'm going to uncheck that, so I can really\nregain some of my real estate here and\n\n250\n00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:41.800\npull it back up.\n\n251\n00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:50.300\nLinks, now let's see,\nlet me just pull up a page here.\n\n252\n00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.443\nSo we'll go to ITProTV.\n\n253\n00:13:52.443 --> 00:13:54.998\nNo Internet connection.\n\n254\n00:13:54.998 --> 00:13:56.057\nThat's fine.\n\n255\n00:13:56.057 --> 00:13:59.898\n[LAUGH] What I'm gonna do-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] You can still drag the link\n\n256\n00:13:59.898 --> 00:14:00.542\ndown there, right?\n\n257\n00:14:00.542 --> 00:14:05.482\n&gt;&gt; Right, it'll still work, but as you\ncan see, or maybe not, let me zoom in so\n\n258\n00:14:05.482 --> 00:14:06.730\nguys can see that.\n\n259\n00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.110\nThis little tiny option and\nit's even yeah, pretty small there.\n\n260\n00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.410\nRight here, it says Links.\n\n261\n00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:16.300\nSo that's my destination for my URL here.\n\n262\n00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.060\nSo what I'm gonna do is left-click and\n\n263\n00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.324\ndrag, and good luck trying\nto use my keyboard shortcut.\n\n264\n00:14:24.324 --> 00:14:25.393\nYou can see it?\nOkay,\n\n265\n00:14:25.393 --> 00:14:31.290\nI'm gonna brink my link over to\nthe section that says Links.\n\n266\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:36.130\nAnd if you move it around, you can\nsee how it changes to the no symbol,\n\n267\n00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.760\nso you know where it'll\naccept your dropping.\n\n268\n00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:46.800\nSo I'll left, just drop it there, and\nnow I'm gonna zoom in a little bit more,\n\n269\n00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:54.150\nI have a little jump list here, a quick\naccessibility for itpro.tv in my links.\n\n270\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.940\nAnd I was thinking,\n\n271\n00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:01.020\nwell, what if you just had this, you had\nbookmarks for your browser or whatever.\n\n272\n00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.080\nBut what if you had multiple\nbrowsers that you used?\n\n273\n00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.260\nI think that this would be\nreally handy to be able to\n\n274\n00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.380\naggregate them all into one location\nthat's really easy to access here.\n\n275\n00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.790\nSo that's actually pretty cool.\n\n276\n00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.616\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n277\n00:15:15.616 --> 00:15:17.940\nThere are certain pages\nthat I typically go to.\n\n278\n00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:22.387\nAnd sometimes it's easier to just click\nthere, rather than open up the browser,\n\n279\n00:15:22.387 --> 00:15:23.620\ngo to your Favorites.\n\n280\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.613\nYou just got a pin\nbasically right to there.\n\n281\n00:15:25.613 --> 00:15:26.937\nThe other cool thing-\n&gt;&gt; And that's what it's all about.\n\n282\n00:15:26.937 --> 00:15:28.260\nHow difficult was that?\n\n283\n00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.251\nBesides trying to make sure\nI landed in the right spot.\n\n284\n00:15:32.251 --> 00:15:32.775\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But you can\n\n285\n00:15:32.775 --> 00:15:33.304\nalso do file locations.\n\n286\n00:15:33.304 --> 00:15:37.815\nSo if there are shared folders on your\nnetwork that you're constantly having to\n\n287\n00:15:37.815 --> 00:15:41.716\nopen up to move files to, you can add\nthose to that links bar as well and\n\n288\n00:15:41.716 --> 00:15:43.670\nkinda keep them all in one place.\n\n289\n00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.732\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they allow you to do that here.\n\n290\n00:15:44.732 --> 00:15:49.703\nAnd we'll actually take a look at that\nin a second under here for new toolbar.\n\n291\n00:15:49.703 --> 00:15:52.168\nActually, let's just do it\nnow like Mike was explaining.\n\n292\n00:15:52.168 --> 00:15:56.333\nIf you wanted to go ahead and create\nyour own toolbar, something like For\n\n293\n00:15:56.333 --> 00:15:58.668\neasy access let's go ahead and do that.\n\n294\n00:15:58.668 --> 00:16:02.926\nOn my desktop I have a folder\nwith notes that I just have for\n\n295\n00:16:02.926 --> 00:16:06.407\nthis particular show, it's 70-698.\n\n296\n00:16:06.407 --> 00:16:11.580\nSo if I select that particular\nfolder I'll hit Select Folder,\n\n297\n00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:18.340\nnow notice like Mike was saying I have\na quick access to that particular show.\n\n298\n00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:23.370\nThen if I click on the double arrow here,\nit'll bring up different resources and\n\n299\n00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.680\nbooks and cheat sheets.\n\n300\n00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.650\nAnd thing that I have that I\nhelp write notes for this show.\n\n301\n00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:34.530\nSuper easy way to organize\nyour information.\n\n302\n00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.505\nAll right, we'll take away\na couple of these, and oops,\n\n303\n00:16:40.505 --> 00:16:44.170\nright-click in, getting click-happy here.\n\n304\n00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.370\nI'll take away our links.\n\n305\n00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:53.610\nThis one, this is going to be, and this is\ngoing to be unique to my computer here.\n\n306\n00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.232\nWell, it's unique to Dell,\nI should say, for this support assist.\n\n307\n00:16:57.232 --> 00:17:02.480\nIt's actually like I'm monitoring\nutility that I have access to.\n\n308\n00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.720\nSo you might not see that in yours.\n\n309\n00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.080\nJust be aware of that.\n\n310\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:08.630\nCortana.\n\n311\n00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.080\nWe already saw how to hide Cortana.\n\n312\n00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:18.760\nI have the option to go ahead and\nbring that search box back right here.\n\n313\n00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.350\nBut if I wanted to just maybe still have\na quick access without taking up all\n\n314\n00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:27.250\nthat search bar space,\nI could also say, show Cortana, and\n\n315\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:31.260\nit will leave her icon sitting there.\n\n316\n00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:35.950\nSo in order to expand out to that search,\nyou would left-click, and\n\n317\n00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.810\nthen it would bring her up right there.\n\n318\n00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:45.010\nAll right,\nwhat's next on our to-do list here.\n\n319\n00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.493\nShow task view button.\n\n320\n00:17:46.493 --> 00:17:53.650\nAll right, let me see,\nwhere did that go, my task view.\n\n321\n00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:54.460\nRight here.\n\n322\n00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.720\nLet me zoom in so you guys can see that.\n\n323\n00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.720\nGonna be up here on the front,\nbecause that's a Windows integrated one.\n\n324\n00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.980\nSo we already have a show on task view.\n\n325\n00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.090\nAnd we've talked about how we can\nsetup those virtual desktops there.\n\n326\n00:18:12.781 --> 00:18:16.050\nAll right, what else do we got here?\n\n327\n00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.540\nOkay.\n\n328\n00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.465\nLooking at the time, do we have\nenough time to talk about people?\n\n329\n00:18:20.465 --> 00:18:22.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've about five or\n\n330\n00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.050\nten minutes, whatever.\n\n331\n00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll go ahead and go with this.\n\n332\n00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.380\nI already have people turned on here.\n\n333\n00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.290\nActually, you guys might\nhave already seen that.\n\n334\n00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.720\nIt's over in the bottom right hand corner.\n\n335\n00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.640\nIf I didn't then that's\nwhere I would turn it on.\n\n336\n00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.780\nBut this is kind of an interesting one,\nMike.\n\n337\n00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:44.310\nSo people is going to be a communication\ntechnology and I'm gonna left click and\n\n338\n00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.770\njust zoom out a little bit so\nwe can see what we're working with here.\n\n339\n00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:52.596\nI really don't utilize this\nthat often to be totally\n\n340\n00:18:52.596 --> 00:18:53.814\nhonest [LAUGH]\n\n341\n00:18:53.814 --> 00:18:54.625\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here.\n\n342\n00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:58.132\n&gt;&gt; I have so many other communication\nchannels that at sometimes I feel\n\n343\n00:18:58.132 --> 00:18:59.730\na little overwhelmed.\n\n344\n00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:04.650\nBut I will say this,\nMicrosoft is working with\n\n345\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:10.730\nother platforms to be able to integrate to\nconsolidate these communication channels.\n\n346\n00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.120\nSo I think that's pretty cool.\n\n347\n00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.350\nCurrently, I have three different\noptions sitting in here.\n\n348\n00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:20.870\nSo I have my people, which is the\napplication that's directly tied to this,\n\n349\n00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.120\nwell, the people app, right?\n\n350\n00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.100\nI also have Skype and then I have\nthe ability to add email accounts to\n\n351\n00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.810\nimport my contacts, so I can have my\nSkype contacts, my email contacts.\n\n352\n00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.010\nUnder this people section Microsoft or\nthe OS will look\n\n353\n00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:43.910\nat your correspondence And see whom\nyou interact with most frequently.\n\n354\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:49.315\nSo there will be contacts that come\nup here when you first set this up.\n\n355\n00:19:49.315 --> 00:19:52.905\nLike maybe suggestions for\nwho you wanna set as your top three.\n\n356\n00:19:52.905 --> 00:19:56.935\nDo you remember in MySpace when it had,\nlike, I don't remember what it was, but\n\n357\n00:19:56.935 --> 00:19:58.625\nyour top whatever of friends.\n\n358\n00:19:58.625 --> 00:20:00.580\nAnd they would be displayed on your page.\n\n359\n00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.470\nThat's what this kind of reminds me of.\n\n360\n00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.280\nAnd I really don't have any friends,\nso I had to harass a couple people,\n\n361\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.710\nMike being one of them.\n\n362\n00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:13.360\nAnd then also Nate, and asked them if they\nwould be my friends for my top three spot.\n\n363\n00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.435\nAnd as you can see, I only have two,\nso that's really sad.\n\n364\n00:20:16.435 --> 00:20:19.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But what happens is,\n\n365\n00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:24.350\nlet's see if I go in my people and\nfind my contacts.\n\n366\n00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:29.250\nSo I do have Marisha but I didn't ask her\nif I could put her in my top three but\n\n367\n00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:29.890\nthat's all right.\n\n368\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:30.860\nI'm sure she won't care.\n\n369\n00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.150\nWe can go ahead.\n\n370\n00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:34.570\nLet me see if I can drag and drop.\n\n371\n00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.550\nI think you can right click on this.\n\n372\n00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.290\nThere's a way where I\ncan select my people,\n\n373\n00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:46.420\nhold on one second,\nI can't really remember.\n\n374\n00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.467\nLike I said, I don't have friends so\nI don't use this app very often.\n\n375\n00:20:49.467 --> 00:20:51.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n376\n00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:55.460\n&gt;&gt; Anyways, I added Mike down here,\n\n377\n00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.890\nMike and Nate,\nI did have those two pulled up.\n\n378\n00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.970\nAnd you guys can see what\nit kind of looks like here.\n\n379\n00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.830\nThe interface might be a little\nbit different depending on\n\n380\n00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.970\nwhat kind of relationship\nyou have with that person.\n\n381\n00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.490\nWhich I thought was actually pretty cool.\n\n382\n00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.880\nSo for instance, Mike,\nI don't know if you have your\n\n383\n00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.835\ncalendar set up where it shows our daily\nhost meeting that we go to, right?\n\n384\n00:21:18.835 --> 00:21:21.463\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Whenever I had a common event with\n\n385\n00:21:21.463 --> 00:21:26.233\nMarisha, I was playing around with\nthat earlier it would notify me of\n\n386\n00:21:26.233 --> 00:21:28.440\nour common events here.\n\n387\n00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.510\nAnd so you could go ahead and\nlaunch your email.\n\n388\n00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.970\nEdit these settings to make it\na little more personalized.\n\n389\n00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.460\nIf I wanted to email him quickly,\nlike on the fly.\n\n390\n00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.710\nHe was a person that I contacted often and\n\n391\n00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.270\nI could keep him sitting\nthere in my taskbar.\n\n392\n00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:47.810\nAnd then this part is pretty\ncool here with Skype.\n\n393\n00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.142\nIf you integrate Skype, and\n\n394\n00:21:51.142 --> 00:21:55.380\nat the time of the show, according to\nMicrosoft documentation it says that it'll\n\n395\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.620\nbe working with personal Skype,\nnot business Skype.\n\n396\n00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.060\nI've tested it a couple of different ways,\n\n397\n00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.770\nit wasn't working the way\nthat we wanted it to.\n\n398\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.840\nSo, I have this set up with\npersonal Skype accounts.\n\n399\n00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:11.390\nSo, we can just say something to Nate,\nlike hi Nate, and see if he responds.\n\n400\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.650\nAnd we also have the ability\nto send these little emojis.\n\n401\n00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.200\nThey're really cute.\n\n402\n00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.590\nYou have your little porg there,\nsome Star Wars emojis.\n\n403\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.820\nSo if you wanted to send\nhim some animation,\n\n404\n00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.280\nwe could just go ahead and send those off.\n\n405\n00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:32.530\nAnd it's kind of neat because even\nif you have the application closed,\n\n406\n00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:36.270\nyou can even receive these animations\non your task bar, they pop up.\n\n407\n00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.240\nThey used to call some\nof these shoulder taps.\n\n408\n00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.010\nThey've changed the verbage\na little bit but\n\n409\n00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:46.240\nlike I said, you'll probably see a lot\nof changes in this application for\n\n410\n00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.300\nthe spring creator's release because\nthey've been working on that.\n\n411\n00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.795\nBut if you haven't checked it out you\nmight want to change out your people,\n\n412\n00:22:54.795 --> 00:22:59.210\n[LAUGH] it's such a weird little name for\nthe app but it is what it is.\n\n413\n00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:04.300\nAll right, Mike, I do know we have some\nmore to talk about here with our taskbar,\n\n414\n00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.260\nbut I don't think we'll have time to\nreally get to everything in this show.\n\n415\n00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.170\nI'm looking at it and I think that's\ngoing to be a good place to stop.\n\n416\n00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:10.990\n&gt;&gt; Good point, Cherokee.\n\n417\n00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:13.610\nI know we want to spend a little time\nthere, so why don't we cut here and\n\n418\n00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.090\nwe'll just come back with a part two?\n\n419\n00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so gossiping in the part two,\nwhere we talk about people?\n\n420\n00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.350\n&gt;&gt; That sounds good to me.\n\n421\n00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.900\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nhope you enjoyed this one.\n\n422\n00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.820\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n423\n00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.590\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n424\n00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.653\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n425\n00:23:26.653 --> 00:23:34.109\n[MUSIC]\n\n426\n00:23:34.109 --> 00:23:36.523\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Hello, welcome to another\n\n4\n00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.906\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:20.000\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, today we\nare installing and configuring Windows 10.\n\n6\n00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.840\nSpecifically in this episode\nwe're actually doing a part two\n\n7\n00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.850\non the action center and task bar.\n\n8\n00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.000\nA lot of cool customizations we can do\nthat can make us more productive, and\n\n9\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.157\nof course get us ready for\nthat 70-698 exam.\n\n10\n00:00:30.157 --> 00:00:34.543\nSo here to walk us through to help us do\nsome more options is none other than miss\n\n11\n00:00:34.543 --> 00:00:35.560\nCherokee Boose.\n\n12\n00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.280\nWelcome back Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for\nhaving me, how are you Mike.\n\n14\n00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.980\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, excited to see\nwhat else you've got to show us.\n\n15\n00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.390\n&gt;&gt; Well I figured, like we said,\n\n16\n00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.820\nwe talk about people in a very\nnon gossipy kind of way.\n\n17\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.930\nBecause people is going to be a type of\ncommunication technology that Microsoft\n\n18\n00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.270\nutilizes to collaborate really,\nyou can take\n\n19\n00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.540\nsome already accounts applications that\nyou may already use to communicate.\n\n20\n00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.620\nAnd then combine them into people so.\n\n21\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.150\n&gt;&gt; It is pretty cool as\nrelatively new with Windows 10,\n\n22\n00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.330\nI forget which update push this out.\n\n23\n00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.180\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n24\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.190\nit is one of those things where we've got\nso many different ways to communicate and\n\n25\n00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.110\nkeep track of our colleagues,\nour friends, things like that.\n\n26\n00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.712\nAnd so,\nthat's the idea behind people, right.\n\n27\n00:01:21.712 --> 00:01:24.410\n&gt;&gt; Merge them.\n&gt;&gt; You start to bring all that to one,\n\n28\n00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.950\neasy to use little interface.\n\n29\n00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because it can get quite\ncubersome if I have to be logging into so\n\n30\n00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.950\nmany different applications,\njust to Make sure I can get messages or\n\n31\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.890\nany kind of notifications that I need to.\n\n32\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.870\nSo with the spring creator's release,\n\n33\n00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.810\nyou'll probably be seeing a lot more\nintegration with other applications.\n\n34\n00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.730\nSo it is up to those other\nexternal vendors that\n\n35\n00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.020\nthey're going to be developing\nto work with my people.\n\n36\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.440\nSo that is, I don't think it's\nlike a guaranteed thing but\n\n37\n00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.270\nthat's what we'll probably see.\n\n38\n00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's Microsoft's hope anyway,\n\n39\n00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.790\nthat vendors will make their apps\nintegrate with it eventually.\n\n40\n00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.930\n&gt;&gt; All right so how do we get it, right?\n\n41\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.440\nSo it is in our Windows 10 operating\nsystem and we were talking about task bar.\n\n42\n00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.030\nActually that's really what we'll continue\ntalking about people it's just what\n\n43\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.150\nare those features that we can quickly\naccess right here from our task bar.\n\n44\n00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.910\nSo, if we take a look at my screen, and\nif you recall, I just selected and did\n\n45\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.000\na right click here, and let me move that\nover so, we can have a little more space.\n\n46\n00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.740\nWe had stopped right here looking\nat that task view button so,\n\n47\n00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.250\nif we select Show people button,\nall right?\n\n48\n00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.070\nAnd I'll zoom in here for us.\n\n49\n00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.510\nMake sure it actually\ncame towards the bottom.\n\n50\n00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.960\nYes, so here are my people,\nMike and you are one of my people.\n\n51\n00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.770\n&gt;&gt; Am I?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n52\n00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.370\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n&gt;&gt; I think, yeah, there you are.\n\n53\n00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.094\nRight there.\n\n54\n00:02:47.094 --> 00:02:47.875\nMike@itpro.tv.\n\n55\n00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:48.656\n&gt;&gt; I feel special.\n\n56\n00:02:48.656 --> 00:02:49.242\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n57\n00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:50.866\n&gt;&gt; Well, I only have a couple of them\n\n58\n00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:51.905\nin here, so [LAUGH].\n\n59\n00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.290\n[LAUGH] I don't have\ntoo many friends Mike.\n\n60\n00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.950\nAll right.\n\n61\n00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.120\nI'm gonna zoom out to give\nmyself a little more space.\n\n62\n00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.165\nBut what you can do is go ahead and\nclick on the people icon.\n\n63\n00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:07.950\nAnd again like I said I really\ndon't have my contacts integrated.\n\n64\n00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.650\nLet me just pull that up real quick.\n\n65\n00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:17.170\nIf we go to our settings page and\nthen under system and let's see.\n\n66\n00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.916\nI believe, I'm trying to think where was.\n\n67\n00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:25.850\nHere, I'll just go back to my home.\n\n68\n00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.853\nI think it was under taskbar.\n\n69\n00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:36.940\nTaskbar settings all\nthe way to the bottom.\n\n70\n00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.350\nI have the ability to even\nhave people show up here.\n\n71\n00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.960\nSo if you wanted to utilise this feature\nbut not have them sitting in the task bar.\n\n72\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.077\nYou can do that as well.\n\n73\n00:03:47.077 --> 00:03:50.558\nAll right also you see\nhere show the contact,\n\n74\n00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:54.800\nshow my people notification and\nplay a sound.\n\n75\n00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.910\nWhen you set this up, you'll have\nthe ability to link email accounts or\n\n76\n00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.820\nSkype accounts so if I select apps\nI don't have anything really safe.\n\n77\n00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.702\nLike I said, I'm not an early\nadopter here with my people.\n\n78\n00:04:08.702 --> 00:04:14.240\nSo definitely take the time here to play\naround with it hopefully this application\n\n79\n00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.630\nor this technology will take off here but\nthe first app that we have is people.\n\n80\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.870\nThen we have Skype.\n\n81\n00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.110\nAnd then we also have the ability to go\nahead and add different email accounts.\n\n82\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.020\nSo by default,\n\n83\n00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.280\nMicrosoft will, under your people\nsection here, I had just went in and\n\n84\n00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.920\nremoved that information but\nthey'll put suggestions up there.\n\n85\n00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.570\nSo people who they think you\ncommunicate with frequently or\n\n86\n00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.160\nthey know you communicate with\nfrequently but thinking might\n\n87\n00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.370\nwant to continue to communicate with\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n88\n00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.006\n&gt;&gt; You do have the ability to select your\n\n89\n00:04:49.006 --> 00:04:53.767\npeople as well but for now,\nif you launch or begin a conversation,\n\n90\n00:04:53.767 --> 00:04:58.450\ngo ahead and place your top three\ndown in the task bar, okay.\n\n91\n00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.740\nSo, if I wanted to go ahead, and this\nis Nate, and we've been chatting here.\n\n92\n00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.280\nSee, talking about people\nin a non gossipy way.\n\n93\n00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.118\nBut if I wanted to go ahead and just\nquickly send something to Nate I could do\n\n94\n00:05:13.118 --> 00:05:18.363\nso and I could send him this little guy,\nhe's so cute, or something like this.\n\n95\n00:05:21.297 --> 00:05:26.400\nI could also send contacts,\nI could send files and any kind of images.\n\n96\n00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.680\nSo this is a very similar interface feel\nto other types of messaging services\n\n97\n00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.680\nyou may already be familiar with, but just\na different way to be able to communicate.\n\n98\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.740\nAnd right from within this\ninterface I could go ahead and\n\n99\n00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.430\nlaunch a Skype call with him,\nas well a video call there.\n\n100\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.880\nSo, and I could probably move this over so\nit's not right there in the way and\n\n101\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.950\nI don't know if Nate's around\nhis computer, he might be busy.\n\n102\n00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.770\nBut it's pretty cool, I mean, you could\neven actually close out of this particular\n\n103\n00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.820\ncanvas window, and have a notification\npop up over your people there.\n\n104\n00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.940\nSo kinda cool.\n\n105\n00:06:05.975 --> 00:06:07.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is.\n\n106\n00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.310\n&gt;&gt; Of course, I'm getting blamed,\nsidetracked looking at him.\n\n107\n00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.630\nHe's so cute.\n\n108\n00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.310\n&gt;&gt; I know we've joked\nabout this off camera.\n\n109\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.240\nNot being the most social of people right.\n\n110\n00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.850\nBut this is a great way to have all of\nthat right there at your fingertips.\n\n111\n00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.330\nAgain, you're seeing a lot of this where I\ndon't have to go all the way into the app,\n\n112\n00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.970\nI can integrate that app's functionality\nright there on my taskbar.\n\n113\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.108\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so maybe I could increase\nmy social skills there okay.\n\n114\n00:06:37.108 --> 00:06:38.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's the idea anyway.\n\n115\n00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.620\n&gt;&gt; All right, but for now let's\ncontinue looking at computer stuff.\n\n116\n00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.160\nIf I go ahead and pull that contacts menu\nup again so we looked at our people.\n\n117\n00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.050\nSo I'm just going to remove them for\nright now.\n\n118\n00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.940\nMy gosh, I took the people\nout of my life [LAUGH] and\n\n119\n00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:59.310\nnow I'll pull up my\nWindows Ink Workspace option.\n\n120\n00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.410\nAnd it'll place it over here to the right.\n\n121\n00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.400\nIt's kind of small.\n\n122\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.700\nIt's like a really nice pen,\nlike a quill pin or\n\n123\n00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.100\na calligraphy pen or something over there.\n\n124\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.510\nWe'll go ahead and launch that, and\nreally just see what Windows Workspace is.\n\n125\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.740\nOops, let me zoom out so\nI can see what I'm doing here.\n\n126\n00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:22.680\nOkay, this is very reminiscent of the old\nschool sticky notes, that you could,\n\n127\n00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.840\nyou know, I haven't used sticky notes in,\nwell, digital sticky notes,\n\n128\n00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.530\nin a very long time, because we have so\nmany other options, nowadays.\n\n129\n00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.402\nBut it's really kind of cool and\nretro feely, I feel like, I don't know.\n\n130\n00:07:33.402 --> 00:07:37.831\n[LAUGH] And you could just say like,\n\n131\n00:07:37.831 --> 00:07:41.240\nremember to brush teeth.\n\n132\n00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.325\n&gt;&gt; This is where you put all\nof your passwords, right?\n\n133\n00:07:46.325 --> 00:07:47.333\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n134\n00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:48.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n135\n00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.220\n&gt;&gt; I'm kidding obviously, the old\njoke about how to the users like to\n\n136\n00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.560\npost note their passwords to the monitors.\n\n137\n00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.255\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But I've definitely used this for\n\n138\n00:07:56.255 --> 00:07:58.725\nlittle things that hey,\nI've gotta remember this, and\n\n139\n00:07:58.725 --> 00:08:00.122\nneed to do something in an hour.\n\n140\n00:08:00.122 --> 00:08:02.942\nLet me make a note,\nit's sitting right there on your desktop,\n\n141\n00:08:02.942 --> 00:08:05.086\nit's in front of you,\nyou just can't miss it.\n\n142\n00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:10.130\nYou can't minimize them and make then go\naway, so it is right there in your face.\n\n143\n00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.129\nAnd I've needed an IP address temporarily,\nso I'll throw that on there,\n\n144\n00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:15.154\nthings like that.\n\n145\n00:08:15.154 --> 00:08:17.680\nThat's really what I like using those for.\n\n146\n00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.240\nJust quick reminders that\nI'm not gonna keep, right?\n\n147\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.050\n&gt;&gt; You can change the color and\nmake them pretty.\n\n148\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.731\n&gt;&gt; You can,\nyou can get pretty fancy with them.\n\n149\n00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:26.554\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Anyways,\nwe won't go too much on that.\n\n150\n00:08:26.554 --> 00:08:30.520\nLet's take a look here at Sketchpad,\nso this is kind of cool.\n\n151\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.719\nAnd if I wanted to, I don't know,\ndraw something here just like it sounds,\n\n152\n00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:38.496\nI can literally make a little notation.\n\n153\n00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:43.330\nOr if I were really creative and\nartistic then I could integrate that a lot\n\n154\n00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.690\nmore because there are apps that\nyou can actually use with this and\n\n155\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.590\ndo really artistic things like\nwatercolors and so forth.\n\n156\n00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.439\nBut just know that that's\navailable there as well.\n\n157\n00:08:55.439 --> 00:09:00.000\nI think that this one's pretty\nuseful here for our screen sketch.\n\n158\n00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.297\nIt's very,\nin my opinion it reminds me of using our\n\n159\n00:09:05.297 --> 00:09:10.730\nlittle screenshot and\nediting abilities, right?\n\n160\n00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.060\nLike down here with our little scissors.\n\n161\n00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.111\nBut if I wanted to,\nmaybe I had a Word document pulled up, and\n\n162\n00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:22.300\nI wanted to quickly make notes or changes\nto a document or something like that.\n\n163\n00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.000\nHighlight a few things.\n\n164\n00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.820\nI have the ability to just take a quick\nscreenshot and then work with it there.\n\n165\n00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.064\nAnd then if I wanted to send it on\noff into my One Note or email or\n\n166\n00:09:32.064 --> 00:09:36.828\nsomething I have the ability to\neasily do that from this interface.\n\n167\n00:09:36.828 --> 00:09:41.632\nYeah, this is one that is great obviously\nin our position here at ITPro TV as very\n\n168\n00:09:41.632 --> 00:09:44.220\nhandy to be able to annotate screens.\n\n169\n00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.000\n&gt;&gt; Circle menu options,\nyou know when you're talking about it.\n\n170\n00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.707\nIt's a lot easier than saying okay,\nnow three options down, or\n\n171\n00:09:49.707 --> 00:09:53.940\nif you're collaborating with somebody and\nyou know it's very handy.\n\n172\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.352\nI like that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's pretty cool.\n\n173\n00:09:55.352 --> 00:09:55.872\nAll right,\n\n174\n00:09:55.872 --> 00:09:59.363\nI don't think there is anything else\ninteresting in that particular section.\n\n175\n00:09:59.363 --> 00:10:03.570\nLet's take a look,\nwhat do we have next here?\n\n176\n00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.790\nTouch keyboard.\n\n177\n00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.630\nWe're gonna be talking a little bit\nmore about accessibility options.\n\n178\n00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.860\nAnd this is something\nthat has been around for\n\n179\n00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.520\na very a long time,\nhaving that digital keyboard.\n\n180\n00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.185\nJust being able to have\noptions available to us.\n\n181\n00:10:22.185 --> 00:10:24.410\nI've been in situations where, for\n\n182\n00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.567\ninstance I have been trying\nto share my desktop, and\n\n183\n00:10:27.567 --> 00:10:32.550\nmy resolution was too large to get to the\nbottom of a window or something like that.\n\n184\n00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.720\nAnd my keyboard just\ncomes in handy to able or\n\n185\n00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.780\nin virtualization and things like that.\n\n186\n00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.480\nYou never know when\nthis may come in handy.\n\n187\n00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.564\nI've saved myself a couple of times.\n\n188\n00:10:41.564 --> 00:10:45.171\n&gt;&gt; And that's another reminder of how\nWindows is really designed to run on so\n\n189\n00:10:45.171 --> 00:10:46.577\nmany different platforms.\n\n190\n00:10:46.577 --> 00:10:48.371\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n&gt;&gt; That might not have a keyboard\n\n191\n00:10:48.371 --> 00:10:51.450\nbuilt into them, or\nif you've go into Tablet Mode.\n\n192\n00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.784\nOr using one of those convertibles\nwhere you fold the device up and\n\n193\n00:10:54.784 --> 00:10:56.910\nthe keyboard's on the bottom or inside.\n\n194\n00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.760\nHow do you type now, and\nthat makes it a lot easier.\n\n195\n00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it definitely does, Mike.\n\n196\n00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.656\nAll right, what else do we have here?\n\n197\n00:11:03.656 --> 00:11:07.533\nSo we have our keyboard button,\nour touchpad button,\n\n198\n00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:11.744\nand this is kind of hearkening\nto what we just said about that\n\n199\n00:11:11.744 --> 00:11:16.664\nkeyboard because we have the same\noption here now with the touchpad.\n\n200\n00:11:16.664 --> 00:11:21.535\nAnd I do think that if you have\na mobile device that this may help you\n\n201\n00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:23.320\nif that's your style.\n\n202\n00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.187\nIf you really like having a touchpad\nthere, well, you know what,\n\n203\n00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:30.100\nI can have a digital one\nright at your fingertips.\n\n204\n00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:30.660\nNo pun intended.\n\n205\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.510\n&gt;&gt; And I will just on the touchpad,\nyou get your two buttons there.\n\n206\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.240\n&gt;&gt; Your left click and\nyour right click, yeah.\n\n207\n00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.740\n&gt;&gt; And you can use your finger\nnow in your screen and-\n\n208\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could use your fingers so\n\n209\n00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.044\nit's pretty cool to be able\nto have that functionality in\n\n210\n00:11:42.044 --> 00:11:44.700\nour tablets that don't\nhave a real touchpad.\n\n211\n00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.140\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n212\n00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.677\n&gt;&gt; All right, what else we got here?\n\n213\n00:11:49.677 --> 00:11:54.430\nSo actually this is good that\nthese elements are grayed out.\n\n214\n00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:59.993\nHere, let me just zoom out a little bit so\nyou can, I'll try to pull it up over here.\n\n215\n00:11:59.993 --> 00:12:00.770\nOkay.\n\n216\n00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.150\nOops, we get all crazy with it.\n\n217\n00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.280\nGive me one second.\n\n218\n00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.738\nRight over those.\n\n219\n00:12:09.738 --> 00:12:13.489\nThey're grayed out, cascading the Windows,\nshowing the Windows stack and showing\n\n220\n00:12:13.489 --> 00:12:16.940\nthe Windows side by side, well, because\nI don't have any Windows pulled up.\n\n221\n00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.661\nSo I guess let's just go ahead and launch\na couple applications or something here.\n\n222\n00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:23.520\nWe'll pull up this alarm clock.\n\n223\n00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.450\nAnd what else?\n\n224\n00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.840\nWindows Home 3D.\n\n225\n00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.961\nAnd I'll do one more.\n\n226\n00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:34.110\nMaybe the scanner application.\n\n227\n00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.859\nSo now if I go ahead and\nI pull up my menu, my context menu again,\n\n228\n00:12:40.859 --> 00:12:43.720\nI have the ability to cascade the windows.\n\n229\n00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.900\nAnd you know,\nI did kind of stack them in a cascade.\n\n230\n00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.671\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say, yeah you should\nhave left one maximized there because you\n\n231\n00:12:49.671 --> 00:12:50.894\nkind of cascaded them yourself.\n\n232\n00:12:50.894 --> 00:12:57.976\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I already cascaded them so,\nokay so now, the magic of cascade, viola.\n\n233\n00:12:57.976 --> 00:13:02.010\n[LAUGH] Okay, and\nif I wanted to go ahead and\n\n234\n00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.940\nstack them, I have the ability to do so.\n\n235\n00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.988\nAnd I was, one thing that I love to do,\nI love to have my screen side by side,\n\n236\n00:13:10.988 --> 00:13:15.318\nI know we have the ability to have\nlike a four quadrant style now,\n\n237\n00:13:15.318 --> 00:13:19.330\nbut I really am just like that's my thing,\nright?\n\n238\n00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:25.860\nSo, whenever we see this option, side\nby side, we do have that ability here.\n\n239\n00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.080\nSo it's a little bit, you still have,\nlet me just say this.\n\n240\n00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.709\nYou still have the ability to use\nyour Windows key and your left and\n\n241\n00:13:33.709 --> 00:13:38.280\nright arrows to make them larger\nif you wanted to, like to snap.\n\n242\n00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.241\nSo that doesn't go away.\n\n243\n00:13:39.241 --> 00:13:43.017\nIt's just another way that you could\neasily work with the different windows\n\n244\n00:13:43.017 --> 00:13:46.027\nthat you have available to you\nright from the taskbar there.\n\n245\n00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.996\nAnd if I didn't wanna look at all these\napplications, and my boss is walking past,\n\n246\n00:13:51.996 --> 00:13:55.942\nand I don't want to see me shopping\nonline, I can just shut the desktop and,\n\n247\n00:13:55.942 --> 00:13:56.826\nnone the wiser.\n\n248\n00:13:56.826 --> 00:13:58.183\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully.\n\n249\n00:13:58.183 --> 00:14:00.670\n&gt;&gt; All right [LAUGH] and\nI won't be here tomorrow.\n\n250\n00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n251\n00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.490\n&gt;&gt; All right [LAUGH].\nWhat else do we have here?\n\n252\n00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.760\nOkay, Task Manager,\nlet's just put a pin in this one.\n\n253\n00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.659\nJust know that this is a very useful\nmonitoring amongst other thing,\n\n254\n00:14:12.659 --> 00:14:15.060\nutility that we have available.\n\n255\n00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.844\nBut we'll look at that in another episode,\njust know that you do in addition to your\n\n256\n00:14:18.844 --> 00:14:21.548\nkeyboard shortcuts have another\noption here to go ahead and\n\n257\n00:14:21.548 --> 00:14:22.755\nquickly launch that way.\n\n258\n00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:31.382\nThis is a good one here for locking the\ntaskbar, so we did talk about this before,\n\n259\n00:14:31.382 --> 00:14:35.896\nI'm not going to lock it now because I do\nwant to show you some different things\n\n260\n00:14:35.896 --> 00:14:37.820\nthat we have available.\n\n261\n00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.899\nBut if I wanted to resize my icons,\n\n262\n00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:44.491\nbecause in the last show we did talk\nabout those notifications that come up,\n\n263\n00:14:44.491 --> 00:14:48.890\nlike if I had my email application opened,\nand I got five emails sent in.\n\n264\n00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.516\nAnd I would see that badge\nwith the number five\n\n265\n00:14:52.516 --> 00:14:57.120\npop up on the icon if I were\nsitting in my taskbar, right?\n\n266\n00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.938\nUp to how many emails could I have,\nMike, before I cleared out on my badge?\n\n267\n00:15:02.938 --> 00:15:03.438\n&gt;&gt; 99.\n&gt;&gt; 99.\n\n268\n00:15:03.438 --> 00:15:04.990\nThat's right.\n\n269\n00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.999\n&gt;&gt; Pop quiz, I almost failed that one.\n\n270\n00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:11.184\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But if I go ahead and\nreduce the size of my icons,\n\n271\n00:15:11.184 --> 00:15:15.370\nthose badge notifications\nare not gonna be visible.\n\n272\n00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.530\nSo just keep that in mind\nif you are relying on them.\n\n273\n00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.519\nAnd then you shrink and\nthen you don't know what happened.\n\n274\n00:15:20.676 --> 00:15:21.763\nSo let's see.\n\n275\n00:15:24.582 --> 00:15:28.368\nAs a matter of fact, let's just pull\nup the taskbar settings there, and\n\n276\n00:15:28.368 --> 00:15:31.610\nwe'll take a look at a few more\nthings that we might want to do.\n\n277\n00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.186\nSo this is that same functionality there,\n\n278\n00:15:34.186 --> 00:15:37.870\nto lock the taskbar that\nwe were just looking at.\n\n279\n00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.130\nNow, automatically hiding\nthe taskbar in desktop mode,.\n\n280\n00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:45.278\nBecause we have the ability to use so\nmany different devices,\n\n281\n00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.547\nmaybe I want one system to\nbehave a certain way and\n\n282\n00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:52.800\nmaybe my mobile devices to behave\na certain way, or whatever.\n\n283\n00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.473\nIf I'm customer facing or\ninside facing, something like that.\n\n284\n00:15:56.473 --> 00:16:01.240\nSo just note you do have those options\nhere to actually hide or lock the taskbar.\n\n285\n00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:06.516\nThis is where you have that option to\nuse those smaller task Bar buttons, but\n\n286\n00:16:06.516 --> 00:16:11.803\nlike I said, don't rely on those badges\nif you do change this feature here.\n\n287\n00:16:11.803 --> 00:16:13.049\nOkay, we'll look at peek.\n\n288\n00:16:13.049 --> 00:16:15.119\nPeek is a cool one here.\n\n289\n00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:18.483\nPeek is going to provide us a preview\nof the desktop whenever you move your\n\n290\n00:16:18.483 --> 00:16:21.200\nmouse to show the desktop button\nat the end of the taskbar.\n\n291\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.219\nWe'll look at that in a second.\n\n292\n00:16:24.219 --> 00:16:25.357\nThis is also a cool one.\n\n293\n00:16:25.357 --> 00:16:31.273\nWhen we were looking at our start menu\nin a different show, I remember saying,\n\n294\n00:16:31.273 --> 00:16:36.760\nlook, it's cool that we have PowerShell\nright there from our start menu.\n\n295\n00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.972\nPowerShell hasn't always been\nin our start menu, right?\n\n296\n00:16:38.972 --> 00:16:43.797\nSo well I'm trying to think of like\nwhy I would utilize command prompt\n\n297\n00:16:43.797 --> 00:16:48.635\nmore than PowerShell, but\nI just can't find a good use case, Mike.\n\n298\n00:16:48.635 --> 00:16:51.889\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you really wanted to have\n\n299\n00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:56.685\ncommand, the CMD, CLI, and\nQuick Access in your Start menu,\n\n300\n00:16:56.685 --> 00:17:00.777\nthen this is where you would go ahead and\nchange that.\n\n301\n00:17:00.777 --> 00:17:05.112\nAll right, and you can disable those\nbadges here also, if you still wanted to\n\n302\n00:17:05.112 --> 00:17:09.264\nuse the larger icons just looking at\na couple of different settings here.\n\n303\n00:17:09.264 --> 00:17:12.663\nJust go ahead and play around with them,\nthere are all sorts of settings.\n\n304\n00:17:12.663 --> 00:17:16.476\nAnd this is kind of,\nI don't use it that often, but\n\n305\n00:17:16.476 --> 00:17:21.450\nsometimes like I said in certain\ngraphical limiting environments\n\n306\n00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.092\nwhenever you're trying\nto access something but\n\n307\n00:17:25.092 --> 00:17:29.645\nyou're trying to full screen or\nwhatever the reason maybe.\n\n308\n00:17:29.645 --> 00:17:32.983\nYou might wanna go ahead and\nmove your taskbar to the left, right, top,\n\n309\n00:17:32.983 --> 00:17:33.546\nor bottom.\n\n310\n00:17:33.546 --> 00:17:38.435\nJust know that you do have those\noptions if the taskbar is not locked,\n\n311\n00:17:38.435 --> 00:17:43.091\nor you have some sort of group\npolicy overriding these settings.\n\n312\n00:17:43.091 --> 00:17:48.018\nNormally, I try to keep them standard,\nespecially in a corporate environment.\n\n313\n00:17:48.018 --> 00:17:53.017\nOtherwise, it just makes for\ndifficult conversations for the help desk,\n\n314\n00:17:53.017 --> 00:17:58.570\nif they're trying to troubleshoot and\nyou don't know where anything is located,\n\n315\n00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.214\njust try to keep that uniform setting.\n\n316\n00:18:01.214 --> 00:18:06.154\nCombined taskbar buttons, so\nthis is kind of interesting here.\n\n317\n00:18:06.154 --> 00:18:09.426\nSo Mike was talking about this earlier,\n\n318\n00:18:09.426 --> 00:18:15.210\nif I have too many icons in my taskbar\nhere, and they're getting full.\n\n319\n00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.788\nIf I have an application running,\nand there\n\n320\n00:18:17.788 --> 00:18:22.471\nare a lot of the different files open for\nthat attached to that one application.\n\n321\n00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:27.257\nWhat this will do is combine or kind of\nbundle them together to just show that one\n\n322\n00:18:27.257 --> 00:18:31.030\nicon, instead of having multiple\nareas in File Explorer, or\n\n323\n00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:35.549\nmultiple pages in Chrome, or\nwhatever windows that you might have open.\n\n324\n00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:37.776\nSo it just kind of concatenates those.\n\n325\n00:18:37.776 --> 00:18:42.404\nAlternatively, somewhere\nyou do have the option.\n\n326\n00:18:42.404 --> 00:18:43.781\nIt might be in here too.\n\n327\n00:18:43.781 --> 00:18:45.349\nUse a scroll bar, so\n\n328\n00:18:45.349 --> 00:18:50.429\nmaybe you had 46 different icons\nin your taskbar or something.\n\n329\n00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:53.848\nAnd you wanted to keep them all there,\nbut you wanted to scroll through them,\n\n330\n00:18:53.848 --> 00:18:55.696\nthen you could use the little wires also.\n\n331\n00:18:55.696 --> 00:19:00.658\nJust a few more settings here for\nmultiple displays.\n\n332\n00:19:00.658 --> 00:19:06.167\nI'm kind of curious about this,\ndo you use your taskbar multiple displays?\n\n333\n00:19:06.167 --> 00:19:10.897\nBecause I do and that wasn't always\na feature that we had to be able to have\n\n334\n00:19:10.897 --> 00:19:14.866\ndifferent things going on with\nexternal monitors, right?\n\n335\n00:19:14.866 --> 00:19:15.669\nWhat do you think?\n\n336\n00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:18.642\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've gotten used to\nhaving my taskbar on multiples.\n\n337\n00:19:18.642 --> 00:19:19.342\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n338\n00:19:19.342 --> 00:19:23.985\n&gt;&gt; Absolutley, cuz with larger monitors,\nit's too much work to drag my mouse all\n\n339\n00:19:23.985 --> 00:19:25.087\nthe-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n340\n00:19:25.087 --> 00:19:25.742\n&gt;&gt; Way back down, right?\n\n341\n00:19:25.742 --> 00:19:28.766\nSo it's very convenient, that the fact\nthat the taskbar is right there and\n\n342\n00:19:28.766 --> 00:19:31.310\nI can launch an application up\non that second or third monitor.\n\n343\n00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.804\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I definitely think so too.\n\n344\n00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:37.098\nAnd when you get spoiled and\nyou forget about all the things-\n\n345\n00:19:37.098 --> 00:19:37.719\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n346\n00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:38.457\n&gt;&gt; That you didn't have in the past.\n\n347\n00:19:38.457 --> 00:19:40.976\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We already looked at people, so\n\n348\n00:19:40.976 --> 00:19:43.885\nI won't go too in depth there,\nwe'll get out of here.\n\n349\n00:19:43.885 --> 00:19:47.520\nAnd I'm trying to think,\nwhat else do we have?\n\n350\n00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.018\nLocking the taskbar, this just brings\nus up to those Taskbar settings there.\n\n351\n00:19:51.018 --> 00:19:55.008\nI don't know why I went the long way,\nbecause that's what taskbar is really here\n\n352\n00:19:55.008 --> 00:19:58.484\nfor, is to make things easier for us,\nand I went about it the long way.\n\n353\n00:19:58.484 --> 00:20:02.419\nI don't think there's anything\nelse we have to cover,\n\n354\n00:20:02.419 --> 00:20:07.105\nI mean we have our normal, I say\nnormal but hell on me just zoom it and\n\n355\n00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:10.224\nsee if we can take a look\nat a normal default.\n\n356\n00:20:10.224 --> 00:20:16.700\nIf we can go full screen for one moment,\ndefault layout of a taskbar here.\n\n357\n00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.020\nI didn't say I will do the peek a boo too.\n\n358\n00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:23.022\nThis one, it's kind of hard to see,\nand it's a very,\n\n359\n00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:28.338\nvery small thin vertical line,\nall the way to the right of your taskbar.\n\n360\n00:20:28.338 --> 00:20:30.229\nAnd let me zoom out for a moment,\n\n361\n00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:35.010\njust notice that my cursor is way over\nhere in the far right-hand bottom corner.\n\n362\n00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:39.905\nIf I hover my mouse over that, that's what\nthat peek a boo option was that we were\n\n363\n00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:42.552\nlooking at under our Settings menu there.\n\n364\n00:20:42.552 --> 00:20:48.397\nSo maybe this would be a better,\nhiding my shopping button, Mike.\n\n365\n00:20:48.397 --> 00:20:49.506\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n366\n00:20:49.506 --> 00:20:52.122\nmight just slam your mouse down\ninto the bottom corner there.\n\n367\n00:20:52.122 --> 00:20:53.514\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let it rest there for a second.\n\n368\n00:20:53.514 --> 00:20:56.567\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a Windows 8esque.\n\n369\n00:20:56.567 --> 00:20:59.913\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, honestly,\nI never use that feature.\n\n370\n00:20:59.913 --> 00:21:00.541\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n371\n00:21:00.541 --> 00:21:02.278\n&gt;&gt; But for some people,\nmaybe that's their forte.\n\n372\n00:21:02.278 --> 00:21:03.814\n&gt;&gt; I have not either,\nI will be honest with you.\n\n373\n00:21:03.814 --> 00:21:06.088\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Becaue as soon as you move away from\n\n374\n00:21:06.088 --> 00:21:07.938\nit, all of your other windows pop back up.\n\n375\n00:21:07.938 --> 00:21:08.557\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n376\n00:21:08.557 --> 00:21:10.091\n&gt;&gt; It's not like it leaves\nyour desktop visible.\n\n377\n00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:14.071\nAnd I didn't really ever have anything\non my desktop other than icons that I\n\n378\n00:21:14.071 --> 00:21:15.785\nwould need to see temporarily.\n\n379\n00:21:15.785 --> 00:21:16.391\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n380\n00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:18.855\n&gt;&gt; So that one for me doen't do\na whole lot, but some people might.\n\n381\n00:21:18.855 --> 00:21:20.879\nI will tell you one that you\ndidn't show that I kind of like-\n\n382\n00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:21.663\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n383\n00:21:21.663 --> 00:21:22.301\n&gt;&gt; Occassionally is-\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n384\n00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:24.492\ncuz I was worried about\nforgetting things in the show.\n\n385\n00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:28.108\n&gt;&gt; I've re-sized my taskbar where you\ncan drag the taskbar up a little bit.\n\n386\n00:21:28.108 --> 00:21:32.160\nAnd like I said,\nI love pinning icons to my taskbar, and so\n\n387\n00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.161\nthat gives you another row.\n\n388\n00:21:34.161 --> 00:21:35.283\n&gt;&gt; Whoa, how big can we go?\n\n389\n00:21:35.283 --> 00:21:38.158\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can get extreme and you can go all\n\n390\n00:21:38.158 --> 00:21:41.781\nurkel esque on it and pull your pants\nall the way up to your belly button.\n\n391\n00:21:41.781 --> 00:21:44.212\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But by pulling it up one,\n\n392\n00:21:44.212 --> 00:21:46.411\nit does make the clock-\n&gt;&gt; A little bit, yeah.\n\n393\n00:21:46.411 --> 00:21:49.861\n&gt;&gt; How you a fuller date format and it\ngives you another row for taskbar buttons.\n\n394\n00:21:49.861 --> 00:21:53.077\n&gt;&gt; If you can get your mouse in the right\nspot with those double arrows there.\n\n395\n00:21:53.077 --> 00:21:54.088\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n396\n00:21:54.088 --> 00:21:57.114\non high resolution monitors,\nyou are not losing that much real estate,\n\n397\n00:21:57.114 --> 00:21:59.610\nalthough I will say that I have\ngone back to a single row now.\n\n398\n00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.512\nI just never could get used to it, but\nit was a cool option for some people.\n\n399\n00:22:02.512 --> 00:22:06.356\n&gt;&gt; That is another option, if you wanted\nto have some extra real estate there\n\n400\n00:22:06.356 --> 00:22:08.155\nwithout using those scroll bars.\n\n401\n00:22:08.155 --> 00:22:10.736\nSo like Mike was saying,\nwith the clock right here,\n\n402\n00:22:10.736 --> 00:22:13.033\nwe do have the ability\nto access that quickly.\n\n403\n00:22:13.033 --> 00:22:19.913\nAnd then there's one other little\nsections are up carrot here.\n\n404\n00:22:19.913 --> 00:22:23.171\nAnd of course, we do have things like\nour volume controls and so forth.\n\n405\n00:22:23.171 --> 00:22:25.446\nThe speakers,\nif you just right click on these icons.\n\n406\n00:22:25.446 --> 00:22:28.643\nAnd I definitely suggest you\nlooking at each one of these,\n\n407\n00:22:28.643 --> 00:22:31.458\nbecause there's so\nmany things that you could do.\n\n408\n00:22:31.458 --> 00:22:35.342\nI won't be able to get through all of\nthem in this show, but you could easily\n\n409\n00:22:35.342 --> 00:22:39.659\ntroubleshoot any kind of audio issues that\nyou may be having, networking issues by\n\n410\n00:22:39.659 --> 00:22:43.134\nright clicking to launch your\nNetwork &amp; Sharing Center, right?\n\n411\n00:22:43.134 --> 00:22:49.720\nSo real quick easy acess or\neasy elements right here, go ahead.\n\n412\n00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.890\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say another one that I\nreally like is controlling what icons\n\n413\n00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.566\nare down there in that taskbar area.\n\n414\n00:22:54.566 --> 00:22:56.276\nBut you can get it from\nyour taskbar settings.\n\n415\n00:22:56.276 --> 00:22:56.895\n&gt;&gt; From the settings?\n\n416\n00:22:56.895 --> 00:22:57.656\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure of that.\n\n417\n00:22:57.656 --> 00:23:00.019\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that one was, all right.\n\n418\n00:23:00.019 --> 00:23:03.335\nOops, let me just do it the way\nI showed you guys here.\n\n419\n00:23:03.335 --> 00:23:05.070\nTaskbar settings, all right.\n\n420\n00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.543\nAnd let's see, Customize taskbar.\n\n421\n00:23:08.543 --> 00:23:09.140\nIs it right here, Mike?\n\n422\n00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.117\n&gt;&gt; Notification area, right below that.\n\n423\n00:23:11.117 --> 00:23:13.201\n&gt;&gt; Yep, this will just take\nus to a help page there.\n\n424\n00:23:13.201 --> 00:23:17.363\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] Select what icons appear,\nand then those system icons as well.\n\n425\n00:23:17.363 --> 00:23:19.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you didn't want to\nsee them for whatever reason.\n\n426\n00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.115\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you don't wanna see the\ndropbox icon all the time, or whether or\n\n427\n00:23:24.115 --> 00:23:28.835\nnot a USB devices plugged in or maybe you\ndon't use that to control your volume.\n\n428\n00:23:28.835 --> 00:23:31.532\nIt's taking up space, so I can hide\nthat volume icon and things like that.\n\n429\n00:23:31.532 --> 00:23:36.539\n&gt;&gt; Right, cool, and then, yeah,\njust that last one here for the.\n\n430\n00:23:36.539 --> 00:23:40.871\nI thnk this one's important just because\nI know I utilize this quite often, and\n\n431\n00:23:40.871 --> 00:23:44.439\nthese are just even specific to my\nsystem here for the Dell Audio.\n\n432\n00:23:44.439 --> 00:23:49.670\nAnd then I have my actual trackpad or\ntouchpad right here, Bluetooth,\n\n433\n00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:55.527\naccessing my power options as well, so\njust running through a couple of these.\n\n434\n00:23:55.527 --> 00:24:00.315\nAlso, if you had any kind of\nexternal devices, media plugged in,\n\n435\n00:24:00.315 --> 00:24:02.718\nthis is where you would go ahead.\n\n436\n00:24:02.718 --> 00:24:08.157\nAnd then hover over that external device\nlike a flash drive or something and\n\n437\n00:24:08.157 --> 00:24:13.268\nthen right-click and then select\neject to properly eject that disk.\n\n438\n00:24:13.268 --> 00:24:16.302\nSo that you don't find yourself\nwith any kind of file corruption or\n\n439\n00:24:16.302 --> 00:24:17.338\nsomething like that.\n\n440\n00:24:17.338 --> 00:24:23.348\nSo that will be right there under\nthat up arrow, and taskbar, yeah.\n\n441\n00:24:23.348 --> 00:24:24.281\nI think that's it.\n\n442\n00:24:24.281 --> 00:24:25.623\nBut there's-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n443\n00:24:25.623 --> 00:24:27.397\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure I'm missing quite a bit, so\n\n444\n00:24:27.397 --> 00:24:30.564\nI really want you to just go through\nthere and comb through all that.\n\n445\n00:24:30.564 --> 00:24:31.905\n&gt;&gt;

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:06.132 --> 00:00:07.289\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:08.346\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.346 --> 00:00:10.520\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.693\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:18.765\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\ntoday we are installing and\n\n8\n00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:22.920\nconfiguring Windows 10,\npreparing for that 70-698 exam.\n\n9\n00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.510\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at accessibility options, and\n\n10\n00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.070\neverybody's favorite assistant, Cortana.\n\n11\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.170\nAnd here to help as for\nthat is none other than Cherokee Boose.\n\n12\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.825\nWelcome, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:31.825 --> 00:00:33.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank for having me, Mike.\n\n14\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.590\nHow are you?\n\n15\n00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.070\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, excited to\nsee what you've got for us today.\n\n16\n00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so talking about accessibility\noptions, this is pretty cool because it\n\n17\n00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.810\nreally is a way that people\ncan use different devices and\n\n18\n00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.930\nwork within the operating system in\nways that were not available before,\n\n19\n00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.680\nand it's just evolving continuously.\n\n20\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.874\nAnd we'll look at some really cool stuff\nthat's also on the forefront as well.\n\n21\n00:00:57.874 --> 00:00:59.281\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n22\n00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:01.004\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty exciting.\n\n23\n00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:03.910\nLet's first take a look at\nsomething called Narrator.\n\n24\n00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.607\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\nof course, you could go ahead and\n\n25\n00:01:07.607 --> 00:01:12.184\nhit the Windows key and I to bring up your\nsettings and then navigate that way, but\n\n26\n00:01:12.184 --> 00:01:17.071\nthere's also a shortcut to get to Ease of\nAccess for our Accessibility options here.\n\n27\n00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:20.769\nSo if you hit the Windows key plus U,\nthat will bring you up\n\n28\n00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:25.103\nto your Accessibility options,\nyour Ease of Access Center here.\n\n29\n00:01:25.103 --> 00:01:29.250\nSo the first think I wanna\ntake a look at is Narrator.\n\n30\n00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.970\nNarrator is pretty cool because it is a\nscreen reader that reads all the elements\n\n31\n00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.890\non the screen, like our texts and buttons.\n\n32\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.330\nAnd I think I have a page pulled up here,\nyeah.\n\n33\n00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.310\nSo this is what I said about, we're\nseeing it here in the operating system,\n\n34\n00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.060\nbut just know that this is a developing\ntechnology, and there's an intelligence\n\n35\n00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.630\nAPI, and we're probably gonna be seeing\na lot more of this in the future.\n\n36\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.530\nThis guy right here,\nhe is a software developer for Microsoft,\n\n37\n00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.960\nhis name is Saqib.\n\n38\n00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.360\nAnd he's wearing these pivot head glasses,\n\n39\n00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.080\nso he's actually taking this\nnarrator concept into real life.\n\n40\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.900\nAnd I was actually out visiting with\none of our friends in the chat there,\n\n41\n00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.450\nMike Stevens,\nat Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, and\n\n42\n00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.870\nsome of the technologies that\nI saw there were so cool.\n\n43\n00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.640\nYou'd walk in front of a camera and\nit'd be able to detect your age.\n\n44\n00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.000\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.160\n&gt;&gt; Number one, and\n\n46\n00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.560\nthen also it would just assume\nthings like gender and emotion, so\n\n47\n00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.460\nit would be able to tell what\nkind of attitude you were in.\n\n48\n00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.971\nSo with those pivot head glasses and\nother devices like smartphones,\n\n49\n00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:39.260\nSaqib was able to create\nan app that would allow\n\n50\n00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.070\nvision impaired individuals\nto be able to interact in and\n\n51\n00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.040\nbe able to know what was on menus\nat restaurants by using the phone.\n\n52\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.380\nAnd it's pretty cool, it'll even\nhelp guide the camera to the phone,\n\n53\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.520\nto the actual menu, to the text,\nand then read that aloud for you.\n\n54\n00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.860\nSo really cool stuff going on with,\nand here are those glasses there.\n\n55\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.406\nYou can see there's like a little camera,\nand that's what'll be\n\n56\n00:03:05.406 --> 00:03:09.080\nable to find that information for\nyou, and this is pretty cool.\n\n57\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.940\n&gt;&gt; Mm, very cool.\n\n58\n00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so how does that\nintegrate with Windows 10 here?\n\n59\n00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.270\nWell, you can go ahead and\n\n60\n00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.090\nturn Narrator on through\nthe toggle switch here in the UI.\n\n61\n00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.270\nThere are also keyboard shortcuts, and\n\n62\n00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.720\nthat's something that\nI wanna stress to you.\n\n63\n00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.120\nAnd I know I've been talking about this\na lot, but anytime we have a mouse click\n\n64\n00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.750\nfeature, there's usually going to\nbe an associated keyboard shortcut\n\n65\n00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.410\nto match that same function,\nas well as touch combination.\n\n66\n00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.360\nSo I think the most\nimportant keys to know,\n\n67\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.280\nor ways to work with Narrator,\nnumber one, to turn it on.\n\n68\n00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.320\nAnd I think even more importantly\nwould be number two, to turn it off.\n\n69\n00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because Narrator can get loud and\n\n70\n00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.680\nit does its job,\nit will read everything to you.\n\n71\n00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.200\nSo if you are like, my gosh,\nhow do I turn this off?\n\n72\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.595\nWell, that's gonna be Cap Locks, Esc.\n\n73\n00:03:58.595 --> 00:04:00.360\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n74\n00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.350\n&gt;&gt; Number one, right there.\n\n75\n00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.230\nAll right, to go ahead and launch it,\nI could turn this on right here.\n\n76\n00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.090\nAlternatively, and I'm just turning\nit off again so you can see that.\n\n77\n00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.010\nBut the keyboard shortcut here is\ngonna be Windows key, Ctrl, and Enter.\n\n78\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.550\nSo if I hit, and I'll take my mouse\noff of here so you can see that.\n\n79\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.570\nWindows key, Ctrl, and\nEnter to now turn on Narrator.\n\n80\n00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.142\nNotice that blue box around that toggle\nswitch, so it's actually explaining that.\n\n81\n00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.862\nLet me, I have my volume muted,\nlet me turn my volume on so\n\n82\n00:04:29.862 --> 00:04:32.385\nyou guys can kind of see\nwhat we're looking at here.\n\n83\n00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:39.397\n&gt;&gt; Unchecked, Settings,\n\n84\n00:04:39.397 --> 00:04:45.140\nsearch box, find a setting, editing,\nitem described by find a setting.\n\n85\n00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.020\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that it's explaining\nto me what we're looking at\n\n86\n00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.120\nhere in that blue box.\n\n87\n00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.639\nAnd then for instance, if I wanted to,\n\n88\n00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.502\nI'm just hitting the Tab key to kind\nof tab through some of these options.\n\n89\n00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:55.064\n&gt;&gt; System one of 13.\n\n90\n00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.120\nSearch box, find a setting,\nediting, down arrow,\n\n91\n00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.260\nsearch box, find a setting, editing,\nBluetooth and other devices-.\n\n92\n00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.301\n&gt;&gt; I got a little click happy.\n\n93\n00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:09.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I think you guys see the point.\n\n94\n00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.150\nSo it'll go through and\nread you these options.\n\n95\n00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.999\nI'm just gonna go ahead and [CROSSTALK].\n\n96\n00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:18.070\n&gt;&gt; HDTV s slash,\nHDTV s slash, slash, w, w.\n\n97\n00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.871\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] In this where we say you really\nneed to know that keyboard shortcut for\n\n98\n00:05:20.871 --> 00:05:21.504\nturning it off.\n\n99\n00:05:21.504 --> 00:05:23.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Caps Lock, Esc there.\n\n100\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.570\nAnd so again,\n\n101\n00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.310\nlike I said, with the tap functions,\nI think it's single tap with two fingers.\n\n102\n00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.860\nLet me just see here, that's gonna be tap\nonce with two fingers to stop the reading.\n\n103\n00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.370\nSo if you're on a touch-enabled device,\nthat would be the alternative for\n\n104\n00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.190\nthat one right there.\n\n105\n00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.379\nAll right, let me just go back.\n\n106\n00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.200\n[COUGH] I think we were there.\n\n107\n00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.800\nAnd like I said,\nif you wanted to go ahead and\n\n108\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.100\naccess that here from the main settings\nmenu right above my head there, this is\n\n109\n00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.240\nwhere we got to that page originally for\nthe Ease of Access right here.\n\n110\n00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.340\nSo we'll just go back there.\n\n111\n00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.070\nYou do have the ability to start\nNarrator automatically, and\n\n112\n00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.550\nthen we also can choose\ndifferent types of voices.\n\n113\n00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.830\nWhat you just heard was David.\n\n114\n00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.350\nDavid, there is another gentleman\nnamed Mark, and then also Zira.\n\n115\n00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.920\nSo just know that you do have some options\nthere, and specifics as far as hitch and\n\n116\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.328\nspeed in any kind of annotation pauses as\nwell to really customize that for you.\n\n117\n00:06:23.328 --> 00:06:25.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n118\n00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.130\nwhat else do we have going on here?\n\n119\n00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.900\nJust a lot of settings.\n\n120\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.840\nAnd my bar is still there.\n\n121\n00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.920\nLet me turn that off, so we can continue.\n\n122\n00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.020\nThe next thing I wanna\ntalk about is Magnifier.\n\n123\n00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.590\nSo this is going to, and it's kind of\ninteresting, Microsoft has about like\n\n124\n00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.160\nthree different categories where they\nreally look at hearing impaired,\n\n125\n00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.720\nvision impaired, and mobility impaired.\n\n126\n00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.440\nSo that's why we have these different\ntypes of categories to hopefully\n\n127\n00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.930\nassist with those any\nkind of obstacles there.\n\n128\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.670\nSo with Magnifier,\nthis one's going to be Windows key plus or\n\n129\n00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.740\nminus button to zoom in, or zoom out.\n\n130\n00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.630\nYou guys probably have seen me\nuse this here within the show.\n\n131\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.740\nAnd let me just minimize and\nlook at something a little bit smaller.\n\n132\n00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.730\nSo Windows key plus to go ahead and\nzoom in, and\n\n133\n00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.440\nreally there's nothing to look at there.\n\n134\n00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.128\nBut wherever your mouse is,\nso for example if\n\n135\n00:07:20.128 --> 00:07:25.030\nI put it on top of this text document and\nzoom in, that's where that focus will be.\n\n136\n00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.070\nAnd then you can zoom out that way.\n\n137\n00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.551\nOr if I zoom in really close and\nI wanted to quickly get out of that,\n\n138\n00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:34.322\nthen I would go ahead and\ndo my Windows and\n\n139\n00:07:34.322 --> 00:07:38.829\nEsc key to bring me back to back\nto full screen there really quick.\n\n140\n00:07:38.829 --> 00:07:44.358\nAll right, another type of vision\nassist that we see here is going to be,\n\n141\n00:07:44.358 --> 00:07:48.390\nso that was Magnifier with\nthe keyboard shortcuts.\n\n142\n00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.556\nBut you also have the ability to turn\nit on here in the interface as well.\n\n143\n00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:56.730\nAnd really select your different\nzoom options and so forth there.\n\n144\n00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.754\nAnd look, keyboard shortcuts.\n\n145\n00:07:59.754 --> 00:08:05.080\nAnd that's one thing that I keep\nstressing, but it's really important.\n\n146\n00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.790\nAnd we'll take a look at keyboard\nshortcuts are actually an accessibility\n\n147\n00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.110\nfeature as well.\n\n148\n00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.470\nJust to give you that enhanced mobility.\n\n149\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.910\nColor and high contrast,\nwe've seen this a little bit\n\n150\n00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.590\nbefore when we were looking at\nour colors and our settings.\n\n151\n00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.900\nBut just know that again this is an option\nthat you have available especially for\n\n152\n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.710\nanyone with nay kind of\ncontrast sensitivity.\n\n153\n00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.360\nYou can go ahead and apply color filters.\n\n154\n00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.840\nThere's also keyboard shortcuts for\nthis as well.\n\n155\n00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.350\nFor the high contrast,\nit's going to be your left Alt key,\n\n156\n00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.540\nas well as your left Shift,\nas well as print screen.\n\n157\n00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.160\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n158\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.460\nAnd I will use our other accessibility\noption to zoom in, so we can see that.\n\n159\n00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.630\nAnd it says,\ndo you want to turn on high contrast.\n\n160\n00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.070\nAnd it will give you that keyboard\nshortcut that I just explained to you.\n\n161\n00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.360\nSo when we hit yes, notice the screen.\n\n162\n00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.190\nAlright, we'll zoom out.\n\n163\n00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.500\nAnd if you use that\ncombination of keys again,\n\n164\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.720\nit'll automatically revert\nto the previous setting.\n\n165\n00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.700\nSo if we say left alt,\nleft shift, print screen.\n\n166\n00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.110\nAnd it goes back to normal there.\n\n167\n00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.320\nSo just keeping that in mind.\n\n168\n00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:19.090\nThe next thing I wanna take\na look at here's closed captions.\n\n169\n00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:24.198\nSo, the developers at Microsoft use\na programming language called XAML and\n\n170\n00:09:24.198 --> 00:09:25.856\nit;s X-A-M-L.\n\n171\n00:09:25.856 --> 00:09:29.060\n[LAUGH] I think about that for\na second, yeah.\n\n172\n00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.600\nIt's not with the Z, it's with an X.\n\n173\n00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.800\nBut they take and\nleverage any kind of like video stream.\n\n174\n00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.050\nAnd if those closed captions are all\nready existing, then it can pull that.\n\n175\n00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.520\nAnd leverage it in for any kind of app or\n\n176\n00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.020\ntool as long as you know\nthe developer's writing that app.\n\n177\n00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.330\nOr taking advantage of those\nclosed caption options.\n\n178\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.670\nSo here in the operating system\nyou have the ability to change\n\n179\n00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.880\nyour default colors and\ntransparency and size and so forth.\n\n180\n00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.350\nAgain, just another way to assist with\nany kind of hearing impairment as well.\n\n181\n00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.692\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, keyboard.\n\n182\n00:10:05.692 --> 00:10:10.400\nThere are a lot of different options\nhere with sticky keys, toggle keys,\n\n183\n00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.880\nfilter keys, and your keyboard.\n\n184\n00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:17.580\nI think it's pretty cool how\nthe developers at Microsoft have really\n\n185\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.700\nthought about and worked with\npeople who do have disabilities.\n\n186\n00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.050\nAnd how they can help them.\n\n187\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.060\nAnd we'll see that being integrated\nin a lot of different ways.\n\n188\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.790\nLet's just go ahead and\npull up like Word for instance.\n\n189\n00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:38.090\nAnd then maybe, let's see here.\n\n190\n00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.400\nWe'll pull up XAML since\nI was talking about that.\n\n191\n00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.320\nIt's pretty cool if you take\na look at all the different\n\n192\n00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.720\nframeworks that they use here.\n\n193\n00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.390\nBut let's go take a look at these two.\n\n194\n00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.240\nThe different.\n\n195\n00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.360\nThey're different functions\nthat a particular keyboard\n\n196\n00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.710\ncombination will create.\n\n197\n00:10:54.710 --> 00:11:00.490\nSo if I use my alt key and the f button.\n\n198\n00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.290\nSo if I say alt f.\n\n199\n00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.050\nAnd depending on where I'm clicking.\n\n200\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:08.970\nSo if I'm in a Word document here,\nand I use alt F, it'll bring up.\n\n201\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.253\nOops, let me do that again.\n\n202\n00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:18.190\nOkay I don't know if you can see that.\n\n203\n00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.220\nIf I click some more into\nzoom it's gonna go away.\n\n204\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:26.480\nBut on the left hand side if you see those\nletters for info new open save save as.\n\n205\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.600\nSo forth If you then hit the corresponding\nletter on your keyboard,\n\n206\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.020\nit'll execute that function.\n\n207\n00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.600\nSo that was Alt-F.\n\n208\n00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.830\nAnd you can see how it behaves\nhere in Microsoft Word.\n\n209\n00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.330\nAnd it's pretty cool.\n\n210\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.350\nSo if I hit n,\nit'll bring up a new document there.\n\n211\n00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.150\nAnd then it gives me the option to all\nthat functionality that we take for\n\n212\n00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.210\ngranted here in the UI with clicking or\ntouching.\n\n213\n00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:54.260\nWe do see how they've leveraged our\naccessibility options here with XAML\n\n214\n00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.320\nto make a really cool feature.\n\n215\n00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.116\nSo, again, L for blank document,\nand there we go.\n\n216\n00:12:00.116 --> 00:12:01.640\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n217\n00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:07.940\n&gt;&gt; In, you know, our browser here,\nin Chrome, I can also use.\n\n218\n00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.780\nAnd you can see how Chrome has\nadopted this concept as well.\n\n219\n00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.020\nI can again hit that Alt-F key.\n\n220\n00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.200\nAnd it will bring up my options here for\n\n221\n00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.320\nthis context menu over on the right\nhand side to allow for that as well.\n\n222\n00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.450\nSo I'll go ahead and close that up here.\n\n223\n00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:23.480\nWhat else do we have.\n\n224\n00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.100\nWe have mouse options as well.\n\n225\n00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.040\nJust remember, we did see in the other\nshow where we had a key board short cut\n\n226\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.840\nfor that track pad on our screen if\nyour device does have a track pad.\n\n227\n00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.100\nAnd then you have options to increase\nfont size, color, and so forth.\n\n228\n00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.810\nFor those mouse keys just to make\nsure you're able to find the mouse.\n\n229\n00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.050\nWhich sometimes I have that problem too.\n\n230\n00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.600\nThis is a really cool one here.\n\n231\n00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.540\nSo if we just hit Windows\nkey s to begin a search.\n\n232\n00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.470\nAnd I type in Windows Speech recognition,\n\n233\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.350\nyou'll see this come on,\ncome up in a search.\n\n234\n00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:01.060\nWe'll go ahead and click that, and let\nme make sure that my volume is on here.\n\n235\n00:13:02.357 --> 00:13:04.090\nFunction, all right.\n\n236\n00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.490\nI haven't set this up yet.\n\n237\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.600\nBut I do wanna take some time\nto show you how this works.\n\n238\n00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:17.520\nSo what we're doing is just allowing the\noperating system to be able to hear me.\n\n239\n00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.420\nSo we've talked about security\nfrom a particular standpoint.\n\n240\n00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.570\nBut if Your functionality\nis more important and\n\n241\n00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.700\nyou wanted to go ahead and use that.\n\n242\n00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.690\nThen you do have that option here.\n\n243\n00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.110\nSo we are just going to\nuse my desktop microphone.\n\n244\n00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.710\nAnd I'm just clicking next here,\nit is pretty explanatory for this wizard.\n\n245\n00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.610\nOkay, its listening to me right now.\n\n246\n00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.420\nSo now I'm going to be like.\n\n247\n00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.440\nMessing with the actual quotation portion.\n\n248\n00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.490\nYou're supposed to read this line,\nit says, Peter dictates to his computer.\n\n249\n00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:52.400\nHe prefers it to typing and particularly\nprefers it to pen and ink and paper.\n\n250\n00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.350\nSo I think they're testing\na lot of those close ups there.\n\n251\n00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.500\nAnd supposedly when you're\nfinished you hit next.\n\n252\n00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.530\nAnd now it's going to be all crazy.\n\n253\n00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.730\nEnable Document Review.\n\n254\n00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:10.090\nSo, with Windows Speech Recognition,\nit'll work with you to hear your commands.\n\n255\n00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.980\nAnd even read you your email and\nthings like that.\n\n256\n00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.820\nYou can enable or disable that,\nso we'll just hit Enable for now,\n\n257\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.480\nand then continue through that.\n\n258\n00:14:20.435 --> 00:14:25.900\n]BLAND_AUDIO] And\n\n259\n00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.037\nwe're gonna skip the tutorial for now.\n\n260\n00:14:31.044 --> 00:14:31.672\n&gt;&gt; Now it's listening.\n\n261\n00:14:31.672 --> 00:14:34.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hold on, let me make sure.\n\n262\n00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.056\nOkay, show numbers.\n\n263\n00:14:40.581 --> 00:14:41.411\nTen.\n\n264\n00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:50.640\nOkay, do that's one way and\nit'll expand on those numbers.\n\n265\n00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.280\nSo if there's a sub menu and\nI say show numbers.\n\n266\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.150\nAnd you select the number that\narea that you want to look at.\n\n267\n00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.190\nThere really wasn't anything\ninteresting there with ten.\n\n268\n00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:02.360\nI didn't pick a good one, but here let's\ndo it again if we look at something else.\n\n269\n00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.460\nShow numbers 15, okay.\n\n270\n00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.980\n&gt;&gt; So when you say\n\n271\n00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.570\nshow numbers it's putting a number on\neveryhting you could potentially click on.\n\n272\n00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then by saying\n\n273\n00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.070\nthat number it's like you clicking on it.\n\n274\n00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah cuz we're in this\nmagnifier setting options.\n\n275\n00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.780\nAnd we were just in the other options\nthere looking at something different.\n\n276\n00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.290\nSo it's pretty cool for\n\n277\n00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:26.780\nthose mobility accessibility features\nthat they have available there.\n\n278\n00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.990\nAll right, what else do we have here?\n\n279\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.940\nSo we've looked at speech recognition.\n\n280\n00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.040\nLet's talk about Cortana for\na moment.Mike?\n\n281\n00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.130\nCortana?\n\n282\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.010\n&gt;&gt; Cortana, for\n\n283\n00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.870\nyou southern people here in the U.S.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n284\n00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:46.020\nCortana is going to be\nour AI assistant here.\n\n285\n00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:50.735\nAnd she's actually pretty cool,\nlet me go to her settings here.\n\n286\n00:15:50.735 --> 00:15:55.740\nSo if we go back here to our,\nI think it's under Home.\n\n287\n00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.307\nI can't remember exactly where she lives.\n\n288\n00:15:58.307 --> 00:16:03.030\nLet's find her, Settings.\n\n289\n00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.450\nTalk to Cortana, all right.\n\n290\n00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:09.550\nSo under her Cortana options here,\nI currently have this disabled.\n\n291\n00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:15.310\nAlso, you can hit the Windows key+C\nto allow her to actively listen.\n\n292\n00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.300\nI think we talked about this before.\n\n293\n00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.870\nBut if I turn her on, let's just see here,\nI do have my volume up.\n\n294\n00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.470\nHey Cortana.\n\n295\n00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:27.540\nWhat's your favorite drink?\n\n296\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.890\n&gt;&gt; A very, very dry martini.\n\n297\n00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:34.095\nEvaporated in fact.\n\n298\n00:16:34.095 --> 00:16:35.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like that one.\n\n299\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.300\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n300\n00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nShe does a lot of different things here.\n\n301\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.350\nAnd you can, by saying, and if I dare\nto say it, Mike, maybe if you say it,\n\n302\n00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.480\nshe won't listen.\n\n303\n00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.270\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n304\n00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.440\n&gt;&gt; Hey Cortana.\n\n305\n00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.045\n&gt;&gt; Hey Cortana.\n\n306\n00:16:47.045 --> 00:16:48.283\n&gt;&gt; See, and now she's listening.\n\n307\n00:16:48.283 --> 00:16:50.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't quite follow that.\n\n308\n00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.810\n&gt;&gt; Hey Cortana,\ndo you know any impersonations?\n\n309\n00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.310\n&gt;&gt; I didn't follow what you said.\n\n310\n00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.800\nCan you phrase it another way?\n\n311\n00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.000\n&gt;&gt; Hey Cortana,\ndo you have any impersonations?\n\n312\n00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:08.470\n&gt;&gt; I'm still not getting that.\n\n313\n00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.630\n&gt;&gt; Do an impersonations maybe.\n\n314\n00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.550\n&gt;&gt; If you'd like to hear something\nunexpected, try saying surprise me.\n\n315\n00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.168\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n316\n00:17:14.168 --> 00:17:18.071\n&gt;&gt; Surprise me.\n\n317\n00:17:19.591 --> 00:17:21.396\nHey Cortana surprise me.\n\n318\n00:17:21.396 --> 00:17:25.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is sweet.\n\n319\n00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.785\nHoney never spoils as long\nas you keep the lid on.\n\n320\n00:17:27.785 --> 00:17:29.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n321\n00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.400\n&gt;&gt; Sweet.\n\n322\n00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.071\n&gt;&gt; Sweet yeah all right so\nlet's just turn her off for a minute so\n\n323\n00:17:36.071 --> 00:17:41.216\nI can say hey Cortana without her\nactually responding to me there.\n\n324\n00:17:41.216 --> 00:17:46.678\nCortana is going to be something that\nI feel like will be developed more\n\n325\n00:17:46.678 --> 00:17:53.780\nas well because we do see other virtual\nassistants in other operating systems.\n\n326\n00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:59.770\nBut Cortana takes a lot of information and\nbecause we have multiple devices.\n\n327\n00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.179\nSo for instance,\nif I were using a Windows phone or\n\n328\n00:18:03.179 --> 00:18:06.600\nwell now you can get Cortana\neven on Apple phones.\n\n329\n00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.230\nSo if I had my mobile device with me I\ncould say something like hey, Cortana.\n\n330\n00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:17.310\nRemind me when I'm near a grocery story\nto grab some milk, so she's actually\n\n331\n00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:22.140\nutilizing geolocation information and\nthen applying that.\n\n332\n00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.890\nIt's not all about hey tell me some jokes.\n\n333\n00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.710\nThere are some really great\nfunctionalities within Cortana,\n\n334\n00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.950\nso just play around with it,\nand get used to it.\n\n335\n00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:37.510\nAnd you might need to spend some time\nworking with that dictation like we\n\n336\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.530\nmentioned before.\n\n337\n00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:43.910\nIf you wanted to allow her to\npotentially only reply to your voice and\n\n338\n00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.890\nso forth, instead of other individuals.\n\n339\n00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.620\nAll right, that's Cortana.\n\n340\n00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.500\nIf we take a look at our power settings,\nlet me just go back here.\n\n341\n00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.510\nUnder system,\na couple different ways you can get there.\n\n342\n00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:01.080\nRemember control panel does still exist\nin our Windows 10 operating system.\n\n343\n00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.100\nSometimes it's just not at\nthe forefront of our minds with that.\n\n344\n00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.840\nCurrently, at this time you can still\naccess these settings that way as well.\n\n345\n00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.730\nBut we'll just use this newer UI for now.\n\n346\n00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:19.660\n&gt;&gt; And it'll kind of, pull back to\nthat old one control panel applet\n\n347\n00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.780\nwhenever we look at our advanced settings\nif that makes sense, it will in a minute.\n\n348\n00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.560\nSo if we take a look at our power and\nsleep functions here,\n\n349\n00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.120\nI'm using a laptop to\nperform this demonstration.\n\n350\n00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.550\nSo I don't have all of the options that\nyou might see with our desktop versions.\n\n351\n00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:39.040\nIt might be a little bit different\nthere if you're plugged into a desktop.\n\n352\n00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.570\nBut just knowing that see\nI have my battery power.\n\n353\n00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.660\nSo if you're on a desktop without\na battery then it's gonna be a little bit\n\n354\n00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.050\ndifferent for you.\n\n355\n00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:52.520\nNow I have the ability to go ahead and\nlook at the behavior that\n\n356\n00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:57.320\nI am accustomed to and then have my\nlaptop or device act accordingly.\n\n357\n00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:02.210\nSo if I'm in an environment where\nI have easy access to power,\n\n358\n00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:06.270\nto AC, to charge my device,\nthen maybe this isn't a big deal.\n\n359\n00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:10.410\nBut if I'm traveling and\nI'm worried about finding the next\n\n360\n00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.250\noutlet then maybe I want to go in and\nchange some of these settings to Sleep,\n\n361\n00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.990\nyou have the ability to here\non the right hand side.\n\n362\n00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:18.610\nThis is where I was saying.\n\n363\n00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.240\nTo kinda drill down and\nlook at additional power settings here.\n\n364\n00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:27.260\nYou have the ability to, there's\na default power plan that Microsoft uses.\n\n365\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.810\nBut you can also drill down through\nto change the plan settings to really\n\n366\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.950\ncustomize that to your behavior\nlike I was mentioning.\n\n367\n00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.770\nWe have the ability to\nchange the brightness.\n\n368\n00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.940\nSo you may already know from,\na lot of us even with our\n\n369\n00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:44.910\ncell phones can see the direct correlation\nwith the brightness of our screen and\n\n370\n00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.390\nthe length of our battery\nlife there as well.\n\n371\n00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.660\nSo just being familiar with these\nsettings are gonna be good for the exam.\n\n372\n00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.220\nIf you plan on taking\nthe exam just know again,\n\n373\n00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.260\neven drilling down a little bit\nfurther with this hyperlink here.\n\n374\n00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.690\nTo change your advance power settings,\n\n375\n00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:05.270\nall sorts of power settings in\nhere having that granular ability.\n\n376\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.240\nTo go ahead and do that.\n\n377\n00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.785\nThat's where I said here in the control\npanel, if I zoom in you can see,\n\n378\n00:21:09.785 --> 00:21:11.760\nit's under Hardware and Sound,\n\n379\n00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.980\npower options to go ahead access those\nplan settings to customize those.\n\n380\n00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:21.140\nCouple different ways to get there,\nbut it's going to do the same thing.\n\n381\n00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.220\nAll right Mike.\n\n382\n00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.670\nI think that's about it for this show.\n\n383\n00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.800\nWe've looked at a lot of different\nthings that we can do and\n\n384\n00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.650\nespecially to take care of\nthose individuals who may need\n\n385\n00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.410\na little bit of help with\nthe accessibility options.\n\n386\n00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.580\nIn our ease of access.\n\n387\n00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.770\n&gt;&gt; All right and\nwe got to see Cortana in action.\n\n388\n00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.675\nI like it.\n\n389\n00:21:39.675 --> 00:21:40.442\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee,\n\n390\n00:21:40.442 --> 00:21:42.361\nwell hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n391\n00:21:42.361 --> 00:21:43.987\nSigning of for ITProTV.\n\n392\n00:21:43.987 --> 00:21:45.157\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n393\n00:21:45.157 --> 00:21:46.023\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

Coming at you live from San Francisco,\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK].\n\n4\n00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:08.163\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.163 --> 00:00:12.237\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:15.180\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here in ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.050\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.870\nToday we're here installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n9\n00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.770\nIn this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at Internet Explorer and Edge.\n\n10\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.630\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Ms Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.320\nWelcome, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you for having me, Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.860\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.785\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n14\n00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:30.590\nI'm excited to be talking about browsers.\n\n15\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.931\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what's a browser, right?\n\n16\n00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:32.904\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n17\n00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:36.685\n&gt;&gt; So a lot of us, well,\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n18\n00:00:36.685 --> 00:00:37.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A lot of\n\n19\n00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.945\npeople are working in\nbrowsers all the time.\n\n20\n00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:44.390\nIt's a very common element\nof a computer system, right?\n\n21\n00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.440\nSo a browser is gonna be\na piece of coding, binary,\n\n22\n00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.400\nthat will allow us to navigate through\nthe wonderful World Wide Web or Internet.\n\n23\n00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.987\nSo we do spend a lot of time there.\n\n24\n00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:59.600\nAnd we have different\nbrowsers available to us,\n\n25\n00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.070\nChrome, Opera, Firefox,\nEdge, Internet Explorer.\n\n26\n00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.250\nMike, what kinda browser do you use?\n\n27\n00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.790\n&gt;&gt; Lately, it's actually been Chrome.\n\n28\n00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.300\nI kinda bounce back and forth.\n\n29\n00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.816\nI play with Edge for a little while,\n\n30\n00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:13.150\nand then I end up going\nback to Chrome actually.\n\n31\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so then you're\ndefinitely following the majority.\n\n32\n00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.660\nIf we take a look at my screen,\nwe can look at this particular web site,\n\n33\n00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.400\nit's called netmarketshare.com.\n\n34\n00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.200\nIt's kinda cool because you could look at,\n\n35\n00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.670\nwell, here I have operating\nsystems pulled up.\n\n36\n00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.198\nI was just playing around,\nkind of looking at that market share.\n\n37\n00:01:29.198 --> 00:01:34.920\nBut let me see, I think I have\ndevice type browser right here, but\n\n38\n00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.690\nover, you have different options like for\ndesktops if you wanted to check that out.\n\n39\n00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.500\nIt's kind of cool if you look at that,\nyou see this purple line here,\n\n40\n00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.610\nthis horizontal.\n\n41\n00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.300\nWe see that Windows Share, which they're\nnot breaking it down by version here, but\n\n42\n00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.180\nthe majority of end users\nrunning on desktops or\n\n43\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.460\nlaptops are using Windows\noperating systems.\n\n44\n00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.310\nIf we look under this browsers category,\nand you guys might have just seen that\n\n45\n00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.450\nthere, they also break it\ndown by device type as well.\n\n46\n00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.900\nSo let's just click on desktop here.\n\n47\n00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.830\nBut look at this gap\nhere that we're seeing.\n\n48\n00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.240\nThis top horizontal line correlates\ndown to this blue square here for\n\n49\n00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.030\nthe key, it's going to be Chrome for\nthat particular market share.\n\n50\n00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.374\nAnd we're looking currently in 03 of 2018,\n\n51\n00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:26.322\napproximately 60% of users using Chrome.\n\n52\n00:02:26.322 --> 00:02:32.989\nSo I think what happened was people\ndidn't really see the value of Edge,\n\n53\n00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.920\nwhich is a newer browser\nthat Microsoft introduced.\n\n54\n00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.482\nSo hopefully, by the end of the show,\n\n55\n00:02:40.482 --> 00:02:45.460\nI will have shared some information with\nyou to allow you the ability to make\n\n56\n00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.080\nthe proper decision,and who knows,\nmaybe even convert Mike over here.\n\n57\n00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.545\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you never know.\n\n58\n00:02:51.545 --> 00:02:53.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, lets first talk about,\n\n59\n00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.150\nInternet Explorer, though.\n\n60\n00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.610\nSo Internet Explorer has been around for\na very long time here.\n\n61\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.955\nAnd as you can see from this\nparticular diagram, we've started,\n\n62\n00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:08.555\napproximately it was like 1995, with\nInternet Explorer running in Windows XP.\n\n63\n00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.670\nSo here on the left-hand side,\nthere's a vertical axis.\n\n64\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.640\nI have this different browsers,\nMicrosoft browsers listed by name.\n\n65\n00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.510\nAnd you can see the different iterations\nas we run through, Internet Explorer 6, 7,\n\n66\n00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.330\n8, 9, 10, 11, the current and\nlast version of Internet Explorer,\n\n67\n00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.140\nas well as Microsoft Edge,\nwhich we'll be taking a look at as well.\n\n68\n00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.003\nNow, it's kind of interesting\nbecause if we see here the,\n\n69\n00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:41.352\nI guess, not longest running,\nit would be in terms of duration,\n\n70\n00:03:41.352 --> 00:03:45.341\nbut also in terms of\noperating system versions,\n\n71\n00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:51.015\nwe see that Internet Explorer 8 kind\nof lingered around for a while.\n\n72\n00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:56.451\nAnd I don't know what happened to this\nlittle check mark, it's like falling down,\n\n73\n00:03:56.451 --> 00:04:00.600\nbut it was still existing Inside of XP,\nVista, and Windows 7.\n\n74\n00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.440\nSo that one was pretty common,\npretty popular, right?\n\n75\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.460\nHowever, in today's day and age,\nrunning here in Windows 10,\n\n76\n00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.345\nwe definitely want to be at\nInternet Explorer version\n\n77\n00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:17.780\n11 because of a lot of security\nenhancements that have been made.\n\n78\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.540\nSo just kinda laying out this\nlandscape as far as this timeline, so\n\n79\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.725\nyou kinda visualize what that looks\nlike if you are not familiar with IE,\n\n80\n00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:31.134\nInternet Explorer, or Edge historically..\n\n81\n00:04:31.134 --> 00:04:35.923\nAll right, so if we look actually\nin this bottom right-hand corner,\n\n82\n00:04:35.923 --> 00:04:40.500\nwe see Windows 10 here,\nin that far right column, right?\n\n83\n00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.490\nActually comes shipped with both,\nInternet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.\n\n84\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.760\nWell, that just sounds great.\n\n85\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.390\nLet's minimize this, we'll go ahead and\nhit our Start Menu and look at our apps\n\n86\n00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.890\ndown here and scroll down in alphabetical\norder, and here I've got my I.\n\n87\n00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.040\nAnd my gosh,\nI don't see Internet Explorer.\n\n88\n00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.400\nWhere is it, right?\n\n89\n00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.880\nSo it's not the easiest,\nI guess it's just some\n\n90\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.070\npeople might not even know that it exists\nin Windows 10, it's a little bit hidden.\n\n91\n00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.810\nSo I'm gonna tell you\na couple things you can do.\n\n92\n00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.650\nWell, number one, you could do\nWindows S here to bring up your search.\n\n93\n00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.468\nAnd then just type in either I space E,\nor start typing Internet Explorer.\n\n94\n00:05:19.468 --> 00:05:20.460\nWhat else?\n\n95\n00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.970\nLet's do Windows E to\npull up File Explorer.\n\n96\n00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.434\nYou could type in,\nin the actual bar up here,\n\n97\n00:05:27.434 --> 00:05:30.851\nyou could just type in I Explorer.\n\n98\n00:05:33.204 --> 00:05:35.609\nE X, that would help if I\nspelled things correctly.\n\n99\n00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:38.842\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it'll go ahead and\n\n100\n00:05:38.842 --> 00:05:40.120\nlaunch the browser.\n\n101\n00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.040\nYou could also type in a command\nprompt at start I Explorer.\n\n102\n00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.170\nSo a couple of different\nways of getting there.\n\n103\n00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.730\nBut it's not just so glaring or obvious.\n\n104\n00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.130\nWhereas Edge, the newer feature,\n\n105\n00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.940\nthe newer browser,\nis a little more easier to access there.\n\n106\n00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:02.600\nSo since we're already here at\nInternet Explorer, let's go ahead and\n\n107\n00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.980\ntake a look and\npoke around at some of the settings there.\n\n108\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.984\nOver on the right-hand side, and I'll\ntry to zoom in so you guys can see this,\n\n109\n00:06:09.984 --> 00:06:11.700\nlet's just kinda look at the layout.\n\n110\n00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.150\nSo there is a visual aesthetic difference\nbetween Internet Explorer and Edge.\n\n111\n00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.780\nSo I want you to pay attention to what\nkind of icons and layout you're seeing so\n\n112\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.500\nthat you are able to quickly visually\nidentify which browser you're in\n\n113\n00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.070\nwithout having to do a lot\nof research there, right?\n\n114\n00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.510\nSo I have, by default, my home button,\n\n115\n00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.290\nI have a star, I have a gear,\nand a happy face, all right?\n\n116\n00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.470\nSo let's talk about what each\none of those are representing.\n\n117\n00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.561\nSo the home page has been around for\na very long time.\n\n118\n00:06:47.882 --> 00:06:49.420\nDo you use a home page?\n\n119\n00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.500\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yes.\n\n120\n00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.681\n&gt;&gt; ITProTV?\n\n121\n00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:52.455\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n122\n00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:54.390\n&gt;&gt; Actually, it's Google.\n\n123\n00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.890\n&gt;&gt; Google, okay.\n\n124\n00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.930\n&gt;&gt; Because typically,\n\n125\n00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.360\nwhen I open up my browser is because\nI wanna search for something.\n\n126\n00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.098\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n127\n00:06:59.098 --> 00:07:00.660\n&gt;&gt; And so Google being my home page.\n\n128\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.171\nOr if I have gone down the rabbit hole and\nnavigated many web pages deep, and\n\n129\n00:07:04.171 --> 00:07:06.811\nrealize okay, I wanna go back and\nstart my search over.\n\n130\n00:07:06.811 --> 00:07:08.370\n&gt;&gt; A quick anchor just to-.\n\n131\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.936\n&gt;&gt; I just click on my home button,\nget right back to there so.\n\n132\n00:07:10.936 --> 00:07:12.540\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\nSo I mean, its been around for\n\n133\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.080\na very long time, you still have that\nfunctionality, that ability there.\n\n134\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.364\nIn Edge, it's not so obvious, but\n\n135\n00:07:19.364 --> 00:07:24.957\nyou can still include that home\nbutton if you choose to do so.\n\n136\n00:07:24.957 --> 00:07:29.582\nAnd we'll take a look at, so here, MSN,\nI just have set, this is the default,\n\n137\n00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:31.680\nI didn't go in and configure that.\n\n138\n00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.960\nBut we'll take a look at how to do that.\n\n139\n00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.900\nAnd we'll take a look also at this star\nand how we can configure our favorites.\n\n140\n00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.808\nSo different pages,\nweb sites that we wanna go to.\n\n141\n00:07:42.808 --> 00:07:47.559\nThis is where we'll be spending the\nmajority of our time looking at this gear\n\n142\n00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:51.505\nor cog setting to go ahead and\nbring up the settings menu there.\n\n143\n00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:56.211\nNow, the happy face is kind of\ninteresting, if I go ahead and click on\n\n144\n00:07:56.211 --> 00:08:01.960\nthat I can use my keyboard shortcuts ALT+J\nfor smile and ALT+K for frowny face.\n\n145\n00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.980\nAnd so let's go with smiling.\n\n146\n00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.540\nAnd if we had some kind of comment or\nany kind of feedback\n\n147\n00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.480\nthat we would like to send to Microsoft\nabout this particular browser,\n\n148\n00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.520\nthat's simply what this dialogue\nbox is allowing us to do.\n\n149\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.790\nNow, it's kind of interesting because\na lot of different presentations that I've\n\n150\n00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:26.240\nwatched from Ignite or\nsome other Microsoft source,\n\n151\n00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.720\nthey do talk about a lot of their features\nare spawning from this option here.\n\n152\n00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.230\nOr just from user feedback, even from\nsocial media and so forth in general.\n\n153\n00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.850\nIt's kind of cool.\n\n154\n00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.053\nIf you have valid information\nyou'd like to share with them,\n\n155\n00:08:42.053 --> 00:08:44.221\nthen definitely take the time to do that.\n\n156\n00:08:44.221 --> 00:08:50.131\nWe'll just hit close for now and\ngo into some of these settings, right?\n\n157\n00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:55.046\nSo if I left-click on that gear, you can\nsee some options I have available to me.\n\n158\n00:08:55.046 --> 00:08:58.310\nI have the ability to go ahead and print.\n\n159\n00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.210\nSo I can print right from within\na browser if, I don't know,\n\n160\n00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.570\nI print receipts sometimes, right?\n\n161\n00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.920\nSo it's a very common thing that I do.\n\n162\n00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.260\nIt's very easy for me to go ahead and do.\n\n163\n00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.410\nYou also have the ability to\naccess different types of\n\n164\n00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.750\nprinting configuration options right\nhere from within the browser as well.\n\n165\n00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.080\nNow, when we take a look,\nand we'll be talking about\n\n166\n00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.150\nthis kind of functions a little\nbit later when we look at Edge and\n\n167\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.890\nsome of the security\nimplementations that they have.\n\n168\n00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.353\nYou might see, in certain situations,\n\n169\n00:09:31.353 --> 00:09:35.630\nreduced amount of features simply\nto have that security, right?\n\n170\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.490\nBecause if we think about saving,\nright, maybe you're dealing with some\n\n171\n00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.900\nsensitive corporate information, and\nyou don't want end users to save that.\n\n172\n00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.030\nWell, here in Internet Explorer,\nthere have\n\n173\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:52.310\nbeen great advancement with IE 11 to go\nahead and integrate and enhance security.\n\n174\n00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.742\nBut I will say that comparing the two,\n\n175\n00:09:54.742 --> 00:09:58.390\nEdge is definitely gonna be that\nforerunner when it comes to security.\n\n176\n00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.900\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n177\n00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:06.091\nHonestly, the main reason that Internet\nExplorer exists and is still within this\n\n178\n00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:10.481\noperating system will be for\nsome backwards compatibility there, so.\n\n179\n00:10:10.481 --> 00:10:13.260\n&gt;&gt; That's actually one of the things\nthat drove me back to Chrome.\n\n180\n00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.423\nI started using Edge when it first came\nout and there were some sites that had\n\n181\n00:10:17.423 --> 00:10:21.480\nissues with Edge, so\nI'd have to flip between Edge and then IE.\n\n182\n00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.080\nAnd I just switched to Chrome\nbecause it had everything.\n\n183\n00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's actually,\nwe're gonna be talking about that, Mike.\n\n184\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:31.550\nSomething that they have with\ntheir enterprise mode is\n\n185\n00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.790\ncreated to handle that problem exactly\nthat you're talking about there.\n\n186\n00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.710\nAll right, and I encourage you to\njust go through the settings because,\n\n187\n00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:45.040\nas I said, Internet Explorer has\nbeen around for a very long time.\n\n188\n00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.280\nMaybe you're familiar with it.\n\n189\n00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.130\nIf not,\nthen you definitely just need to go and\n\n190\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.270\nthen get the feel because you may see\nquestions on the exam that are gonna be\n\n191\n00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:56.340\nspecific to configurations or how to\naccess and navigate through that browser.\n\n192\n00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.840\nThis was kind of interesting, though.\n\n193\n00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:05.261\nWe've already talked about different types\nof accessibility options that we have\n\n194\n00:11:05.261 --> 00:11:06.694\navailable to us, right,\n\n195\n00:11:06.694 --> 00:11:10.487\nwhen were looking at our ease of\naccess options in the settings menu.\n\n196\n00:11:10.487 --> 00:11:13.908\nNow, by leveraging some of\nthose keyboard functions,\n\n197\n00:11:13.908 --> 00:11:17.859\nwe can also take advantage of\nsomething called caret browsing.\n\n198\n00:11:17.859 --> 00:11:21.805\nAnd you can use the F7 key to go ahead and\nimplement this.\n\n199\n00:11:21.805 --> 00:11:26.439\nAnd basically what you're doing, and\nI'll zoom out so we can see this and\n\n200\n00:11:26.439 --> 00:11:30.269\nit's prompting me do I want to\nactually use caret browsing.\n\n201\n00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:35.415\nI'm gonna be using the keyboard\nto navigate throughout my\n\n202\n00:11:35.415 --> 00:11:41.095\nwebpage here instead of using a mouse or\ntouch command options.\n\n203\n00:11:41.095 --> 00:11:44.272\nSo this is a really busy page.\n\n204\n00:11:44.272 --> 00:11:47.636\nBut if I just go ahead and\ntab through, it's kind of hard for\n\n205\n00:11:47.636 --> 00:11:51.020\nyou to see that I'm currently\non the little Bing icon here.\n\n206\n00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.150\nSee how there's like\na little slashed gray?\n\n207\n00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.900\nBut let's just tab through a few\nmore things and you can see how,\n\n208\n00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.210\nif I hit my shift and\nmy tab to go backwards,\n\n209\n00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:06.710\nyou can see how that changes there,\nbetween the two if that makes sense.\n\n210\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.520\nThen you'll have the ability to\ngo ahead and navigate that way.\n\n211\n00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.410\nTo turn that off,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and hit my\n\n212\n00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:19.760\nagain that F7 key and\nlet me make sure I did hit that.\n\n213\n00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.926\nYeah, so if you hit it again,\nthen it's going to disable and\n\n214\n00:12:22.926 --> 00:12:24.364\nalso do you wanna go ahead.\n\n215\n00:12:24.364 --> 00:12:29.994\nI hit it twice, so I'm just gonna say\nno here to go ahead and disable that.\n\n216\n00:12:29.994 --> 00:12:33.702\nAll right,\nwhat else here in Internet Explorer,\n\n217\n00:12:33.702 --> 00:12:36.890\nunder the settings here we looked at file.\n\n218\n00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.960\nZoom that's self-explanatory there.\n\n219\n00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:42.890\nI will say this, though,\n\n220\n00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:48.240\nfirst of all, let me right-click on\nsome white space up here on the top.\n\n221\n00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.980\nFor the menu bar, you do have some options\nfrom this action menu here to go ahead and\n\n222\n00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.450\nselect additional components,\n\n223\n00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:04.058\nlike graphical or UI components here,\nso you have additional tabs.\n\n224\n00:13:04.058 --> 00:13:07.560\nAnd by right-clicking on top of those\nsettings, we've already seen some of these\n\n225\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.430\ncomponents, it's just\nmore in the forefront, so\n\n226\n00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.490\njust making an easier experience for\nthe end-user there.\n\n227\n00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.520\nBut when it comes to\nthis command bar here,\n\n228\n00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.530\nnotice how all of my little icons\non right-hand side disappear.\n\n229\n00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.180\nSo by default,\nI don't think these are there.\n\n230\n00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.820\nI had to actually set\nthose to put them there.\n\n231\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.740\nAnd things like the Zoom\nthat we are just looking\n\n232\n00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:41.820\nat underneath that gear icon, you'll\nsee a lot of duplicate setting options.\n\n233\n00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.580\nThat's why I say play around with it.\n\n234\n00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:49.900\nBecause there's probably more than\none way to get to that setting.\n\n235\n00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.660\nAnd that's really gonna come from\njust playing around with it.\n\n236\n00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.690\nWe can see things in here.\n\n237\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.480\nThis is Save As, and we are looking\nat Save in a different area.\n\n238\n00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.740\nLooking at things like sending a page by\nemail and just sending a link by email.\n\n239\n00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.340\nI think this is going to be important\nknowing how to execute things between\n\n240\n00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.806\nthe two browsers and you gonna have\ndifferent options between the two.\n\n241\n00:14:12.806 --> 00:14:17.327\nLet's take a look at compatibility view\nsettings because this is important.\n\n242\n00:14:17.327 --> 00:14:22.905\nAnd although Internet Explorer is\nthe older of the two Microsoft operating\n\n243\n00:14:22.905 --> 00:14:28.230\nsystems here, some websites do not\nrender properly even with IE 11.\n\n244\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:34.110\nSo then maybe they're really stuck on\nthat IE 8 that we spoke about, right?\n\n245\n00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:38.760\nSo if I want, there's a particular site,\nI don't know.\n\n246\n00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.950\nLet's just say it is MSN.com,\nand MSN.com can only run and\n\n247\n00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.750\ncan only render in an older version here.\n\n248\n00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.760\nThen, I do have the ability\nto go ahead and add that.\n\n249\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:55.440\nAnd Microsoft does compile\ncompatibility lists for us.\n\n250\n00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.890\nAnd actually, Mike, that's where\nwe'll also take a look at that\n\n251\n00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:04.820\nenterprise mode where we can download\nsome pretty comprehensive lists.\n\n252\n00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.310\nSo that, from a development standpoint,\nI'm just gonna close out of here, but\n\n253\n00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.764\nlet me go ahead and\nshow you something here.\n\n254\n00:15:11.764 --> 00:15:17.086\nI believe it's F11 in IE, no, not F11.\n\n255\n00:15:17.086 --> 00:15:24.050\nMaybe F12, yeah, so F12, and\nI can't remember if it's the same in Edge.\n\n256\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.850\nWe can test that, but what'll happen,\nit'll bring up my developer options here.\n\n257\n00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.860\nAnd you can see different\ncategories at the bottom.\n\n258\n00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:37.910\nAnd over on the right-hand side here for\nemulation, you can see\n\n259\n00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:42.060\nthe type of compatibility\nthat I'm dealing with here.\n\n260\n00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.630\nSo, by default,\nthis page running at Internet Explorer.\n\n261\n00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:50.495\nAnd if it were an older page, you might be\nable to see and change it manually here.\n\n262\n00:15:50.495 --> 00:15:54.385\nAnd this might be what you were\ntalking about, trying to find\n\n263\n00:15:54.385 --> 00:15:59.115\nthat perfect marriage of browser and\nweb page And so Enterprise mode, and\n\n264\n00:15:59.115 --> 00:16:04.082\nwe'll look at that more, is basically\ntaking all the guess work out there.\n\n265\n00:16:04.082 --> 00:16:09.452\nSo, you do have backwards compatibility\neven here in Internet Explorer 11, if you\n\n266\n00:16:09.452 --> 00:16:14.611\nwanted to go further back in that timeline\nthat I showed you before we got started.\n\n267\n00:16:14.611 --> 00:16:15.623\nAll right.\n\n268\n00:16:23.103 --> 00:16:27.305\nAdd site to apps if you had a particular\nsite and you want an easy access,\n\n269\n00:16:27.305 --> 00:16:30.946\nlike whenever I went to my start\nmenu to look under those apps,\n\n270\n00:16:30.946 --> 00:16:33.720\nyou didn't even see Internet Explorer.\n\n271\n00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.980\nI think for me, the easiest thing, and\nsince we already have this pulled up,\n\n272\n00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.120\nwe already talked about our taskbar\nsettings, you can just right-click and\n\n273\n00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.840\nthen pin to taskbar for easy access for\nInternet Explorer there.\n\n274\n00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.790\nJust know that you can do that for\nweb pages as well.\n\n275\n00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.520\nWe'll look at Internet\nin Edge it's easier.\n\n276\n00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.650\nI think they did a really\ngood job with the UI there,\n\n277\n00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.330\nsome pretty cool features we'll look at.\n\n278\n00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.620\nAll right,\nI'm trying to think about anything else.\n\n279\n00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.710\nInternet options, let's definitely\nspend some time in this section here.\n\n280\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:06.837\nGo ahead and zoom in.\n\n281\n00:17:11.622 --> 00:17:15.504\nThis is that home page we were talking\nabout, so Mike, you would go ahead and\n\n282\n00:17:15.504 --> 00:17:18.490\nchange that and, oops,\nI already had it selected there.\n\n283\n00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.675\nShould have just did Select All.\n\n284\n00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:29.119\nAll right, so he would type in\nwww.google.com to go ahead and\n\n285\n00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:33.130\nset his home page for that particular one.\n\n286\n00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.110\nLet me zoom out a little bit.\n\n287\n00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:41.070\nWe also see some behavior, some ways that\nwe can control that browser behavior.\n\n288\n00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.260\nSo in this section right\nhere under start up,\n\n289\n00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.530\nit says start with tabs from the last\nsection if we wanted to pick up\n\n290\n00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.270\nwhere we left off,\nwhich I think is a pretty cool feature.\n\n291\n00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:54.130\nThat might not always be what you want\nif it's maybe a shared computer or\n\n292\n00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:59.690\nif you were wanting to really have some\nmore granular security control there.\n\n293\n00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.520\nStarting with that home page,\nand let's see,\n\n294\n00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:10.260\nthis is really extra control about\nhow those particular tabs behave.\n\n295\n00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:15.020\nSo [LAUGH] this would be horrible if I\nhad a warning every time I went to close\n\n296\n00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.230\na tab here for multiple tabs, but\nif you had for every single tab.\n\n297\n00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.670\nEnable tab groups, this is a pretty cool\nfeature where you can kind of group them.\n\n298\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:28.950\nI think Edge takes that\nconcept to the next level,\n\n299\n00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.670\nand we'll take a look at that there.\n\n300\n00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.268\nBut again, just come in here,\n\n301\n00:18:32.268 --> 00:18:35.344\nplay with a lot of these settings\nbecause there are so many.\n\n302\n00:18:35.344 --> 00:18:38.120\nAnd it's just about\ncustomizing that experience.\n\n303\n00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.540\nBut hopefully you are going\nto be using Microsoft Edge.\n\n304\n00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.590\nThat's kinda, like I said,\nthe way that we want to go there.\n\n305\n00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:50.980\nNow, looking at a browsing history,\nand browsing history,\n\n306\n00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:55.960\nagain, it's not necessarily\na security feature.\n\n307\n00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.080\ni would say maybe like\na security enhancement or\n\n308\n00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.370\njust performance of your system, right?\n\n309\n00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.990\nBecause having all that extra\ninformation stored in your cache,\n\n310\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:09.160\nsitting there in your memory\nthat can slow things down a bit\n\n311\n00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.200\ndepending on how much\nhistory is sitting in there.\n\n312\n00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.052\nSo you have the ability to go ahead and\ndelete your browsing\n\n313\n00:19:18.052 --> 00:19:22.518\nhistory on exit, and\nyou can just check that as well.\n\n314\n00:19:22.518 --> 00:19:26.265\nDon't think you're trying to be sneaky or\nanything with that because\n\n315\n00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:30.455\nthere are definitely ways to look at your\nhistory and traffic aside from that,\n\n316\n00:19:30.455 --> 00:19:32.612\nthat's not gonna wipe the slate clean,\n\n317\n00:19:32.612 --> 00:19:35.360\nit just gets rid of that\ncached information there.\n\n318\n00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:41.260\nAlso we have the ability to really\ncustomize with anything like colors, and\n\n319\n00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.980\nlanguages, fonts, and\nsome accessibility options there.\n\n320\n00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.170\nI really wanna take some time\nlooking at this security tab.\n\n321\n00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:55.570\nIf we think about security and how it\nshould be implemented in layers, right?\n\n322\n00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.920\nSo what we're doing with these,\nit may seem minuscule or\n\n323\n00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.520\nlittle like small settings here,\noverall, in the grand scheme of things,\n\n324\n00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.200\nwe're building up those layers.\n\n325\n00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.520\nSo that's what we're looking at here\nwith our different security zones.\n\n326\n00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.957\nAnd Internet Explorer\ntakes this concept and\n\n327\n00:20:12.957 --> 00:20:17.310\nthey really divide it into\nfour zone types here.\n\n328\n00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.220\nSo we have an Internet Zone,\n\n329\n00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:25.231\na local Intranet Zone,\nTrusted Sites, and Restricted Sites.\n\n330\n00:20:25.231 --> 00:20:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Hey, what other settings do\nwe need to be familiar with?\n\n331\n00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Mike, if we take a look at that\nsecond tab, we see the security tab.\n\n332\n00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.600\nAnd let me just go ahead and zoom in here.\n\n333\n00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:39.870\nLooking at the way that\nInternet Explorer is set up,\n\n334\n00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:43.710\nit really kind of plays\ninto those security layers.\n\n335\n00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:47.900\nSo they categorize and\nbreak it down into four different zones.\n\n336\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.940\nWe have the Internet Zone,\nwe have the Intranet Zone,\n\n337\n00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.160\nwe have Trusted Sites,\nand then Restricted Sites.\n\n338\n00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.190\nSo what does that mean?\n\n339\n00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:03.810\nWell, each one of these zones\nhave different layers or\n\n340\n00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.740\ndifferent accessibility features.\n\n341\n00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:11.350\nSo for instance, Internet,\nwe have a sliding scale here.\n\n342\n00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.880\nSo default settings, medium to high.\n\n343\n00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.440\nYou can select this sliding scale and\nchange it.\n\n344\n00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.450\nSo if I wanna go ahead and\n\n345\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:25.270\nchange it to high,\nthis would be a more restrictive setting.\n\n346\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:30.380\nSo it's going to be reducing\nthe amount of types of code basically,\n\n347\n00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.760\nor features that a website may have\nbecause anytime you have that code,\n\n348\n00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.920\nthat additional programming and\n\n349\n00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.990\nbinary running, it could potentially\nbe a vulnerability, right?\n\n350\n00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.980\nSo by reducing or lowering this threshold,\n\n351\n00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:50.360\nI'm allowing for more code to run on\nmy websites, if that make sense here.\n\n352\n00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.700\nAnd you know what?\n\n353\n00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.322\nLet's look at a web page that I\ndo have pulled up at Microsoft,\n\n354\n00:21:55.322 --> 00:21:57.829\nI think it might help\nto look at the features\n\n355\n00:21:57.829 --> 00:22:01.331\nthat they actually do block\nwithin these different zones.\n\n356\n00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:04.386\nAnd I've included all these links\nin the show notes here, and\n\n357\n00:22:04.386 --> 00:22:06.443\nit's just setting up security zones, so\n\n358\n00:22:06.443 --> 00:22:10.670\nif you really wanna spend some time\nlooking at each one of these, you can.\n\n359\n00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:15.930\nI'm gonna be scrolling down, let me close\nout of this, to the chart right here.\n\n360\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.610\nSo looking at that sliding bar here,\n\n361\n00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.660\nit explains what is allowed and\nwhat is not allowed.\n\n362\n00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.740\nSo here they use enable prompt, so enable\njust means I'm gonna let it run, right?\n\n363\n00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:33.630\nPrompting, that's when they ask you about\nthat, and disable says, look, we found\n\n364\n00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:39.622\nserious vulnerabilities or flaws within\nthis type of element here, ActiveX, right?\n\n365\n00:22:39.622 --> 00:22:44.430\nSo ActiveX is one of those big offenders\nthere that is completely omitted from\n\n366\n00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.870\nMicrosoft Edge.\n\n367\n00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.537\nSo keep that in mind, right?\n\n368\n00:22:48.537 --> 00:22:53.256\nBeing able to set these different\nsecurity zones will allow different,\n\n369\n00:22:53.256 --> 00:22:54.976\nwell, security levels.\n\n370\n00:22:54.976 --> 00:22:57.689\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Local Intranets,\n\n371\n00:22:57.689 --> 00:23:01.650\nso we're talking about those\ninternal sites that you have there.\n\n372\n00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:05.722\nTrusted Sites, so this is the behavior,\n\n373\n00:23:05.722 --> 00:23:11.270\nif maybe my company has a few\nsites where they order parts,\n\n374\n00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:15.540\nwe have some vendors and\nwe trust them, we use them every day.\n\n375\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.870\nI can then allow more features\nlike ActiveX to go ahead and\n\n376\n00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:25.710\nrun on a particular site, it's okay,\nwe've tested it, and give it our approval.\n\n377\n00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:30.490\nNow, alternatively,\nif we look at Restricted Sites,\n\n378\n00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:34.560\nand maybe we've had an end user\nthat's had an infected computer.\n\n379\n00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.270\nAnd going back and investigating we can\ndetermine that it was from x, y, z sites.\n\n380\n00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:43.810\nSo we say, look, when we go to that site\nwe only want text to be able to be viewed,\n\n381\n00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:44.830\nor wherever.\n\n382\n00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:49.656\nSo by setting this threshold\nwe can eliminate a lot of\n\n383\n00:23:49.656 --> 00:23:53.947\nthose controls or\ntypes of code from running.\n\n384\n00:23:53.947 --> 00:23:57.204\nIt doesn't mean that you\ncan't go to that site.\n\n385\n00:23:57.204 --> 00:23:59.908\nSo I definitely wanna make\nsure you guys understand that.\n\n386\n00:23:59.908 --> 00:24:03.245\nWe're not preventing users\nI'm navigating to the site.\n\n387\n00:24:03.245 --> 00:24:09.881\nIt's just restricting what is displayed\nand rendered on that web page there.\n\n388\n00:24:09.881 --> 00:24:11.144\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n389\n00:24:11.144 --> 00:24:13.372\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so some built-in security here.\n\n390\n00:24:13.372 --> 00:24:16.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Privacy settings,\n\n391\n00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:19.480\nagain definitely just want you to go\nthrough and take a look at all of these.\n\n392\n00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.270\nSo by default,\npop-up blockers are turned on.\n\n393\n00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.970\nYou can go ahead and disable that.\n\n394\n00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.600\nSome sites do require pop-ups.\n\n395\n00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.770\nYou can also temporarily disable pop-ups.\n\n396\n00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.760\nI always keep my blocker on\nunless I do find that a site\n\n397\n00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.990\nis crippled by having that enabled.\n\n398\n00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:45.740\nAnd again, you have the ability to allow\nlocation, so for like geo-tracking.\n\n399\n00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:50.870\nInPrivate is a cool feature here, so\nInPrivate is going to disable toolbars and\n\n400\n00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:57.500\nextensions, it's going to be\na little more restrictive as far as,\n\n401\n00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.080\nand like Chrome, you're familiar Chrome,\nwhat did they call it, incognito mode?\n\n402\n00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.130\n&gt;&gt; I believe so, yes.\n\n403\n00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:06.933\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's not saving your\nbrowsing history and cookies, and\n\n404\n00:25:06.933 --> 00:25:12.320\nwe should probably talk about\ncookies there and what those are.\n\n405\n00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:18.730\nWhenever you open a tab in\nprivate mode there, so again,\n\n406\n00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:24.820\njust all these little things that we can\ndo to build up and add to that security.\n\n407\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.480\nAnd I'm trying to think here, anything\nsuper glaring that I wanna talk about.\n\n408\n00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.331\n&gt;&gt; There are.\n\n409\n00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:32.880\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n410\n00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.830\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of settings in there.\n\n411\n00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.010\n&gt;&gt; I know, there's just so many.\n\n412\n00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.340\nI'm trying to think,\nlike I can't cover all of them, and\n\n413\n00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.920\nI'm trying to think about the best\nones that we should cover.\n\n414\n00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.060\nI think it's important to note that\n\n415\n00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.640\neverything that I'm doing here can\nalso be managed with group policy.\n\n416\n00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.630\nSo on a personal note, I'm not gonna\nprobably want to mess with that.\n\n417\n00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.100\nHowever, in a business or\nenterprise environment,\n\n418\n00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.870\nthere are ways that I can really\nlock down these configurations so\n\n419\n00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:04.100\nmy end users aren't tinkering and\nchanging these configurations here.\n\n420\n00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:08.330\nSomething I do think is\nimportant to know for\n\n421\n00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.510\nthe exam, let's just go ahead and take\na look at how we would create a favourite.\n\n422\n00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:16.097\nBecause we do have the ability\nin Edge to go ahead, well, in,\n\n423\n00:26:16.097 --> 00:26:18.790\nI don't wanna say all browsers,\ncuz I'm not sure.\n\n424\n00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.260\nI haven't worked with every\nsingle browser in existence,\n\n425\n00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:26.090\nbut every one that I've worked with has\nthe ability to allow you to save pages and\n\n426\n00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:29.080\nbookmark or favorite them,\nwhatever the terminology may be.\n\n427\n00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:33.240\nSo if you decide to jump ship or\nswitch to a different browser,\n\n428\n00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.400\nyou might still wanna have\naccess to those bookmarks.\n\n429\n00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.880\nSo I think we should look at\nhow to quickly import and\n\n430\n00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.910\nexport our favorites here.\n\n431\n00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.140\nSo I don't think I have any favorites.\n\n432\n00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:49.360\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's just type in ITPro.TV.\n\n433\n00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:54.630\nAnd we can add ITPRO.TV\nto our favorites here\n\n434\n00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:58.695\nby just clicking on this little star and\nselecting Add to Favorites.\n\n435\n00:26:58.695 --> 00:27:06.160\nAlso, I might have done this before\nin my search bar or my favorites bar.\n\n436\n00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.350\nIf you use this drop down,\n\n437\n00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:12.030\nthe favorites bar is going to be\na graphical element that lays it out for\n\n438\n00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.640\nyou within that header there of\nthe browser, so just keep that in mind.\n\n439\n00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.980\nSo we'll just say Add and\nthen also let's pull up another tab here.\n\n440\n00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:25.495\nMaybe I like to shop quite a bit on eBay,\nso we'll say eBay.\n\n441\n00:27:25.495 --> 00:27:28.390\n[COUGH] We'll add to\nour favorites as well.\n\n442\n00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.650\nJust so we can see something in\nthere when we go ahead and export.\n\n443\n00:27:32.872 --> 00:27:36.920\n&gt;&gt; So I use my favorites bar as\nlike a temporary holding spot for\n\n444\n00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.040\nbookmarks I wanna go back to.\n\n445\n00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.940\nI don't have time but so\nI throw it right there so it's in my face.\n\n446\n00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.450\n&gt;&gt; And then like if they make it there,\nthen they get moved.\n\n447\n00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.210\n&gt;&gt; Once I go to the page, I delete it.\n\n448\n00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:47.490\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Unless it's something I want to save,\n\n449\n00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:48.890\nand then I might move it to a folder.\n\n450\n00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:51.150\nBut it's like my reminder that hey,\n\n451\n00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.450\nyou found something that you\nneed to go check out later on.\n\n452\n00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.290\n&gt;&gt; Cool, I like it.\n\n453\n00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:59.470\nAll right, so once we have our favorites\nin there, from this little arrow on\n\n454\n00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:04.490\nthe right hand side, the drop down, I have\nsome other options here, you see that.\n\n455\n00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.550\nBut what I wanted to show you\nwas importing and exporting.\n\n456\n00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:12.580\nSo I can click there, and\nthis is not the only way to access those.\n\n457\n00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:17.705\nIf I navigate to the actual user's\nprofile under my C drive here,\n\n458\n00:28:17.705 --> 00:28:20.870\nwhereever those profiles are stored,\nyou can copy and paste that as well.\n\n459\n00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.590\nAnd if we have time, we'll look at that.\n\n460\n00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:27.920\nBut using their interface, I think\nthat that's important to understand.\n\n461\n00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.850\nIf I were importing from another\nbrowser I have the ability.\n\n462\n00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.060\nI also have the ability\nto import from a file.\n\n463\n00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:37.290\nSo think about importing, bringing\nin favorites into Internet Explorer.\n\n464\n00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:41.910\nSo if you are taking the exam, just think\nabout the logistics of what they're\n\n465\n00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.420\nasking you and\nwhich way those favorites are traveling.\n\n466\n00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.778\nSo here we want to export to a file.\n\n467\n00:28:47.778 --> 00:28:50.050\nWe'll hit next.\n\n468\n00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:54.320\nAnd I have the ability to select feeds,\nand right over here,\n\n469\n00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.500\nthis little feeds option.\n\n470\n00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.050\nIf I had any feeds like man,\n\n471\n00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:02.400\nI have information coming at me\nfrom every angle on social media.\n\n472\n00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.050\nI don't want anymore feeds,\nbut you might like them, and\n\n473\n00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:09.400\nyou might want to bring them over\nwith your favorites and your cookies.\n\n474\n00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.190\nI say leave that stuff.\n\n475\n00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.400\nI'm just gonna take my favorites for now.\n\n476\n00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.360\nWe'll hit Next.\n\n477\n00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:20.540\nAnd if you just wanted to just bring\nMike's Temporary in that favorites bar,\n\n478\n00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.000\nor bring the whole favorites folder,\nwhich I'm gonna do.\n\n479\n00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.560\nWe'll hit Next.\n\n480\n00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.670\nAnd by default here I'm placing\nthese under My Documents.\n\n481\n00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:34.780\nBut if I wanted to,\nI could just go ahead under, let's say,\n\n482\n00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:39.992\nmaybe Desktop or something like that,\nand I could go ahead and\n\n483\n00:29:39.992 --> 00:29:43.919\nput this right there on my desktop,\nhit Save.\n\n484\n00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:46.310\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; And a username.\n\n485\n00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:53.050\n&gt;&gt; I didn't delete the name so maybe,\nor you can see the file extension there.\n\n486\n00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.510\nIt's going to be HTM because\nit does save it as a web page,\n\n487\n00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:58.290\nlike that HTML rendering.\n\n488\n00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.450\nSo we're just gonna say.\n\n489\n00:30:01.378 --> 00:30:04.570\nFav for my favorites, and it should\nput that file extension on there.\n\n490\n00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:10.330\nYep, and so we'll hit Export and\nthen Finish,\n\n491\n00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:15.680\nand you can see that if I just minimize\nthis, sitting over here on my desktop,\n\n492\n00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.670\nand if you clicked on that, it really\ndoesn't do a whole lot for you there.\n\n493\n00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:23.620\nIf you wanted to save that you could\nnavigate to ITPro.TV just by clicking this\n\n494\n00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:29.800\nhyperlink there, or\nour eBay link that we have here.\n\n495\n00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.400\nYou guys see how that works.\n\n496\n00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:36.410\nBut normally what people do is then import\nit, so whichever browser you may be\n\n497\n00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:41.830\nmigrating to,\nyou would follow their steps to go ahead.\n\n498\n00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:46.540\nAnd you saw here in Internet Explorer,\nyou could also import the same way.\n\n499\n00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.150\nBut just real quick, let me show you where\nthat would be located here on my machine.\n\n500\n00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:56.140\nSo under my C drive and\nunder Users, my account here,\n\n501\n00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.895\nthen Vaughn created Justin Timberlake's\naccount on my computer, also.\n\n502\n00:30:59.895 --> 00:31:02.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But let's take a look at mine, and\n\n503\n00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.360\nunder my Favorites, and\n\n504\n00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:08.350\nyou can see that with that same little\nstar icon that we're looking at.\n\n505\n00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:11.900\nWe'll double click there, and\nwe can see, oops, we can see\n\n506\n00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.590\nBing is going to be the default that\nthe operating system puts in there.\n\n507\n00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:18.440\nI didn't put that in there,\n\n508\n00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:23.380\nbut we have the eBay icon as\nwell as our ITPro.TV icon.\n\n509\n00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.980\nAnd then again, that sub-folder for\nthat favorites bar because we kept that.\n\n510\n00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.900\nWe carried it on over.\n\n511\n00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:33.250\nOr that's just the folder that's\nsitting there under that option.\n\n512\n00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:35.980\nSo I could go through,\n\n513\n00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:41.100\nhit this up arrow if I wanted to\nright-click, and then select Copy and\n\n514\n00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:46.835\npaste it to my desktop or some external\nmedia to bring to a new machine.\n\n515\n00:31:46.835 --> 00:31:48.660\nCouple different options there,\n\n516\n00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.120\nbut I think that's about it for\nInternet Explorer.\n\n517\n00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.710\nI think if we take a look at Edge and\n\n518\n00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:57.550\nthen next show we can really see\nthe improvements that have been made,\n\n519\n00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:00.830\nand just a lot more that\nwe have available to us.\n\n520\n00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.020\n&gt;&gt; Alright, sounds like a plan.\n\n521\n00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.458\nWe'll see if we are ready to transition\nfrom Internet Explorer over to Edge with\n\n522\n00:32:05.458 --> 00:32:06.880\nall those cool new features.\n\n523\n00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.983\nWe appreciate that, Cherokee.\n\n524\n00:32:07.983 --> 00:32:10.420\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n525\n00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.210\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n526\n00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:14.040\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n527\n00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.784\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n528\n00:32:15.784 --> 00:32:21.773\n[MUSIC]\n\n529\n00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:25.396\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

Francisco,\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK].\n\n3\n00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:08.225\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:12.152\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.152 --> 00:00:15.460\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.790\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.930\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n8\n00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.510\nIn this episode,\nwe're actually doing the part two,\n\n9\n00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.330\nwe're continuing our thought process\non Edge and Internet Explorer.\n\n10\n00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.730\nAnd back in the studio is none\nother than Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.455\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:30.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.470\nWe're like traveling chronologically here\nin time, we looked at Internet Explorer,\n\n14\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.030\nso now we're gonna take\na look at Edge in this show.\n\n15\n00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.053\nNow, a lot of the features\nthat we've seen and\n\n16\n00:00:41.053 --> 00:00:46.180\nwe were talking about in Internet Explorer\n11 carry on over to Edge.\n\n17\n00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.790\nThere really aren't a ton of differences,\n\n18\n00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.020\nI'll cover what is\ndifferent between the two.\n\n19\n00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.380\nSo I think this show might be a little\nbit shorter, but we'll just have to see,\n\n20\n00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.850\nyou never know with me talking.\n\n21\n00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.600\nSo let's go ahead and launch Edge, so\nEdge, I'm pretty sure by default, it's\n\n22\n00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.810\ngoing to be sitting there in your taskbar\njust out of the box with Microsoft.\n\n23\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.460\nBut like I said, it is a little easier to\nfind, we don't have to worry about any of\n\n24\n00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.550\nthose command line shortcuts or\nsearch options there.\n\n25\n00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.110\nThey want you to know that Edge exists.\n\n26\n00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.170\nNow, when Edge first was deployed or\n\n27\n00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.330\nrolled out, and let me just\nopen a new tab, that's a little\n\n28\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.880\nobnoxious there with all [LAUGH],\nit wasn't so\n\n29\n00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.750\nwidely adopted,\nthere were issues with Edge.\n\n30\n00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.860\nI'm not gonna sugar coat anything.\n\n31\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.610\nAnd they've been working on it, and\n\n32\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.270\nin the iterations here of Windows 10,\nthere have been improvements.\n\n33\n00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.030\nBut I think people just kinda had\na sour taste in their mouth, and\n\n34\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.130\nthey're not ready to fully adopt Edge yet.\n\n35\n00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.970\nSo honestly, honestly,\n\n36\n00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.480\nI wasn't using Edge, but getting ready for\nthis show and looking at all\n\n37\n00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.740\nthe features that are available,\nI do think that I was underestimating it.\n\n38\n00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.830\nSo who knows, maybe you were too.\n\n39\n00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.640\nLet's first take a look\nat the differences.\n\n40\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.240\nSo I said they weren't that\nmany noticeable differences,\n\n41\n00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.670\nlet me just clarify.\n\n42\n00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.520\nThere are a lot of differences,\n\n43\n00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.680\nespecially with the underpinning\ntechnologies that focus on security here.\n\n44\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.570\nNow, from a user standpoint,\nnot as many differences, right?\n\n45\n00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.445\nSo the first thing I wanna talk about\nhere is going to be this option,\n\n46\n00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:37.820\nthis little icon.\n\n47\n00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.900\nAnd let me just zoom in so\nwe can see this a little bit better.\n\n48\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.060\nIt's kind of like a star with three\nhorizontal lines, it's called the Hub.\n\n49\n00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.533\nIt sounds like some cool restaurant or\nsomething, but\n\n50\n00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:53.770\nthe Hub is going to simply be kind\nof like a storage or a hub, right?\n\n51\n00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n52\n00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.900\n&gt;&gt; A location where I can easily\naccess some pretty cool things.\n\n53\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.550\nSome of this stuff,\nyou may already recognize the icons.\n\n54\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.740\nSo the graphics may be slightly different,\nbut remember, star, what is that for?\n\n55\n00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.480\nWell, our favorites.\n\n56\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.020\nAnd you can assume that to be safe here.\n\n57\n00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.520\nIt's still gonna be\nrepresenting favorites as well.\n\n58\n00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.470\nThis is a new icon, it's called Reading\nList, and so I guess those are books or\n\n59\n00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.210\npages that are stacked vertically there.\n\n60\n00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.183\nI really like this feature,\nwhen I pulled up the browser Edge here and\n\n61\n00:03:26.183 --> 00:03:30.983\nEbay came up, actually, let's zoom out and\ntake a look at that and\n\n62\n00:03:30.983 --> 00:03:34.840\nwhat that does, or\neven something like what is this,\n\n63\n00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.100\nthis is just my home,\n&gt;&gt; MSN.\n\n64\n00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so for\nMSN they're pretty big offenders also, so\n\n65\n00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.040\nlooking at all, with any kind\nof news page with a lot of text,\n\n66\n00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.860\nI think that this option\nis really great for.\n\n67\n00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.770\nSo I don't know,\n\n68\n00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.792\nlet's just go to technology,\nsomething relevant to us, right?\n\n69\n00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:53.758\nOkay.\nWell,\n\n70\n00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:57.070\n[LAUGH] probably didn't\nwanna click on this.\n\n71\n00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.175\nIt's a touchy subject.\n\n72\n00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:00.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But let's just go ahead and\n\n73\n00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.980\ntake a look at some of\nthe latest happenings.\n\n74\n00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.960\nI see my headline, right,\nI see a photo, and\n\n75\n00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.240\nI see all sorts of little, I don't know if\nyou wanna called this graphic pollution or\n\n76\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.240\nsomething, all of these advertisements,\nright?\n\n77\n00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.448\nNobody likes ads, ask Mark, right?\n\n78\n00:04:16.448 --> 00:04:19.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So what we can do here is in\n\n79\n00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.060\nour Hub, and also actually, this is where\nI want to switch to that Reading View.\n\n80\n00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.750\nMy Reading List, and\nI was getting the two confused,\n\n81\n00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.380\nI don't want that to happen to you.\n\n82\n00:04:30.676 --> 00:04:34.930\nReading View is what I was thinking,\nbut watch, you click that and\n\n83\n00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.640\nit changes it to a less cluttered view\n\n84\n00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.710\nof that article that was\npublished here on this site.\n\n85\n00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.770\nSo I actually really like this option\nto get rid of all those ads and\n\n86\n00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.190\ntake a look at that.\n\n87\n00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.840\nNow, if I wanted to save this article for\n\n88\n00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.620\nlater, that's where the stack\ncomes into play here.\n\n89\n00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.448\nSo my Reading List.\n\n90\n00:04:57.448 --> 00:05:02.265\nSo whenever I click on the star icon here,\nI not only have\n\n91\n00:05:02.265 --> 00:05:07.596\nthe ability to go ahead and\nadd that as a favorite, actually,\n\n92\n00:05:07.596 --> 00:05:14.800\nso this star up here in the actual URL\nline there, that's how I would access it.\n\n93\n00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.444\nSo I click on that star,\nadd to your favorites or\n\n94\n00:05:18.444 --> 00:05:23.580\nReading List, and to the right you can see\nthis is blue, it's already highlighted.\n\n95\n00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.330\nI have the ability to either chose\nfavorite, and/or Reading List there.\n\n96\n00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.190\nI could keep that default headline,\n\n97\n00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.790\nor make it something a little\nmore short or customized there.\n\n98\n00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.840\nLet's just go ahead and\nadd it the way it is.\n\n99\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.699\nAnd now, when I go into the Hub,\nclick on the Readings List,\n\n100\n00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.360\nyou can see a quick access the link there.\n\n101\n00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.700\nSo that is actually pretty cool.\n\n102\n00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.160\nBooks, I have the ability to also\nimport books as well, so ebooks,\n\n103\n00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.920\nwe're talking about here.\n\n104\n00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.750\nIf I have, something I think is really\ncool about Edge, if I log in with\n\n105\n00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.860\na Microsoft account, Xbox,\nOutlook, whatever it may be here,\n\n106\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.230\nI can sync my information\nacross multiple devices.\n\n107\n00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.260\nSo if you think about the whole\nconcept of Windows 10,\n\n108\n00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.220\nthis is an operating system to\nbe ran on multiple devices.\n\n109\n00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.620\nSo I do have the ability there,\n\n110\n00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.580\nI could also always go into Microsoft\nStore and buy some books as well.\n\n111\n00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.429\nThis icon probably looks very similar,\n\n112\n00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:35.170\nvery reminiscent to that older history\nicon that we spoke about within IE 11.\n\n113\n00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.734\nAnd it's a pretty simple interface,\njust looking at my last hour,\n\n114\n00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:43.256\nand they have different\ntime increments there, and\n\n115\n00:06:43.256 --> 00:06:46.875\nyou could clear or\ndelete that history accordingly.\n\n116\n00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:50.225\nAnd they kind of break it down into\nlittle fly out branches here for\n\n117\n00:06:50.225 --> 00:06:52.245\nearlier today and stuff like that.\n\n118\n00:06:54.275 --> 00:06:57.165\nThis option is gonna really\nbe focusing on my downloads.\n\n119\n00:06:57.165 --> 00:07:00.595\nSo if I have downloaded\nany kind of files or\n\n120\n00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:06.400\nanything right here from Edge,\nthis is where they would reside.\n\n121\n00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.240\nAlternatively, this would bring me back\n\n122\n00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.820\nin file explorer to that location where\nthose downloads live and reside as well.\n\n123\n00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.090\nSo that's the Hub,\nthat's a new feature there.\n\n124\n00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.705\nAnd the Reading View is also, I had to\nthink to make sure I was saying it right,\n\n125\n00:07:22.705 --> 00:07:27.190\nnot Reading List, the Reading View\nis also a new feature there as well.\n\n126\n00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.800\nNow, this is a new feature too.\n\n127\n00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.850\nBeing able to mark up and\nadd notes and annotate.\n\n128\n00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.690\nSo here I have that article I was reading,\nbut I could do this pretty much with\n\n129\n00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.873\nanything that's gonna be sitting\nhere inside of the browser.\n\n130\n00:07:41.873 --> 00:07:46.853\nAnd let's take a look at that,\nthis framework here, the actual design\n\n131\n00:07:46.853 --> 00:07:51.999\nis built upon OneNote, or if you're\nfamiliar with at all, the Microsoft\n\n132\n00:07:51.999 --> 00:07:57.243\napplication to help really Really\ndesigned for note taking and creating.\n\n133\n00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:59.441\nPretty cool app, if I may say.\n\n134\n00:07:59.441 --> 00:08:00.499\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n\n135\n00:08:00.499 --> 00:08:01.370\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to pay for this.\n\n136\n00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.490\nThis is actually integrated\nright in here with this browser.\n\n137\n00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.070\nAnd I have the ability to go ahead and\nmark up with pens and highlighters.\n\n138\n00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.350\nThis little finger option,\nif I do have a touch-enabled device,\n\n139\n00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.180\nwill let me perform these functions here.\n\n140\n00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.370\nJust a lot of really cool stuff,\nour eraser function,.\n\n141\n00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.640\nThis is actually something\nI could find very helpful.\n\n142\n00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.309\nAdd a note, and\nyou'll notice my cursor has changed into\n\n143\n00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:30.140\nthe larger plus key symbol there.\n\n144\n00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.320\nSo I don't know, what do we\nwanna say about Mark Zuckerberg?\n\n145\n00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.342\nMay be I should be careful\nwith this note here.\n\n146\n00:08:36.342 --> 00:08:39.098\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'll go ahead and click it, and\n\n147\n00:08:39.098 --> 00:08:41.501\nthen I'll say, [LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n148\n00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:43.026\n&gt;&gt; Good luck in your testimony\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n149\n00:08:43.026 --> 00:08:44.807\n&gt;&gt; Just wish him well.\n\n150\n00:08:44.807 --> 00:08:46.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good luck, Mark.\n\n151\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.786\nAll right, whatever, so\nnow that I have this note here,\n\n152\n00:08:51.786 --> 00:08:54.488\nyou can kind of move it around.\n\n153\n00:08:54.488 --> 00:08:58.529\nOkay, I just got click happy, and if you\ngo behind my head there you can see that\n\n154\n00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:01.296\nthere's a second note, but\nI didn't want that one.\n\n155\n00:09:01.296 --> 00:09:03.760\nSo I'm gonna quickly just hit delete.\n\n156\n00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.410\nAnd then I think you click on the one, and\nnow if I grab this one and drag it around.\n\n157\n00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:13.400\nI could put in a pertinent location\nwhere it makes sense in that text.\n\n158\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.790\nAnd maybe I wanna draw attention\nto that particular area, so\n\n159\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.110\nI can select my highlighter options here.\n\n160\n00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:25.589\nAnd then go ahead and, let me see if\nI'm on that with my actual pen there.\n\n161\n00:09:26.706 --> 00:09:35.440\n[INAUDIBLE] Let me make sure I didn't\nput it on the finger taps here.\n\n162\n00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.090\nOkay, I did.\n\n163\n00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:41.030\nSo you can see, I'm just using my finger\nhere to go ahead and highlight this text.\n\n164\n00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.740\nI can even click over the pen and\n\n165\n00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.220\nthen say like, I don't know.\n\n166\n00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.820\nThis is gonna be miserable.\n\n167\n00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.794\nGo and then we'll just put FB for\nFacebook, yay, okay.\n\n168\n00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:56.485\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can see where this would be very\n\n169\n00:09:56.485 --> 00:09:58.550\nuseful, though,\nif you were working with a colleague and\n\n170\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.290\nwanted to make annotations on a web\npage and send it to them, maybe.\n\n171\n00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.560\nCan you save this and send it?\n\n172\n00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.490\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\nActually,\n\n173\n00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.680\nthat's one of the coolest,\nthanks for reminding me, Mike.\n\n174\n00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.869\nYeah, so this little button over here\nin the top right-hand corner, so\n\n175\n00:10:10.869 --> 00:10:15.530\nof course you have the ability to save\nit locally or to some other location.\n\n176\n00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.360\nBut really about collaboration,\n\n177\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.920\nlike you're talking about, right, so\nI could see this really being used.\n\n178\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:26.770\nAnd if you guys recall back to an earlier\nshow when we were looking at my people,\n\n179\n00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:32.000\nI had some people like Mike here, and\nI also had Nate, Maricia and Angie.\n\n180\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.750\nThese are the people that Microsoft\nthinks I interact with most if I allow\n\n181\n00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.106\nthe operating system to access my people.\n\n182\n00:10:38.106 --> 00:10:39.030\n&gt;&gt; Back from the people icon.\n\n183\n00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, from that people application.\n\n184\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.180\nSo maybe I do work with you a lot,\nand I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n185\n00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.235\nsend you this particular\nannotated article.\n\n186\n00:10:47.235 --> 00:10:51.240\nThen all I would have to do is go ahead\nand click on your icon right there, so\n\n187\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.240\nthat's pretty cool.\n\n188\n00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.116\nAnd behind my head I do have additional\noptions here to copy the link\n\n189\n00:10:57.116 --> 00:10:58.607\nto actually set up.\n\n190\n00:10:58.607 --> 00:11:03.770\nNow, Edge is really leveraging on Cortana.\n\n191\n00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.160\nThere are a lot really cool things\nwhere we can integrate her.\n\n192\n00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.160\nSo we can set up reminders like,\nhey, remind me to go ahead and\n\n193\n00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.150\nfinish reading and\nmarking up this article or whatever.\n\n194\n00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.040\nFeedback hub, mail, Facebook,\n\n195\n00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.390\nSkype, all sorts of different\napplications that I could easily share.\n\n196\n00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.610\nSo definitely pretty cool there.\n\n197\n00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.300\nSo yeah, I guess those are the big\nthree features that we see.\n\n198\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.090\nWe see that reading view, we see the hub,\nand then we also see our web notes, and\n\n199\n00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.150\nthat's what they call it here to\ngo ahead and mark those things up.\n\n200\n00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.320\nLet me just close out of here.\n\n201\n00:11:44.909 --> 00:11:45.950\nWe don't want to see those changes.\n\n202\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.310\nWe were just playing around there.\n\n203\n00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.550\nOur little ellipsis button is going to be\n\n204\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:57.590\ncomparable to our gear cog\nsetting that we saw in IE.\n\n205\n00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.590\nAnd I do have the ability\nto create new windows.\n\n206\n00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:05.080\nAnd also you may recognize our\nnew InPrivate window, again,\n\n207\n00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:10.950\nwith that more restrictive,\nmore private-type browsing experience.\n\n208\n00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:17.280\nOne thing that you probably won't see out\nof the box if you're just setting up your\n\n209\n00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.755\npersonal computer, unless you are in like\na domain environment, you might see this.\n\n210\n00:12:21.755 --> 00:12:23.356\nIs this second option right here,\nlet me zoom and\n\n211\n00:12:23.356 --> 00:12:24.694\nsee if you can really take a look at that.\n\n212\n00:12:24.694 --> 00:12:29.180\nIt says, New Application Guard window.\n\n213\n00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.560\nAll right, well,\nwhat is Application Guard and\n\n214\n00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.380\nwhy are talking about\nit here in a browser?\n\n215\n00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.220\nLet me just clarify terminology for\na moment.\n\n216\n00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.890\nSo whenever you see the word apps\nlike APPS, Microsoft is usually\n\n217\n00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:47.820\nreferring to Windows store,\nMicrosoft store applications.\n\n218\n00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.160\nIf you see the word\napplication written out,\n\n219\n00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.330\nIt's usually referencing those binaries.\n\n220\n00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.791\nAnd back in the day,\nI used to call them programs.\n\n221\n00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:00.420\nWe said, we installed this program or\nwhatever.\n\n222\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.720\nSo that would be another use of the term.\n\n223\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.618\nBut here in context of a browser,\nyou can hear the term web application,\n\n224\n00:13:07.618 --> 00:13:12.597\nand it could just referring to a site\nin the way that that actual website was\n\n225\n00:13:12.597 --> 00:13:17.120\ndesigned and the functionality it\noffers within the web browser.\n\n226\n00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.470\nSo technically,\nwe are accessing apps here,\n\n227\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.180\nnot maybe in the sense\nthat you would think.\n\n228\n00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.100\nNow let me talk about this for\n\n229\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:31.450\na little bit more because it's\nnot a viable option for everyone.\n\n230\n00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.830\nYou have to have some\nhardware requirements.\n\n231\n00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:41.760\nSo, if I just pull up my search here, and\nI type in turn Windows features on or\n\n232\n00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.080\noff, and it brings up that older\ncommand prompt-style applet here.\n\n233\n00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.065\nLet me be patient, it might have popped\nbehind, or I didn’t, there we go.\n\n234\n00:13:51.981 --> 00:13:56.500\nHere you see the ability to go ahead and\nturn the features on or off.\n\n235\n00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:02.980\nNow, currently on this machine,\nI do not have Hyper-V enabled.\n\n236\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:08.180\nWhat I do have enabled is going to be\nmy Windows Defender Application Guard,\n\n237\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.960\nand you can see that right here.\n\n238\n00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.260\nWindows Defender Application Guard\nis a technology that\n\n239\n00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.830\nleverages on virtualization containers.\n\n240\n00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:25.130\nSo although you don't see Hyper-V\nas being turned on per se,\n\n241\n00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.779\nin this machine,\nit actually is using components of\n\n242\n00:14:29.779 --> 00:14:34.740\nHyper-V to allow a Windows\nDefender Application Guard to run.\n\n243\n00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.040\nIf that makes sense.\n\n244\n00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:41.890\nSo any kind of hardware requirements\nsuch as the 4 gig minimum of RAM and\n\n245\n00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:46.884\nthings like SLAT and having hardware\nthat will allow Hyper-V to run,\n\n246\n00:14:46.884 --> 00:14:50.040\nneeds to be present in order to\ntake advantage of this feature.\n\n247\n00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:55.430\nSo all I did was I selected this button,\njust typed in turn on features like you\n\n248\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:00.890\nguys just saw, put this little\ncheckmark there, restarted the machine.\n\n249\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:07.080\nAnd that's how I was able to go ahead and\nhave that option on Microsoft Edge here.\n\n250\n00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.900\nI will say this.\n\n251\n00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.700\nThe first time you actually, and\n\n252\n00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:15.620\nI put deployment guides in\nthe show notes for you as well.\n\n253\n00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.222\nAnd it even says this in\nthe deployment guide.\n\n254\n00:15:17.222 --> 00:15:22.730\nThe very first time that you accessed\nthis feature, it will take awhile.\n\n255\n00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:26.310\nIt took about ten minutes for\nme to load up my very first page.\n\n256\n00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.840\nBut it shouldn't take that long now.\n\n257\n00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:34.930\nSo, If we select our new Application Guard\nwindow, it'll take a little bit of time.\n\n258\n00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:38.020\nYou saw that, just not a terrible amount.\n\n259\n00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.740\nBut it is so cool what's actually\nhappening behind the scenes.\n\n260\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:48.295\nThat container is being created\ndynamically on the fly,\n\n261\n00:15:48.295 --> 00:15:53.049\nof my system, so\nI have basically a little baby.\n\n262\n00:15:53.049 --> 00:15:55.801\n&gt;&gt; I won't say for one operating\nsystem it is a container, but\n\n263\n00:15:55.801 --> 00:15:59.450\nit's a virtualization container\nthat I'm using right here.\n\n264\n00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.580\nSo what it does is isolate\nmy browsing capabilities.\n\n265\n00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.447\nIf I went to a malicious site or\nwebsite and\n\n266\n00:16:07.447 --> 00:16:14.340\nhad some malicious code run on it,\nthen the code would not, should not.\n\n267\n00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.636\nI don't wanna ever have like our\ndefinites here, but the idea behind\n\n268\n00:16:19.636 --> 00:16:24.932\nit is that malicious code will be\nisolated inside of the container and\n\n269\n00:16:24.932 --> 00:16:29.796\nwill not infiltrate down to my host or\nguest operating system.\n\n270\n00:16:29.796 --> 00:16:31.350\nPretty cool.\n\n271\n00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.574\nI mean, that is so cool in my opinion.\n\n272\n00:16:34.574 --> 00:16:39.017\nThere is some sacrifice which we see\na lot with security when we do have that\n\n273\n00:16:39.017 --> 00:16:39.790\ntrade off.\n\n274\n00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:44.002\nSo when running an Application Guard\nwindow, I many not have all\n\n275\n00:16:44.002 --> 00:16:48.456\nthe features and functionality\nthat I've grown to love ad expect.\n\n276\n00:16:48.456 --> 00:16:53.263\nSo very common things may be limited and\nlet me just say,\n\n277\n00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:57.100\nthere are two modes of Application Guard.\n\n278\n00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.764\nI'm running in standalone\nmode here on my desktop,\n\n279\n00:16:59.764 --> 00:17:01.833\nbecause I'm not connected to a domain.\n\n280\n00:17:01.833 --> 00:17:07.314\nThere is an enterprise mode that will\nallow me to have more granular control\n\n281\n00:17:07.314 --> 00:17:12.850\nover my end users and their behavior,\nhow Application Guard works.\n\n282\n00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:17.705\nSo I may see restrictions,\nsuch as copy and paste.\n\n283\n00:17:17.705 --> 00:17:19.250\nWhat's the big deal with that?\n\n284\n00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:24.322\nWell, if you think about it, what if I\nhad a document on my host computer and\n\n285\n00:17:24.322 --> 00:17:28.283\nit had a password and I copied and\npasted it into a browser?\n\n286\n00:17:28.283 --> 00:17:32.460\nYou could be weakening your\noverall security by doing that.\n\n287\n00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.228\nSo they do know that these limitations\nexist, but they actually exist for\n\n288\n00:17:36.228 --> 00:17:36.787\na reason.\n\n289\n00:17:36.787 --> 00:17:40.380\nThings like being able\nto print the web page.\n\n290\n00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.767\nYou don't have that feature per say.\n\n291\n00:17:43.767 --> 00:17:49.480\nYou could say or were save,\nexcuse me, save.\n\n292\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:54.624\nBut you could say, file print\nto PDF as kind of a work around.\n\n293\n00:17:54.624 --> 00:17:56.035\nBut like uploading and downloading,\n\n294\n00:17:56.035 --> 00:17:57.806\nthey're not gonna allow\nthose sort of things.\n\n295\n00:17:57.806 --> 00:18:01.074\nBecause that would reduce\nthe overall security and\n\n296\n00:18:01.074 --> 00:18:06.390\nkind of undermine the entire concept\nhere for our Application Guard.\n\n297\n00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.704\nYou can notice the difference\nhere between my windows,\n\n298\n00:18:10.704 --> 00:18:14.207\nmy different windows\nthat I have available.\n\n299\n00:18:14.207 --> 00:18:17.040\nOops, getting all click happy here.\n\n300\n00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.713\nThe orange line here.\n\n301\n00:18:18.713 --> 00:18:22.982\nSo everything under my line is going to be\n\n302\n00:18:22.982 --> 00:18:28.580\nalerting you that you\nare in Application Guard.\n\n303\n00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:33.652\nAs a matter of fact, if I do hit\nlike Ctrl+P to print here within my\n\n304\n00:18:33.652 --> 00:18:38.914\nApplication Guard window,\nthat orange graphical element carries\n\n305\n00:18:38.914 --> 00:18:44.013\nover into the new window to just\nkind of remind me to be cognizant.\n\n306\n00:18:44.013 --> 00:18:47.920\nHey, you should be using security\nhere to keep that in mind.\n\n307\n00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.544\nDon't anything stupid, Cherokee.\n\n308\n00:18:49.544 --> 00:18:51.593\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, pretty cool.\n\n309\n00:18:51.593 --> 00:18:58.498\nI'm trying to think if I'm forgetting\nanything about this, but I don't know.\n\n310\n00:18:58.498 --> 00:18:59.143\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n311\n00:18:59.143 --> 00:19:02.770\nthat's a feature I really haven't\nhad a chance to play much with yet.\n\n312\n00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:03.754\nBut I'm looking forward\nto trying that out.\n\n313\n00:19:03.754 --> 00:19:08.685\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I will say this to just think\nabout how the impact of Hyper-V on your\n\n314\n00:19:08.685 --> 00:19:13.400\nsystem, so you may have that same\nkind of performance impact to those.\n\n315\n00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.585\nIf your hardware isn't\nconducive to Hyper-V,\n\n316\n00:19:16.585 --> 00:19:19.854\nthen it might not be a feature\nthat you want to run.\n\n317\n00:19:19.854 --> 00:19:23.600\nLike a solid state drive,\nit's a lot of RAM.\n\n318\n00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.936\nThose are the kind of things you'd\nprobably wanna think about there.\n\n319\n00:19:26.936 --> 00:19:28.415\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool, what else do we got?\n\n320\n00:19:28.415 --> 00:19:32.360\n&gt;&gt; So we have the normal things, nothing.\n\n321\n00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.401\nI don't wanna spend a lot of time on\nsilly things like themes and colors, and\n\n322\n00:19:36.401 --> 00:19:36.983\nso forth.\n\n323\n00:19:36.983 --> 00:19:40.541\nJust I would like you to go and\nspend time, and look at that.\n\n324\n00:19:40.541 --> 00:19:43.025\nI do think like I said in the last show,\n\n325\n00:19:43.025 --> 00:19:47.610\nit's important to understand\nhow to deal with favorites.\n\n326\n00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.291\nFavorites are one of those things\nthat people care about and\n\n327\n00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:54.262\nit's personal to them.\n\n328\n00:19:54.262 --> 00:19:57.100\nSo if you're working as\na help desk technician or\n\n329\n00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.920\njust helping out within your environment,\npeople want to have their favorites.\n\n330\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.921\nSo making sure that we are able to\nfacilitate any kind of migrations from\n\n331\n00:20:05.921 --> 00:20:09.601\nother browsers or even older versions,\nmaybe even like IE11.\n\n332\n00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:11.138\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n333\n00:20:11.138 --> 00:20:14.182\nas an enterprise worker\nyou build up a list of\n\n334\n00:20:14.182 --> 00:20:18.727\nfavorites that you use in a daily\nbasis to do whatever it is you do.\n\n335\n00:20:18.727 --> 00:20:23.825\nYour IT rolls in with a new machine or\nan updated operating system, a new browser\n\n336\n00:20:23.825 --> 00:20:29.210\nand it can take a long time before I can\nget all those bookmarks built back up.\n\n337\n00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.782\nSo a really easy way to keep\nmy users productive and\n\n338\n00:20:31.782 --> 00:20:34.853\nease that transition process\nfrom one browser to the next.\n\n339\n00:20:34.853 --> 00:20:36.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no doubt, Mike.\n\n340\n00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:38.395\nEdge even takes it\na little bit step further.\n\n341\n00:20:38.395 --> 00:20:42.945\nTakes a step further here and makes it\nsuper easy to go ahead, and import.\n\n342\n00:20:42.945 --> 00:20:46.722\nSo I have this button here,\nI go ahead and select import settings.\n\n343\n00:20:46.722 --> 00:20:50.631\nAnd wow, it detects the different\nbrowsers that I already have installed on\n\n344\n00:20:50.631 --> 00:20:51.370\nthis system.\n\n345\n00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.209\nSo I have my Internet Explorer and\n\n346\n00:20:53.209 --> 00:20:56.697\nyou guys saw hopefully in that\nlast show what that looked like.\n\n347\n00:20:56.697 --> 00:20:58.930\nWe created a couple of favorites.\n\n348\n00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.728\nI also have the ability to kind\nof go beyond Microsoft here and\n\n349\n00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:07.653\nreach out into a third party browsers\nas well, and go ahead, and import them.\n\n350\n00:21:07.653 --> 00:21:12.858\nNow if you had followed steps from a third\nparty browser or even Internet Explorer\n\n351\n00:21:12.858 --> 00:21:17.905\nand you had that file like the one that we\ncreated on my desktop in the last show,\n\n352\n00:21:17.905 --> 00:21:23.290\nthen you could go ahead and import it\nthere as well with this option right here.\n\n353\n00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:27.104\nYou alternatively,\nyou could export that too.\n\n354\n00:21:27.104 --> 00:21:30.340\nSo that's kind of cool.\n\n355\n00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.387\nMan, there's just so much.\n\n356\n00:21:32.387 --> 00:21:36.370\nPinning this pane,\nthe little pin option is pretty cool.\n\n357\n00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:40.670\nI can pin my pages to my task bar.\n\n358\n00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:46.190\nLet's see, pin this page to\nthe task bar here behind my head.\n\n359\n00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.146\nPin the page to start.\n\n360\n00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:50.071\nSo talking about having those favorites,\n\n361\n00:21:50.071 --> 00:21:55.530\nthis is just another way we can access\nthose pages quickly to be more efficient.\n\n362\n00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:59.483\nThere are so\nmany different things going on here.\n\n363\n00:21:59.483 --> 00:22:02.370\nCasting media two device.\n\n364\n00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.576\nSo this is something we didn't\nsee here in Internet Explorer.\n\n365\n00:22:05.576 --> 00:22:08.096\nAnd again,\nthis is just thinking about that mobility.\n\n366\n00:22:08.096 --> 00:22:11.335\nAnd hint saying the ability to,\nI don't know for\n\n367\n00:22:11.335 --> 00:22:14.500\nme giving presentations\nlike how cool is this?\n\n368\n00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:19.530\nI can go ahead and cast my media to any\nkind of device that they may find in\n\n369\n00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:24.732\nthe environment, maybe I have a particular\ndisplay or TV that is mounted\n\n370\n00:22:24.732 --> 00:22:29.447\nin a conference room to make it\nsuper easy for our end users there.\n\n371\n00:22:29.447 --> 00:22:33.516\nAnother really cool feature is\nthe ability to go ahead and\n\n372\n00:22:33.516 --> 00:22:36.500\nI guess kind of park things, if you will.\n\n373\n00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.172\nSo here we have, well,\nlet's close out our blank tab.\n\n374\n00:22:40.172 --> 00:22:43.160\nBut we've got eBay and here we have MSN.\n\n375\n00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.367\nSo if I didn't want to abandon these tabs\nand forget about them altogether and\n\n376\n00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:51.124\nwanted to come back and\nrevisit these sites later,\n\n377\n00:22:51.124 --> 00:22:54.220\nI do have the ability to go ahead and\nset these tabs aside.\n\n378\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.312\nAnd so here I just have my main\nleading page, my home page.\n\n379\n00:22:58.312 --> 00:23:00.762\nAnd again,\nI do have the ability if I go on and\n\n380\n00:23:00.762 --> 00:23:04.090\ncome to those studies start\na home page more specifically.\n\n381\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.612\nBut if I want to go ahead and pull-up and\n\n382\n00:23:07.612 --> 00:23:11.576\nexpand those sites I was just working\nwith, I know this kind of small.\n\n383\n00:23:11.576 --> 00:23:14.821\nIt's just like a couple of\nweb pages here for this icon.\n\n384\n00:23:14.821 --> 00:23:17.702\nYou go ahead and it says,\ntabs you've set aside.\n\n385\n00:23:17.702 --> 00:23:18.644\nClick on that and\n\n386\n00:23:18.644 --> 00:23:22.760\nyou have the ability to see those\ndifferent groupings that you may have.\n\n387\n00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:28.820\nSo if I just hit store tabs,\nthen voila, super easy.\n\n388\n00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:29.764\nJust-\n&gt;&gt; Very handy.\n\n389\n00:23:29.764 --> 00:23:34.386\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's the thing is getting\nfamiliar with the tools that you can\n\n390\n00:23:34.386 --> 00:23:36.020\nbecome more efficient.\n\n391\n00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.794\nI think that's when you'll\nkinda learned to love Edge.\n\n392\n00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:42.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Speaking about that love relationship,\n\n393\n00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.885\nlet's think about the love hate\nrelationship side of Edge and\n\n394\n00:23:45.885 --> 00:23:48.682\nthat was with those early adopters like,\nMike with you.\n\n395\n00:23:48.682 --> 00:23:53.358\nWhen you said you weren't able to\nSuccessfully navigate to certain sites,\n\n396\n00:23:53.358 --> 00:23:57.887\nand that's because those sites may\nbe older sites, and they're coded,\n\n397\n00:23:57.887 --> 00:24:01.010\nthey're no optimized\nto be working in Edge.\n\n398\n00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.950\nAnd in the last show we did take\na look at that developer mode there,\n\n399\n00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:06.110\nand here I think it's F12.\n\n400\n00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:11.870\nIf we hit that tab,\nagain we can see the emulation section\n\n401\n00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:17.070\nhere under our mode, really how\nthis web page was designed to run.\n\n402\n00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.770\nSo some of our older pages,\nwere designed for\n\n403\n00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.325\nIE8, and\nhopefully not anything less than that.\n\n404\n00:24:23.325 --> 00:24:25.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But,\n\n405\n00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.150\nlet's talk about this term called\nEnterprise Mode, all right?\n\n406\n00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.720\nJust close up here for\na second because what it does,\n\n407\n00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.240\nEnterprise Mode will take that\nguess work out of saying.\n\n408\n00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.340\nI don't know how this page should render,\nright?\n\n409\n00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.294\nSo that's the hope behind all of these.\n\n410\n00:24:40.294 --> 00:24:46.053\nAnd it's kinda funny,\nI actually have my deployment info here\n\n411\n00:24:46.053 --> 00:24:51.281\nabout Enterprise Mode in Rome so,\n[LAUGH] kind of ironic.\n\n412\n00:24:51.281 --> 00:24:56.220\nEnterprise mode and site lists.\n\n413\n00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.119\nSo Microsoft,\nlet me just talk about that for a second.\n\n414\n00:24:59.119 --> 00:25:02.050\nHere we really want to be looking at,\n\n415\n00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:07.536\nit's very common to deploy\nEnterprise Mode while in an enterprise,\n\n416\n00:25:07.536 --> 00:25:12.125\nleveraging good old active\ndirectory group policy.\n\n417\n00:25:12.125 --> 00:25:15.090\nSo, this is going to be\nthe path that we are using.\n\n418\n00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:19.761\nAnd let me just go ahead and\ndo my Windows Run and let's see,\n\n419\n00:25:19.761 --> 00:25:24.620\ngpedit.msc and, if you guys can see that,\nI'm just using my\n\n420\n00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:29.490\nrun line to go ahead and\nlaunch up my group policy editor here.\n\n421\n00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.790\nWe'll hit enter.\n\n422\n00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:35.532\nNow, I'm looking at this strictly on\nmy local machine capabilities but,\n\n423\n00:25:35.532 --> 00:25:39.146\nfollowing this path here in\nan Enterprise environment,\n\n424\n00:25:39.146 --> 00:25:42.704\nif you were using group policy\nin a domain environment.\n\n425\n00:25:42.704 --> 00:25:49.265\nSo what we could do is, we have a couple\nsettings here in our policy editor,\n\n426\n00:25:49.265 --> 00:25:53.344\nthat would need to be configured and\nenabled.\n\n427\n00:25:53.344 --> 00:25:57.950\nSo I am just gonna go ahead and drill\ndown under my administrative templates.\n\n428\n00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:04.240\nAnd this is going to be under my Windows\ncomponents, from Windows components.\n\n429\n00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.820\nI have Internet Explorer.\n\n430\n00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.508\nLet me see here.\nI need to go ahead and pull this out,\n\n431\n00:26:09.508 --> 00:26:11.580\nmaybe give myself some space.\n\n432\n00:26:14.567 --> 00:26:16.530\nInternet Explorer.\n\n433\n00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:20.370\nAnd from Internet Explorer,\nI have a couple.\n\n434\n00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.801\nLet me full screen this so\nwe can look at it.\n\n435\n00:26:28.869 --> 00:26:33.590\nLet users turn on and\nuse Enterprise Mode from the Tools menu.\n\n436\n00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:36.800\nSo if we just double click on that and\nPull that up.\n\n437\n00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.820\nReally there are two settings here\nthat we'd wanna take a look at.\n\n438\n00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.780\nI have the ability to create\ncustomized lists, or also and\n\n439\n00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.630\nthat's where I was getting\nat here with those list.\n\n440\n00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.790\nMicrosoft compiles lists, that Dave found,\n\n441\n00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:54.670\ncommon websites that they know the best\nway, like the best rendering or\n\n442\n00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.130\ncompatibility mode for you,\nso you don't have to guess.\n\n443\n00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.200\nAnd that's what enterprise mode does for\nus.\n\n444\n00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.314\nIt's taking that guess work out.\n\n445\n00:27:00.314 --> 00:27:01.450\nSo if you wanted to go.\n\n446\n00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.570\nGo ahead and enable it.\n\n447\n00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:06.860\nWhat you would need to do,\nis specify the location.\n\n448\n00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:11.520\nYou need to store that list somewhere\nan essential repository so,\n\n449\n00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.330\nyou'd wanna make sure that everyone\nknew where to find that list there.\n\n450\n00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:19.400\nSo, just looking at those settings and\nagain, the one right underneath here for\n\n451\n00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.530\nusing the actual enterprise\nmode i.e website list.\n\n452\n00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:23.686\nI'd take some time and look at that.\n\n453\n00:27:23.686 --> 00:27:26.178\nJust knowing, you do have an option.\n\n454\n00:27:26.178 --> 00:27:33.570\nTo even improve compatibility and\nedge a little bit more.\n\n455\n00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.382\nLet me close out of here.\n\n456\n00:27:35.382 --> 00:27:39.910\nAnd in the show notes you guys do\nhave access to these links, and\n\n457\n00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:45.580\nscrolling down, this is the deployment\nguide helping you, set that up.\n\n458\n00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.950\nBut there are also links to those\nprecompiled lists for you as well, so\n\n459\n00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.430\nif you didn't wanna go through.\n\n460\n00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.880\nAnd, actually,\nthat brings up a really good point.\n\n461\n00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.644\nIn a previous show,\nwe were talking about something\n\n462\n00:27:57.644 --> 00:28:02.390\ncalled upgrade readiness that\nutilizes Windows Analytics.\n\n463\n00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:07.890\nSo if I have OMS, and remember,\nthat was for Operations Management Suite.\n\n464\n00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.390\nI didn't have to pay.\n\n465\n00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.148\nSo I actually can set up\na free Azure account.\n\n466\n00:28:11.148 --> 00:28:15.998\nAnd actually leverage my analytics to see,\n\n467\n00:28:15.998 --> 00:28:22.693\nwhat websites are being used\nin my enterprise environment.\n\n468\n00:28:22.693 --> 00:28:26.673\nNow you might want to check on,\nlegal regulation, so\n\n469\n00:28:26.673 --> 00:28:32.246\njust to make sure you're not overstepping\nany boundaries there because,\n\n470\n00:28:32.246 --> 00:28:38.701\nusing that telemetry data, you are looking\nat all the web, a lot of different pieces,\n\n471\n00:28:38.701 --> 00:28:44.476\ngears, to the way that your engines\nare accessing the Internet and so forth.\n\n472\n00:28:44.476 --> 00:28:50.900\nSo you kinda wanna look at that, and say\nokay I see that Mike, he uses website xyz,\n\n473\n00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.370\neveryday and it looks like he's being\npretty productive with his job.\n\n474\n00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:55.622\nSo I do see that.\n\n475\n00:28:55.622 --> 00:28:57.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Way to go Mike, yeah.\n\n476\n00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:02.930\nAnd I see that this particular website\nruns in Internet Explorer 8 mode.\n\n477\n00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:04.370\nWhatever.\n\n478\n00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:09.580\nI can make a decision base\non that telemetry data.\n\n479\n00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.060\nMaybe it's an Internet site.\n\n480\n00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.730\nA site that I've created inhouse.\n\n481\n00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.950\nSo my company, and\nit's something that I can fix.\n\n482\n00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:20.870\nI can have my dev team go and\nchange the way that that site was coded.\n\n483\n00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:26.040\nBut if it's like 10,000 sites that\nmy users are accessing, then,\n\n484\n00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:31.110\nusing that information will help me\ndecide how I want my environment set up.\n\n485\n00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:35.470\nSo maybe setting up and running\nenterprise mode will be a good option for\n\n486\n00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:41.500\nme if I have that many users that are\ngonna have to, convert to a older mode.\n\n487\n00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.785\nBecause the thing is we don't want\nthem to just run an IE11 all day.\n\n488\n00:29:45.785 --> 00:29:46.723\nThat's a security issue.\n\n489\n00:29:46.723 --> 00:29:51.705\nWe would rather have them running\na more secure faster browser,\n\n490\n00:29:51.705 --> 00:29:55.683\nand only dropping down on\na per sight basis as well.\n\n491\n00:29:55.683 --> 00:29:58.359\nI think I know we're\ncoming up out of time.\n\n492\n00:29:58.359 --> 00:30:01.583\nI also wanted to just\nshow real quick here, and\n\n493\n00:30:01.583 --> 00:30:04.610\nit included these in the notes as well.\n\n494\n00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:11.550\nDifferent reports that neutral parties\nhave done on different browsers.\n\n495\n00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:16.600\nSo here we see Microsoft Edge, comparing\nit to Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.\n\n496\n00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:21.060\nAnd it's kind of interesting, so\nthat was not commissioned by Microsoft.\n\n497\n00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.788\nThis particular report that was generated.\n\n498\n00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:27.140\nIf you are looking for\nany kind of buy in for your enterprise, or\n\n499\n00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.050\njust wanna read a little bit\nmore about the analysis and\n\n500\n00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:33.225\ncool things that,\nthe security that Edge brings to table.\n\n501\n00:30:33.225 --> 00:30:37.838\nMicrosoft did commission\nForrester which is a company\n\n502\n00:30:37.838 --> 00:30:40.653\nthat sends out surveys to users.\n\n503\n00:30:40.653 --> 00:30:46.380\nTo go ahead and give honest reviews\nabout the adoption of Edge.\n\n504\n00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.340\nAnd it was kind of surprising that\nthe people who actually were using edge\n\n505\n00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.100\ndid see a 90% positive ROI.\n\n506\n00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:58.590\nSo again, don't give up on it right away,\nif you can get familiar with it and\n\n507\n00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:04.320\nrecognize those security benefits,\nand those user enhancements,\n\n508\n00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.580\nand again, looking at things\nlike any kind of annotation,\n\n509\n00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.760\nthat may not be for everyone, but\njust knowing those options are there and\n\n510\n00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.360\nespecially for the exam I think\nthat's a good place to be.\n\n511\n00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.090\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee,\n\n512\n00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:19.010\nmaybe I'll give Edge another try\nafter those great, demonstrations.\n\n513\n00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:22.320\nWe appreciate that, hope everybody\nout there enjoyed watching this one.\n\n514\n00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.160\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n515\n00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:25.880\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n516\n00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.642\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n517\n00:31:26.642 -->

00:00:08.155\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.155 --> 00:00:12.010\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.257\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.257 --> 00:00:16.800\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.940\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n8\n00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.150\nSpecifically in this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.740\nwe'll be taking a look at how\nwe can configure client Hyper-V.\n\n10\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.460\nHere to show us the way is none\nother than Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.460\nWelcome, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.590\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.970\nYeah, so Hyper-V, right.\n\n14\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.110\nWe're not just talking about Hyper-V\nin the server side for this show.\n\n15\n00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.420\nWe are on a Windows 10.\n\n16\n00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.550\nSo I think that is\nan important distinction.\n\n17\n00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.420\nI'll try to point out some\ndifferences there, but first of all,\n\n18\n00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.470\nwhat is is Hyper-V, right?\n\n19\n00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.780\nSo I think that's a good place to start.\n\n20\n00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.470\nWe'll take a look at some terminology and\nthen delve a little bit deeper.\n\n21\n00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.670\nSo Hyper-V is Microsoft's\nhypervisor technology.\n\n22\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.180\nAnd hypervisor is going to\nbe a piece of software,\n\n23\n00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.170\nits coding, that will allow you\nto utilize a virtual environment.\n\n24\n00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.370\nSo the hypervisor is managing all\nthe virtual components and the elements.\n\n25\n00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.070\nAnd we sure do have a lot of them.\n\n26\n00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.230\nThere are a lot of cool things that\nwe can do with virtualization.\n\n27\n00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.650\nIt's literally like running a computer\ninside of another computer.\n\n28\n00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.370\nYou can run multiple computers\ninside of one computer,\n\n29\n00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.140\nwhich we normally call our\nhost operating system.\n\n30\n00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.840\nAnd so let's just talk about\na couple of those terms.\n\n31\n00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.203\nIf we can look at my screen real quick,\nI do have a diagram, and\n\n32\n00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:34.280\nI know some of this is coming off the\nbottom, but We'll save some of that for\n\n33\n00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.515\nlooking at in the server shows, right?\n\n34\n00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:40.848\nSo client side's a little\nbit different because we're\n\n35\n00:01:40.848 --> 00:01:45.840\nnormally gonna be running Hyper-V\non our desktops, laptops.\n\n36\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.630\nWe're not talking about running\nthem on a server, right?\n\n37\n00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.877\nThat's what we saved for\nour server operating system.\n\n38\n00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:54.343\nSo the hardware's gonna be\na little bit different,\n\n39\n00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:58.300\nusually not as robust for\nhardware, so keep that in mind.\n\n40\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.900\nFor example, my laptop that I have,\nthat we'll be using and\n\n41\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.460\nlooking at today, only has one NIC,\nNetwork Interface Card.\n\n42\n00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.930\nSo on the server side, you really wouldn't\nbe deploying virtualization with on\n\n43\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.060\none NIC, that's just setting\nyourself up for failure.\n\n44\n00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.130\nSo we're not gonna be looking\nat things like NIC Teaming, and\n\n45\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.160\nsome of those other more advanced\ncapabilities especially the ones that\n\n46\n00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.410\nrequire that additional,\nmore robust hardware support if you will.\n\n47\n00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.190\nSo a couple of terms to get\nfamiliar with VM, all right.\n\n48\n00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.850\nVM short for virtual machine.\n\n49\n00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.790\nAnd we see my yellow rectangle\nhere residing in the host machine.\n\n50\n00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.630\nSo that pink outer rectangle is\ngoing to be like the host OS.\n\n51\n00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.740\nI'm trying to think of different\nterms that we may be using here but\n\n52\n00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.670\nthat's the physical, tangible machine.\n\n53\n00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.800\n&gt;&gt; Much like your laptop then.\n\n54\n00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is my laptop, exactly Mike.\n\n55\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.880\nNow, this green, let's just say here,\nremember, for my laptop\n\n56\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.260\nI only have one network interface card so\nI don't have two green boxes here.\n\n57\n00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.430\nI only have one green box.\n\n58\n00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.980\nThat's my physical tangible\nnetwork interface card\n\n59\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.930\nwhere I plug my ethernet cable or\nwhere I can utilize wireless, right?\n\n60\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.380\nSo that's my NIC there.\n\n61\n00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.640\nIn a virtualized environments,\nI have virtual components.\n\n62\n00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.515\nSo you see this vNIC here.\n\n63\n00:03:25.515 --> 00:03:30.225\nYour vNIC is going to be, so remember how\nI said the hypervisor is kind of the,\n\n64\n00:03:30.225 --> 00:03:33.267\nyou also may hear VMM,\nVirtual Machine Manager,\n\n65\n00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:36.395\nbecause it manages all these components,\nright.\n\n66\n00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:40.608\nAnd so it can create a virtual\nnetwork interface card,\n\n67\n00:03:40.608 --> 00:03:43.090\nit can create a virtual switch.\n\n68\n00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.980\nYes, we can still utilize,\nwe will utilize, physical hardware.\n\n69\n00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.900\nThough we also have an additional layer.\n\n70\n00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.050\nAnd they call those layers of abstraction.\n\n71\n00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.760\nSo we're creating layers of abstraction\nright from within that hypervisor there.\n\n72\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.900\nWe can utilize the software to emulate\ndifferent types of physical devices.\n\n73\n00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.160\nSo If we think about\n\n74\n00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.400\ngoing back to maybe you guys\nare familiar with networking, hopefully.\n\n75\n00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.610\nIf not,\ndon't worry we do have shows on that.\n\n76\n00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.730\nBut you should really understand\nhow physical switches work and how\n\n77\n00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.810\ncommon networking engineering or design,\njust networking fundamentals right?\n\n78\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.860\nIn order to really grasp i think\nthe full concept of virtualization here,\n\n79\n00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.150\nbecause a lot of the components,\nthe virtual components like I said\n\n80\n00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.130\nare emulating the behaviors\nof our physical components.\n\n81\n00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.210\nSo we have a virtual,\nwe can create virtual switches.\n\n82\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.860\nAnd we'll take a look at that in the show,\nshow you how we can do that and how we can\n\n83\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.530\nconfigure them also looking at virtual\nadapters, creating virtual machines.\n\n84\n00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.470\nA lot of fun stuffs going on here.\n\n85\n00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.440\nDon't get too hang up on the terminology,\nit will come as we are talking and\n\n86\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.710\nmoving through the show here.\n\n87\n00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.930\nAnd I also wanna take a moment to\n\n88\n00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.110\nuse a visual aid to kind of\nexplain what this looks like.\n\n89\n00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.980\nBecause not only are there different\nways we can implement a virtualization,\n\n90\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.855\nthere are gonna be different types of\nhypervisors that we see out there in\n\n91\n00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:18.655\nthe real world basically.\n\n92\n00:05:18.655 --> 00:05:22.335\nSo let's take a look at\nthe difference between a type one and\n\n93\n00:05:22.335 --> 00:05:23.575\na type two hypervisor.\n\n94\n00:05:23.575 --> 00:05:27.425\nTalk about that for a second, and\nthen how it relates to Hyper-V,\n\n95\n00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:31.565\nMicrosoft's implementation\nof virtualization.\n\n96\n00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:37.820\nSo number one over here we\nhave our type one hypervisor.\n\n97\n00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.210\nA type one hypervisor,\nthe grey box at the very bottom down here,\n\n98\n00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.590\nthat's my hardware, so everything I\nneed to create a computer, right?\n\n99\n00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.629\nSo I have my-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n100\n00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:48.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah my laptop.\n\n101\n00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.970\nAll right, so that's my laptop down there.\n\n102\n00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.760\nAnd sitting on top of this,\nlet me just say and\n\n103\n00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.900\nmaybe not in every situation\nlet's go to the server for\n\n104\n00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.050\nthis example Mike so maybe this is\nmy server down here at the bottom.\n\n105\n00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.510\n&gt;&gt; So if I can take a hypervisor and\ninstall the hypervisor\n\n106\n00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.470\nright on top of that hardware without even\nan operating system it's gonna run fast.\n\n107\n00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.695\nCoding in the hypervisor can speak and\ncommunicate directly with\n\n108\n00:06:17.695 --> 00:06:23.088\nthe hardware not having to bypass or\ngo through any middlemen, so to speak.\n\n109\n00:06:23.088 --> 00:06:25.744\nSo I can install multiple\nvirtual machines and\n\n110\n00:06:25.744 --> 00:06:30.620\nhave a really fast production\nenvironment with type 1 hypervisors.\n\n111\n00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.750\nAll right, type 2 hypervisors.\n\n112\n00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.450\nOur, you add an additional\nlayer of subtract,\n\n113\n00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.980\nlayer of abstraction there and\nso we can have our hardware,\n\n114\n00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.770\nwe can have our operating system\ninstalled on our hardware and\n\n115\n00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:50.910\nthen we can install a Hypervisor\nfrom within the operating system.\n\n116\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.640\nSo when you create your\nVirtual Machines and\n\n117\n00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.740\nthis'll pick things on my\nVirtual Machines, right?\n\n118\n00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.440\n[LAUGH] They have to go\nthrough our hypervisor\n\n119\n00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.530\nthrough the operating system and\ndown ro the hardware.\n\n120\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.110\nSo we do see some performance\ndegradation with type 2 hypervisors.\n\n121\n00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.630\nType 1 faster.\n\n122\n00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.540\nAnd really in production environment we're\ngonna be writing a type 1 hypervisor.\n\n123\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.014\n&gt;&gt; So what is Hyper-V?\n\n124\n00:07:16.014 --> 00:07:19.975\n&gt;&gt; Hyper-V is kind of tricky it's a little\nbut misleading because your thinking,\n\n125\n00:07:19.975 --> 00:07:24.160\nokay, well I have a Windows 10 operating\nsystem, it must be a type two.\n\n126\n00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.705\nThat's not the case at all.\n\n127\n00:07:25.705 --> 00:07:29.360\nHyper-V is actually\na type one hypervisser.\n\n128\n00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.400\nAnd what's really cool is Microsoft\nhas figured out a way where they can\n\n129\n00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.230\npunch through the operating system and\ncreate a little tunnel so\n\n130\n00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.710\nthat the hypervisor can\ndirectly communicate to that\n\n131\n00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.740\nhardware without sacrificing any speed and\nperformance there.\n\n132\n00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:51.200\nSo a really neat concept\nour hypervisor is,\n\n133\n00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.060\nour hyper-V is a type one hypervisor Mike.\n\n134\n00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.301\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n135\n00:07:55.301 --> 00:08:00.176\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and another cool thing about\nthat is we don't have to install\n\n136\n00:08:00.176 --> 00:08:02.238\nlike go out to the Internet.\n\n137\n00:08:02.238 --> 00:08:03.652\nAnd download it and install it.\n\n138\n00:08:03.652 --> 00:08:08.410\nSo a lot of type 2 hypervisors,\nyou will have to go out there and do that.\n\n139\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.800\nBut here in Windows 10,\n\n140\n00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.910\nwe have it integrated right\nwithin our operating system.\n\n141\n00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.783\nSo let's take a look at my machine here,\nand\n\n142\n00:08:15.783 --> 00:08:19.133\nwe'll see how we could go ahead and\nget that going.\n\n143\n00:08:24.214 --> 00:08:26.130\nI do have virtual machines.\n\n144\n00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.450\nAnd just for this demo,\n\n145\n00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.930\nI'm actually gonna be working with\nsomething called nested virtualization.\n\n146\n00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.110\nBut again, that's not really recommended\nfor production, I'm just demoing it here.\n\n147\n00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.450\nSo that's why you see me\nrunning a VM inside of a VM.\n\n148\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.005\nBut there are couple of different\nways that we can go ahead and\n\n149\n00:08:42.005 --> 00:08:46.688\nenable Hyper-V from within Windows 10,\nI'll start with the easiest ways.\n\n150\n00:08:46.688 --> 00:08:49.442\nIf we just go to our search bar here, and\n\n151\n00:08:49.442 --> 00:08:55.540\nwe're gonna start typing turn on Windows\nfeatures, turn Windows features on or off.\n\n152\n00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:01.750\nSo this is actually a Hyper-V role that's\ninside of our operating system here.\n\n153\n00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:07.104\nAnd give this a moment to propagate,\nthis is going to be our older\n\n154\n00:09:07.104 --> 00:09:12.375\ncontrol panel applet that we\nstill see here, this interface.\n\n155\n00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:16.614\nI'll zoom in so you guys can\nsee what's going on here, oops.\n\n156\n00:09:16.614 --> 00:09:20.143\nI actually locked my computer, that's\nlovely, oops and that's not the right,\n\n157\n00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:21.382\nI just changed my password.\n\n158\n00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:24.894\nI've gotta remember what that is.\n\n159\n00:09:35.511 --> 00:09:40.207\nAnd so that's actually what you just saw\nthere was my host OS that I logged into\n\n160\n00:09:40.207 --> 00:09:42.817\nand then I logged into my virtual machine.\n\n161\n00:09:42.817 --> 00:09:46.103\nSo you can see how it's a computer\ninside of another computer,\n\n162\n00:09:46.103 --> 00:09:47.535\nif that makes sense there.\n\n163\n00:09:47.535 --> 00:09:52.122\nBringing us back up to this menu,\nI can currently see that I do,\n\n164\n00:09:52.122 --> 00:09:56.549\nin fact, have Hyper-V installed\nalready on this machine.\n\n165\n00:09:56.549 --> 00:09:59.375\nIf it wasn't, and\nI'll just zoom in a little bit there.\n\n166\n00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:04.919\nYou would just hit that tick box there,\nall right?\n\n167\n00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:07.400\nSo you would go ahead and\nput your check in.\n\n168\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.671\nNow let me expand this out\nover on the left-hand side.\n\n169\n00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:14.531\nYou do have some subcomponents here,\nsuch as the Hyper-V Management Tools and\n\n170\n00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:15.770\nthe Hyper-V Platform.\n\n171\n00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:21.007\nSo what do you think Mike,\ndo you ever install Hype- V without\n\n172\n00:10:21.007 --> 00:10:26.466\nthe management tools,\nbecause I'm almost always using them.\n\n173\n00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:31.162\n&gt;&gt; Yeah definitely not on the client\nright, if I'm running this from Windows 10\n\n174\n00:10:31.162 --> 00:10:35.593\nlike we are here, I'm pretty much\na single machine environment, right?\n\n175\n00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:39.789\nIn a production environment, my Hyper-V\nserver might be a server sitting in\n\n176\n00:10:39.789 --> 00:10:44.345\nthe closet and I can install Hyper-V the\nplatform, but not the management tools.\n\n177\n00:10:44.345 --> 00:10:46.410\nCuz I'm gonna do all my\nmanagement remotely.\n\n178\n00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.930\nSo I want the management tools on\nmy client or something like that.\n\n179\n00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.900\nBut in this case, yeah,\nyou're gonna need both.\n\n180\n00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.498\nYou need the platform to\nbe able to use Hyper-V, and\n\n181\n00:10:53.498 --> 00:10:56.938\nyou need the management tools to be\nable to work with it and manage it.\n\n182\n00:10:56.938 --> 00:10:58.848\n&gt;&gt; All right, so there you have it.\n\n183\n00:10:58.848 --> 00:11:02.524\nAnd that's the thing, because doesn't\nreally make sense in this installation.\n\n184\n00:11:02.524 --> 00:11:06.440\nYou wanna make sure that those sub\nboxes are checked here as well.\n\n185\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.360\nAnd Hyper-V some roles\ndo not require restarts.\n\n186\n00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.100\nHowever, we can't say that about Hyper-V.\n\n187\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.325\nYou will need to go ahead and\nrestart that machine.\n\n188\n00:11:15.325 --> 00:11:18.930\nSo just keep that in mind for deployment.\n\n189\n00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.214\nYou wanna make sure you have some\nmaintenance window there if you're gonna\n\n190\n00:11:23.214 --> 00:11:24.507\nbe affecting anyone.\n\n191\n00:11:27.294 --> 00:11:31.694\nAll right, that is not the only\nway we can go ahead and\n\n192\n00:11:31.694 --> 00:11:34.600\nenable our Hyper-V, of course.\n\n193\n00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.932\nThere's going to be additional options,\nMicrosoft loves to give us options here.\n\n194\n00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:43.900\nSo let's take a look at what we\ncan do here inside of PowerShell.\n\n195\n00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:50.073\nWe're going to us the cmdlet enable,\nand this is going to be enable-windows.\n\n196\n00:11:52.705 --> 00:11:56.849\nAnd then it's optional, and\nlet me just tab through here.\n\n197\n00:11:56.849 --> 00:12:01.598\nNot quite yet, so\nit's enable-windowsoptionalfeature.\n\n198\n00:12:01.598 --> 00:12:07.930\nIf I'm typing, Give it a second.\n\n199\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.855\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, first time you do that tab,\nit'll kinda take-\n\n200\n00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.378\n&gt;&gt; Hose me up here.\n\n201\n00:12:13.378 --> 00:12:15.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit takes it a minute to figure out,\n\n202\n00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.188\nwhat all commands could\nI possibly show you?\n\n203\n00:12:17.188 --> 00:12:20.981\n&gt;&gt; Okay yeah, so now we have feature\nfeature, [LAUGH] kinda like pizza pizza,\n\n204\n00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:22.259\nbut we don't want that.\n\n205\n00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:27.086\nWe only want one enable feature, and the\nremaining portion of this is going to be\n\n206\n00:12:27.086 --> 00:12:31.494\n-online, because we're working on\nthis machine here that is online.\n\n207\n00:12:31.494 --> 00:12:36.757\nWe do need to specify that feature name,\nthe feature name is going to be Microsoft.\n\n208\n00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:44.564\nMicrosoft-Hyper-v.\n\n209\n00:12:44.564 --> 00:12:49.080\nNow if we left it as is, we would just be\n\n210\n00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.798\ninstalling basically that first box\nthat I showed you in the interface.\n\n211\n00:12:52.798 --> 00:12:54.711\nWe don't wanna do that,\nlike Mike and I said,\n\n212\n00:12:54.711 --> 00:12:56.981\nwe really wanna have those\nmanagement capabilities.\n\n213\n00:12:56.981 --> 00:13:03.749\nSo I'm going to hit space -all to go ahead\nand grab all of those components there.\n\n214\n00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:07.999\nThe management tools and the underpinning\ntechnologies we'll use there for\n\n215\n00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:09.179\nmanagement as well.\n\n216\n00:13:09.179 --> 00:13:13.915\nYou'd hit enter and it would prompt\nyou to go ahead and perform a restart.\n\n217\n00:13:13.915 --> 00:13:18.902\nBecause this machine already\nhas Hyper-V installed,\n\n218\n00:13:18.902 --> 00:13:22.731\nI'm just going to back out of here for\nnow.\n\n219\n00:13:22.731 --> 00:13:25.367\nBut I wanted to show you\nhow you would go ahead,\n\n220\n00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:29.639\nthat's the syntax you would use to get\nthat installed here in PowerShell.\n\n221\n00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:32.216\nBut wait, there's more.\n\n222\n00:13:32.216 --> 00:13:35.732\nIn our command prompt,\nand we can fall back\n\n223\n00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:40.624\non an older methodology here\nwhere we're utilizing DISM.\n\n224\n00:13:40.624 --> 00:13:44.461\nSo here in command prompt,\nlet me see here, what was my actual,\n\n225\n00:13:44.461 --> 00:13:47.032\nI wanna make sure I\nhave the actual syntax.\n\n226\n00:13:47.032 --> 00:13:52.960\nIt's a little bit different if\nyou're not used to working in DISM,\n\n227\n00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.880\nif you are, then that's great.\n\n228\n00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.174\nWe'll go ahead and\ntype DISM for our, D-I-S-M, and\n\n229\n00:13:59.174 --> 00:14:02.200\nit doesn't matter about uppercase,\nlowercase.\n\n230\n00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.351\nI just wanted to kind of pick one and\nchoose, not switch halfway through,\n\n231\n00:14:07.351 --> 00:14:11.521\nand again, we're gonna specify for\nonline machine here.\n\n232\n00:14:11.521 --> 00:14:15.242\nWe're gonna go /enable,\n\n233\n00:14:15.242 --> 00:14:21.563\nthis is going to be\n-feature / feature name.\n\n234\n00:14:23.316 --> 00:14:25.662\nNow this is where I said it's a little\nbit different for the syntax.\n\n235\n00:14:25.662 --> 00:14:29.432\nYou're gonna say :Microsoft, and\n\n236\n00:14:29.432 --> 00:14:34.909\nthis going to be again,\n-Hyper-V, the same here.\n\n237\n00:14:34.909 --> 00:14:42.485\nHyper-V -all to go ahead and\npull in all of those components.\n\n238\n00:14:42.485 --> 00:14:46.913\nOkay, that's great, we've looked at three\ndifferent ways that we can enable Hyper-V.\n\n239\n00:14:46.913 --> 00:14:50.293\nWe didn't have to download or\ninstall anything,\n\n240\n00:14:50.293 --> 00:14:54.080\nbuilt right into the Windows OS here,\nwhat do we do now?\n\n241\n00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.970\nWell a couple different things,\nI'm just going to go ahead and\n\n242\n00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.930\nuse my search bar here and\nstart typing in Hyper-V.\n\n243\n00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.926\nThis is going to be the icon that\nwe see here for my Hyper-V Manager.\n\n244\n00:15:06.926 --> 00:15:11.695\nAnd let me just move my little magnifier.\n\n245\n00:15:11.695 --> 00:15:14.811\nKind of like a machine inside of\na machine for that icon there, and\n\n246\n00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:15.897\nthat does make sense.\n\n247\n00:15:15.897 --> 00:15:18.310\nWe'll go ahead and click and launch this.\n\n248\n00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:23.425\nIf you're using Hyper-V quite often,\nyou might wanna go ahead and\n\n249\n00:15:23.425 --> 00:15:27.382\npin this to your task bar just for\neasy access there.\n\n250\n00:15:27.382 --> 00:15:32.237\nSo what we're gonna be launching and\nworking with here is our hypervisor,\n\n251\n00:15:32.237 --> 00:15:35.796\nour manager, our VMM,\nour virtual machine manager.\n\n252\n00:15:35.796 --> 00:15:40.361\nSo this is going to be the interface\nthat our hypervisor creates that allows\n\n253\n00:15:40.361 --> 00:15:44.641\nus to create machines, manage machines,\ncreate virtual switches.\n\n254\n00:15:44.641 --> 00:15:48.073\nAll the different components that\nare required or that are available.\n\n255\n00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:51.942\nI won't say required,\nthey're not all required, but\n\n256\n00:15:51.942 --> 00:15:54.176\nthat you have available to you.\n\n257\n00:15:54.176 --> 00:15:56.542\nAll right, so\nwhere do we wanna go from in here?\n\n258\n00:15:56.542 --> 00:16:00.599\nHow about let's look at\ncreating a virtual machine, or\n\n259\n00:16:00.599 --> 00:16:03.934\ndo you wanna talk about\nGen 1 versus Gen 2?\n\n260\n00:16:03.934 --> 00:16:05.940\nAbsolutely.\n&gt;&gt; It kind of goes in hand here, right?\n\n261\n00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.672\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n262\n00:16:06.672 --> 00:16:09.061\n&gt;&gt; All right, so-\n&gt;&gt; Are there any settings we need to\n\n263\n00:16:09.061 --> 00:16:09.730\nworry about also?\n\n264\n00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.850\nSo we've got it installed,\nwe're good to go?\n\n265\n00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.160\n&gt;&gt; We've got our settings-\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n266\n00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.800\n&gt;&gt; Good to go here, and\nour virtual machine manager, and\n\n267\n00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.460\nif you notice I have the ability\non my left-hand pane here.\n\n268\n00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.775\nThis is the machine I'm working on.\n\n269\n00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:27.040\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, okay.\n&gt;&gt; So for that physical machine here.\n\n270\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.140\nAnd I don't have any virtual\nmachines created as of yet.\n\n271\n00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.180\nThey would appear in this center pane.\n\n272\n00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.380\nAnd we'll talk about checkpoints and look\nat some of these other components as well.\n\n273\n00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.275\nBut what's cool about this manager.\n\n274\n00:16:39.275 --> 00:16:44.605\nYou are able as long as you, you're\nable to manage other machines as well.\n\n275\n00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:46.585\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n276\n00:16:46.585 --> 00:16:49.515\nIf you do have different machines that\nyou are in charge of managing, you always\n\n277\n00:16:49.515 --> 00:16:53.795\nwanna make sure that you are over here on\nthe left hand side clicking on the right.\n\n278\n00:16:53.795 --> 00:16:56.145\n&gt;&gt; So if we had a production Hyper-V\nserver in the server closet,\n\n279\n00:16:56.145 --> 00:16:57.755\nI could add it to this console and\n\n280\n00:16:57.755 --> 00:17:01.590\nmanage my laptop running Hyper-V as\nwell as that server running hyper-V.\n\n281\n00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:05.250\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, as long as you\njust had that proper connectivity and\n\n282\n00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:09.408\nthere weren't any kind of like firewall\nobstructions or anything like that and\n\n283\n00:17:09.408 --> 00:17:13.708\nremote management was allowed on that\nserver according to your security policy.\n\n284\n00:17:13.708 --> 00:17:19.250\nAll right, so we'll go ahead here and\nwe have that ability.\n\n285\n00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.810\nNow, in a previous show, and I'll zoom in\na little bit so you guys can see that.\n\n286\n00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.520\nA couple of different\nways you can get here.\n\n287\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:29.170\nOver on the right hand pane you can select\nNew, it gives me a couple of options.\n\n288\n00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.700\nI can create a virtual machine.\n\n289\n00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.810\nI can create a hard disk.\n\n290\n00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:32.900\nI can create a floppy disk.\n\n291\n00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.770\nTo wanna create a floppy disk.\n\n292\n00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.320\nYou guys have already seen\nme create hard disks in,\n\n293\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.540\nwhen were talking about\nnative blue scenarios, right?\n\n294\n00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:46.460\nWe'll also spend a lot more time and\nreally look at creating hard disks,\n\n295\n00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.650\neven virtual hard disks in our\nstorage episodes as well, so\n\n296\n00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.580\nI don't wanna spend\na tone of time with that.\n\n297\n00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.900\nSo, let's go ahead and\ncreate our virtual machine.\n\n298\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:01.230\nNow you can I guess pre stage\nby creating a hard disk,\n\n299\n00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.910\nthere are just a lot of\ndifferent ways you can do this.\n\n300\n00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:08.230\nYou can create a virtual machine, and\ncreate the hard disk at the same time.\n\n301\n00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:12.450\nOr you can have your VHD created ahead\nof time and then attach it later.\n\n302\n00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.530\nOkay, so we can go ahead and,\nmy wizard kind of was hiding there,\n\n303\n00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.050\nlet's go ahead and launch that.\n\n304\n00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.920\nAnd I will zoom in a little bit, so\n\n305\n00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.420\nyou can see what's going on here,\nI don't have zoom in I don't think.\n\n306\n00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.210\nTry and see if you guys can see that.\n\n307\n00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.280\nOkay, just wanna make sure.\n\n308\n00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.310\nAll right so this is going to be\nour virtual machine wizard here and\n\n309\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.560\nthis is just a splash screen letting\nus know, or the welcome screen.\n\n310\n00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.570\nThe initiation here,\n\n311\n00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.970\nletting us know that we're about\nto be creating a virtual machine.\n\n312\n00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.660\nWe'll go ahead and hit Next.\n\n313\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.660\nAlso you could check this box so\n\n314\n00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.810\nit's not giving you that\nwelcome page every single time.\n\n315\n00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:59.440\nNow, on this particular screen I'm going\nto go ahead and name my virtual machine.\n\n316\n00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.750\nSo we could name it Demo1 here.\n\n317\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:07.690\nAnd by default, I can currently see where\n\n318\n00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:13.120\nthis HyperVisor wants to\nplace that virtual machine.\n\n319\n00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.280\nI actually have two different hard\ndrives installed in my laptop.\n\n320\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.250\nI used my C drive for\nrunning the operating system.\n\n321\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.270\nAnd my D drive is larger.\n\n322\n00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:27.370\nVirtual machine files can be large,\nso you really should be aware of.\n\n323\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.080\nAnd if you think about it on\nhow virtualization works,\n\n324\n00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.790\nwe're taking over hardware components and\n\n325\n00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:37.920\nsharing it with our virtual machines\nthat we need to calculate accordingly.\n\n326\n00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.359\nSo I'll go ahead and\nselect a different location for\n\n327\n00:19:41.359 --> 00:19:44.655\nthe storage of this\nparticular virtual machine.\n\n328\n00:19:49.278 --> 00:19:51.845\nWe'll give it a second\nhere to think about that.\n\n329\n00:19:51.845 --> 00:19:52.620\n&gt;&gt; It might let you.\n\n330\n00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.909\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, yeah.\n\n331\n00:19:59.683 --> 00:20:04.163\nYou know what, while that's going, let me\njust minimize this and we will look at,\n\n332\n00:20:04.163 --> 00:20:06.370\nI talked about some of this.\n\n333\n00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.120\n&gt;&gt; There it goes.\n\n334\n00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.906\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll wait,\nwe'll come back to that.\n\n335\n00:20:09.906 --> 00:20:13.516\n&gt;&gt; As it slowly paints the browser\nwindow out there, yeah.\n\n336\n00:20:13.516 --> 00:20:14.725\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n337\n00:20:14.725 --> 00:20:19.223\nAll right, so on my D drive, I actually\nalready have a folder that I use for\n\n338\n00:20:19.223 --> 00:20:22.000\nstoring some of my virtual machines.\n\n339\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.320\nYou could also create,\noops, you know what?\n\n340\n00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.420\nLet me just keep that here on my C drive.\n\n341\n00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.580\nI'm not creating this on my local machine.\n\n342\n00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.640\nSo, that's fine.\n\n343\n00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.425\nI'm trying to think for my C drive here.\n\n344\n00:20:39.425 --> 00:20:42.630\nLet's just go ahead and\nput it right here on the root.\n\n345\n00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.372\nAll right, that'll work for now.\n\n346\n00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.380\nAnd as far as the name, I don't know if\nI need to have a different folder here.\n\n347\n00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.665\nWe could create a folder\nlike VM [CROSSTALK].\n\n348\n00:20:55.665 --> 00:20:58.470\n&gt;&gt; And then while she's getting that set\nup this is definitely something that\n\n349\n00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:59.190\nyou've plan out.\n\n350\n00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.330\nIf you're gonna run\nHyper-V on your laptop,\n\n351\n00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.680\nit's gonna be a really disk\nintensive process, right?\n\n352\n00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.910\nYou're running another operating system\nthat's reading from that VHD or VHDX,\n\n353\n00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:15.220\nand if it's on the same physical\nspindle as your host operating system,\n\n354\n00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.490\nthere's gonna be some contention there.\n\n355\n00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.440\nAnd if you try to run\nmore than one machine,\n\n356\n00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.240\nyou're gonna get a lot of discontention.\n\n357\n00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.340\nSo it's much better if you got\na separate physical spindle or\n\n358\n00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.350\nif you're solid state you're better off\ntrying to get it off of the drive that\n\n359\n00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.426\nhas your host operating system drive.\n\n360\n00:21:30.426 --> 00:21:34.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and [LAUGH] planning it out, and\n\n361\n00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:37.610\nI am kind of doing this on the fly here,\nbut that's a good point to make,\n\n362\n00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:41.900\nbecause when you get to this particular\nscreen, they're asking you, hey,\n\n363\n00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:46.350\ndo you wanna create Generation 1 or\nGeneration 2 virtual machine here?\n\n364\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.230\nAnd let me zoom in and you can see this.\n\n365\n00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.640\nIt's kind of important, because once you\ngo ahead and create that virtual machine,\n\n366\n00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.160\nyou can't change its generation.\n\n367\n00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.060\nOther things in virtual machines, you can\nchange different configuration settings,\n\n368\n00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.340\nbut this is not one of them so\nyou really need to plan ahead.\n\n369\n00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:08.130\nAnd let's just pause here for\na second and I will hop out and go to my\n\n370\n00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:12.580\nlocal machine to, I have a link pulled\nup and I have some diagrams here, too.\n\n371\n00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.580\nLet's first take a look at this diagram.\n\n372\n00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:22.100\nI did wanna show you guys those files\nassociated with virtual machines as well.\n\n373\n00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.900\nXML files are gonna be files, and we'll\nsee this after we create the machine.\n\n374\n00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.090\nIf we go in and see like where it\nstores the actual virtual machine.\n\n375\n00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:34.778\nThe virtual machine will be created,\nwe have our .vhd or\n\n376\n00:22:34.778 --> 00:22:38.720\n.vhdx files for\nthat actual hard drive of that machine.\n\n377\n00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.810\nAnd if we have saved-state\nvirtual machine,\n\n378\n00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:44.670\nyou'll see the file extension .vsv.\n\n379\n00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.450\nAnd then we'll also talk\nabout checkpoints, and\n\n380\n00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:53.240\nprobably in the next show where\nwe look the file extension .avhd.\n\n381\n00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.526\nSo just if you are working\nin your systems,\n\n382\n00:22:55.526 --> 00:22:59.020\nand you're not sure what those\ndifferent file extensions mean,\n\n383\n00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.845\nthey're going to be associated\nwith our virtual-environment here.\n\n384\n00:23:02.845 --> 00:23:09.520\nAnd this is diagram of\ndifferent hardware components.\n\n385\n00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.275\nRemember how I said there hyper\nvisor was emulating actual hardware.\n\n386\n00:23:13.275 --> 00:23:19.495\nSo looking at Gen 1 and Gen 2,\nwe see older technology,\n\n387\n00:23:19.495 --> 00:23:24.535\nhardware in Gen 1 machines,\nnewer technology in Gen 2.\n\n388\n00:23:24.535 --> 00:23:27.077\nLike for instance in Gen 1,\n\n389\n00:23:27.077 --> 00:23:31.627\nyou would need to boot to a IDE drive\nwhere you could have a SCSI drive for\n\n390\n00:23:31.627 --> 00:23:35.937\nother devices, but here in Gen2 machines,\nyou can boot from a SCSI.\n\n391\n00:23:35.937 --> 00:23:40.203\nThere are a lot of advantages\nof using a Gen2 machine.\n\n392\n00:23:40.203 --> 00:23:45.002\nHowever, there are certain\nsituations where you would want to\n\n393\n00:23:45.002 --> 00:23:47.200\nuse a Gen1 machine.\n\n394\n00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.983\nI think I found a really great link\nthat covers a lot of different reasons\n\n395\n00:23:51.983 --> 00:23:54.705\nwhy you had to choose one over the other.\n\n396\n00:23:54.705 --> 00:23:58.644\nI have some bullet points here,\nyou guys can read those.\n\n397\n00:23:58.644 --> 00:24:01.343\nBut let's take a look at\nthe link real quick because.\n\n398\n00:24:01.343 --> 00:24:08.370\nMicrosoft does recommend going\nwith a Gen 2 if it all possible.\n\n399\n00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.690\nWhat about for you Mike?\n\n400\n00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:14.699\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, I wonder if one of\nthem is the old PXE boot, cuz when Gen 2s\n\n401\n00:24:14.699 --> 00:24:18.730\nfirst came out, PXY boot was an issue\nthat they weren't able to emulate.\n\n402\n00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.050\nThey had to use the old\nlegacy adaptor in the Gen 1.\n\n403\n00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:22.940\nBut they fixed that now.\n\n404\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:23.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You can do it now.\n\n405\n00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:24.746\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can boot.\n\n406\n00:24:24.746 --> 00:24:27.879\nSo, what PXY boot is is being\nable to boot off of a network\n\n407\n00:24:27.879 --> 00:24:28.939\ninterface card-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n408\n00:24:28.939 --> 00:24:33.676\n&gt;&gt; And what Mike was saying is you\nhad to utilize a legacy adapter, and\n\n409\n00:24:33.676 --> 00:24:37.370\nonly Gen 1 machines\nprovide a legacy adapter.\n\n410\n00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:41.680\nBut you are correct, Gen 2 machines\nnow allow to boot from PXE boot.\n\n411\n00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.336\nBut there are certain\nother instances where-\n\n412\n00:24:43.336 --> 00:24:43.910\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n413\n00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:47.260\n&gt;&gt; You might want to go ahead and\ncreate a Gen 1, number one for\n\n414\n00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.868\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n415\n00:24:48.868 --> 00:24:49.600\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n416\n00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.510\n&gt;&gt; And I put this link in the show notes,\nand it's really cool,\n\n417\n00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:56.750\nbecause talking about,\nlike Mike said, planning.\n\n418\n00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.290\nWe take a look at my screen,\nI really think you should look at this,\n\n419\n00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.010\njust to make sure you've gone through\neach one of these questions and\n\n420\n00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:04.120\nhave asked yourself this.\n\n421\n00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.086\nMy level of portability, okay?\n\n422\n00:25:07.086 --> 00:25:08.022\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n423\n00:25:08.022 --> 00:25:10.290\n&gt;&gt; Or my access.\n\n424\n00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:14.540\nDo I wanna provision virtual machines\nas quickly as possible using PXE boot?\n\n425\n00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.183\nWhere in the past, this document would\nhave been a little bit different, but\n\n426\n00:25:17.183 --> 00:25:18.550\nnow it says, hey-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n427\n00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.830\n&gt;&gt; Gen 2s have support for PXE boot,\nand they're gonna be faster here.\n\n428\n00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:23.330\n&gt;&gt; Bigger-\n&gt;&gt; Looking-\n\n429\n00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.420\n&gt;&gt; Right below that too.\n\n430\n00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.865\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a huge one right here.\n\n431\n00:25:25.865 --> 00:25:26.391\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n432\n00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:28.804\n&gt;&gt; Are you running any 32-bit virtual\n\n433\n00:25:28.804 --> 00:25:33.430\nmachines?\nI mean, this is a huge planning faux\n\n434\n00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:38.160\npas if you don't look at this, because\nI'm going to need to run a Generation 1\n\n435\n00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:43.320\nmachine because Generation 2 only\nsupports the 64-bit architecture there.\n\n436\n00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.450\nSo, a lot of details, so\nthey say the devil is in the details,\n\n437\n00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:53.710\ndefinitely here, because again,\nwe can't change our minds afterwards.\n\n438\n00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:57.100\nAnd if you look here,\ndo you want the best performing VMs?\n\n439\n00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.690\nI mean, who doesn't want-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n440\n00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.206\n&gt;&gt; The best performing VMs, right?\n\n441\n00:26:00.206 --> 00:26:01.903\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Then they're gonna say,\n\n442\n00:26:01.903 --> 00:26:04.087\nwell then in that case,\nyou'll need to use Gen 2 VMs.\n\n443\n00:26:04.087 --> 00:26:06.220\nSo that's-\n&gt;&gt; That's usually what I do.\n\n444\n00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.331\nI sit down at my console and go,\nwhat would give me the worst-\n\n445\n00:26:08.331 --> 00:26:09.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n446\n00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.821\n&gt;&gt; Performance possible?\n\n447\n00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:11.809\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what I want.\n\n448\n00:26:11.809 --> 00:26:14.447\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, man, all right.\n\n449\n00:26:14.447 --> 00:26:16.319\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's go back to our virtual\n\n450\n00:26:16.319 --> 00:26:17.700\nmachine here.\n\n451\n00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:22.500\nSo Mike, I think you've convinced me,\nlet's go with a Gen 2 machine, okay.\n\n452\n00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.670\n&gt;&gt; Honestly, unless you're running\nan older 32-bit operating system that you\n\n453\n00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:30.150\nneed to virtualize, there's not too many\nreasons to go with that Gen 1 nowadays.\n\n454\n00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:30.800\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n455\n00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.461\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; All right, memory.\n\n456\n00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.500\nThat brings up another thing I really\nshould have said right at the beginning of\n\n457\n00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.030\nthis show.\n\n458\n00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:44.450\nWe do have some system requirements\neven to get Hyper-V installed.\n\n459\n00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:46.470\nSo number one, memory.\n\n460\n00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.560\nBare minimum is going to be four gigs.\n\n461\n00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.810\nHowever, with that being said,\n\n462\n00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.887\nyou're not gonna want to run Hyper-V on\na machine with only four gigs of memory.\n\n463\n00:26:55.887 --> 00:26:58.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It might be possible.\n\n464\n00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.847\nMicrosoft says it's possible, but-\n&gt;&gt; You can launch Hyper-V,\n\n465\n00:27:00.847 --> 00:27:02.143\nyou just can't run any virtual machines.\n\n466\n00:27:02.143 --> 00:27:02.643\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n467\n00:27:04.469 --> 00:27:06.039\n&gt;&gt; If you wanna actually virtualize\n\n468\n00:27:06.039 --> 00:27:09.260\nsomething, you might want a few\nmore gigs of RAM of that.\n\n469\n00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.570\n&gt;&gt; You do need to have a Windows 10 Pro,\nor\n\n470\n00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:15.470\nat least Enterprise Edition,\nEnterprise or Pro.\n\n471\n00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:20.520\nSo you're not gonna be able to run\nthis Hyper-V on your home editions.\n\n472\n00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.274\nYeah, you do need a 64-bit processor.\n\n473\n00:27:23.274 --> 00:27:24.900\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's one thing that you need.\n\n474\n00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.150\nAnd when you're looking at that processor,\n\n475\n00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.790\nyou also have to make sure that it\nactually supports virtualization.\n\n476\n00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:34.040\nSo if you look at\nthe firmware level support,\n\n477\n00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.922\nso AMD has their AMD-V, and\nIntel has their, what is it?\n\n478\n00:27:38.922 --> 00:27:39.746\nIntel VT-\n&gt;&gt; VT.\n\n479\n00:27:39.746 --> 00:27:41.760\n&gt;&gt; For Virtual Technology.\n\n480\n00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.067\nYeah, so you wanna just go into\nthose settings, into your firmware,\n\n481\n00:27:46.067 --> 00:27:47.898\nwhether it be probably UEFI.\n\n482\n00:27:47.898 --> 00:27:51.323\nBut you go in there, and you verify that,\nnumber one, it can support it, and\n\n483\n00:27:51.323 --> 00:27:53.510\nthen number two,\nthat it's actually enabled.\n\n484\n00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.523\nSo, there are some things-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n485\n00:27:55.523 --> 00:27:59.720\n&gt;&gt; Most modern systems, but I won't\nsay all, because you never know, so.\n\n486\n00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most of them support it.\n\n487\n00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:05.340\nBut as you said, a lot of times, the\nvirtualization technologies are not turned\n\n488\n00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.760\non by default, so\nyou need to go in there an turn them on.\n\n489\n00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.980\nMost systems nowadays do support that\nsecond level address translation,\n\n490\n00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.780\nbut if you've got an older system,\nit might not, and\n\n491\n00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.170\nthat would keep you from\ninstalling Hyper-V.\n\n492\n00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:17.367\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, looking for that slot there.\n\n493\n00:28:17.367 --> 00:28:18.030\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n494\n00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:18.590\n&gt;&gt; Good point Mike.\n\n495\n00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.290\nAll right, so, memory.\n\n496\n00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:25.180\nStartup memory, this is another\nthing you have to be cognizant of\n\n497\n00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:29.830\nwhat you're actual physical machine\nhas available for you to use.\n\n498\n00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:33.783\nStartup memory,\nwe can overallocate slightly,\n\n499\n00:28:33.783 --> 00:28:38.111\nbecause if we think about when\nwe boot it up on machine,\n\n500\n00:28:38.111 --> 00:28:43.474\nour systems are gonna be drawing\nmore RAM during that initial boot,\n\n501\n00:28:43.474 --> 00:28:48.956\nrather than looking at it from a more\nstable running baseline there.\n\n502\n00:28:48.956 --> 00:28:53.519\nSo if I were to try to boot\nmultiple machines at the same time,\n\n503\n00:28:53.519 --> 00:28:58.438\nthat could cause a crash if I set\nmy size higher than what I actually\n\n504\n00:28:58.438 --> 00:29:00.690\nhave in my physical machine.\n\n505\n00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:03.120\nSo these are some things that\nyou need to think about.\n\n506\n00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.770\nBut Microsoft acknowledges\nthe shortcomings, and\n\n507\n00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:10.630\nalso has utilized newer\ntechnologies to overcome that,\n\n508\n00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:14.520\nsuch as using dynamic memory for\nthis virtual machine.\n\n509\n00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.402\nThey've come along way in virtualization.\n\n510\n00:29:16.402 --> 00:29:19.072\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So by using leveraging like dynamic\n\n511\n00:29:19.072 --> 00:29:23.878\nmemory, you're able to see less issues\nwith those memory bursts during\n\n512\n00:29:23.878 --> 00:29:26.790\nstart up and things like that.\n\n513\n00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.660\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nuse dynamic memory here.\n\n514\n00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:35.470\nWe will take a look at creating\ndifferent types of network adapters.\n\n515\n00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.460\nYou can add adapters later, so\n\n516\n00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.350\nwe don't really need worry about that for\nright now.\n\n517\n00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.360\nWe'll talk about that.\n\n518\n00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.930\nAnd let me go ahead and zoom in.\n\n519\n00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.690\nThere's a lot going on on\nthis particular screen.\n\n520\n00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:51.570\nSo, here is the name of my\nmachine that we just created.\n\n521\n00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.837\nNotice the file extension.\n\n522\n00:29:53.837 --> 00:29:58.365\nAnd on one of my diagram pages,\nI had VHD or VHDX.\n\n523\n00:29:58.365 --> 00:30:02.032\nAnd like I said, we'll spend\nmore time looking at that later,\n\n524\n00:30:02.032 --> 00:30:03.624\njust know here by default,\n\n525\n00:30:03.624 --> 00:30:08.773\nit points to that VHDX, which is the newer\nvirtual hard disk driver version.\n\n526\n00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:10.575\nSo they kinda want you to use that, again,\n\n527\n00:30:10.575 --> 00:30:13.725\nthere are certain situations where\nyou would wanna use the older style.\n\n528\n00:30:13.725 --> 00:30:14.615\nWe'll look at that later.\n\n529\n00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.120\nThis is the location that we\nhad specified previously, and\n\n530\n00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:25.710\nthen also looking at this size, the\ngigabytes here for this particular disks.\n\n531\n00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:30.190\nMaybe I don't what that much, and\nI'll just drop this one down to 60 here.\n\n532\n00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:36.823\nEverything, our limitations on our\nclients side Hyper-V are going\n\n533\n00:30:36.823 --> 00:30:42.170\nto be the same on the server side,\nwhich is really cool, actually.\n\n534\n00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:47.502\nBecause we can create virtual machines\nwith that maximum 64 terabytes,\n\n535\n00:30:47.502 --> 00:30:49.543\nwhich blows my mind anyway.\n\n536\n00:30:49.543 --> 00:30:51.487\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't even know of a drive,\n\n537\n00:30:51.487 --> 00:30:53.720\nI've never had one that large.\n\n538\n00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.599\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you can still use your PowerShell\n\n539\n00:30:56.599 --> 00:31:00.140\ncommandlets here in our\nclient side Hyper-V.\n\n540\n00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:04.580\nSo, a lot of those components\nare gonna be the same.\n\n541\n00:31:08.821 --> 00:31:12.784\nUsing an external virtual hard disk, so\nif we had, like I said, kind of pre-stage,\n\n542\n00:31:12.784 --> 00:31:15.740\nyou already created one,\nthey have the option there.\n\n543\n00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:21.080\nAnd I can also, this very last option\nhere, attach a virtual hard disk later.\n\n544\n00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.060\nSo I can create a virtual\nmachine without a hard drive.\n\n545\n00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:29.074\nSo basically, I'm creating\na shell of that virtual machine.\n\n546\n00:31:29.074 --> 00:31:30.460\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And then I have the option\n\n547\n00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.210\nto attach that hard drive later.\n\n548\n00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.666\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, much like if you were building\na physical PC, you might have bought\n\n549\n00:31:35.666 --> 00:31:39.678\nthe cache, the motherboard, the processor,\nthe RAM, all your other components,\n\n550\n00:31:39.678 --> 00:31:43.610\nyou put it together, but your hard drive\nhasn't made it in from your online order.\n\n551\n00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:46.000\nSo you've got this machine sitting there,\nyou can't do anything with it.\n\n552\n00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:46.890\nIt doesn't have a hard drive yet.\n\n553\n00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.540\nThere's nowhere to install\nthe operating system,\n\n554\n00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.200\nbut you can always pop one in later.\n\n555\n00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:50.790\n&gt;&gt; And then, guess what?\n\n556\n00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:55.190\nWhen we pop our hard drive in, what's the\nnext step if you think about building and\n\n557\n00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.500\ncreating a computer?\n\n558\n00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.978\nWell, once we get that hard drive, we get\nall the components attached and hooked up-\n\n559\n00:31:59.978 --> 00:32:00.580\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n560\n00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.530\n&gt;&gt; We need to put some software\non that hardware right?\n\n561\n00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:04.950\nSo that's what we're looking at on\nthis screen, we need to go ahead and\n\n562\n00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.100\ninstall an operating system.\n\n563\n00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:13.150\nSo, we do have the option here to\nkind of procrastinate or offset.\n\n564\n00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.779\nProcrastinate has a negative\nconnotation here-\n\n565\n00:32:15.779 --> 00:32:16.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n566\n00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.370\n&gt;&gt; But maybe I'm not ready, okay?\n\n567\n00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:22.028\nSo maybe I wanna go ahead and install\nan operating system later, I will for\n\n568\n00:32:22.028 --> 00:32:23.975\nthe sake of just creating it right now.\n\n569\n00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:28.917\nBut if I wanted to go ahead and\ninstill the operating system, I would need\n\n570\n00:32:28.917 --> 00:32:31.884\nto have that bootable image file here-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n571\n00:32:31.884 --> 00:32:36.466\n&gt;&gt; So I could navigate to\nthe location where I had it stored.\n\n572\n00:32:36.466 --> 00:32:41.858\nAnd then also, looking at installing from\nnetwork-based installation as well, which,\n\n573\n00:32:41.858 --> 00:32:47.050\nby it being grayed out, and that's because\nmy network adapter is not configured here.\n\n574\n00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:50.470\nSo obviously, and we'll take\na look at that a little bit more.\n\n575\n00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.850\nLike I said, you would need to\nhave connectivity in order to\n\n576\n00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:57.350\nreceive the operating\nsystem from your network.\n\n577\n00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:03.730\nAll right, we'll just go ahead and\nselect Install operating system later.\n\n578\n00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:05.270\nHit Next.\n\n579\n00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:10.100\nThis is going to be my\nsummarization basically, great for\n\n580\n00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.250\nany kind of documentation.\n\n581\n00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.390\nYou could just take a screenshot\nof this real quick,\n\n582\n00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:16.860\nand save it into your\ndocumentation folder.\n\n583\n00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:19.350\nAnd we'll go ahead and hit Finish.\n\n584\n00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.830\nAnd shouldn't take too long,\n\n585\n00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:23.860\nit's actually pretty quick here,\ncreating these virtual machines.\n\n586\n00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.660\nAgain, that's just\ndependent on your hardware.\n\n587\n00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.920\nBut look,\nour new little baby right here, Demo 1.\n\n588\n00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.842\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we have our virtual machine\n\n589\n00:33:32.842 --> 00:33:33.837\ncreated.\n\n590\n00:33:33.837 --> 00:33:35.900\nI do look at the time and\nsee that we're short on time.\n\n591\n00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.790\nSo I think we're gonna\nhave to come back and\n\n592\n00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:41.000\nthen actually configure this new\nmachine that we've just created.\n\n593\n00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.220\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good Cherokee,\ngreat look there.\n\n594\n00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.100\nGetting Hyper-V installed and\ncreating a virtual machine.\n\n595\n00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.660\nMore to come, but for now,\nwe are gonna call it on this episode.\n\n596\n00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.950\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host,\n\n597\n00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:51.640\nMike Rodrick\n&gt;&gt;

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:08.213\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.213 --> 00:00:11.605\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.605 --> 00:00:15.567\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:17.180\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.848\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n9\n00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:23.570\nSpecifically in this episode we're gonna\nbe taking a look at it configuring client\n\n10\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.108\nHyper-V.\n\n11\n00:00:24.108 --> 00:00:27.389\nThis is a part two, so make sure you go\nback and watch the previous episode, but\n\n12\n00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:29.699\nback in studio is none other than Ms.\nCherokee Boose.\n\n13\n00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.363\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:31.379\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me Mike.\n\n15\n00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:32.043\nHow are you today?\n\n16\n00:00:32.043 --> 00:00:32.563\n&gt;&gt; Doing great.\n\n17\n00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:35.493\nExcited to see what else we have\nto talk about with Hyper-V.\n\n18\n00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:36.917\nThere is a lot, I will say that.\n\n19\n00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:39.313\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In the last show we did go ahead and\n\n20\n00:00:39.313 --> 00:00:40.388\ncreate a machine.\n\n21\n00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:42.900\nWe use the GUI to be able to do that.\n\n22\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.270\nSo, in this show I wanted to\nstart off using PowerShell,\n\n23\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.200\nbecause of course as you may already know\nthat is something that we need to know,\n\n24\n00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.420\nespecially for this exam, and that's\nkind of the way things are going so-\n\n25\n00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.212\n&gt;&gt; And it's cool.\n\n26\n00:00:53.212 --> 00:00:53.857\n&gt;&gt; And it's cool.\n\n27\n00:00:53.857 --> 00:00:54.361\n&gt;&gt; I mean, come on, PowerShell.\n\n28\n00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:55.141\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo.\n\n29\n00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:59.023\n&gt;&gt; It's so much more robust in the things\nthat I can do with it than just using that\n\n30\n00:00:59.023 --> 00:00:59.814\nWizard there.\n\n31\n00:00:59.814 --> 00:01:03.612\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and especially I\nfind like with client side Hyper-V,\n\n32\n00:01:03.612 --> 00:01:07.160\ntypically what I'm doing is\nsetting up test networks, right?\n\n33\n00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.276\nSetting up spinning up machines quickly,\nbanging on them,\n\n34\n00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:14.795\ninstalling software, testing things out,\nand then blowing them away, because I need\n\n35\n00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:18.579\na new clean machine to do my next round\nof test with whatever it is, and so,\n\n36\n00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.385\nbeing able to strip this kind of thing\nmakes spinning up a new VM very easy.\n\n37\n00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:25.029\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and especially for\nlarger scale deployment, or\n\n38\n00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:27.346\nlarger scale management\nreally with anything.\n\n39\n00:01:27.346 --> 00:01:33.636\nYou can do a more comprehensive\nexecution of the task.\n\n40\n00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:37.627\nSo just deploying it to several machines\nor executing something on several machines\n\n41\n00:01:37.627 --> 00:01:39.830\nrather than going in and\ndoing it one at a time.\n\n42\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.580\nSo it's pretty cool there.\n\n43\n00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.180\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n44\n00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.110\n&gt;&gt; And because we've been blowing machines\nout and setting them up so frequently,\n\n45\n00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.268\nI very seldomly get to\ncustomize a machine.\n\n46\n00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:51.414\nBut if we take a look at my screen now,\nyou'll see that okay, so\n\n47\n00:01:51.414 --> 00:01:55.250\nthis is the same machine that\nwe were working with before,\n\n48\n00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.948\njust a few things I've changed,\nnot only on my host operating system,\n\n49\n00:01:59.948 --> 00:02:04.647\nwhich is now called CANDYLAND, and\nyou can see that by the desktop, and\n\n50\n00:02:04.647 --> 00:02:09.895\nthroughout the next couple of Hyper-V\nshows we might be working with our actual\n\n51\n00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:15.144\nHyper-V guest, so I wanna distinguish\ninstead of having both the blue Windows\n\n52\n00:02:15.144 --> 00:02:18.661\n10 default backgrounds there just to-\n&gt;&gt; That is definitely different from\n\n53\n00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:19.382\nthe default Windows background.\n\n54\n00:02:19.382 --> 00:02:22.444\n&gt;&gt; I know, I kinda feel like I'm getting\ndiabetes from just looking at this screen\n\n55\n00:02:22.444 --> 00:02:25.266\nright now, but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n56\n00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:26.610\n&gt;&gt; We'll switch it back I promise.\n\n57\n00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.114\n[LAUGH] Anyways for now if you recall we\ndid create that virtual machine called\n\n58\n00:02:32.114 --> 00:02:37.202\nDemo1 one in the last show, and\nthat's the one we created in the GUI.\n\n59\n00:02:37.202 --> 00:02:41.420\nI just changed it slightly\na little bit as well.\n\n60\n00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.651\nWe'll look at that in a few minutes,\nbut going back to what I said,\n\n61\n00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:46.864\nlet's create a machine here in PowerShell.\n\n62\n00:02:46.864 --> 00:02:51.855\nSo the command that we're gonna be using\nhere is simply just going to be new-vm.\n\n63\n00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.820\nI'm gonna stick with that theme\nthat we were doing before so\n\n64\n00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.955\nI'll just say Demo2 here, so\nDemo2 for the name of my machine.\n\n65\n00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:06.685\nIf you were going to create a virtual\nmachine that had any kind of\n\n66\n00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:11.665\nspaces within that name, you'd wanna go\nahead and use quotation marks to signify\n\n67\n00:03:11.665 --> 00:03:16.890\nan entire name space, or piece,\nindividual element there.\n\n68\n00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.515\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; That was it?\n\n69\n00:03:18.515 --> 00:03:19.073\n&gt;&gt; That was it Mike.\n\n70\n00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:20.133\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; We're done.\n\n71\n00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.728\nWe can end this show,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n72\n00:03:21.728 --> 00:03:24.654\n&gt;&gt; All right, well I hope you guys enjoyed\nthis one, signing out, just kidding.\n\n73\n00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:25.806\nThere's gotta be more to it than that?\n\n74\n00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:28.869\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There definitely is, right?\n\n75\n00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:32.627\nWe went through that entire Wizard,\nand it was prompting us throughout,\n\n76\n00:03:32.627 --> 00:03:36.275\nasking us things like memory, and\ndefault location, and all of that.\n\n77\n00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:38.564\nWell, let me just go ahead and\nminimize this,\n\n78\n00:03:38.564 --> 00:03:40.980\nlet's see if there actually\nis a machine there.\n\n79\n00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.880\nWell, sure enough there is a machine.\n\n80\n00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.003\nIf I can go over that?\n\n81\n00:03:46.003 --> 00:03:50.664\nThere's Demo2, and if we take a look at\nthat, you might even be thinking Cherokee,\n\n82\n00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:55.070\nyou talked about all these things that\nwere super important like having to choose\n\n83\n00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.958\nbetween generation 1 and\ngeneration 2 machines.\n\n84\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.590\nWe don't even have to\nchoose anything there.\n\n85\n00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.677\nSo this is more or less just\na placeholder for a virtual machine,\n\n86\n00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:06.582\nlike a chassis or something.\n\n87\n00:04:06.582 --> 00:04:11.085\nThere aren't any specific or\ncustomized settings yet.\n\n88\n00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:14.375\nSo actually talking about settings,\nlet's just go ahead and right-click, and\n\n89\n00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:16.290\nselect settings,\nI'll zoom out a little bit.\n\n90\n00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.560\nIf I have multiple virtual\nmachines running I can\n\n91\n00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.230\nuse these little arrows to flip through\nthe different settings options, but for\n\n92\n00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.450\nright now I do wanna pull\nthem both up side by side so\n\n93\n00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.950\nwe can really go through and\nlook at the differences there real quick.\n\n94\n00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.420\nWe'll go through all the settings\nin more detail, but for\n\n95\n00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.960\nright now let's just take a look here.\n\n96\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.500\nAll right,\nmaking sure we can get them all, perfect.\n\n97\n00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.994\nLooking at these two side by side, just at\na first glance, well, what do we see here?\n\n98\n00:04:48.994 --> 00:04:52.391\nWe did already talk about, and I showed\nyou a diagram where there was some\n\n99\n00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:56.122\ndifferences in the hardware, and I'll also\nshow you a link and put it in the show\n\n100\n00:04:56.122 --> 00:04:59.934\nnotes that you have it available that\nreally detail explain those differences.\n\n101\n00:04:59.934 --> 00:05:03.594\nSo it might take awhile for\nyou to get acclimated and\n\n102\n00:05:03.594 --> 00:05:07.086\njust accustomed to being\nable to look at these and\n\n103\n00:05:07.086 --> 00:05:12.449\nquickly identify which one is a gen one\nversus gen two, because that cmdlet\n\n104\n00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.559\nhere with the PowerShell virtual\nmachine that we just created Demo2,\n\n105\n00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:22.072\nwe didn't say explicitly that\nthat should be a Gen1 machine or\n\n106\n00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:27.480\na Gen 2 machine, so by default\nthe operating system chose Generation 1.\n\n107\n00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.592\nAnd we can see that by a lot of\nthe older components that we have here,\n\n108\n00:05:32.592 --> 00:05:37.886\nlike our older IDE drives, comports,\nobi drives, we don't see that\n\n109\n00:05:37.886 --> 00:05:42.176\nhere in our machine Demo1, this is the-\n&gt;&gt; Gen two.\n\n110\n00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:44.799\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the gen two for Demo1.\n\n111\n00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:46.392\nKind of did the naming there backwards?\n\n112\n00:05:46.392 --> 00:05:50.282\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyways you get the point, and\n\n113\n00:05:50.282 --> 00:05:55.512\nactually since we're right here, let\nme just go ahead and pull up that link,\n\n114\n00:05:55.512 --> 00:06:00.660\nbecause I think it's something that\nMicrosoft does do a very good job on it,\n\n115\n00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.490\nstressing the important between those.\n\n116\n00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.422\nLet's see, I got pulled up somewhere here,\n\n117\n00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:14.316\nIt's going to be,\nI wanted to show you this page also, but\n\n118\n00:06:14.316 --> 00:06:18.092\nscrolling down there is another\nhyperlink if I can find it here.\n\n119\n00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:21.633\nI say that, and I promise I'm not lying.\n\n120\n00:06:21.633 --> 00:06:22.409\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n121\n00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:23.910\nShould I create a gen one or gen two?\n\n122\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.706\nI showed you another link\nin the last show, but\n\n123\n00:06:25.706 --> 00:06:27.147\nthis one's a little bit different.\n\n124\n00:06:27.147 --> 00:06:30.989\nThis, I thought it was cool because\nit had a nice little tables here,\n\n125\n00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:34.967\nwith really nice information about\nthe different operating systems,\n\n126\n00:06:34.967 --> 00:06:37.483\nwhich if we could go fullscreen for\na second,\n\n127\n00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:41.988\nI'm not sure if I did mention this, but\nit's important to know, especially for\n\n128\n00:06:41.988 --> 00:06:46.294\nthat exam, if you're ever presented\nwith any kind of scenario where you were\n\n129\n00:06:46.294 --> 00:06:51.065\nworking with older systems, looking at\nour server 2008 operating systems, and\n\n130\n00:06:51.065 --> 00:06:55.372\nmaybe an older client side system you'll\nsee that generation two, gen two,\n\n131\n00:06:55.372 --> 00:06:57.812\nVMs are not gonna support Port Windows 7.\n\n132\n00:06:57.812 --> 00:07:00.634\nSo that, I mean there are certain\nsituations where Gen 1,\n\n133\n00:07:00.634 --> 00:07:03.852\nwe were kind of joking Mike about\nhaving picking Gen 2 all the time,\n\n134\n00:07:03.852 --> 00:07:07.747\nbut you might have situations where you\nhave to revert back to that older version,\n\n135\n00:07:07.747 --> 00:07:11.020\nand there's one more section I wanted\nto kind of point out to you, and\n\n136\n00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.885\nyou guys can peruse on your leisure.\n\n137\n00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:17.505\nBut what we were just looking at there\nin the graphical user interface,\n\n138\n00:07:17.505 --> 00:07:20.508\nlooking at those different\ntypes of drives and\n\n139\n00:07:20.508 --> 00:07:24.137\nhardware that we could go ahead and\nutilize right here.\n\n140\n00:07:24.137 --> 00:07:25.575\nI mean, so it's pretty cool.\n\n141\n00:07:25.575 --> 00:07:28.913\nThat link right there.\n\n142\n00:07:28.913 --> 00:07:33.579\nAnd of course, they talk about the Gen\n2 performing better, and it's kinda,\n\n143\n00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:38.110\nit goes with this thing like, you look\nat the hardware that they have provided\n\n144\n00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.731\nin the Gen 1's, and there's this term\nthat they use for it called emulated.\n\n145\n00:07:42.731 --> 00:07:47.877\nSo, when you're emulating the hardware,\nthe drivers are not going to be\n\n146\n00:07:47.877 --> 00:07:53.355\nas good as synthetic pieces of hardware\nthat are created in Gen 2 machines, so\n\n147\n00:07:53.355 --> 00:07:59.262\nthe emulated hardware is more clunky, and\nnot as efficient as synthetic hardware.\n\n148\n00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:00.166\nIf that makes sense.\n\n149\n00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:00.977\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n150\n00:08:00.977 --> 00:08:02.022\n&gt;&gt; All right, cool.\n\n151\n00:08:02.022 --> 00:08:03.440\nSo what did we wanna do here?\n\n152\n00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.750\nLet's go ahead and\nclose out of Demo1 for right now.\n\n153\n00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.810\nAnd we'll just close out of here.\n\n154\n00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.510\nLet's get back into PowerShell\nas a matter of fact so\n\n155\n00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:16.568\nwe can see that both these machines\nare currently in an off state.\n\n156\n00:08:16.568 --> 00:08:20.800\nWe could right-click and\nthen go ahead and start them up that way.\n\n157\n00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.498\nBut, oops, I don't know why\nI clicked on Edge right now.\n\n158\n00:08:24.498 --> 00:08:26.830\nLet me go ahead and close out of there.\n\n159\n00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.390\nWe don't want to look at that.\n\n160\n00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.440\nWe're gonna get back into PowerShell.\n\n161\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.150\nLet me just clear this screen here.\n\n162\n00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.050\nWe see that state also being\nnoted there as being off.\n\n163\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.460\nMaybe I wanted to go ahead and\nstart a machine or stop a machine.\n\n164\n00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.530\nI have the ability to go ahead and do that\nright here within PowerShell as well.\n\n165\n00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.268\nSo if I just say, for\nthis it's just going to be start,\n\n166\n00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:53.885\ndash, I can't type dash VM right there.\n\n167\n00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.670\nAnd again, if you had any\n\n168\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.280\nspaces in your virtual machine name you'd\nwant to go ahead and use those quotations.\n\n169\n00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.170\nI don't.\n\n170\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.680\nSo we can start Demo2 now.\n\n171\n00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:10.130\nI will say Demo2 we just created, doesn't\nhave any kind of virtual hard disk.\n\n172\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.740\nWe didn't attach to Demo2, right?\n\n173\n00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.590\nWe didn't install an operating system.\n\n174\n00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:20.410\nSo we can start this machine and you can\nsee that it states here that it's running,\n\n175\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.450\nbut it doesn't have an operating system.\n\n176\n00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.702\nSo basically,\nthat would be the same as powering on,\n\n177\n00:09:25.702 --> 00:09:29.917\npushing the power button on a tower or\nserver, something like that.\n\n178\n00:09:29.917 --> 00:09:35.031\nAll right, so you can go ahead and\nremove also, would be comparable\n\n179\n00:09:35.031 --> 00:09:40.160\nto right-clicking and\ndeleting their graphical user interface.\n\n180\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.706\nSo if I just say, remove-vm.\n\n181\n00:09:42.706 --> 00:09:45.310\n&gt;&gt; Can you do that while I try?\n\n182\n00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.492\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, and\nI didn't even spell that right.\n\n183\n00:09:47.492 --> 00:09:51.470\nLet's go ahead and stop it, or\n\n184\n00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.847\nlet's try to [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Live on the edge.\n\n185\n00:09:54.847 --> 00:09:55.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n186\n00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.588\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] Remove Demo2.\n\n187\n00:09:56.588 --> 00:10:01.720\nAnd of course, I didn't capitalize,\nbut that's not an issue here.\n\n188\n00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.540\nAre you sure you wanna remove?\n\n189\n00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.150\nSo sometimes in Power Shell,\n\n190\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:09.160\nwe don't always get those extra reminders\nwhen we're doing something destructive.\n\n191\n00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.620\nBut here let's be destructive, Mike.\n\n192\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.970\nSo we'll say A for yes to all and\ngo ahead and hit that button.\n\n193\n00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.860\nRemove, deleting Demo2 failed.\n\n194\n00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.277\nAnd you can see from the actual syntax\nhere that PowerShell provides us, it says,\n\n195\n00:10:24.277 --> 00:10:26.335\nthis operation cannot be performed.\n\n196\n00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:29.834\nI can actually highlight it and\nit makes it more difficult to read,\n\n197\n00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:32.380\nwhile the object is in its current state.\n\n198\n00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.890\nSo to answer your question, no, we cannot.\n\n199\n00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:41.450\nSo let's go ahead and stop-vm space demo2.\n\n200\n00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.780\nAll right, is unavailable.\n\n201\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.680\nWoof, this brings up\nanother good point here.\n\n202\n00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.840\nAnd this is what happens when\nyou do things on the fly.\n\n203\n00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.010\nBut that's okay.\n\n204\n00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.110\nI want you guys to look at this.\n\n205\n00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.771\nIt says, hyper-v can't shut down virtual\nmachine Demo2 because the shutdown\n\n206\n00:10:57.771 --> 00:11:00.045\nIntegration service is unavailable.\n\n207\n00:11:00.045 --> 00:11:01.340\nAll right.\n\n208\n00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.950\n&gt;&gt; And Cherokee, we talked about the\ndifference between shutdown and power off.\n\n209\n00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:04.670\n&gt;&gt; Did we?\n\n210\n00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.160\n&gt;&gt; And shutdown, I think we did, right?\n\n211\n00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:06.850\nOr did we not?\n\n212\n00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:07.520\n&gt;&gt; I don't think we did.\n\n213\n00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's do that.\n\n214\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, yeah,\nthis is the perfect time to do that.\n\n215\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.970\nYeah, so Mike, what's the difference\nbetween shutting down and\n\n216\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:14.770\npowering off, right?\n\n217\n00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, shutdown, the idea is that we can\nsend a command to the operating system and\n\n218\n00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.810\ndo a graceful shutdown which means Just\nlike you were to go to Shutdown from\n\n219\n00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:22.520\nthe Start Menu, right?\n\n220\n00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.530\nIt's gonna stop all the services,\nshut everything down,\n\n221\n00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.290\nshut the operating system down.\n\n222\n00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.050\nWhereas Power Off is more\nlike pulling the plug or\n\n223\n00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.550\nholding the power button down and\ndoing a hard shutdown.\n\n224\n00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.900\nSince there's no operating\nsystem on this VM-\n\n225\n00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.570\n&gt;&gt; You can't gracefully shut it down.\n\n226\n00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.438\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no operating system to\n\n227\n00:11:39.438 --> 00:11:42.540\nsend that command to, so\nyour only option is gonna be to power off.\n\n228\n00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're gonna go ahead and\nsay yes to all, and\n\n229\n00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.800\nthis is that kind of\ndestructive way to go ahead and\n\n230\n00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.890\nturn this machine off,\nlike unplugging it from the wall there.\n\n231\n00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.480\nWe will take a look at, did it go through?\n\n232\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.300\nOkay, let me just check.\n\n233\n00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.921\nNow, you can see that the state\nis off in the background, but\n\n234\n00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:06.750\nagain, if we wanted to check\non that here in PowerShell,\n\n235\n00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:12.180\nyou could use the command get-vm\ndemo2 to look at the status of\n\n236\n00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:17.350\nthat machine like we first initially\nsaw when it provided us this table.\n\n237\n00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.478\nBut you can get this table at\nany time by using that command.\n\n238\n00:12:21.478 --> 00:12:23.845\nSo get-vm.\n\n239\n00:12:23.845 --> 00:12:27.330\nAnd there is also a link that I have\nin the show notes for you that have\n\n240\n00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.689\nthe switches, the different options that\nyou have available for you to go ahead and\n\n241\n00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:35.142\nwork with and manipulate those\nvirtual machines in PowerShell.\n\n242\n00:12:35.142 --> 00:12:37.269\nBecause like Mike and\nI were talking about in the beginning,\n\n243\n00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.760\nit's great to be able to have\na graphical user interface but\n\n244\n00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.890\nwhen you're dealing with multiple virtual\nmachines, then it can be a lot easier to\n\n245\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:51.920\ngo ahead and\nmanage them here with PowerShell.\n\n246\n00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.520\nAll right, let me clear my screen.\n\n247\n00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.910\nWhat else do we wanna\ndo here in PowerShell?\n\n248\n00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:56.688\nWe just created that machine.\n\n249\n00:12:56.688 --> 00:12:57.910\nWe didn't delete it, actually.\n\n250\n00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.785\n&gt;&gt; We didn't shut it down, yeah.\n\n251\n00:12:58.785 --> 00:13:01.150\n&gt;&gt; That's what we were gonna do, yeah.\n\n252\n00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.060\nOkay, so if I just use my up arrow,\n\n253\n00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.290\neventually remove is\nwhat we want it to do.\n\n254\n00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.100\nSo I'll go back to remove dash demo2.\n\n255\n00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.720\nNow it's gonna ask me the same thing\nagain, a, do we want to delete?\n\n256\n00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.820\nGive it a second there.\n\n257\n00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.520\nAnd we can even just kind of zoom in and\ncheck on that.\n\n258\n00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.290\nWe don't see it there.\n\n259\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.970\nSo yeah, pretty easy.\n\n260\n00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.460\nYep.\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n261\n00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:28.590\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's look at another\nthing we can do here within PowerShell.\n\n262\n00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.260\nAgain, I'm expecting the screen\nto give us some space.\n\n263\n00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.880\nLet's create a virtual hard disk drive.\n\n264\n00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.643\nWe've done this before, so create new-vhd.\n\n265\n00:13:37.643 --> 00:13:40.550\nWe need to specify a path.\n\n266\n00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.930\nI'm going to go ahead and\nuse a path different than the default.\n\n267\n00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.410\nSo my path is going to be on the C drive.\n\n268\n00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:51.138\nAnd if you recall in the last show,\nwe did create a folder called VMDEMO, so\n\n269\n00:13:51.138 --> 00:13:53.260\nlet's go ahead and use that one again.\n\n270\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.720\nAnd for this one,\nlet's name this disk DEMODISK3.\n\n271\n00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.806\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\n\n272\n00:14:02.806 --> 00:14:05.770\ncreate a .VHDX.\n\n273\n00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:11.110\nRemember that was the later version\nof virtual hard disk drives.\n\n274\n00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:15.890\nAnd I should note to that, VHDX is\ndesigned to be working with our Gen 2\n\n275\n00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.070\nmachine so as we're progressing here,\njust keep that in mind and\n\n276\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.170\nyou'll want to keep that in mind when\nyou're creating your machines also.\n\n277\n00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.490\nI could create a dynamically\nexpanding disk.\n\n278\n00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:33.590\nI could even set a upper maximum size for\nthat dynamically expanding disc so\n\n279\n00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.690\nthat the disc doesn't grow\nlarger than I really want it to.\n\n280\n00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.730\nBut for now,\nlet's just create a fixed size disc.\n\n281\n00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:44.940\nI do need to specific a size for that disc\nif I'm going to create a fixed sized disc.\n\n282\n00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.340\nAnd I can go ahead and tab through.\n\n283\n00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.410\nWe see that its size in bytes,\nit's says size bytes.\n\n284\n00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.550\nDon't let that confuse you because you can\nuse gigabytes as a unit of measure, so\n\n285\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.000\nlet's go ahead and do five GB.\n\n286\n00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.406\nIf you forget to add a size and\nyou hit Enter and\n\n287\n00:15:01.406 --> 00:15:06.348\nyou run this command,\nyou'll be prompted for a unit of measure.\n\n288\n00:15:06.348 --> 00:15:10.283\nAnd at that point in time it\nwon't take the gigabyte, so\n\n289\n00:15:10.283 --> 00:15:13.480\nyou'll have to actually\nuse the five bytes.\n\n290\n00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.675\nSo if you type in a five with nine zeros,\n\n291\n00:15:15.675 --> 00:15:18.950\nyou just have to think about\nthe conversion factor there.\n\n292\n00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.680\n&gt;&gt; All right, so this time we're\ncreating the drive ahead of time.\n\n293\n00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.430\nI know you're gonna create a VM and\nattach that drive later.\n\n294\n00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:30.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so like maybe I wanna\npre-stage this particular situation and\n\n295\n00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.590\nmaybe I'm gonna delegate or\nsomething like that.\n\n296\n00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.950\nSo this really isn't gonna take a long\ntime because I am creating only a five gig\n\n297\n00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:41.721\ndrive, but maybe you wanna expedite this\nprocess or whatever your reasoning may be.\n\n298\n00:15:41.721 --> 00:15:45.621\nNow remember,\nbecause we are creating a fixed disk,\n\n299\n00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:50.908\nit is kind of staking the claim on\nthat continguous five gigs rate there,\n\n300\n00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:55.435\nso we have to wait for\nthat entire five gigs to be established.\n\n301\n00:15:55.435 --> 00:15:58.291\nSo that's what we're waiting on right now,\nbut as soon as that happens,\n\n302\n00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:58.990\nwe'll go ahead.\n\n303\n00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.787\nCreate the virtual machine like we saw,\n\n304\n00:16:01.787 --> 00:16:05.666\npreviously we're just creating that Shell,\nI guess?\n\n305\n00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:09.040\nYes, the hard disk, so\nif you had your actual hard disk drive,\n\n306\n00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.605\na physical piece of drive,\nthat's what we're creating now, and\n\n307\n00:16:12.605 --> 00:16:16.441\nthen we're gonna create, we're gonna\ntake the machine and put it in.\n\n308\n00:16:16.441 --> 00:16:18.521\nThat's the goal here, if that makes sense.\n\n309\n00:16:18.521 --> 00:16:19.780\nAll right.\n\n310\n00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.754\nHalfway there.\n\n311\n00:16:20.754 --> 00:16:23.876\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something else,\n\n312\n00:16:23.876 --> 00:16:28.368\nwhile we're talking, I do wanna mention\na little bit later integration services,\n\n313\n00:16:28.368 --> 00:16:30.533\nwe're gonna come back to those as well.\n\n314\n00:16:30.533 --> 00:16:33.973\nYou guys saw that as part of\nthat PowerShell error messages.\n\n315\n00:16:33.973 --> 00:16:39.403\nSo if you have never seen that before,\nwe will come back to that as well.\n\n316\n00:16:39.403 --> 00:16:41.251\nAll right, 67% there.\n\n317\n00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:42.888\n&gt;&gt; Almost done, there it goes.\n\n318\n00:16:42.888 --> 00:16:47.176\n&gt;&gt; And in real life, you wouldn't really\nbe creating a virtual hard disk for\n\n319\n00:16:47.176 --> 00:16:47.874\nfive gigs.\n\n320\n00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:51.339\nI mean, you can't even install\nan operating system on that, and\n\n321\n00:16:51.339 --> 00:16:53.106\nI only did that to help save time.\n\n322\n00:16:53.106 --> 00:16:54.585\nBut obviously it wasn't enough time.\n\n323\n00:16:54.585 --> 00:16:56.686\nMaybe next time I'll do one gig or\nsomething.\n\n324\n00:16:56.686 --> 00:16:57.425\n&gt;&gt; 500 megs.\n\n325\n00:16:57.425 --> 00:16:59.945\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n326\n00:16:59.945 --> 00:17:04.311\nI don't know if there's any kind of lower\ncontrol limit for the size there but-\n\n327\n00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:07.031\n&gt;&gt; I've made some pretty small drives,\n\n328\n00:17:07.031 --> 00:17:10.604\nI wanna say 5 megs I've gone down to,\nwhat is it?\n\n329\n00:17:10.604 --> 00:17:13.253\nWhen you create a blank one I think\nit's four kilobytes in size, right?\n\n330\n00:17:13.253 --> 00:17:16.499\nWhen you create a dynamic\ndisk with no data on it yet?\n\n331\n00:17:16.499 --> 00:17:19.044\nI think [INAUDIBLE]-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually that's a good point\n\n332\n00:17:19.044 --> 00:17:22.669\nbecause when we created that first,\nand I didn't show you guys that.\n\n333\n00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:26.430\nBut just know that in that,\nwhat was it, demo two,\n\n334\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:31.765\nthat machine that we created where we\njust said new VM demo two, it will,\n\n335\n00:17:31.765 --> 00:17:37.118\nthe operating system will apply\nnecessary default limitations there.\n\n336\n00:17:37.118 --> 00:17:40.943\nSo like for memory, we didn't specify\nhow much memory we want that virtual\n\n337\n00:17:40.943 --> 00:17:42.958\nmachine to have, but it did create it.\n\n338\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.372\nSo looking, I think it's cool\nif you can just go ahead and\n\n339\n00:17:46.372 --> 00:17:49.229\njust create one to see\nwhat it looks like there.\n\n340\n00:17:49.229 --> 00:17:54.113\nAll right, so now we see that our virtual\nhard disk, or five gig disk, has been\n\n341\n00:17:54.113 --> 00:17:58.487\ncreated inside of our host operating\nsystem store on the C drive here.\n\n342\n00:17:58.487 --> 00:18:01.066\nRemember, that's for\nour machine there for Candy Land.\n\n343\n00:18:01.066 --> 00:18:04.203\nAll right,\nnow let's create our virtual machine.\n\n344\n00:18:04.203 --> 00:18:09.811\nSo we're gonna use the command new-,\nthis is going to be vm.\n\n345\n00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:14.547\nAnd the name for our vm, let's go\nahead and call this one demo three,\n\n346\n00:18:14.547 --> 00:18:16.927\njust to stick with our theme here.\n\n347\n00:18:16.927 --> 00:18:18.230\nSo this is demo three, and\n\n348\n00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.442\nlike I've mentioned without memory let's\ngo ahead and specify an amount that I just\n\n349\n00:18:22.442 --> 00:18:26.317\nused my tab key because virtual machines\nloves memory and this is kind of fun.\n\n350\n00:18:26.317 --> 00:18:28.711\nCuz this is the first thing\nthat it pops up with, so\n\n351\n00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:30.487\nthat one's an easy one to use there.\n\n352\n00:18:30.487 --> 00:18:33.805\nLet's go ahead and\ngive this machine one gig, and\n\n353\n00:18:33.805 --> 00:18:38.387\nalso we didn't specify the generation\nof that previous machine, so\n\n354\n00:18:38.387 --> 00:18:43.368\nwe need to specify the generation here,\nso we'll start tabbing through.\n\n355\n00:18:43.368 --> 00:18:47.430\nFor our generation, there are only two\nvalues available at this current time,\n\n356\n00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.713\nit's either one or two.\n\n357\n00:18:48.713 --> 00:18:49.999\nWe want a two.\n\n358\n00:18:49.999 --> 00:18:51.309\nWhy do we want a two?\n\n359\n00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:55.695\nWhat kind of disc do we create?\n\n360\n00:18:55.695 --> 00:18:56.747\nThink about that.\n\n361\n00:18:56.747 --> 00:18:57.459\n&gt;&gt; VHDX?\n\n362\n00:18:57.459 --> 00:18:58.376\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah.\n\n363\n00:18:58.376 --> 00:19:02.677\nSo remember VHDX is gonna be used\nwith our Gen 2 machines here, so\n\n364\n00:19:02.677 --> 00:19:07.544\nwe wanna make sure we're paying\nattention to that and specify our Gen 2.\n\n365\n00:19:07.544 --> 00:19:15.475\nWe've got our VHD path now so, Because\nwe've already created that, all right?\n\n366\n00:19:15.475 --> 00:19:18.824\nSo we go ahead and we type our VHD path,\n\n367\n00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:23.549\nlet me make sure I'm typing\nthis right here, Gen 2.\n\n368\n00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:29.661\nThis is going to be under\nour C-drive as well,\n\n369\n00:19:29.661 --> 00:19:33.266\nthat was C:\\ VMDemo, and\n\n370\n00:19:33.266 --> 00:19:37.359\nthat was Dedmodisk3.vhdx.\n\n371\n00:19:39.959 --> 00:19:41.812\nI'm pretty sure that's correct, right?\n\n372\n00:19:41.812 --> 00:19:43.087\nWe'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n373\n00:19:43.087 --> 00:19:48.256\n&gt;&gt; We got a, an error in demodisk,\nI see d-e-d, demo [INAUDIBLE].\n\n374\n00:19:48.256 --> 00:19:51.488\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the name isn't correct, al right,\nI'll wait for that to go ahead and\n\n375\n00:19:51.488 --> 00:19:52.103\ncheck for it.\n\n376\n00:19:52.103 --> 00:19:59.662\nAnd just come back and\nget rid of that, all right.\n\n377\n00:19:59.662 --> 00:20:05.384\nAnd I do want you to pay attention to,\nlet me see which portion here.\n\n378\n00:20:08.767 --> 00:20:13.727\nHow we just created the path here for\nour vhd, okay?\n\n379\n00:20:13.727 --> 00:20:18.201\nWe do have the ability to go ahead and\ncreate the hard disk and\n\n380\n00:20:18.201 --> 00:20:21.075\nthe virtual machine at the same time.\n\n381\n00:20:21.075 --> 00:20:23.973\nSo I wanna show you that as well, but\nI wanted to kind of run through the paces\n\n382\n00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:26.749\nhere and just let you know that there\nare different options available.\n\n383\n00:20:26.749 --> 00:20:30.347\nSo now we do see this\nmachine that was created, and\n\n384\n00:20:30.347 --> 00:20:34.471\nwe had pointed it to this\nvirtual hard disk drive up here.\n\n385\n00:20:34.471 --> 00:20:39.025\nSo that's one way to do it, let's go\nahead and clear the screen, though.\n\n386\n00:20:39.025 --> 00:20:42.255\nThe last thing that I\nwanna show you here for\n\n387\n00:20:42.255 --> 00:20:46.853\nthe creation of new virtual\nmachines is going to be new- vm.\n\n388\n00:20:48.868 --> 00:20:53.997\nAnd for this name, this one again\nwe're just gonna stick with the theme,\n\n389\n00:20:53.997 --> 00:20:55.824\nwe're gonna say Demo4.\n\n390\n00:20:55.824 --> 00:21:01.405\nAnd my Memory Startup here,\nagain let's just keep it simplified 1 gig.\n\n391\n00:21:01.405 --> 00:21:06.378\nAnd now the path is a little bit different\nbecause we've just specified that\n\n392\n00:21:06.378 --> 00:21:07.629\nlocation before.\n\n393\n00:21:07.629 --> 00:21:12.586\nThis time I wanna go ahead and\nI wanna specify new.\n\n394\n00:21:12.586 --> 00:21:17.173\nAnd now I'm gonna say, a VHD path.\n\n395\n00:21:19.118 --> 00:21:22.539\nOkay, and that's simply because\nI'm creating a new path,\n\n396\n00:21:22.539 --> 00:21:24.291\nthat virtual hard disk drive.\n\n397\n00:21:24.291 --> 00:21:25.574\nIt's never been created before.\n\n398\n00:21:25.574 --> 00:21:30.017\nThat's what we're doing right now so\nwe need to tell the system that.\n\n399\n00:21:30.017 --> 00:21:38.697\nAlso for my Gen 2, we don't wanna forget\nthat, And let me put this path in,\n\n400\n00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:43.689\nyou could put the path right afterwards,\nit shouldn't matter, but we'll find out.\n\n401\n00:21:43.689 --> 00:21:48.904\nSo our VHD backslash,\nwe're gonna again call this one demo\n\n402\n00:21:48.904 --> 00:21:54.756\ndisc 4 just to keep with that style,\nVHDX because it's a gen two.\n\n403\n00:21:54.756 --> 00:21:59.572\nAnd we need to specify our\nnew VHD size bytes, and\n\n404\n00:21:59.572 --> 00:22:03.226\nthat's going to be, let's try it.\n\n405\n00:22:03.226 --> 00:22:04.745\nLet's try it with the one.\n\n406\n00:22:04.745 --> 00:22:08.336\nI have never made a VHD that small but\nlet's go ahead and give it a go so\n\n407\n00:22:08.336 --> 00:22:09.977\nwe don't have to wait as long.\n\n408\n00:22:09.977 --> 00:22:12.868\nOop, I'm missing my new path there.\n\n409\n00:22:12.868 --> 00:22:15.401\nOkay, so it doesn't like it\nwith my Gen 2 right there.\n\n410\n00:22:15.401 --> 00:22:18.973\nI was kind of wondering about that, I've\nnever put it right in the middle there.\n\n411\n00:22:18.973 --> 00:22:20.051\nLet's go ahead and,\n\n412\n00:22:28.155 --> 00:22:36.916\nTack it on at the end here, or\nmine actually right here, Generation two.\n\n413\n00:22:36.916 --> 00:22:41.813\nAll right, let's see if it likes that.\n\n414\n00:22:41.813 --> 00:22:44.563\nAnd it did, and it created that.\n\n415\n00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:47.673\nWe can see demo 4 here in\nthe current state is off.\n\n416\n00:22:47.673 --> 00:22:51.521\nAnd if I just minimize this you can see\nall the machines that we've already\n\n417\n00:22:51.521 --> 00:22:55.695\ncreated, with the exception of demo two\nbecause we did get rid of that to there.\n\n418\n00:22:55.695 --> 00:22:58.573\nSo yeah, different ways we\ncan go ahead and do that.\n\n419\n00:22:58.573 --> 00:23:02.069\nNow, now that we have\nour virtual machines,\n\n420\n00:23:02.069 --> 00:23:06.763\nwhat if I wanted to go ahead and\ncreate checkpoints for them?\n\n421\n00:23:06.763 --> 00:23:09.755\nSo I said we were gonna look\nat all of these details for\n\n422\n00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:13.359\neach individual machine there\nare settings, and then also for\n\n423\n00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:17.646\nour hypervisor, our virtual machine\nmanager here, there are settings.\n\n424\n00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:21.757\nSo, I'll just right-click on one of these,\nand if I go to Settings,\n\n425\n00:23:21.757 --> 00:23:25.541\nyou'll see that it is an option\nthat we do have available for us.\n\n426\n00:23:25.541 --> 00:23:30.604\nSo, oops, let me, I was gonna use the\nother zoom, let's zoom in a little bit.\n\n427\n00:23:33.148 --> 00:23:34.956\nCheck points.\n\n428\n00:23:34.956 --> 00:23:40.150\nCheck points are going to be\nlike a current as is picture for\n\n429\n00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.441\na machine at a certain point in time.\n\n430\n00:23:43.441 --> 00:23:46.681\nSo, there are different types\nof checkpoints that we do have\n\n431\n00:23:46.681 --> 00:23:47.640\navailable to us.\n\n432\n00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:52.730\nIf I go ahead and just left-click\non this section right here for\n\n433\n00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:56.871\nour checkpoints,\nwe see some options available.\n\n434\n00:23:56.871 --> 00:24:01.367\nAll right, so it says you can configure\noptions for, check configure options for\n\n435\n00:24:01.367 --> 00:24:04.625\ncheck point for,\nwhich is kinda sounds weird but anyways,\n\n436\n00:24:04.625 --> 00:24:08.260\njust know that there are different\ntypes of check points.\n\n437\n00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.530\nNumber one,\nyou have to enable this feature.\n\n438\n00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:13.730\nIf you turn it off, then you're not able\nto go ahead and utilize check points.\n\n439\n00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.950\nSo by default, this is enabled,\nand we will leave that there.\n\n440\n00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:23.190\nNow, I have the ability to\nuse production checkpoints.\n\n441\n00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.820\nProduction checkpoints use\nbackup technology in the guest\n\n442\n00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.250\noperating system to create data\nconsistent checkpoints that\n\n443\n00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.780\ndon't include information\nabout running applications.\n\n444\n00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:37.680\nSo, information that's stored in memory\nand I don't, gonna say unimportant but\n\n445\n00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.700\nmay be unnecessary information is\nnot gonna be retained there as well\n\n446\n00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.550\nfor our production checkpoints.\n\n447\n00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:50.817\nNow, this little guy right here says,\ncreate standard checkpoints if the guest\n\n448\n00:24:50.817 --> 00:24:54.140\ndoes not support creation\nof production checkpoints.\n\n449\n00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.920\nSo this is kind of like,\nhey, if that doesn't work,\n\n450\n00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.050\nthen try this type deal, right?\n\n451\n00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:03.080\nAnd if I wanted to just\ncreate standard checkpoints.\n\n452\n00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.160\nSo that's the older style of checkpoints\nthat we've seen around for a long time.\n\n453\n00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:12.980\nThis is going to be the whole kit and\ncaboodle, so all of your settings\n\n454\n00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.670\nplus information that was stored in memory\nfor those standard checkpoints there.\n\n455\n00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.930\nNow, when your checkpoints are created,\nand we saw this in the last show,\n\n456\n00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:28.260\nthe different types of files that\nwe see here, in our hypervisor.\n\n457\n00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.200\nThose are gonna be those AVHD files.\n\n458\n00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.650\nSo the virtual hard disks that we were\nworking with, this is just a very,\n\n459\n00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:39.080\nour AVHD files are a variation\nof those virtual hard disks.\n\n460\n00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.250\nAnd that's what you'll\nsee them being noted as.\n\n461\n00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:47.784\nAnd they'll be living or residing in this\ndefault location, unless you change them.\n\n462\n00:25:47.784 --> 00:25:51.900\nAnd we've already talked about, I think we\nhave, why we would want to change them.\n\n463\n00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most likely, I mean,\nyou really don't want your snapshots,\n\n464\n00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.710\nyour checkpoints,\nbeing stored on your C drive.\n\n465\n00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.480\nEspecially if you take very many of them,\nyou can eat up a lot of disk space,\n\n466\n00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.900\nreally cause some contention\nperformance issues, as well.\n\n467\n00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.936\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and also, I mean,\nif you think about it,\n\n468\n00:26:06.936 --> 00:26:10.140\nlike what if something catastrophic\nhappens to your physical machine, and\n\n469\n00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.350\nyou're saving those on that\nphysical machine as well.\n\n470\n00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:18.550\nSo maybe if you had an external or\nnetwork share, something like that,\n\n471\n00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:23.505\nand just depends faster drive maybe\nif you have like our computers.\n\n472\n00:26:23.505 --> 00:26:27.775\nMike, we have that optical drive,\nthis little solid state.\n\n473\n00:26:27.775 --> 00:26:30.415\nMaybe you have one that is larger,\nyou have more storage space,\n\n474\n00:26:30.415 --> 00:26:34.635\nbecause these files can be large depending\non how large that virtual machine, or\n\n475\n00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:36.665\nwhat you've got going on\ninside of that environment.\n\n476\n00:26:36.665 --> 00:26:38.375\nSo just keep that in mind as well.\n\n477\n00:26:40.005 --> 00:26:44.075\nOkay, I'm looking at the time here for\nour show, and\n\n478\n00:26:44.075 --> 00:26:46.895\nI know we just talked about checkpoints\nhere in the graphical user interface.\n\n479\n00:26:46.895 --> 00:26:50.040\nI think this would be a good\nplace to kind of wrap up and\n\n480\n00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.242\nthen pick up with checkpoints and\nPowerShell for the next show.\n\n481\n00:26:53.242 --> 00:26:57.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, we will\ncome back, we will check back in, and\n\n482\n00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.660\ncheck on our checkpoints about that one.\n\n483\n00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.803\n&gt;&gt; Good one, Mike\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n484\n00:27:01.803 --> 00:27:04.656\nI hope everybody out there enjoyed\nwatching this one, signing off for\n\n485\n00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:06.750\nITPro.TV, I've been your host,\nMike Rodrick.\n\n486\n00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:07.550\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n487\n00:27:07.550 -->

You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n6\n00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.667\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:17.150\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.220\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n9\n00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.299\nIn this episode,\nwe're still working with Client Hyper-V.\n\n10\n00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:24.546\nThis is part three.\n\n11\n00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:27.090\nIf you missed the first two parts,\nmake sure you go back and check those out.\n\n12\n00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.650\nWe left off talking about checkpoints.\n\n13\n00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.190\nAnd back in the studio is,\nof course, Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n14\n00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.880\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n15\n00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.300\nThat's right we did take\na look at checkpoints.\n\n16\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.390\nWe didn't get very far, though.\n\n17\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.280\nWe just looked at the option underneath\nthe settings for our virtual machine.\n\n18\n00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.680\nAnd we did see that we have the ability\nto create production type checkpoints.\n\n19\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.440\nWe also had the ability to take advantage\nof that little check box where we could\n\n20\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.370\nfall back to standard checkpoints\nif production wasn't available.\n\n21\n00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.000\nAnd then we had that third option\nof just standard checkpoints.\n\n22\n00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.980\n&gt;&gt; And you know what I just realized,\n\n23\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.700\nCherokee?\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n24\n00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.012\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if we really said what\n\n25\n00:01:01.012 --> 00:01:02.620\ncheckpoints were for?\n\n26\n00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.519\nWe talked about creating them.\n&gt;&gt; I said they were taught like a frozen\n\n27\n00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:08.605\nmoment in time.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, just making sure.\n\n28\n00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:09.542\n&gt;&gt; Feels like a fairy tale.\n\n29\n00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:13.005\n[LAUGH] Yeah, but\nwhy would we use a checkpoint,\n\n30\n00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:13.879\nMike?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n31\n00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:15.592\n&gt;&gt; Because of the situation, well,\n\n32\n00:01:15.592 --> 00:01:16.730\nthey come in handy.\n\n33\n00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.295\nI use them all the time for my shows.\n\n34\n00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:23.150\nYes, cuz maybe I wanna get a demonstration\nteed up and ready to go the way I want it.\n\n35\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.932\nI mean, and it's great because the most\nimportant thing at that point in time is\n\n36\n00:01:26.932 --> 00:01:29.598\njust remembering not to\ndelete the proper checkpoint.\n\n37\n00:01:29.598 --> 00:01:31.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n38\n00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.650\n&gt;&gt; I've had it happen to me before.\n\n39\n00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.390\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we've seen that, haven't we?\n\n40\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.410\nActually you guys didn't see it,\nwe know it happened.\n\n41\n00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.080\nAll right, so we've got these checkpoints.\n\n42\n00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.490\nWe saw how to create them through the GUI.\n&gt;&gt; We didn't create one through the GUI,\n\n43\n00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.570\nwe just looked at the settings.\n\n44\n00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.050\nSo let's do that,\nbecause that is important.\n\n45\n00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.600\nYou can do that in two different ways.\n\n46\n00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.280\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n47\n00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.080\nI have Demo1 machine running right now.\n\n48\n00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.440\nThat's the current state, so I haven't\nlogged into that machine or anything.\n\n49\n00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.370\nActually it's just sitting right here,\nconnecting, but\n\n50\n00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.960\nanyways, the machine is running.\n\n51\n00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.950\nSo you should be able to create\na checkpoint because the machine is\n\n52\n00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.590\nup and running.\n\n53\n00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.240\nI'll just create some here and then\nwe'll actually get into the machine and\n\n54\n00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.750\nlook at the ways that the standard and\nproduction really work.\n\n55\n00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.560\nBut just to show you how to create one\nhere in the graphical user interface,\n\n56\n00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.360\nall right, so here I have my machine\nrunning, and let me zoom in a little bit.\n\n57\n00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.240\nWe can see the option is Checkpoint.\n\n58\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.710\nSo pretty self-explanatory there.\n\n59\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.060\nWe'll go ahead and left-click on that.\n\n60\n00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.723\nOops, hold on.\n\n61\n00:02:32.723 --> 00:02:34.680\nLet me see if I actually did click.\n\n62\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.203\nI say self-explanatory there.\n\n63\n00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:41.170\nCancel creating checkpoints,\nthat means that you're creating it.\n\n64\n00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.202\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n65\n00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:43.270\n&gt;&gt; I have to be patient.\n\n66\n00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.210\nActually, if I pull this out,\nhere let me full screen this.\n\n67\n00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.150\nYou'll be able to see that over\nhere on the right-hand side.\n\n68\n00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.840\nLet me zoom in.\n\n69\n00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.600\nThis is where that status is,\nso and you'll, okay.\n\n70\n00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.450\nAnd I have my notification here.\n\n71\n00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.840\nThroughout what we're doing\nhere in the demos and stuff,\n\n72\n00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.760\nyou might just want to take a peek in\nthat corner, if I forget to remind you.\n\n73\n00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.800\nBecause when you're applying\ncheckpoints or saving them,\n\n74\n00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.360\nyou'll see that little status and\nit will tell you what you're doing, so\n\n75\n00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.560\nin case you're impatient like me\nyou'll have some kind of notice.\n\n76\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.180\nAll right, so here we have that checkpoint\nthat we just created right there and\n\n77\n00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.980\nit says Now, and\nit has the date as well for\n\n78\n00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.580\nthis particular, let me zoom in so\nwe can see this a little bit better.\n\n79\n00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.140\nIt's like a stopwatch icon\nthat's next to that checkpoint.\n\n80\n00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.316\nNow it's just stating where we\nare in a timeline, so to speak.\n\n81\n00:03:34.316 --> 00:03:39.299\nI could also go ahead and create another\ncheckpoint, and let me do that so\n\n82\n00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.560\nyou guys can see how that subtree\nstructure works real quick.\n\n83\n00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.330\nSo we'll go ahead and\njust create another checkpoint.\n\n84\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.050\nAnd of course,\nit's not really making sense for\n\n85\n00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.585\nus to just keep creating them\nwithout having any changes in them.\n\n86\n00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:59.180\nAnd also to note, every time you're\ncreating a checkpoint, it's silly to just\n\n87\n00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.110\ncontinuously create them because if you\nthink about what we're doing is we're\n\n88\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.450\ncreating that AVHD file which is a virtual\nhard disk file, which can be large.\n\n89\n00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.060\nSo you're eating away at\nyour storage unnecessarily\n\n90\n00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.200\nif you're just continuously [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; And performance issues as well.\n\n91\n00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true too,\n\n92\n00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.940\nperformance issues.\n\n93\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.760\nSo just kind of be aware of that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n94\n00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.140\nthese are really kinda\ntemporary things typically.\n\n95\n00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.770\nRight before I get ready to make\na major change, we'll do a checkpoint.\n\n96\n00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.683\nLike you said, you had a demo teed up or\nsomething like that.\n\n97\n00:04:29.683 --> 00:04:32.660\nBut you typically want to get rid of those\ncheckpoints when we're done with them.\n\n98\n00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.170\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n99\n00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.439\nthat's how I end up sometimes getting\nmyself in trouble because I'm like,\n\n100\n00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.440\nI gotta delete,\nI gotta delete to save space.\n\n101\n00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.820\nAnd then oops, you go and\ndelete the wrong ones, though.\n\n102\n00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.340\nRemember these are not in lieu of backups.\n\n103\n00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.980\nThis is in addition to\nbackups kind of thing.\n\n104\n00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.660\nSo all right, so\nthat's how we go ahead and\n\n105\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.350\ncreate them in the graphical\nuser interface.\n\n106\n00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.540\nNow, we do have the ability to go\nahead and work with them here as well.\n\n107\n00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.240\nSo let's see what options we have.\n\n108\n00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.300\nWe have the ability to\napply the checkpoint, so\n\n109\n00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.940\nwe're reverting back to a previous\npoint in time that we select here.\n\n110\n00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.620\nWe have the ability to export,\nto rename, delete checkpoint and\n\n111\n00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.230\nthe individual checkpoint as\nwell as the checkpoint subtree.\n\n112\n00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.820\nSo there isn't a checkpoint subtree\nfrom where I'm currently clicking on,\n\n113\n00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.230\nbut if I were to click up\nhere at this checkpoint,\n\n114\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.090\nif I select Delete Checkpoint Subtree,\nthen you'll see.\n\n115\n00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.630\nOkay, so I do have a notification here.\n\n116\n00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.820\nThat is important to note as well.\n\n117\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.960\nJust reminding me, hey,\nare you sure you wanna make this decision?\n\n118\n00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.960\nI'm gonna go ahead and select delete.\n\n119\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.880\nAnd you'll see now they're gone there.\n&gt;&gt; Both of them.\n\n120\n00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, both of them.\n\n121\n00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.228\nSo just be aware of that\nin case you are not.\n\n122\n00:05:46.228 --> 00:05:49.730\nAll right, let's go ahead and\ntake a look here in PowerShell.\n\n123\n00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.440\nLet me minimize our hyper-V here.\n\n124\n00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.930\nThis is going to be our machine that\nwe're gonna be working with here.\n\n125\n00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.750\nSo let's just go ahead and log on and\npretend like we are Mario.\n\n126\n00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.950\nYeah, uh-huh,\nlook at the desktop background.\n\n127\n00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.800\nI had to get creative.\n\n128\n00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.917\nIf Polly Pocket had Candyland,\nthen I had to do something for Mario,\n\n129\n00:06:11.917 --> 00:06:13.340\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n130\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.870\n&gt;&gt; So he's just taking a while to log on.\n\n131\n00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.400\nI think this is the first time\nthat I've created this machine,\n\n132\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.870\nbut now would be a good time for trivia.\n\n133\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.461\nWhere do Mario and Luigi live?\n&gt;&gt; In a green pipe?\n\n134\n00:06:24.461 --> 00:06:25.515\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n135\n00:06:25.515 --> 00:06:26.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n136\n00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.370\n&gt;&gt; In a sewer?\n\n137\n00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.780\nYeah, so I had to look it up,\n\n138\n00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.130\nbecause I was gonna name my machine\nwherever was like this fictitious place.\n\n139\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.460\nBrooklyn.\n\n140\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.605\n&gt;&gt; Brooklyn?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n141\n00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:37.355\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n142\n00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:41.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] anyways, all right.\n\n143\n00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.880\nSo I have my machine here.\n\n144\n00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.180\nThis is Brooklyn,\napparently, and let's see.\n\n145\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.660\nLet's go ahead and give it a second\nto think about what it's going to do.\n\n146\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.340\nLet's pull up Notepad.\n\n147\n00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.362\nAnd maybe this is like\nthe work that I'm working on,\n\n148\n00:07:03.362 --> 00:07:07.559\nand maybe I could say something like,\n\n149\n00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:13.925\nthis is a test of\nthe Emergency- Broadcast,\n\n150\n00:07:13.925 --> 00:07:15.710\ndo they still do those?\n&gt;&gt; I think\n\n151\n00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:16.640\nso.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n152\n00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.160\n&gt;&gt; Occasionally.\n\n153\n00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.245\n&gt;&gt; System, all right.\n\n154\n00:07:20.245 --> 00:07:25.390\n[LAUGH] Anyways, so I'm typing along and\nI haven't saved my work or anything.\n\n155\n00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.140\nIt is what it is.\n\n156\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.090\nLet's just minimize Brooklyn for\nright now.\n\n157\n00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.920\nAnd pull up PowerShell on Candyland.\n\n158\n00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.720\nAnd I still have some stuff\nleft over from the last show.\n\n159\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.540\nLet's clear that out.\n\n160\n00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:44.860\nOkay, now if I'm in PowerShell and\nI haven't set anything up.\n\n161\n00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.545\nMaybe it's out of the box,\nbrand new machine and\n\n162\n00:07:47.545 --> 00:07:51.029\nI've never decided if I wanted\nto use standard of production.\n\n163\n00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:55.256\nIf you think back to what we saw in the\ngraphical user interface, where that radio\n\n164\n00:07:55.256 --> 00:07:59.816\nbutton defaulted to, well, that's gonna go\nahead and default to a production type.\n\n165\n00:07:59.816 --> 00:08:02.645\nCheckpoint, unless we otherwise specify.\n\n166\n00:08:02.645 --> 00:08:06.052\nSo what we need to do is go ahead and\nset that.\n\n167\n00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:10.855\nSo we'll type in the commandlet set-vm,\nand then we need to\n\n168\n00:08:10.855 --> 00:08:16.120\nspecify the name of the machine,\nand I think that one was Demo2.\n\n169\n00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.140\nLet me just pull up\nHyper-visor to verify that.\n\n170\n00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.492\nDemo1, okay, so get myself a little,\n\n171\n00:08:24.492 --> 00:08:29.618\nall right so\nthe name of this machine is Demo1.\n\n172\n00:08:29.618 --> 00:08:33.962\nAnd the reason I need to specify\nthe name of the machine is,\n\n173\n00:08:33.962 --> 00:08:37.790\nwell I am working here on\nmy host operating system.\n\n174\n00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.840\nI'm on Candy Land right\nnow which is the host.\n\n175\n00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.050\nThe guest is going to be that Mario and\nLuigi Brooklyn machine if that makes\n\n176\n00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.560\nsense here so,\nthe name of this is going to be Demo1.\n\n177\n00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.943\nNow I need to specify the checkpoint type.\n\n178\n00:08:50.943 --> 00:08:52.780\nI'll go ahead and tap through this.\n\n179\n00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.260\nYou'll see this option.\n\n180\n00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.170\nI have those three\noptions available to me.\n\n181\n00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.130\nI'll just tap through them so we can see,\ndisabled to go ahead and disable that.\n\n182\n00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.450\nBut we're not, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n183\n00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:06.000\nuse either the production,\nproduction only, or standard.\n\n184\n00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.182\nSo for this first one let's go ahead and\nhit standard.\n\n185\n00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:12.859\nNow, at this point in time,\nwe have not created a checkpoint actually,\n\n186\n00:09:12.859 --> 00:09:16.899\nif you wanna just go ahead and verify\nthat, see have this machine highlighted,\n\n187\n00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:20.877\nand if I wanted to look at any kind of\ncheckpoint to have for the other machines,\n\n188\n00:09:20.877 --> 00:09:22.360\nyou do have to click on them.\n\n189\n00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.986\nSo, currently you can see here,\nI have no virtual checkpoints for\n\n190\n00:09:25.986 --> 00:09:27.864\nthis virtual machine as well, but\n\n191\n00:09:27.864 --> 00:09:32.434\njust make sure your focus in on the right\nplace here in the virtual machine manager.\n\n192\n00:09:32.434 --> 00:09:36.445\nAlternatively in PowerShell,\nyou could go ahead and\n\n193\n00:09:36.445 --> 00:09:41.800\nuse a Git checkpoint commandlet to go\nahead and get the status of those.\n\n194\n00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.350\nWe'll take a look at that in a minute,\nbut as of right now,\n\n195\n00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.000\nwe've just set it to standard.\n\n196\n00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.582\nWe haven't created the checkpoint,\nso let's do that.\n\n197\n00:09:48.582 --> 00:09:54.026\nSo now this is going to be Check point.\n\n198\n00:09:54.026 --> 00:09:56.495\nAnd then this is a checkpoint-VM.\n\n199\n00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.470\nOops, what did I do?\n\n200\n00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.229\nLet me go back.\n\n201\n00:10:01.229 --> 00:10:04.495\nI think I tabbed and then it didn't go\nthrough fast enough so I started typing.\n\n202\n00:10:04.495 --> 00:10:08.379\n[LAUGH] See, it's all about patience.\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n203\n00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:12.175\n&gt;&gt; All right, checkpoint-vm.\n\n204\n00:10:12.175 --> 00:10:16.507\nAnd the actual name of the machine again,\nso we're gonna go ahead and\n\n205\n00:10:16.507 --> 00:10:17.935\nspecify name Demo1.\n\n206\n00:10:17.935 --> 00:10:23.575\nNow we need to have a name for\nthe checkpoint.\n\n207\n00:10:23.575 --> 00:10:25.925\nDon't get, let yourself get,\n\n208\n00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:28.985\nthings get twisty here because\nthis is going to be a standard.\n\n209\n00:10:28.985 --> 00:10:34.410\nSo if we, excuse me, snapshot, this is\nwhere that vocabulary comes into play.\n\n210\n00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.270\nSo this is just the old terminology for\ncheckpoints.\n\n211\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.272\nThey used to call them snapshots,\nso that's why you see that here.\n\n212\n00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:44.621\nSo, for our snapshot name let's go\nahead and keep it simple for us, and\n\n213\n00:10:44.621 --> 00:10:49.044\nwe'll just say that this is our\nstandard C-P for Check-Point, okay,\n\n214\n00:10:49.044 --> 00:10:54.170\nalthough it does a snapchat, I'm just\nreminds me checkpoint-to-checkpoint.\n\n215\n00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.323\nWe'll hit enter.\n\n216\n00:10:55.323 --> 00:10:58.674\nAnd so now we're going to go ahead and\n\n217\n00:10:58.674 --> 00:11:03.990\ncreate that check point here for\nour Brooklyn machine.\n\n218\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.090\nAnd remember we had that\nnotepad document up and open.\n\n219\n00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:13.011\nWe didn't save it or anything, but\nthat's where it was at that point in time.\n\n220\n00:11:13.011 --> 00:11:15.180\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ncreate another checkpoint.\n\n221\n00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.220\nThis time we'll create a production\ncheckpoint, and we're going to use\n\n222\n00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.535\nthe same syntax here, we're just going\nto change this last portion, right?\n\n223\n00:11:23.535 --> 00:11:30.012\nAnd go ahead and oops, let me go back and\nI'll just start typing it here.\n\n224\n00:11:32.197 --> 00:11:33.911\nWe don't need all those other options.\n\n225\n00:11:33.911 --> 00:11:37.970\nGoodness, all right, let me go back\none more space, and then space and\n\n226\n00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:38.885\nstart typing.\n\n227\n00:11:38.885 --> 00:11:41.750\n[COUGH] I'm not gonna use my tab.\n\n228\n00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.070\nI know you're a big tab fan Mike,\nand I've been trying to-\n\n229\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:44.648\n&gt;&gt; Well I don't think you can tab\n\n230\n00:11:44.648 --> 00:11:46.050\non the you're giving it a name, so\nI don't know what you wanna call it.\n\n231\n00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.146\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, shoot that was right,\n\n232\n00:11:49.146 --> 00:11:53.894\nyou're right,\nI'm getting all kinds of goofy here,\n\n233\n00:11:53.894 --> 00:11:58.141\nlet me go back I'm getting\nahead of myself here.\n\n234\n00:11:58.141 --> 00:12:01.385\nLet's slow down and go back to commandlet.\n\n235\n00:12:01.385 --> 00:12:04.480\nSo not that one, and I'm like,\nwhy is it doing that?\n\n236\n00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.580\nI'm like, yeah that's right, Mike thanks.\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n237\n00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.277\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n238\n00:12:07.277 --> 00:12:09.168\nwe need to change the type here.\n\n239\n00:12:09.168 --> 00:12:14.520\nSo instead of standard let's go ahead and\nchange that to production.\n\n240\n00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.840\nAnd you know what, actually,\nlet me go back, and\n\n241\n00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.840\nI'll tab through just to get\neverything right in the universe, here.\n\n242\n00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.132\nSo there we go, all right,\n\n243\n00:12:22.132 --> 00:12:27.231\n[LAUGH] now let's go back to\nthe checkpoint, the naming one.\n\n244\n00:12:27.231 --> 00:12:31.256\nAnd, well,\nsince we had already typed it from before,\n\n245\n00:12:31.256 --> 00:12:36.582\nlet's go ahead and we didn't actually\nhit enter there, so production.\n\n246\n00:12:36.582 --> 00:12:43.535\nCP4 production check point.\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n247\n00:12:43.535 --> 00:12:44.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n248\n00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.830\nwhen this is finished,\nwhat we're gonna do is actually okay.\n\n249\n00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.920\nSo it didn't take long at all,\nbut let's just minimize that.\n\n250\n00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.585\nLet's pull up our virtual machine and\n\n251\n00:12:55.585 --> 00:13:00.260\nmaybe close out of this notepad\ndocument or something like that.\n\n252\n00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.115\nSo we'll just say don't save for now.\n\n253\n00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:07.853\nMinimize it again, and you can see\nhere in the GUI we have our standard\n\n254\n00:13:07.853 --> 00:13:14.055\ncheckpoint that me created, as well as\nour production checkpoint there also.\n\n255\n00:13:14.055 --> 00:13:19.493\nAnd let me just show you how you can check\non that here in power-shell as well.\n\n256\n00:13:19.493 --> 00:13:25.122\nAll right, so that command line is\ngoing to be git-dash-vm-checkpoint, and\n\n257\n00:13:25.122 --> 00:13:30.749\nI could type through here, and I do need\nto specify the V-M name because remember\n\n258\n00:13:30.749 --> 00:13:36.129\nlike I said, you have a lot of different\ncomputers already on this particular\n\n259\n00:13:36.129 --> 00:13:39.640\nmachine already, so we that one-\n&gt;&gt; You missed a space right after\n\n260\n00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.963\ncheckpoint.\n&gt;&gt; There we go,\n\n261\n00:13:40.963 --> 00:13:41.640\nthank you.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n262\n00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.707\n&gt;&gt; All right so, vmname my typing,\n\n263\n00:13:45.707 --> 00:13:48.160\nis going crazy on me.\n\n264\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.675\nAll right, this is gonna be Demo1,\nall right.\n\n265\n00:13:51.675 --> 00:13:57.693\n[COUGH] I swear, once you have\none mistake, then everything,\n\n266\n00:13:57.693 --> 00:14:02.437\nI tried to have the universe\nin alignment there,\n\n267\n00:14:02.437 --> 00:14:05.695\nand the last one it didn't work.\n\n268\n00:14:05.695 --> 00:14:09.785\nAll right, so this is the same thing as\nbasically viewing them in your graphical\n\n269\n00:14:09.785 --> 00:14:10.711\nuser interface.\n\n270\n00:14:10.711 --> 00:14:14.560\nWe have our standard checkpoint as\nwell as our production checkpoint.\n\n271\n00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.965\nIt's nice because it has the times, it\nhelps us maybe I didn't change a default\n\n272\n00:14:18.965 --> 00:14:22.003\nname or something where I\njust created them in the GUI.\n\n273\n00:14:22.003 --> 00:14:26.989\nBut you saw I did create a timestamp\nanyway so that's gonna be one clue or\n\n274\n00:14:26.989 --> 00:14:32.310\nindication, and I think talking about\nwe do talk about how PowerShell's so\n\n275\n00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.657\nmuch than the GUI.\n\n276\n00:14:33.657 --> 00:14:38.810\nBut in this particular situation,\nthink about this for a second.\n\n277\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.412\nIf I were to enhance my PowerShell skills,\nand\n\n278\n00:14:41.412 --> 00:14:46.035\nMike has some really great shows on how\nwe can do that, he's the PowerShell guru.\n\n279\n00:14:46.035 --> 00:14:49.760\nI can do things Like get vm.\n\n280\n00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.960\nSo in our naming syntax, we were pretty\nlame and we stuck with Demo, Demo1, 2,\n\n281\n00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.540\n3, 4, 5, whatever.\n\n282\n00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.340\nIn your real world environments, and\n\n283\n00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:02.320\neven when you are studying some\nMicrosoft documentation, you'll see how\n\n284\n00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:07.110\na lot of companies utilize geographic\nlocations as prefixes for machines.\n\n285\n00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.791\nSo maybe I have some servers in\nthe London office, like Lon for Lon,\n\n286\n00:15:11.791 --> 00:15:13.205\nDC or lon, svro1.\n\n287\n00:15:13.205 --> 00:15:18.540\nAnd maybe there's something\ngoing on in that particular\n\n288\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.340\ngeographic location, like an update or\nsome kind of infrastructure change or\n\n289\n00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.950\ninclement weather, and you wanted to go\nahead and quickly Run a commandlet for get\n\n290\n00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:34.330\nasterisk and then type in LON so\nthat all those virtual machines that\n\n291\n00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.670\nyou manage that start with LON,\nyou can grab them right away, get dash.\n\n292\n00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.800\nAnd then pipe it, pipe it out into\nwhatever you want to do here,\n\n293\n00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.390\nlike these that I'm showing you here,\nthe different ones\n\n294\n00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.967\nthat are associated with check points.\n&gt;&gt; So you have some wild cards in there.\n\n295\n00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:48.132\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so just be creative with how you\n\n296\n00:15:48.132 --> 00:15:51.677\nwanna go ahead and structure,\nyour environments there.\n\n297\n00:15:51.677 --> 00:15:53.426\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n298\n00:15:53.426 --> 00:15:58.677\ntake a look at what we can do now that\nwe have those check points created.\n\n299\n00:15:58.677 --> 00:16:03.132\nLet's start with working in the GUI,\nso If I were to go ahead and,\n\n300\n00:16:03.132 --> 00:16:07.992\nclick on my standard check point,\nand right click, remember we did see\n\n301\n00:16:07.992 --> 00:16:13.940\nthese options already, but I'm gonna\ngo ahead and select apply this time.\n\n302\n00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.970\nWe do have a prompt here and\nit's not just asking yes, or do,\n\n303\n00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.760\ndo you wanna apply this check point or\napply and cancel, we have one extra.\n\n304\n00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.600\nOption here to create and additional check\npoint, and then apply which sometimes\n\n305\n00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.460\ncould be a good idea if you're making\na lot of like configuration changes, and\n\n306\n00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.870\nyou're not 100% sure everything's\ngonna work out accordingly.\n\n307\n00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.540\nSo, we'll go ahead, and we'll hit apply.\n\n308\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:44.980\nNow let's take a look at, we need to go\nahead and reconnect that machine because\n\n309\n00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.940\nthe system is using it, and\nthat's why we got that error message.\n\n310\n00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:53.760\nSo we'll go ahead, let me go full screen\nagain so we can see what's happening here.\n\n311\n00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.410\nI can't like power it on\nuntil this portion here,\n\n312\n00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.950\nmy saving has been complete or\nat like 92%.\n\n313\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.940\nSo as soon as that's done we'll\nturn it on and check out Brooklyn.\n\n314\n00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.370\nYou ever been to Brooklyn?\n&gt;&gt; I have not.\n\n315\n00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:09.930\n&gt;&gt; That's where the cool\n\n316\n00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:10.520\nkids are.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n317\n00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.100\nI know.\n\n318\n00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.244\nThat's why I haven't been there.\n\n319\n00:17:12.244 --> 00:17:13.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n320\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:13.660\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n321\n00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.170\nlet's go ahead and\nstart this virtual machine here.\n\n322\n00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:23.780\nWe'll go ahead and log in.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n323\n00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.120\nreplying that standard yet?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n324\n00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.300\n&gt;&gt; Need a little music to keep us\n\n325\n00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.370\noccupied.\n\n326\n00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:33.070\nSo we're basically rolling back in time\nto when you created that standard.\n\n327\n00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.160\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n328\n00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.442\nOops and if I type in my password,\nthat would be even better.\n\n329\n00:17:40.514 --> 00:17:44.150\nAnd look, the test of the emergency\nbroadcast system still lives.\n\n330\n00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:48.350\nSo that's what our standard looks like.\n\n331\n00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:52.480\nHowever doesn't look like\neverything was as perfect.\n\n332\n00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.900\nLet me make sure that we did that correct.\n\n333\n00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.940\nNormally for\nour standard we did that one first, right?\n\n334\n00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:01.730\nThis was our standard.\n\n335\n00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:06.560\nYeah, so normally you would even\nsee that graphical element.\n\n336\n00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:11.110\nMaybe something happened and\nit wasn't able to save that also for\n\n337\n00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:17.190\nthe desktop there, but at least, and\nthis is what it normally looks like for\n\n338\n00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.260\nthis production checkpoint, so\nI'm not really sure what happened there.\n\n339\n00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:26.510\nBut just know that the normal behavior\nto see your graphical components and\n\n340\n00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.160\nelements there.\n\n341\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.910\nThe main thing is that\n\n342\n00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:34.710\nmy work is still here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n343\n00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.670\nSo it really is capturing\nthe exact state of that machine.\n\n344\n00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.930\nApplications that are running, documents\nthat are open in the middle of editing,\n\n345\n00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.790\nbecause not only is it snap shotting\nthe VHD, but it's including RAM, right,\n\n346\n00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.640\nso any active processes.\n\n347\n00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.160\nIt should go right back\nto that point in time.\n\n348\n00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.380\n&gt;&gt; Right, because we didn't write this\n\n349\n00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.250\nfile to disk.\n\n350\n00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.370\nWe just had it sitting there in RAM and\nI closed out of it,\n\n351\n00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:02.630\nso yeah, you just stop.\n&gt;&gt; It probably will come back.\n\n352\n00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.040\nYou might need to log off and log back on.\n&gt;&gt; I might need to reboot or\n\n353\n00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.130\nsomething, yeah.\n\n354\n00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.610\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; If something hang up,\n\n355\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.890\nthe desktop background\nwill be there I'm sure.\n\n356\n00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:10.930\n&gt;&gt; Let's close out of here and\n\n357\n00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.880\nactually, let me just turn\n&gt;&gt; I should shift down\n\n358\n00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.950\ngracefully, yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n359\n00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.310\n&gt;&gt; So I'll practice what I preach here.\n\n360\n00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.270\nSo, we'll give it a second to go ahead and\nshipped down and\n\n361\n00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.180\nthen we will take a look at\nthat production checkpoint.\n\n362\n00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.320\nBut let's go ahead and\n\n363\n00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.170\ndo that here from within the PowerShell.\n\n364\n00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:30.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n365\n00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.830\nSo before we hit Enter don't let me\npull the trigger here before checking,\n\n366\n00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.840\nI mean who should that machine is\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n367\n00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.360\n&gt;&gt; It is in the right state.\n\n368\n00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.800\nWell, PowerShell will let me too.\n\n369\n00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.750\nIt'll say this operation\ncan't be performed because\n\n370\n00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.160\nof the current state of the machine.\n\n371\n00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:54.920\nBut anyways,\nrestore-vmcheckpoint, all right.\n\n372\n00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.740\nWe do need to specify.\n\n373\n00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.890\nThere are two perimeters here\nthat we need to think about.\n\n374\n00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.580\nBecause if I were, I am on Candyland host.\n\n375\n00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.910\nIf I were on that machine,\n\n376\n00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:09.400\nI wouldn't have to specify which\nmachine's checkpoint I wanted to pull.\n\n377\n00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.400\nBut since I'm on the host and\n\n378\n00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.330\nI could have multiple guests,\nI do need to specify that.\n\n379\n00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.800\nSo by using the name parameter, I'm\nsaying, look, Demo1 is the computer that I\n\n380\n00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.560\nwanna pull from, but\nI also need to take that a step further.\n\n381\n00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.110\nOops, excuse me, I had that backwards.\n\n382\n00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.180\nYou could do this either way.\n\n383\n00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.820\nSo I could say,\nthe name of that checkpoint,\n\n384\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.640\nso there's two different perimeters.\n\n385\n00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.540\nIt's name and VM Name.\n\n386\n00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.000\nSo I just typed Name first, so either way.\n\n387\n00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.940\nName is going to be what\nwas the production.\n\n388\n00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:44.520\nCP, and I also need to have VM name.\n&gt;&gt; And it makes sense,\n\n389\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.340\nso you gotta know what VM you're trying to\nroll back to a particular checkpoint, and\n\n390\n00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.950\nthen you can have multiple checkpoints, so\nwhich checkpoint do you want to roll back\n\n391\n00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.060\nto?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n392\n00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.260\nOkay, so our machine is off.\n\n393\n00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.950\nWe should be good to go,\nit's finished doing what it needs to do.\n\n394\n00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:00.930\nWe'll hit Enter, and because this\nis a pretty destructive potentially\n\n395\n00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.210\ntype action here, so\nwe'll go ahead and just yes to all,\n\n396\n00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.570\nbecause that is what we wanna go ahead and\ndo.\n\n397\n00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:10.322\nIt's applying that checkpoint,\nso let's go ahead now and\n\n398\n00:21:10.322 --> 00:21:13.935\npower that machine on and\nsee how that looks, all right.\n\n399\n00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.018\nTake a double-click to bring\nit back up here, all right.\n\n400\n00:21:22.486 --> 00:21:23.337\nAnd again,\n\n401\n00:21:23.337 --> 00:21:26.265\nif you need more Alex Trebek music here.\n\n402\n00:21:26.265 --> 00:21:28.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n403\n00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.410\n&gt;&gt; I think that our production\n\n404\n00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.890\nteam is really nervous and afraid to\ngive me a sound board, because I ask for\n\n405\n00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.670\none at least once a week.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n406\n00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're probably a little scared\n\n407\n00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:43.260\nof what you might do with that.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, all right, so we're just powering\n\n408\n00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.430\nthis machine up, and really there's just\ntwo more commands in this show that I want\n\n409\n00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:51.240\nto go over, focusing on checkpoints\n&gt;&gt; You have the option to delete and\n\n410\n00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.330\nexport and it's rather simple.\n\n411\n00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:57.620\nIt's the exact same syntax\nthat we just typed, except for\n\n412\n00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:04.430\nyou're going to be using delete instead\nof our Restore for that, first for\n\n413\n00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:09.140\ndeleting and then with your exporting it's\nthe same, but another parameter you would\n\n414\n00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.820\nwant to add would be that destination\npath as to where you can export it.\n\n415\n00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.840\nMakes sense, right?\n\n416\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.780\n&gt;&gt; Mhm.\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\n\n417\n00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:20.670\n&gt;&gt; And then another difference with\n\n418\n00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:25.740\nthe production and standard check points\nwhereas those standard check points, and\n\n419\n00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:30.460\nif the state of the current of the virtual\nmachine when you took the checkpoint is\n\n420\n00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:35.220\nrunning, then when you roll back to that\nstandard check point the VM's running.\n\n421\n00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.241\nWhereas production checkpoints\nare always going to be shutdown and\n\n422\n00:22:38.241 --> 00:22:41.899\nyou're going to have to boot that machine\nup once you roll back to the checkpoint.\n\n423\n00:22:46.383 --> 00:22:48.760\n&gt;&gt; I need an outfit like that too.\n\n424\n00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.570\nSo that's my purchase order request.\n\n425\n00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.460\nAn outfit that is on board.\n\n426\n00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.760\nOkay, so here we do\n\n427\n00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.770\nsee our production checkpoint and\nthe background did come through here so\n\n428\n00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.720\nit might have just been something glitchy\nwith the standard checkpoint there.\n\n429\n00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.840\nBut, what are we missing?\n\n430\n00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.890\nWell, we're missing\nthat note pad document.\n\n431\n00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:17.160\nAnd because we had not saved that file on\n\n432\n00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:22.620\nthe virtual hard disk drive, and it was\njust sitting in RAM, we lost it there.\n\n433\n00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:28.000\nBut, that's I guess the most\nimportant difference I would think\n\n434\n00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.430\nbetween those two options there.\n&gt;&gt; Yep absolutely.\n\n435\n00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:32.770\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that's it for\n\n436\n00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:33.540\ncheckpoints.\n\n437\n00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.900\nWe've pretty much spent the whole time\ntalking about those but it is important.\n\n438\n00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.090\nYou do need to know about them for\nthe exam.\n\n439\n00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:42.680\nI do have other settings that I want to\nspend some time in looking at our virtual\n\n440\n00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.050\nmachines here but we'll save that, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good Cherokee,\n\n441\n00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.710\ngreat demonstration there of the different\ntypes of checkpoint we can create\n\n442\n00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:50.750\nwithin Hyper-V.\n\n443\n00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.150\nSo hope everybody enjoyed\nwatching this one.\n\n444\n00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.200\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n445\n00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:56.990\n&gt;&gt;

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:11.551\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:12.599\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n6\n00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.530\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.320\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.947\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n9\n00:00:19.947 --> 00:00:24.555\nIn this episode, we're actually continuing\nalong with configuring Client Hyper-V.\n\n10\n00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:26.928\nBack in studios is none other than Ms.\nCherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:26.928 --> 00:00:27.672\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:27.672 --> 00:00:28.584\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:29.192\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:29.992\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n15\n00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:33.017\nSo what do we got on store for\ntoday, or in store for today?\n\n16\n00:00:33.017 --> 00:00:36.375\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well that's a good point, because\nwe already have done quite a bit so far.\n\n17\n00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:40.138\nWe created virtual machines, we created\ncheckpoints for those virtual machines,\n\n18\n00:00:40.138 --> 00:00:43.670\nbut we really didn't spend a lot of time\nlooking at virtual machine settings.\n\n19\n00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.368\nSo I think that's a good place for\nus to start today.\n\n20\n00:00:46.368 --> 00:00:51.323\nWe did look at them slightly, especially\nwhen we were talking about the differences\n\n21\n00:00:51.323 --> 00:00:55.437\nbetween Gen one and Gen two machines,\nand how that all played out, but\n\n22\n00:00:55.437 --> 00:00:59.968\nif we could take a look at my screen now,\nI think it's also important to note,\n\n23\n00:00:59.968 --> 00:01:04.785\nespecially for you test takers out there\nthe difference between a setting options\n\n24\n00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:06.730\nfor machines that are running.\n\n25\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.906\nSo I just opened up the settings for\nDemo1, this is a virtual machine that is\n\n26\n00:01:10.906 --> 00:01:15.556\nrunning, and you guys recognize these same\nmachines that we had from the last show.\n\n27\n00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:19.703\nSo these are both, and I'm gonna go\nahead and pull up the settings for\n\n28\n00:01:19.703 --> 00:01:20.714\nDemo3 as well.\n\n29\n00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:23.508\nWe'll do another side by\nside comparison here.\n\n30\n00:01:23.508 --> 00:01:28.360\nNow Demo3 is in a powered off state.\n\n31\n00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.220\nDemo1 is powered on.\n\n32\n00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.180\nThat's what I want you to notice.\n\n33\n00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.660\nThese are both going to\nbe our Gen2 machines, but\n\n34\n00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.060\nI'd like to take a look at some of\nthe things that we have available to us.\n\n35\n00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.380\nSo for instance,\nthis first option add hardware,\n\n36\n00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.272\nokay, so what can I add in\nthe machine that's powered off?\n\n37\n00:01:48.272 --> 00:01:52.540\nWell, let me move down through\nthis a little bit, oops,\n\n38\n00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.690\nI'm in the wrong focus here.\n\n39\n00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.350\nIf you see SCSI controller\nis actually black.\n\n40\n00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.358\nThe options that we don't have in our,\n\n41\n00:02:01.358 --> 00:02:05.430\navailable to us are going to\nbe gray here in this box.\n\n42\n00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.088\nSo I have the ability to add a SCSI\ncontroller, a network adapter.\n\n43\n00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:14.898\nI don't have RemoteFX 3D Video Adapter,\nthat's different, I'll tell you why, and\n\n44\n00:02:14.898 --> 00:02:17.823\nI can also add a fiber channel adapter,\nand this is for\n\n45\n00:02:17.823 --> 00:02:19.647\nthe machine that is powered off.\n\n46\n00:02:19.647 --> 00:02:23.950\nFor the machine that is power on,\nI can only add a network adapter.\n\n47\n00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.490\nSo, it's important to understand that\ndistinction of components that you can or\n\n48\n00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.900\ncan not add.\n\n49\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.780\nThe reason my RemoteFX 3D Video Adapter\nis greyed out, your physical adapter has,\n\n50\n00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.570\nyour physical network interface card\nactually has to have technical support for\n\n51\n00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.040\nthat, for my local machine, it does not\nthat's why you see it greyed out there.\n\n52\n00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.103\nSo, that's why that's not available,\nall right.\n\n53\n00:02:48.103 --> 00:02:52.002\nFirmware, well we already\nreally talked about\n\n54\n00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:56.493\nthe difference between our BIOS and\nUEFI previously.\n\n55\n00:02:56.493 --> 00:03:01.967\nThis is the option here to go ahead, and\nutilize secure boots, to go ahead and\n\n56\n00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:07.293\nenable that, and again, notice\nthe difference between my options here.\n\n57\n00:03:07.293 --> 00:03:10.996\nI can manage my settings in\nthe machine that's powered down, but\n\n58\n00:03:10.996 --> 00:03:13.230\nnot in the machine that's powered on.\n\n59\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.380\nSo I need to make that executive\ndecision ahead of time, but\n\n60\n00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.401\nwhat the heck is secure boot anyways?\n\n61\n00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:23.384\nWe're gonna have shows that focus more\non the security side of things, but\n\n62\n00:03:23.384 --> 00:03:28.603\njust so you know, secure boot is going to\nbe a way where we can actually check and\n\n63\n00:03:28.603 --> 00:03:31.688\nvalidate what we're\nrunning on our systems,\n\n64\n00:03:31.688 --> 00:03:36.072\neven from the very beginning\nduring the boot-up process there.\n\n65\n00:03:36.072 --> 00:03:40.573\nSo in other shows, we talked about\ndrivers, and I even showed you some ways\n\n66\n00:03:40.573 --> 00:03:44.862\nthat we could bypass utilizing those\nsigned drivers, just keep in mind\n\n67\n00:03:44.862 --> 00:03:49.525\nsome of those methods might not be working\nif you do have secure boot enabled.\n\n68\n00:03:49.525 --> 00:03:52.941\nSo if you ever create a virtual machine,\nand you have to use a line of\n\n69\n00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:56.726\nbusiness application, or\nsomething that you've created in-house and\n\n70\n00:03:56.726 --> 00:03:59.960\nit doesn't have those sign drivers,\nor something like that,\n\n71\n00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.461\nyou might wanna go in here and\ncheck to see if secure boot is enabled.\n\n72\n00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:06.640\nYou might have to disable it to\nget that app running or something.\n\n73\n00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.340\nJust know that for troubleshooting.\n\n74\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you.\n\n75\n00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.480\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n76\n00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.477\nMemory.\nThis is another one, all right?\n\n77\n00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:17.360\nIt kind of makes sense if you\nthink about your settings here.\n\n78\n00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.380\nSo you can't hot swap, at least I\ndon't know of a way that you can hot\n\n79\n00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.800\nswap memory out of the machine currently,\nright?\n\n80\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.020\nYou have to power that machine down,\ntake your memory module out,\n\n81\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.890\nand then go ahead and replace it,\nand power that system back on.\n\n82\n00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.160\nSo we see the ability to go ahead and do\nthat here on our machine that's down, but\n\n83\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.400\nwe can't change the amount of\nmemory a virtual machine can use.\n\n84\n00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.903\nWe do have a couple other options that we\ncould change here for our dynamic memory.\n\n85\n00:04:48.903 --> 00:04:53.818\nDynamic, we can't enable dynamic memory,\nwe have to do that when the machine\n\n86\n00:04:53.818 --> 00:04:58.358\nis powered down, but I could change\nthe upper and lower control limits,\n\n87\n00:04:58.358 --> 00:05:02.465\nthose thresholds for the memory\nallocation, if I chose to do so.\n\n88\n00:05:02.465 --> 00:05:07.131\nDynamic memory brings more\nflexibility to the table for\n\n89\n00:05:07.131 --> 00:05:10.803\nus within our virtual machines, and also,\n\n90\n00:05:10.803 --> 00:05:14.783\nthese last options here for\nour memory weight.\n\n91\n00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:19.631\nSo if I have different virtual machines,\nif I give a higher weight, so\n\n92\n00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:23.005\nmaybe, I say this machine\nis more important.\n\n93\n00:05:23.005 --> 00:05:27.894\nDemo3 is more important, or\nthe weight in utilization is more\n\n94\n00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:32.321\nimportant to this machine than\nin my other machine here,\n\n95\n00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:36.578\nDemo1, that's how they're\ngoing to set that also.\n\n96\n00:05:36.578 --> 00:05:39.822\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz with dynamic memory,\nwe can end up overallocating, right?\n\n97\n00:05:39.822 --> 00:05:42.250\nActually assigning more memory where if-\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n98\n00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.935\n&gt;&gt; Every machine wants to go all the way\nto its max, we might not have that much\n\n99\n00:05:45.935 --> 00:05:49.919\nphysical memory in our system, our host,\nand so with that weight, we can say,\n\n100\n00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.250\nall right, there's not enough to\ngive everybody what they want,\n\n101\n00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.999\nyou've been deemed a little more\nimportant, so we'll make sure we handle\n\n102\n00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:00.660\nyour request first, and then the other\nmachines can take what's left.\n\n103\n00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.\n\n104\n00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.000\nJust a smart way to think about how we\ncan allocate those physical machine\n\n105\n00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.040\nresources or physical hardware amongst\nour virtual machines there, and\n\n106\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.930\nalso, it's kind of behind my head, but\nyou can see this little yield sign here.\n\n107\n00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.600\nThis is just some of the settings\ncannot be modified because the virtual\n\n108\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.960\nmachine was in the following state\nwhen this window was open: running.\n\n109\n00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.696\nSo that's just pointing out, that's\nwhy these options are greyed out for\n\n110\n00:06:28.696 --> 00:06:29.297\nyou there.\n\n111\n00:06:29.297 --> 00:06:30.335\n&gt;&gt; It's also very settled.\n\n112\n00:06:30.335 --> 00:06:33.988\nNotice that it says that the virtual\nmachine was in this state when the window\n\n113\n00:06:33.988 --> 00:06:34.625\nwas opened.\n\n114\n00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:37.217\nIn other words, if you turn around and\nshut that machine down, but\n\n115\n00:06:37.217 --> 00:06:39.502\ndon't close that window,\nthe setting won't come back.\n\n116\n00:06:39.502 --> 00:06:42.335\nYou need to close those properties and\nopen the properties up so\n\n117\n00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.790\nthat it can detect\nthe current state of the VM.\n\n118\n00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.025\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, yep.\n\n119\n00:06:46.025 --> 00:06:50.352\nAlways, you gotta stay one\nstep ahead there [LAUGH].\n\n120\n00:06:50.352 --> 00:06:52.570\nPay attention to what you're doing, right?\n\n121\n00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.930\nI tell myself that every day.\n\n122\n00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.411\nAll right, again,\nsame thing with the processor here,\n\n123\n00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:01.850\njust like shutting down an actual\nmachine and changing that processor.\n\n124\n00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.971\nYou need to be aware of that.\n\n125\n00:07:02.971 --> 00:07:06.246\nSo I think that the reason\nI'm spending the time and\n\n126\n00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:09.979\ngoing through each one of these\nis because these are very,\n\n127\n00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:14.230\na lot of scenarios could be created\naround these types of things.\n\n128\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.940\nHey, you need to go ahead and modify this,\nor change this, increase, decrease that.\n\n129\n00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.769\nSo knowing the current state of the\nmachine will help you be able to determine\n\n130\n00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:27.706\nthe proper steps and\nsequence in which those steps are taken.\n\n131\n00:07:27.706 --> 00:07:32.220\nMaybe this one machine needed more virtual\nprocessors and we had some to spare.\n\n132\n00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.360\nWe could go ahead and add them there.\n\n133\n00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.354\nNow for our storage, it's going to\nbe a little bit different here.\n\n134\n00:07:40.354 --> 00:07:45.118\nNoticed how on both machines I have\nblack options for me, I have hard drive,\n\n135\n00:07:45.118 --> 00:07:49.509\nDVD drive, share drive available on both,\nand if you think about it,\n\n136\n00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:54.423\nif you have ever been inside of a server\ncloset, and you have a lot of production\n\n137\n00:07:54.423 --> 00:07:59.113\nenvironments have the ability to just\ngo ahead and pull those drives out and\n\n138\n00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:03.242\nhot swap them in production without\npowering down that machine.\n\n139\n00:08:03.242 --> 00:08:05.037\nSo if you think about that logic,\n\n140\n00:08:05.037 --> 00:08:08.510\nit makes sense when we're looking\nat our setting options here.\n\n141\n00:08:11.237 --> 00:08:15.913\nAll right, and another whole thing\nwe can go ahead and work with,\n\n142\n00:08:15.913 --> 00:08:20.931\nthis is just the drive that I currently\nhave, but don't negate the use\n\n143\n00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:25.719\nof virtual hard disks even as\nstorage as well in this environment.\n\n144\n00:08:25.719 --> 00:08:27.032\nNetwork adapters.\n\n145\n00:08:27.032 --> 00:08:31.112\nThis one, we're gonna put a pin in and\nwe'll come back to those because\n\n146\n00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:35.260\nthere's a little extra configuration\nthat we need to do to get that up and\n\n147\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.350\nrunning the way I wanna show it to you.\n\n148\n00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.949\nAnd then these management options down\nhere, let's take a look at those.\n\n149\n00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:45.790\nWe really, we don't need both of these\nwindows at this point in time anymore.\n\n150\n00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:46.472\nActually, what machine?\n\n151\n00:08:46.472 --> 00:08:48.170\nI closed down the wrong one.\n\n152\n00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.962\nLet me just use my arrows here\nto go back to, pending changes.\n\n153\n00:08:52.962 --> 00:08:55.340\nI do wanna continue.\n\n154\n00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.083\nI'm not gonna save any of the changes\nthat we made in this window here.\n\n155\n00:08:58.083 --> 00:09:00.229\nBut what's happening is\nI'm trying to flick back.\n\n156\n00:09:00.229 --> 00:09:02.424\nI closed down a window\nI didn't want to close.\n\n157\n00:09:02.424 --> 00:09:05.967\nI wanted to switch to Demo1,\nwhich I clicked the wrong window anyways.\n\n158\n00:09:05.967 --> 00:09:10.190\nBut now I'm at Demo1, it's just letting\nme know luckily in the GUI hey,\n\n159\n00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.110\ndo you wanna save those changes?\n\n160\n00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.806\nOkay, so\nlooking at some of these other options,\n\n161\n00:09:14.806 --> 00:09:18.404\nI have the ability to look at our names,\nand we'll even see that for\n\n162\n00:09:18.404 --> 00:09:21.826\na lot of the sub-categories,\nlike for your network adaptor.\n\n163\n00:09:21.826 --> 00:09:24.689\nIf you create a network adaptor or\nhard disk drive, and\n\n164\n00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:28.238\nyou're not satisfied with the name,\nyou could come back in here and\n\n165\n00:09:28.238 --> 00:09:30.554\nchange some of the settings or\nleave notes.\n\n166\n00:09:30.554 --> 00:09:34.625\nAnd when we're looking at some of those\nother options I'll explain why that may be\n\n167\n00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:36.631\nimportant more so for some than others.\n\n168\n00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:38.067\nAll right.\n\n169\n00:09:38.067 --> 00:09:41.631\nIntegration services.\n\n170\n00:09:41.631 --> 00:09:45.810\nThis is its own little realm here.\n\n171\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.997\nI can't remember if I pulled the link\nup now that we're going, but if not,\n\n172\n00:09:48.997 --> 00:09:50.675\nI definitely have it in the show notes.\n\n173\n00:09:50.675 --> 00:09:53.822\nAnd I do want to talk about\neach one of these individually,\n\n174\n00:09:53.822 --> 00:09:56.856\nbecause this again could be\na potential test question.\n\n175\n00:09:56.856 --> 00:10:03.660\nAnd integration services is something that\nwasn't always built into Hyper-V, right?\n\n176\n00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.170\nSo we have the ability to go ahead and\ninstall it or\n\n177\n00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.376\nadd it as a bolt-on option,\nan afterthought if you will.\n\n178\n00:10:11.376 --> 00:10:15.311\nBut here in Windows 10 it\ncomes nicely integrated.\n\n179\n00:10:15.311 --> 00:10:18.058\nActually, let me show you what\nit looks like by default.\n\n180\n00:10:18.058 --> 00:10:21.790\nThe only thing that I've changed on\nthis system was that right there.\n\n181\n00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:27.191\nSo the default behavior for\nintegration services looks like this.\n\n182\n00:10:27.191 --> 00:10:30.630\nIt allows for operating system shutdown.\n\n183\n00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.766\nSo what we're talking about here for\nour integration services, and\n\n184\n00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:37.780\nthese settings that we're looking at here,\nremember this is on a per-machine basis.\n\n185\n00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.860\nSo we're looking at the settings for\nDemo 1.\n\n186\n00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.160\nOperating system shutdown,\nthat's one service or\n\n187\n00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.561\nfeature that Windows is offering us.\n\n188\n00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:50.836\nNow, Mike, in the last show we were\nlooking at those checkpoints and\n\n189\n00:10:50.836 --> 00:10:55.776\nhow checkpoints handled different\nmachines' behavior with a shutdown versus\n\n190\n00:10:55.776 --> 00:10:59.240\nthe and off or\npowering that machine off, right?\n\n191\n00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.703\nSo, when we split operating system shut\ndown we are really looking at graceful\n\n192\n00:11:04.703 --> 00:11:10.194\nshutdowns because we don't want our\nsystems to have those abrupt shutdowns.\n\n193\n00:11:10.194 --> 00:11:16.093\nSo within Hyper-V, or VMM,\nour virtual machine manager,\n\n194\n00:11:16.093 --> 00:11:22.571\nI could actually just right-click\non a machine that was running,\n\n195\n00:11:22.571 --> 00:11:29.310\nthat had integration services enabled,\nand then select Shut down.\n\n196\n00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.620\nShut down performs that\ngraceful shut down.\n\n197\n00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.510\nShut down is not the same as turn off.\n\n198\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.490\nTurn off is unplugging that power,\n\n199\n00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.260\nshutting down is making sure that\nthe system is shut down properly.\n\n200\n00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.480\nSo it's a nice supplemental,\nor nice to have feature.\n\n201\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.168\n&gt;&gt; It's that integration\nservice that allows that.\n\n202\n00:11:45.168 --> 00:11:47.434\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; That particular service is unchecked,\n\n203\n00:11:47.434 --> 00:11:49.064\nyou could click on that option.\n\n204\n00:11:49.064 --> 00:11:50.685\nIt wouldn't actually\nshut the machine down.\n\n205\n00:11:50.685 --> 00:11:52.400\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it'll let you know.\n\n206\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.209\nIt'll baulk at you there for sure.\n\n207\n00:11:54.209 --> 00:11:55.129\nWhere did I put my settings?\n\n208\n00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:56.061\nThere they are.\n\n209\n00:11:56.061 --> 00:11:57.840\nAll right, let's zoom back in.\n\n210\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.760\nTime synchronization.\n\n211\n00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:05.460\nThis is another one that if I had multiple\nmachines, multiple guests on a host,\n\n212\n00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.715\nmaybe I have different machines\nin different time zones and\n\n213\n00:12:09.715 --> 00:12:14.220\nI want to be able to,\nlet's just say timing is everything.\n\n214\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.008\nTiming is such an important functionality\nfor a lot of systems, and especially for\n\n215\n00:12:18.008 --> 00:12:19.914\nsecurity and authentication purposes.\n\n216\n00:12:19.914 --> 00:12:22.747\nIt's important to recognize and\n\n217\n00:12:22.747 --> 00:12:26.700\nacknowledge any kind\nof time discrepancies.\n\n218\n00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.695\nSo that's what time synchronization\nwill provide for us.\n\n219\n00:12:29.695 --> 00:12:32.810\nMicrosoft does call out\nsomething specifically.\n\n220\n00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:37.196\nThey say they do not recommend\nutilizing time synchronization on\n\n221\n00:12:37.196 --> 00:12:39.748\ndomain controllers, especially for\n\n222\n00:12:39.748 --> 00:12:44.224\ndomain controllers that may be\nusing the role of the PDC emulator.\n\n223\n00:12:44.224 --> 00:12:47.208\nBecause that PDC emulator\nis responsible for\n\n224\n00:12:47.208 --> 00:12:51.065\nmaintaining the time in your\ndomain environments there.\n\n225\n00:12:51.065 --> 00:12:55.563\nSo you don't want to\ninterfere with that behavior.\n\n226\n00:12:55.563 --> 00:12:56.880\nData exchange.\n\n227\n00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.529\nData exchange is not how you might\ninitially perceive it to be.\n\n228\n00:13:01.529 --> 00:13:03.360\nAt least that's how my brain thinks.\n\n229\n00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.724\nI'm thinking data, right?\n\n230\n00:13:04.724 --> 00:13:09.690\nLike binaries of files, right?\n\n231\n00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:10.651\nSomething like that.\n\n232\n00:13:10.651 --> 00:13:15.640\nWhat we're looking at here is system\ninformation, fully qualified domain names,\n\n233\n00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.210\npertinent information like that.\n\n234\n00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.707\nDon't get that confused\nwith guest services.\n\n235\n00:13:20.707 --> 00:13:25.633\nAnd I do feel like they could have\nnamed these two something a little bit\n\n236\n00:13:25.633 --> 00:13:30.394\ndifferently here because the term\nguest services almost alludes to\n\n237\n00:13:30.394 --> 00:13:35.280\nthe fact that it's the same as\nour guest integration services.\n\n238\n00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.204\nBut it is not.\n\n239\n00:13:36.204 --> 00:13:41.313\nGuest services is what I would think\ndata exchange would be called.\n\n240\n00:13:41.313 --> 00:13:45.520\nGuest services allows us to\nshare those types of files.\n\n241\n00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:52.414\nJpegs, executables, whatever it\nis from one machine to the other.\n\n242\n00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:57.420\nSo we'll take a look at this actually,\nI'll show the the command line here.\n\n243\n00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.020\nBut just think about how that works.\n\n244\n00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.203\nSo If I have a host operating system, and\n\n245\n00:14:03.203 --> 00:14:06.654\nI have a guest operating system.\n\n246\n00:14:06.654 --> 00:14:09.738\nSo the guest is on the host, and\nthey're all part of a domain, or\n\n247\n00:14:09.738 --> 00:14:12.380\nall part of a network,\nthey're one big happy family.\n\n248\n00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:17.133\nAs long as network sharing was enabled,\nI had the ability to do my backslash\n\n249\n00:14:17.133 --> 00:14:20.465\nbackslash, put the computer name in,\nbackslash.\n\n250\n00:14:20.465 --> 00:14:24.771\nAnd as long my permission could grant it,\nI could access files that way, right?\n\n251\n00:14:24.771 --> 00:14:29.391\nBut with virtualized\nenvironments sometimes we create\n\n252\n00:14:29.391 --> 00:14:32.970\nvirtual machines for that isolation.\n\n253\n00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.124\nAnd we might not want to have\nthem on the same network.\n\n254\n00:14:36.124 --> 00:14:41.778\nSo maybe we'll go ahead and\njust utilize this option for\n\n255\n00:14:41.778 --> 00:14:46.350\nour guest services as\na different way to share\n\n256\n00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:50.840\nfiles faster, more efficient, without.\n\n257\n00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.672\nMaybe I don't even wanna have my guest\noperating system have connectivity to\n\n258\n00:14:55.672 --> 00:14:58.957\na network, and\nnot even provide a network adapter.\n\n259\n00:14:58.957 --> 00:15:02.030\nMaybe I'm just testing some code,\nor something like that.\n\n260\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:08.445\nAll right, let's come back to that one\nbecause I wanna talk about these last two,\n\n261\n00:15:08.445 --> 00:15:13.109\nand then we'll take a look at a demo on\nhow we can actually use our guest services\n\n262\n00:15:13.109 --> 00:15:14.045\noption there.\n\n263\n00:15:14.045 --> 00:15:17.020\nI think that ones the most interesting\nto look at, so that's why-\n\n264\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:17.621\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n265\n00:15:17.621 --> 00:15:21.398\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Heartbeat, maybe because I'm a parent,\n\n266\n00:15:21.398 --> 00:15:25.671\nbut this always reminds me of my kids\nbecause you're always wanting to holler at\n\n267\n00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:28.316\nthem and\ncheck on them to see how they're doing.\n\n268\n00:15:28.316 --> 00:15:32.256\nEspecially if you have toddlers,\nor have had a toddler, and\n\n269\n00:15:32.256 --> 00:15:34.519\nit gets quiet in your house-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n270\n00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:36.226\n&gt;&gt; You know something is wrong.\n\n271\n00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:40.765\nSo you want to go ahead and call out\nto that child and be like, hey, Johnny,\n\n272\n00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:41.930\nwhat's going on?\n\n273\n00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.049\nThat's essentially what a heartbeat does.\n\n274\n00:15:43.049 --> 00:15:45.444\nWe don't get a ton of\ninformation from that,\n\n275\n00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:48.911\nit's basically an up down state\nthat we're receiving from our,\n\n276\n00:15:48.911 --> 00:15:51.905\nI don't want to say child-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:15:51.905 --> 00:15:54.492\n&gt;&gt; But our guest operating system here.\n\n278\n00:15:54.492 --> 00:15:57.799\nAnd backups.\nSo backups allow the use of our volume\n\n279\n00:15:57.799 --> 00:16:03.526\nshadow copy service and\nThat's pretty self explanatory there.\n\n280\n00:16:03.526 --> 00:16:06.568\nWe did look at our checkpoints earlier, so\n\n281\n00:16:06.568 --> 00:16:11.140\njust know that that is the same\nunderpinning technology there.\n\n282\n00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.125\nAnd I think yeah, let's go ahead and\n\n283\n00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:18.569\ntake a look at how our guest\nservices works real quick.\n\n284\n00:16:18.569 --> 00:16:21.179\nI'm trying to think,\nI do have this machine.\n\n285\n00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:23.150\nNope, that's just a magnifier,\nwhy did I click on that?\n\n286\n00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.367\nThat was demo1,\nthat's where I wanna go, yeah.\n\n287\n00:16:28.367 --> 00:16:31.500\n[LAUGH] Let's go ahead and\nget this machine up.\n\n288\n00:16:37.433 --> 00:16:40.659\nI'm trying to think what\nI wanna bring over there.\n\n289\n00:16:43.693 --> 00:16:44.691\nLet me minimize this.\n\n290\n00:16:47.832 --> 00:16:50.724\n&gt;&gt; So right now,\nwe have the guest services turned on,\n\n291\n00:16:50.724 --> 00:16:52.193\nin the settings in the VM.\n\n292\n00:16:52.193 --> 00:16:56.730\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so we actually have the ability\nto go ahead and use that now.\n\n293\n00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.993\nBut I have to think about what\nis it that I want to, and\n\n294\n00:16:58.993 --> 00:17:00.490\nlet me just minimize this for now.\n\n295\n00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.550\nWhat is it that I want to be bringing\nover to that host operating system?\n\n296\n00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.640\nSo let me just take a look at what\nwe have sitting here on our C drive,\n\n297\n00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.740\nsomething easily accessible for these.\n\n298\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.420\nMy desktop backgrounds I had put on there,\n\n299\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:20.020\nbut let's be a little more realistic\nhere in a business environment.\n\n300\n00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:24.050\nYou probably would want to,\nexecutables, that's a great one.\n\n301\n00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:28.380\nSo here I have in that ZoomIt\ntool which I didn't just use,\n\n302\n00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.650\nI used my magnifier tool to zoom in.\n\n303\n00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:35.544\nBut maybe I wanna put this ZoomIt\nexecutable on that guest operating system.\n\n304\n00:17:35.544 --> 00:17:40.457\nSo I could take this executable sitting\nhere on the root of my C drive, and\n\n305\n00:17:40.457 --> 00:17:43.720\npush it on over to that virtual machine.\n\n306\n00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.350\nAnd when we look at our files,\n\n307\n00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.810\nI know it's an executable just\nbecause I know what that program is.\n\n308\n00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.640\nBut you would need to look at that file\nname extension if you weren't sure there\n\n309\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.610\nto know that it's an executable,\nbecause you will need that full path.\n\n310\n00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:03.316\nSo it's a really simple cmdlet, but\nit does require the knowledge of\n\n311\n00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:08.120\nyour source and destination path,\nso that should make sense, okay.\n\n312\n00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:15.208\nSo now we are on the guest,\n\n313\n00:18:15.208 --> 00:18:19.191\nall right, and [COUGH].\n\n314\n00:18:19.191 --> 00:18:24.050\nI just wanna show that it's not on, my\nthing is doing something funky right now.\n\n315\n00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:27.021\nLet me just minimize that and\npull it back up.\n\n316\n00:18:27.021 --> 00:18:28.020\n&gt;&gt; We lost our background.\n\n317\n00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.045\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, my background,\n\n318\n00:18:29.045 --> 00:18:32.150\nthat was from all those checkpoints\nwe were playing with earlier.\n\n319\n00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.540\nAnd it is still doing something\nweird with the display there.\n\n320\n00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:41.570\nLet me try one more,\nif I just, it's still there.\n\n321\n00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:45.832\nOkay, all I wanted to show you\nguys is kinda like the, hey,\n\n322\n00:18:45.832 --> 00:18:49.940\ncheck my sleeve,\nI don't have anything sitting there.\n\n323\n00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.560\nIt's showing my host,\nlet me click on the one above that there.\n\n324\n00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.675\nSo right here,\nif I can click in the right spot.\n\n325\n00:19:02.837 --> 00:19:05.423\nThis is the C drive of the machine,\nmy guest's, so\n\n326\n00:19:05.423 --> 00:19:09.570\nI just wanted to show you that there's\nnot anything sitting there, all right?\n\n327\n00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:13.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we got that guest\nservice, integration service on.\n\n328\n00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.700\nHow do we take advantage of that,\nCherokee?\n\n329\n00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so you and I and\nyou know that it's enabled.\n\n330\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.710\nWe just checked that, but what if\nwe didn't know that it was enabled?\n\n331\n00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.800\nAnd what if we were managing\nthis machine with PowerShell?\n\n332\n00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.298\nLet's take a look at how we\ncould check that setting.\n\n333\n00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:34.127\nBecause without it, we wouldn't be able\nto take advantage of some of those cool\n\n334\n00:19:34.127 --> 00:19:36.302\noptions, such as guest services.\n\n335\n00:19:36.302 --> 00:19:38.580\nSo let's go ahead and check that first.\n\n336\n00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:45.378\nThe cmdlet that we're going to be using\nhere is going to be, we have our get.\n\n337\n00:19:45.378 --> 00:19:48.400\nLet me make sure I'm looking at the right\nspot here, Get-vmIntegrationService.\n\n338\n00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:53.080\nI couldn't remember what that was, but\nI bet you what, if we tab on through here,\n\n339\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.110\nwe can find IntegrationService\nright there.\n\n340\n00:19:56.110 --> 00:20:00.362\nNow we do need to specify a couple things,\nbecause this is the host,\n\n341\n00:20:00.362 --> 00:20:03.793\nI need to specify the VM name\nthat we're checking for,\n\n342\n00:20:03.793 --> 00:20:07.169\nbecause it could be checking for\nmultiple machines.\n\n343\n00:20:07.169 --> 00:20:12.890\nSo we'll say vmname, and\nfor this one it's Demo3.\n\n344\n00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.050\nSo just by typing this in,\nwe will see that our,\n\n345\n00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:21.732\nguest service interface is\nactually off right here,\n\n346\n00:20:21.732 --> 00:20:26.220\nso we do need to make sure\nthat that is enabled, so-\n\n347\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.330\n&gt;&gt; I think we turned it on on Demo1.\n\n348\n00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.572\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's check, that was\nthe wrong machine, good call, Mike.\n\n349\n00:20:32.572 --> 00:20:36.737\nDemo1, I was gonna say, okay,\nit's on, that's where we wanna be.\n\n350\n00:20:36.737 --> 00:20:42.533\nSo it is on, okay, cool, now we can\nuse our guest service interface.\n\n351\n00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:47.574\nAnd actually, now that this is here,\nwe can see that\n\n352\n00:20:47.574 --> 00:20:54.810\nwe have these names corresponding with\nthose services in our particular.\n\n353\n00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.660\nSo this one's pretty\nself explanatory here.\n\n354\n00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:01.530\nThe interface is a little bit longer\nthan what you saw on the GUI,\n\n355\n00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:02.550\nheartbeat the same.\n\n356\n00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:04.860\nThis one's a little bit different,\nand what is this one for, Mike?\n\n357\n00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.460\n&gt;&gt; That's that data exchange.\n\n358\n00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.768\n&gt;&gt; That's right, shut down,\ntime synchronization, and VSS for\n\n359\n00:21:10.768 --> 00:21:13.096\nour volume shadow service there.\n\n360\n00:21:13.096 --> 00:21:14.870\n&gt;&gt; Which I think they\ncall backup in the GUI.\n\n361\n00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:19.447\n&gt;&gt; They do, I think they have it\nin parentheses, but who knows?\n\n362\n00:21:19.447 --> 00:21:22.160\nOkay, yeah, my memory, yeah,\nI had to think about that for a second.\n\n363\n00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.143\nAll right, now we are on the host,\nlike I said, but first,\n\n364\n00:21:27.143 --> 00:21:32.627\nlet's just look at what we have\ngoing on in our environment here,\n\n365\n00:21:32.627 --> 00:21:34.538\nand let me minus this.\n\n366\n00:21:37.079 --> 00:21:41.228\nOn my C drive,\nI have a folder named folder,\n\n367\n00:21:41.228 --> 00:21:43.991\nthat's one for-\n&gt;&gt; Creative [LAUGH].\n\n368\n00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:47.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nthat one wins an award for creativity.\n\n369\n00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.960\nAll right, I just have a couple\nof those little Mario JPEGs.\n\n370\n00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.860\nI have my ZoomIt tool as well, so\n\n371\n00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.960\nI'm just showing you where\nthat lives on my host here.\n\n372\n00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.500\nAll right,\nnow if I pull up my virtual machine, and\n\n373\n00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.250\nlet's take a look at what\nwe've got going there.\n\n374\n00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:09.580\nNow, on my C drive,\nI don't have anything here.\n\n375\n00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.670\nNormally in production environments,\nyou wouldn't, in a lot of demos,\n\n376\n00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.186\nyou'll see me be putting stuff\non my C drive for easy access.\n\n377\n00:22:15.186 --> 00:22:17.970\nYou probably wouldn't, shouldn't be doing\nthat in production environments, but\n\n378\n00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.360\nit's just easy for me to access it.\n\n379\n00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:25.600\nI don't have any special folder here, but\nwe can go ahead and specify where we wanna\n\n380\n00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.500\ndump or plop that file as our destination\nhere within our host operating system.\n\n381\n00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.700\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nclose out of here, minimize my guest.\n\n382\n00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.877\nBack in my host, pulling up\nan administrative command prompt here.\n\n383\n00:22:40.877 --> 00:22:45.117\nAnd now we're gonna go ahead and copy\na particular file, maybe that ZoomIt file,\n\n384\n00:22:45.117 --> 00:22:48.325\nand I wanna run that executable\nin my guest operating system.\n\n385\n00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:54.090\nSo we'll go ahead and\nuse the cmdlet here, Copy-vmFile.\n\n386\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:23:00.377\nAnd I do need to specify the destination\nmachine, so that's going to be Demo1.\n\n387\n00:23:00.377 --> 00:23:06.419\nI need to specify my source path,\nand that was under my C drive,\n\n388\n00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:11.435\nand so that was C:\\,\nsuper creative, folder\\,\n\n389\n00:23:11.435 --> 00:23:16.465\nthe full name including\nthat file extension there.\n\n390\n00:23:16.465 --> 00:23:20.982\nSo for this particular executable, this\nis an executable for that ZoomIt program,\n\n391\n00:23:20.982 --> 00:23:26.355\nso ZoomIt.exe for\nthe actual path there- source path.\n\n392\n00:23:26.355 --> 00:23:28.805\nNow for my destination path,\n\n393\n00:23:28.805 --> 00:23:34.410\nI need to specify where I want it to\nland on that guest operating system.\n\n394\n00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:39.882\nSo I do want it under the C drive, and\nI didn't have a folder teed up for that.\n\n395\n00:23:39.882 --> 00:23:45.202\nSo maybe if I say, let's create dest\nfolder, for destination folder.\n\n396\n00:23:45.202 --> 00:23:46.901\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\n\n397\n00:23:46.901 --> 00:23:49.779\nwe do need to also include that name here.\n\n398\n00:23:49.779 --> 00:23:55.424\nSo ZoomIt.exe, and\nbecause this place, this path,\n\n399\n00:23:55.424 --> 00:24:01.938\ndoesn't exist, what I'm going\nto do is say create Full path.\n\n400\n00:24:01.938 --> 00:24:03.643\nAnd it's kind of wrapping, sorry.\n\n401\n00:24:03.643 --> 00:24:06.282\nI should have changed my settings so you\ncould see that, but it starts over here.\n\n402\n00:24:06.282 --> 00:24:09.851\nSo CR, move back over, createFullPath.\n\n403\n00:24:09.851 --> 00:24:13.407\nSo we're telling it,\nforcing it, asking it politely.\n\n404\n00:24:13.407 --> 00:24:15.485\n&gt;&gt; So if the path doesn't exist,\nit doesn't fail.\n\n405\n00:24:15.485 --> 00:24:17.069\nIt actually creates the folder structure.\n\n406\n00:24:17.069 --> 00:24:17.685\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n407\n00:24:17.685 --> 00:24:18.651\n&gt;&gt; Nice, nice.\n\n408\n00:24:18.651 --> 00:24:19.573\n&gt;&gt; And then, you know what?\n\n409\n00:24:19.573 --> 00:24:24.292\nLet's just give a little more information\nhere and we'll specify our file source,\n\n410\n00:24:24.292 --> 00:24:26.092\nand this is going to be the host.\n\n411\n00:24:26.092 --> 00:24:28.727\nThat's where we're working.\n\n412\n00:24:28.727 --> 00:24:31.025\nOkay, that was really quick.\n\n413\n00:24:31.025 --> 00:24:34.253\nZoomIt is a smaller executable file,\nbut that's okay.\n\n414\n00:24:34.253 --> 00:24:38.926\nSo let's just minimize that and\ncheck out our guest operating system and\n\n415\n00:24:38.926 --> 00:24:40.695\nsee if it actually worked.\n\n416\n00:24:40.695 --> 00:24:43.186\nSo we'll go under our C drive, here.\n\n417\n00:24:43.186 --> 00:24:46.775\nZoom in for us, oops.\n\n418\n00:24:50.117 --> 00:24:52.505\nAnd here I see that folder, DestFfolder.\n\n419\n00:24:52.505 --> 00:24:56.595\nSo that's a good sign because\nthat folder didn't exist before.\n\n420\n00:24:56.595 --> 00:24:57.523\nAnd here we go.\n\n421\n00:24:57.523 --> 00:24:59.396\nHere we have that ZoomIt tool,\n\n422\n00:24:59.396 --> 00:25:04.383\nright here within that folder that we\njust created, and it wasn't there before.\n\n423\n00:25:04.383 --> 00:25:08.667\nThis is a great, newer,\nnot brand new, but new feature,\n\n424\n00:25:08.667 --> 00:25:12.878\nthat Microsoft does provide for\nus for easy management.\n\n425\n00:25:12.878 --> 00:25:16.290\nI mean, if you didn't have physical access\nand you can't put a thumb drive and\n\n426\n00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:19.705\nyou're working with your virtual machines\nremotely or something like that,\n\n427\n00:25:19.705 --> 00:25:21.952\nI just think it's a really\nfun one to take a look at.\n\n428\n00:25:21.952 --> 00:25:26.447\nBut definitely make sure you're familiar\nwith some of those other ones also.\n\n429\n00:25:26.447 --> 00:25:31.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I find that one really handy, cuz\na lot of times especially in the client\n\n430\n00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.038\nside Hyper-V, where you don't have all of\nyour networking maybe fully fleshed out,\n\n431\n00:25:36.038 --> 00:25:39.645\ncuz getting a file to your virtual\nmachine can be a challenge.\n\n432\n00:25:39.645 --> 00:25:41.843\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And if you have to set up a share,\n\n433\n00:25:41.843 --> 00:25:45.671\nyou have to set up the right\npermissions things like that, this guy,\n\n434\n00:25:45.671 --> 00:25:48.519\nI can just use my copyVM file and\nmove it right over.\n\n435\n00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:49.193\nSo very handy.\n\n436\n00:25:49.193 --> 00:25:50.041\nYou can even do arrays.\n\n437\n00:25:50.041 --> 00:25:52.495\nIf I need to copy a multiple VMs\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n438\n00:25:52.495 --> 00:25:54.809\n&gt;&gt; You can list out an array of VM names.\n\n439\n00:25:54.809 --> 00:25:55.789\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it works out really well.\n\n440\n00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:59.628\n&gt;&gt; Mike, looking at the clock I think\nthat's it for this show, but we might have\n\n441\n00:25:59.628 --> 00:26:03.370\na, hopefully we won't have a saga here,\nbut I think maybe one or two more.\n\n442\n00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:07.460\nBecause we still need to take\na look at our Hyper-V settings.\n\n443\n00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.355\nWe combed through all of those settings\nfor our individual virtual machines.\n\n444\n00:26:11.355 --> 00:26:13.083\nWe need to look at our\nhyper visor setting,\n\n445\n00:26:13.083 --> 00:26:15.542\nas well as our virtual switch settings and\ntalk about those.\n\n446\n00:26:15.542 --> 00:26:18.303\nBut I think that's about it for\nHyper-V, when we're finished.\n\n447\n00:26:18.303 --> 00:26:19.116\nYou don't want to miss that.\n\n448\n00:26:19.116 --> 00:26:19.843\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n449\n00:26:19.843 --> 00:26:20.587\nSounds good.\n\n450\n00:26:20.587 --> 00:26:24.412\nMore Hyper-V coming your way, but\nthat does it for this particular episode.\n\n451\n00:26:24.412 --> 00:26:27.440\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Roderick.\n\n452\n00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.319\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n453\n00:26:28.319 --> 00:26:30.551\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n454\n00:26:30.551 --> 00:26:36.477\n[MUSIC]\n\n455\n00:26:36.477 --> 00:26:39.852\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.486\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.486 --> 00:00:12.734\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:15.619\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:16.849\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.918\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n8\n00:00:19.918 --> 00:00:23.979\nSpecifically in this episode we're\ncontinue our thought process on\n\n9\n00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:25.877\nconfiguring client Hyper-V.\n\n10\n00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:29.131\nThis is a part five, I think.\n&gt;&gt; Five.\n\n11\n00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:31.869\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that just means there's tons\n\n12\n00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.753\nof great information we have to share\nwith you on configuring Hyper-V.\n\n13\n00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:37.738\nAnd back in the studio, as you can see,\nnext to me is Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n14\n00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:39.665\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n15\n00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:42.742\nI really didn't think it would go\non this long, but it really has.\n\n16\n00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:45.559\nBecause Hyper-V, there's a lot to it.\n\n17\n00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.174\nSo I wanna make sure you\nguys definitely know that.\n\n18\n00:00:48.174 --> 00:00:52.826\nSo in the last show we did look at\nsettings for individual virtual machines,\n\n19\n00:00:52.826 --> 00:00:55.233\nand eventually we're getting there.\n\n20\n00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:58.251\nLet's take a look at some settings for\nHyper-V itself.\n\n21\n00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:02.650\nBecause some of those individual settings\non the virtual machines, they rely on each\n\n22\n00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.513\nother to go ahead and work, they might\nneed to be configured in both spots.\n\n23\n00:01:06.513 --> 00:01:09.294\nSo let's take a look at that first.\n\n24\n00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:12.468\nAll right, so\nhere I have my virtual machine manager or\n\n25\n00:01:12.468 --> 00:01:14.613\nmy Hyper-V manager pulled up here.\n\n26\n00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:17.302\nAnd over on the right-hand side, and\n\n27\n00:01:17.302 --> 00:01:20.842\njust note that there\nare a couple different ways.\n\n28\n00:01:20.842 --> 00:01:26.223\nSo far we've selected new to create\nour virtual machines over here,\n\n29\n00:01:26.223 --> 00:01:28.932\nvirtual hard disk, floppy disk.\n\n30\n00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:32.672\nBut just get familiar with this interface.\n\n31\n00:01:32.672 --> 00:01:36.606\nBecause even from the different menus,\nthe options that we have here, or\n\n32\n00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:39.026\nby right-clicking, and left-clicking.\n\n33\n00:01:39.026 --> 00:01:44.471\nSo if I were to right click on top of this\nactual host over here I could go ahead and\n\n34\n00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:45.800\nselect new again.\n\n35\n00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.741\nSo when I'm showing you this just keep in\nmind that there are a couple of different\n\n36\n00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.134\nways that we can get to the same place.\n\n37\n00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:54.331\nAll right, but for now,\nover on the right-hand side here,\n\n38\n00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:57.971\nwhat we'll be looking at\nis our Hyper-V settings.\n\n39\n00:01:57.971 --> 00:02:02.052\nSo this looks very, very similar, like\nthat interface, to what we saw before.\n\n40\n00:02:02.052 --> 00:02:04.339\nBut notice we don't have\nthe hardware options and\n\n41\n00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:07.721\na lot of those other management that\nwe saw with our individual machines.\n\n42\n00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:12.618\nIt doesn't say the name of\nthe actual virtual machines up here,\n\n43\n00:02:12.618 --> 00:02:17.707\nit says Candyland, that's the name\nof my host operating system.\n\n44\n00:02:17.707 --> 00:02:22.577\nSo by default,\nthis is the first option that we see here.\n\n45\n00:02:22.577 --> 00:02:26.343\nThis is that default location for\nwhere those virtual hard disks reside.\n\n46\n00:02:26.343 --> 00:02:27.297\nWe've talked about that.\n\n47\n00:02:27.297 --> 00:02:29.791\nI won't spend too much time there.\n\n48\n00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:32.341\nThis is also going to be\nthat default location for\n\n49\n00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:34.713\nthe virtual machines and\nwhere they reside.\n\n50\n00:02:34.713 --> 00:02:37.577\nAnd here we see something\na little bit different.\n\n51\n00:02:37.577 --> 00:02:42.797\nThis is going to be focusing on our\nphysical graphics processing unit,\n\n52\n00:02:42.797 --> 00:02:45.675\nour GPUs here, and let me just zoom in.\n\n53\n00:02:45.675 --> 00:02:50.409\nWe saw something similar to this in,\nI think it was the last show.\n\n54\n00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.609\nWhen we saw this option here for\nthe remote Fx for\n\n55\n00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.169\nthe individual machines grayed out.\n\n56\n00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:01.083\nAnd I said that because my machine here,\nmy physical hardware,\n\n57\n00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:06.907\ndoes not support that functionality\nin the actual network interface card,\n\n58\n00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:08.824\nbut also on client side.\n\n59\n00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:11.274\nAnd just remember it's\ndifferent on the server side.\n\n60\n00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:14.509\nThis is like a more advanced\nfeature that we may have.\n\n61\n00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:19.101\nSo we won't see currently this\noption on our client OSs,\n\n62\n00:03:19.101 --> 00:03:23.800\nthis is going to be reserved for\nour server systems there.\n\n63\n00:03:25.794 --> 00:03:30.868\nAll right, this is another one of\nthose settings where I feel this is\n\n64\n00:03:30.868 --> 00:03:36.044\nmore of a server setting,\nin my opinion too, for our NUMA Spanning.\n\n65\n00:03:36.044 --> 00:03:40.818\nAnd what it does is it allow\nbetter utilization for memory for\n\n66\n00:03:40.818 --> 00:03:45.695\nlarger different configurations for\nlarger architecture.\n\n67\n00:03:45.695 --> 00:03:49.744\nSo here we're probably gonna be\nworking with individual machines,\n\n68\n00:03:49.744 --> 00:03:53.674\nwe're not looking at any kind of\nadvanced configurations there.\n\n69\n00:03:53.674 --> 00:03:57.825\nSo sometimes there's actually\na performance decrease if you\n\n70\n00:03:57.825 --> 00:03:59.190\ndo have it enabled.\n\n71\n00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.397\nIt's just something you might wanna check.\n\n72\n00:04:00.397 --> 00:04:02.223\nI'll just leave the defaults for now.\n\n73\n00:04:02.223 --> 00:04:04.517\nIt's fine for us.\n\n74\n00:04:04.517 --> 00:04:08.192\nAnd this is something that you\nprobably do wanna keep in mind.\n\n75\n00:04:08.192 --> 00:04:13.884\nAgain, if you're not utilizing\nHyper-V in a production environment,\n\n76\n00:04:13.884 --> 00:04:18.955\nmaybe like you would with a server,\non the server side of things.\n\n77\n00:04:18.955 --> 00:04:21.193\nYou probably don't have a lot of\ndifferent migrations happening.\n\n78\n00:04:21.193 --> 00:04:24.328\nYou might be just setting up a lab\nenvironment for yourself, but\n\n79\n00:04:24.328 --> 00:04:26.077\nit is something to be cognizant of.\n\n80\n00:04:26.077 --> 00:04:30.722\nBecause whenever those storage migrations,\nso what is a storage migration?\n\n81\n00:04:30.722 --> 00:04:34.598\nWell if I'm moving virtual machine\nlocations, think about that,\n\n82\n00:04:34.598 --> 00:04:35.963\nthose are large files.\n\n83\n00:04:35.963 --> 00:04:40.535\nSo all my little bits that\nare going through my busses and\n\n84\n00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:44.536\nutilizing that CPU,\nmy compute power, right?\n\n85\n00:04:44.536 --> 00:04:48.548\nI need to take that into consideration,\nbecause maybe my system is just scraping\n\n86\n00:04:48.548 --> 00:04:52.326\nby with the hardware requirements,\nand I don't wanna tax or overwhelm it.\n\n87\n00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:57.422\nSo I can go ahead and\ncap how many simultaneous moves or\n\n88\n00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:01.396\nmigrations I can allow at one given time.\n\n89\n00:05:01.396 --> 00:05:06.561\nAnd this is another one here for\nEnhanced Session Mode that we did see\n\n90\n00:05:06.561 --> 00:05:11.831\nas a setting when we were looking\nat our Guest Integration Services.\n\n91\n00:05:11.831 --> 00:05:17.723\nNow I will say this is one of those\nsettings that does, it comes as a pair.\n\n92\n00:05:17.723 --> 00:05:22.707\nSo I can't enable my enhanced\nsession mode from my integration\n\n93\n00:05:22.707 --> 00:05:27.418\nservices without the actual\nhost allowing that to happen.\n\n94\n00:05:27.418 --> 00:05:32.388\nSo if I were to uncheck this, regardless\nof how that individual virtual machine was\n\n95\n00:05:32.388 --> 00:05:35.306\nsetup, I still wouldn't\nbe able to utilize it.\n\n96\n00:05:35.306 --> 00:05:40.192\nAnd remember,\nenhanced session mode was that capability,\n\n97\n00:05:40.192 --> 00:05:46.145\nthose features to access resources from\nthe host to the VM and vice versa.\n\n98\n00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:51.307\nSo if I had things like storage,\nlocal storage, USB drives, printers,\n\n99\n00:05:51.307 --> 00:05:56.156\nI'm trying to think, all the fun things,\nclick board access even.\n\n100\n00:05:56.156 --> 00:05:59.648\nSo a lot of things that previously.\n\n101\n00:05:59.648 --> 00:06:04.172\nSo in the past, we were really\njust limited to mouse clicks and\n\n102\n00:06:04.172 --> 00:06:05.651\nkeyboard strokes.\n\n103\n00:06:05.651 --> 00:06:08.409\nBut now we have more options available.\n\n104\n00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.798\nSo I could print something\nat a remote location.\n\n105\n00:06:10.798 --> 00:06:15.967\nOr I could print something to my local\nattached printer from a virtual machine.\n\n106\n00:06:15.967 --> 00:06:19.924\nSo that's enhanced session mode, and\nit does need to be configured both in your\n\n107\n00:06:19.924 --> 00:06:23.005\nHyper-V settings as well as\nyour virtual machine settings.\n\n108\n00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:30.226\nI'm trying to think here,\nanything else I wanna show you here?\n\n109\n00:06:30.226 --> 00:06:34.165\nI think we're good for that,\nthose are the important ones.\n\n110\n00:06:34.165 --> 00:06:38.938\nVirtual Switch Manager, let's definitely\nspend some time to get look at this\n\n111\n00:06:38.938 --> 00:06:42.717\nbecause l'm pretty sure that\nthese could be testable areas.\n\n112\n00:06:42.717 --> 00:06:46.135\nThink about this.\n\n113\n00:06:46.135 --> 00:06:49.148\nSo we've talked about how\nwe can set up hardware,\n\n114\n00:06:49.148 --> 00:06:53.328\nwe're really creating virtual\ncomponents for our computers here.\n\n115\n00:06:53.328 --> 00:06:56.690\nBut if you think about\nthe physical components, well,\n\n116\n00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.919\nhow does networking work,\nwhy do we have computers?\n\n117\n00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.655\nFor the most part it's to communicate,\nright?\n\n118\n00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:06.993\nSo I may just want to create virtual\nmachines, and have them in isolation,\n\n119\n00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:10.652\nand never worry about\ncommunication whatsoever.\n\n120\n00:07:10.652 --> 00:07:12.761\nBut for the majority of us,\nthat's not the case.\n\n121\n00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:17.203\nSo what we need to do is think about\nhow we can create virtual switches, and\n\n122\n00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:19.291\nthat's what these settings are.\n\n123\n00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:23.057\nNow I do have three\ndifferent options here.\n\n124\n00:07:23.057 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd I can create an external,\nan internal and private.\n\n125\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.480\nEarlier when we looked at the individual\nvirtual machine settings, I said, hey,\n\n126\n00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.664\nlet's come back to\nthe network adapter settings.\n\n127\n00:07:34.664 --> 00:07:39.858\nAnd the reason being is,\nI can't go ahead and configure my network\n\n128\n00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:44.792\nadapters to attach them to a switch\nif a switch doesn't exist.\n\n129\n00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:51.880\nSo let me just go ahead and\nminimize this and pull up my, not that.\n\n130\n00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.361\nI want to pull up my ink space here.\n\n131\n00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:58.699\nThis is gonna be a test,\nmy artistic capabilities test here, Mike.\n\n132\n00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:00.504\nSo we'll see how this.\n&gt;&gt; You're testing, okay,\n\n133\n00:08:00.504 --> 00:08:01.733\nI thought you made a pop quiz for me.\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no,\n\n134\n00:08:01.733 --> 00:08:02.358\nno, I'm on the chopping block here.\n\n135\n00:08:02.358 --> 00:08:07.042\nAnd let's see my first time\nreally using Workspace, so\n\n136\n00:08:07.042 --> 00:08:13.534\nlet's see if there we go, I can get my\ntouchpad and everything to play along.\n\n137\n00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:17.592\nAll right, let's think about this for\na second, so\n\n138\n00:08:17.592 --> 00:08:21.018\nif I have a couple of\nvirtual machines here.\n\n139\n00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:27.108\nSo this is VM1 VM2.\n\n140\n00:08:29.204 --> 00:08:30.490\nOkay.\n\n141\n00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:35.390\nAnd so I also have my host,\nand I'll just do, I know,\n\n142\n00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.100\nthese are not to scale or anything.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n143\n00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.870\n&gt;&gt; Just giving you more room to type or\n\n144\n00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.860\nto write I should say.\n\n145\n00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.560\nAll right, so there's my host.\n\n146\n00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.330\nAnd if you think about the physical\nconnectivity when we're running it over,\n\n147\n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.090\nusing the wire to transmit that binary,\nright?\n\n148\n00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.301\nSo usually my nic.\n\n149\n00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:56.459\nI didn't leave myself a lot\nof space there did I?\n\n150\n00:08:56.459 --> 00:08:58.110\n[LAUGH] Poor my nic.\n\n151\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:05.586\nAll right, so that's what connects to\nwhatever else you have here maybe,\n\n152\n00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:08.547\nlike, your router and your firewall.\n\n153\n00:09:08.547 --> 00:09:10.050\nJust do like-\n&gt;&gt; Physical network.\n\n154\n00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:10.971\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah,\n\n155\n00:09:10.971 --> 00:09:12.658\nwe'll just do a big blog there for now,\n\n156\n00:09:12.658 --> 00:09:15.176\nbecause that's not what we're\ntalking about right now.\n\n157\n00:09:15.176 --> 00:09:15.776\nOkay, so\n\n158\n00:09:15.776 --> 00:09:21.500\nwith the different options that we have\nwhenever we can create those switches.\n\n159\n00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.764\nAll right,\na switch just like in real life.\n\n160\n00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:25.931\nActually it's not just like in real life,\n\n161\n00:09:25.931 --> 00:09:30.390\nbecause when we're talking about switches\nin real life, what is our big limitation?\n\n162\n00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.932\nWell, it's usually ports.\n\n163\n00:09:32.932 --> 00:09:38.670\nAnd ports and port density, it's usually\na budget limitation there, right?\n\n164\n00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:44.498\nSo in virtualized environment, there is\nno port limitation which is really cool.\n\n165\n00:09:44.498 --> 00:09:47.738\nYou'd still have to consider\nyour bandwidth usage,\n\n166\n00:09:47.738 --> 00:09:52.562\nbecause that's still a factor, but\nyou can't have all these virtual machines\n\n167\n00:09:52.562 --> 00:09:56.606\npiggy-backing off of this one\nphysical network interface card.\n\n168\n00:09:56.606 --> 00:10:02.350\nI mean, you can, but you're gonna see\nperformance issues there for that.\n\n169\n00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.595\nAll right, so let's take a look at these\nthree different types of switches.\n\n170\n00:10:05.595 --> 00:10:07.525\nSo I can create a switch, and\n\n171\n00:10:07.525 --> 00:10:11.563\nI can have like three different\noptions here for external.\n\n172\n00:10:11.563 --> 00:10:17.437\nOkay, so if I create a switch\nthat will allow my virtual\n\n173\n00:10:17.437 --> 00:10:22.928\nmachines to go ahead and\nconnect through the host,\n\n174\n00:10:22.928 --> 00:10:29.700\nborrow its network interphase card and\nconnect down, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.015\nSo that's at external.\n\n176\n00:10:32.015 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd I should probably\njust do one motion and\n\n177\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.366\nI'll have to hit that one at times.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n178\n00:10:38.366 --> 00:10:41.500\n&gt;&gt; So external, you are taking a virtual,\n\n179\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.540\nyou're creating a switch that allows\nthat virtual machine to kind of borrow\n\n180\n00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:51.540\nthat network interface card to actually\ncommunicate with the wire transmit\n\n181\n00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.740\non your LAN, on your WAN to the Internet\nwherever it is your heart desires, okay?\n\n182\n00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.930\nSo that's external options.\n\n183\n00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.538\nSo with your internal\nswitches that you create,\n\n184\n00:11:02.538 --> 00:11:06.322\nthis is where that connectivity lies,\nall right?\n\n185\n00:11:06.322 --> 00:11:11.930\nSo for your internal, oops,\ngive me one seconds, I said that wrong.\n\n186\n00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:18.990\nThat is going to be for your private let's\njust go to private, cuz I said that wrong.\n\n187\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.200\nPrivate is going to be from virtual\nmachine to virtual machine.\n\n188\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.028\nAll right, so\nmaybe there's a reason why I don't\n\n189\n00:11:26.028 --> 00:11:31.110\nwant my host to be able to\ncommunicate to my virtual machines.\n\n190\n00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:36.320\nMaybe I'm testing out some anti-malware\n\n191\n00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.370\nsoftware that I've created, and I don't\n[LAUGH] really know if it works yet.\n\n192\n00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.735\nSo I don't want my host to become infected\nor something like that, so only VM1 and\n\n193\n00:11:43.735 --> 00:11:47.700\nVM2 would be able to communicate if I\nwere able to create a private switch.\n\n194\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:54.240\nNow internal is actually\nwhere my virtual machines\n\n195\n00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.580\ncan speak with my host,\nthey can not come over here,\n\n196\n00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:03.720\nbecause they're not getting access to or\nactual network interphase card.\n\n197\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.531\nI can only speak to that host,\nso that's internal, all right?\n\n198\n00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:11.060\nAnd then private was just VM to VM.\n\n199\n00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.835\nAnd then we also have one other little\noption that when we're creating our\n\n200\n00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:20.860\nexternal, we have the ability to kinda\ngo around our host and go into the NIC.\n\n201\n00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.055\nSo we're circumventing that host,\nwe're saying, the virtual machine can have\n\n202\n00:12:25.055 --> 00:12:29.154\naccess to this network interface card,\nbut the host operating system cannot.\n\n203\n00:12:29.154 --> 00:12:32.817\nSo those are going to be our options\nwhenever we look at different ways we can\n\n204\n00:12:32.817 --> 00:12:35.487\ncreate different switch types basically.\n&gt;&gt; Very cool,\n\n205\n00:12:35.487 --> 00:12:37.497\nare you going to show us how to do that?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n206\n00:12:37.497 --> 00:12:41.521\nwe are how much time we got plenty\nof time plenty of time, cool.\n\n207\n00:12:41.521 --> 00:12:47.313\nAll right, I will say this, though,\nwhenever you are creating your external\n\n208\n00:12:47.313 --> 00:12:53.760\nswitch, because you have been married to\nthat physical network interface card.\n\n209\n00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.000\nHow many wives can you have?\n\n210\n00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.436\nHow many husbands can you have, right?\n\n211\n00:12:56.436 --> 00:12:58.090\n[LAUGH] So I don't know.\n\n212\n00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.830\nIn the United States you\ncan only have one, right?\n\n213\n00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:00.801\nThat's the law.\n\n214\n00:13:00.801 --> 00:13:05.342\nSo if you think about it that way,\nyou can't have multiple spouses or\n\n215\n00:13:05.342 --> 00:13:11.460\nmultiple external switches here if you\nonly have one network interface card.\n\n216\n00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.003\nIf you have multiple network interface\ncards, that's a whole other story, though,\n\n217\n00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:16.670\nwe will get until that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.290\n&gt;&gt; We'll save that for\n\n219\n00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:18.950\nthe server side conversation.\n\n220\n00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.843\nSo, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n221\n00:13:20.843 --> 00:13:22.038\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so,\n\n222\n00:13:22.038 --> 00:13:28.130\nit's actually pretty easy to ahead and\nset this up here.\n\n223\n00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.269\nAnd I'm not gonna create\nan external as of yet,\n\n224\n00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:33.920\nbecause I wanna create that in PowerShell\nto show you what we'd have to do there.\n\n225\n00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.545\nBut let's just say I wanted to create\na private switch, we can go ahead and\n\n226\n00:13:37.545 --> 00:13:38.260\ndo that here.\n\n227\n00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.896\nWalk through the wizard,\ncreate virtual switch.\n\n228\n00:13:41.896 --> 00:13:44.567\nAnd this is going to be important for\n\n229\n00:13:44.567 --> 00:13:49.196\nthe name of our virtual switches,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n230\n00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:53.929\nname this one as private here,\nbecause it aligns with my demo.\n\n231\n00:13:53.929 --> 00:13:56.930\nBut you'd wanna really think\nabout a self-explanatory or\n\n232\n00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:02.000\nhelpful name whenever you're creating\nyour switches, and I'll tell you why.\n\n233\n00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.641\nGo back to the logic or\nthinking of that physical switch.\n\n234\n00:14:05.641 --> 00:14:11.720\nWhat happens if someone in the server room\nunplugs the power to that physical switch?\n\n235\n00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.910\nWho is affected?\n&gt;&gt; Everybody that's connected to that\n\n236\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.740\nswitch I believe, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Everybody that's connected to\n\n237\n00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.790\nthat switch.\n\n238\n00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:23.220\nSo what if I'm creating this switch here,\nand then, two months from now\n\n239\n00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:28.530\nyou're tasked with maybe cleaning up\nunused switches or something like that.\n\n240\n00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:32.680\nAnd you go through and your starting\nto delete out some un-used switches.\n\n241\n00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.035\nHow will you even know who\nis going to be effective but\n\n242\n00:14:36.035 --> 00:14:39.250\nthe machine that you delete?\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] I don't know, yeah.\n\n243\n00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.630\n&gt;&gt; I don't think you would know, right?\n\n244\n00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.060\nYou would have to come to find me if I\nwas even with the company anymore and\n\n245\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.740\nask me what machines were\ndependent on what adaptors\n\n246\n00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.620\nhad I set to point to that switch.\n\n247\n00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.350\nSo this note portion right here,\nsuper important to go ahead and\n\n248\n00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.240\nput the names of the virtual machines.\n\n249\n00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.675\nThat you plan or are connected to that\nswitch, so that if it comes time for\n\n250\n00:14:59.675 --> 00:15:03.527\nremoval, at least someone has\na heads up and they can come in and\n\n251\n00:15:03.527 --> 00:15:07.231\ncheck that before disrupting everyone.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n252\n00:15:07.231 --> 00:15:09.879\n&gt;&gt; Okay, because I am selecting a private\n\n253\n00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:14.615\nnetwork here, I don't really need\nto worry about, this Intel here,\n\n254\n00:15:14.615 --> 00:15:19.456\nthis is my physical network interface\ncard, so I don't need to worry.\n\n255\n00:15:19.456 --> 00:15:22.297\nIt's a great out because,\nmy private network.\n\n256\n00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:26.915\nRemember, private is just going to be\nthat virtual machine to virtual machine.\n\n257\n00:15:26.915 --> 00:15:30.947\nWe don't need to touch that\nphysical network at all.\n\n258\n00:15:30.947 --> 00:15:31.480\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n259\n00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.305\n&gt;&gt; I do have the ability not here but\n\n260\n00:15:35.305 --> 00:15:41.426\nwe will take a look at this in a moment\nto utilize local area network there,\n\n261\n00:15:41.426 --> 00:15:43.814\nbut will just for now hit OK.\n\n262\n00:15:43.814 --> 00:15:50.978\nAll right, and because I have just created\nthat if I go back to my virtual manager.\n\n263\n00:15:50.978 --> 00:15:57.007\nI have that virtue switch, over here\non left hand side and you could like,\n\n264\n00:15:57.007 --> 00:16:03.055\nrename it and go back and change things\nif you want to modify then later on.\n\n265\n00:16:03.055 --> 00:16:07.755\nLet's go ahead and create another one,\nwe create an internal switch here.\n\n266\n00:16:07.755 --> 00:16:12.361\nAnd, Just making\n\n267\n00:16:12.361 --> 00:16:16.629\nsure I don't have anything set here for\nthat.\n\n268\n00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:20.160\nNow with my VLAN ID,\nwe think about this again.\n\n269\n00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.810\nJust like with our physical switches,\n\n270\n00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:26.570\nwe can configure them to allow for\nVirtual Local Area Network.\n\n271\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:30.770\nSo we can segment our network traffic for\nwhatever the reason may be, security,\n\n272\n00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:35.221\nincreased performance, so that our actual\nswitches are storing less information if\n\n273\n00:16:35.221 --> 00:16:38.272\ncertain machines are communicating\nmore frequently,.\n\n274\n00:16:38.272 --> 00:16:41.448\nBoth of those reasons, or\nwhatever reason you choose to do so\n\n275\n00:16:41.448 --> 00:16:45.400\nyou have that same logic applied\nhere within your virtual switches.\n\n276\n00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.104\nSo as long as you, again, document and\nkeep track of what machines are on which\n\n277\n00:16:50.104 --> 00:16:52.758\nVLANs, then you should\nbe good to go there.\n\n278\n00:16:52.758 --> 00:16:55.312\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nuncheck that now.\n\n279\n00:16:55.312 --> 00:16:59.384\nAnd for that name,\nthis one is going to be our internal.\n\n280\n00:17:01.624 --> 00:17:04.830\nPer name of our actual switch and\nwe'll hit OK.\n\n281\n00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.141\nPretty easy Mike, there's not-\n&gt;&gt; Very descriptive names,\n\n282\n00:17:07.141 --> 00:17:10.622\nI like that, yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not much to it there.\n\n283\n00:17:10.622 --> 00:17:12.460\nLet's go ahead and pull up PowerShell.\n\n284\n00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.783\nI might even have PowerShell\nup here in the background.\n\n285\n00:17:14.783 --> 00:17:20.535\nYeah, and show you, it's not difficult\nto create them in PowerShell either.\n\n286\n00:17:20.535 --> 00:17:24.823\nI do wanna show, let's see here,\non my local machine,\n\n287\n00:17:24.823 --> 00:17:28.660\nthe different parameters that you have.\n\n288\n00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.854\nFor now, we're just gonna stick with the\nbasics but if you wanted to go into more\n\n289\n00:17:32.854 --> 00:17:36.873\nadvanced features you could do that\nunder some advanced options in the GUI.\n\n290\n00:17:36.873 --> 00:17:40.604\nAlso by utilizing\nadditional parameters for\n\n291\n00:17:40.604 --> 00:17:45.413\ninstance if you wanted to\nimplement any kind of QOS here for\n\n292\n00:17:45.413 --> 00:17:50.770\nthe optional parameters like\nAllow management OS and so forth.\n\n293\n00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:55.731\nBut for right now the ones that we're\ngonna be focusing on like this switch type\n\n294\n00:17:55.731 --> 00:17:58.452\nand then just setting the basics up there.\n\n295\n00:17:58.452 --> 00:18:00.450\nI did put this link in the show notes so\n\n296\n00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.724\nyou could refer back if you wanted to\nplay in your lab environment or whatever.\n\n297\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.019\nOkay, so the syntax that we'll be\nusing here, pretty straightforward.\n\n298\n00:18:11.019 --> 00:18:15.250\nWe just created an internal switch so\nlet's go ahead and we'll create another\n\n299\n00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:19.557\ninternal just to show you what that looks\nlike, side by side comparison there.\n\n300\n00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:27.423\nSo we'll say new-vmswitch And\nwe'll name this one.\n\n301\n00:18:27.423 --> 00:18:28.654\nSo it needs a name.\n\n302\n00:18:28.654 --> 00:18:33.849\nAll those other optional parameters,\nlike they say, are optional.\n\n303\n00:18:33.849 --> 00:18:38.664\nFor this one, we're just gonna go\nahead and name this one internal2.\n\n304\n00:18:38.664 --> 00:18:42.560\nNow if I use my parameter here for\nmy switch type,\n\n305\n00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.050\nlet's go ahead and tab through here.\n\n306\n00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.033\nAnd I'll tab through and\nshow you the options.\n\n307\n00:18:48.033 --> 00:18:53.280\nWe have external, we have internal and\nwe have private, like we spoke about.\n\n308\n00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.889\nSo let me just go back and\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n309\n00:18:55.889 --> 00:18:58.000\ncreate another internal switch here.\n\n310\n00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.788\nPretty quick, it's doing the same\nthing that we saw in the GUI.\n\n311\n00:19:02.788 --> 00:19:07.769\nLet me just kind of move this guy so you\nguys can see that, and there's my switch,\n\n312\n00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:12.540\nnot a whole lot of special configuration\noptions that we have set here.\n\n313\n00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.404\nBut the reason I wanted to show\nyou how easy that one was and\n\n314\n00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:19.465\nthe difference that something that we\nwould need to take into consideration when\n\n315\n00:19:19.465 --> 00:19:21.210\nwe create our external switches.\n\n316\n00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.840\nThink about that marriage\nthat we spoke about, right?\n\n317\n00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:29.219\nSo if I'm telling the operating\nsystem to create an external switch,\n\n318\n00:19:29.219 --> 00:19:33.702\nit needs to know who its new\npartner is going to be, right?\n\n319\n00:19:33.702 --> 00:19:35.388\nSo that's what we need to specify here.\n\n320\n00:19:35.388 --> 00:19:39.869\nAnd also if we had multiple\nnetwork adapters on a machine,\n\n321\n00:19:39.869 --> 00:19:45.050\nmaybe we do have a computer that\nhas multiple network adapters.\n\n322\n00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:49.956\nThe first command that you would\nwant to run is Get-NetAdapter and\n\n323\n00:19:49.956 --> 00:19:55.220\nthat will return the adapters that\nare already present on that system.\n\n324\n00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.789\nAnd why that's important\nis especially here,\n\n325\n00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:06.576\nYou can use this name to go ahead and\napply it into your PowerShell syntax.\n\n326\n00:20:06.576 --> 00:20:08.830\nThere are other ways to go ahead and\n\n327\n00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:12.100\nidentify your switches\nhere over in this column.\n\n328\n00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.980\nBut for\nnow we're gonna stick with the names.\n\n329\n00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.770\nAnd as a matter of fact you can even\nsee here, we have our internal and\n\n330\n00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.660\ninternal 2 that we just created.\n\n331\n00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:24.856\nBut notice the difference, they have a v\nhere for that virtual connection there.\n\n332\n00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:30.256\nSo the physical adapter in this\nparticular machine is called ethernet 0,\n\n333\n00:20:30.256 --> 00:20:34.900\nso that's important and\nthat will be used in our next line here.\n\n334\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.326\nI'm just gonna clear my screen.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\n\n335\n00:20:37.326 --> 00:20:39.952\nI'm guessing this command is\ngonna be a little more complex.\n\n336\n00:20:39.952 --> 00:20:44.280\nNot a whole lot, we just have to specify\nwho that spouse is gonna be there for\n\n337\n00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.253\nthat marriage.\n\n338\n00:20:45.253 --> 00:20:49.702\nSo the first part looks the same, so here\nit's gonna be new and then it's going to\n\n339\n00:20:49.702 --> 00:20:53.970\nbe rvm-switch, just the same and\ngo ahead and tap through these here.\n\n340\n00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:59.702\nWe still need to specify name for this, so\nspace, dash, name, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n341\n00:20:59.702 --> 00:21:04.113\nname this external, just to keep\nit my super creative theme here.\n\n342\n00:21:04.113 --> 00:21:09.031\nAnd now I'm gonna go ahead and specify\nnet and we will and we will tab through\n\n343\n00:21:09.031 --> 00:21:14.190\nthis net adapter name, the name of our\nadapter that we checked on, right?\n\n344\n00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:14.770\n&gt;&gt; The physical network adapter?\n\n345\n00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.809\n&gt;&gt; The physical network adapter, yeah,\n\n346\n00:21:16.809 --> 00:21:18.000\nthat was ethernet0.\n\n347\n00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.062\nWe'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n348\n00:21:19.062 --> 00:21:22.001\nSo we're just telling the machine\nthat's the one we wanna bind to for\n\n349\n00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:24.528\nthis virtual switch here.\n&gt;&gt; So really not much more complex.\n\n350\n00:21:24.528 --> 00:21:25.988\nInstead of switch type,\n\n351\n00:21:25.988 --> 00:21:27.530\nyou use net adapter name.\n\n352\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:28.268\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n353\n00:21:28.268 --> 00:21:28.768\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty cool.\n\n354\n00:21:28.768 --> 00:21:29.485\n&gt;&gt; Easy.\n\n355\n00:21:29.485 --> 00:21:31.795\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if for whatever reason,\n\n356\n00:21:31.795 --> 00:21:33.874\nhere let me just minimize that so\n\n357\n00:21:33.874 --> 00:21:36.383\nwe can pull this back up in the GUI.\nAnd\n\n358\n00:21:36.383 --> 00:21:41.514\nyou do have the ability to go ahead and\nof course modify, and delete\n\n359\n00:21:41.514 --> 00:21:46.655\nfrom here within our operating system.\nSo if I click on internal 2 one\n\n360\n00:21:46.655 --> 00:21:51.963\nof the ones we had created, we'll just\ngo ahead and hit Remove, and Apply.\n\n361\n00:21:51.963 --> 00:21:57.192\nOkay, it didn't notify me, but\nusually for external, it will notify you\n\n362\n00:21:57.192 --> 00:22:02.630\nthe first time just saying,\nhey this will affect network connectivity.\n\n363\n00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.240\nWell, duh, because we did talk about that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good point.\n\n364\n00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.157\nAny time you create those externals,\nyou will potentially interrupt network\n\n365\n00:22:10.157 --> 00:22:13.980\nconnectivity as it temporarily sets it up.\n&gt;&gt; Makes that change, yeah.\n\n366\n00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.415\n&gt;&gt; Gotta bind that virtual switch to\n\n367\n00:22:15.415 --> 00:22:18.703\nthat physical network adapter which\nis gonna interrupt you connectivity.\n\n368\n00:22:18.703 --> 00:22:20.592\n&gt;&gt; And usually it's really quick but\n\n369\n00:22:20.592 --> 00:22:24.893\nif you have any kind of latency-sensitive\napplications that may be running,\n\n370\n00:22:24.893 --> 00:22:30.030\nthat might be a consideration if you\nneed that constant communication there.\n\n371\n00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.928\nOkay, let's go back into PowerShell.\n\n372\n00:22:31.928 --> 00:22:39.074\nI just wanna show you for giggles here\nthe other type of things we can do.\n\n373\n00:22:39.074 --> 00:22:40.730\nAnother one would be just to remove.\n\n374\n00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.075\nSo REMOVE-VMSWITCH.\n\n375\n00:22:45.623 --> 00:22:47.812\nThere's a lot of things we\ncan remove there, okay.\n\n376\n00:22:47.812 --> 00:22:50.275\nAnd what was another one\nthat we had here for?\n\n377\n00:22:50.275 --> 00:22:53.863\nOur private, we'll go ahead and\nremove that private switch and\n\n378\n00:22:53.863 --> 00:22:57.929\nit gives us here a note, a warning,\nhey do you wanna go ahead and remove?\n\n379\n00:22:57.929 --> 00:23:01.430\nWe'll hit Yes or A to all.\n\n380\n00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.932\nGo ahead and hit Enter, and\nit really is that easy.\n\n381\n00:23:04.932 --> 00:23:07.779\nSo that's gonna be on\nthe switch side of things, but\n\n382\n00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:10.379\nthen what about our virtual machines,\nright?\n\n383\n00:23:10.379 --> 00:23:13.580\nI'll just go ahead and clear this,\nand let's take a look at those.\n\n384\n00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:18.448\nSo for each one of our virtual machines\nhere now that we have created switches,\n\n385\n00:23:18.448 --> 00:23:21.567\nif I go to these guys and\npull up with the settings.\n\n386\n00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:25.465\nI can go ahead and choose for\nmy network adapter,\n\n387\n00:23:25.465 --> 00:23:29.100\nif we go ahead and either way select that.\n\n388\n00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.058\nBefore, from the drop down we didn't\n\n389\n00:23:31.058 --> 00:23:32.550\nhave any options, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n390\n00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.654\n&gt;&gt; Just not connected, but now, there's\n\n391\n00:23:35.654 --> 00:23:41.325\ntwo switches that we were left with and\nwe could go ahead and select those.\n\n392\n00:23:41.325 --> 00:23:46.702\nYou can add additional virtual network\nadapters to your virtual machines but\n\n393\n00:23:46.702 --> 00:23:51.758\nremember you can only have one external\nswitch connected to an adapter.\n\n394\n00:23:51.758 --> 00:23:56.886\nSo you can't have multiple\nexternal connections\n\n395\n00:23:56.886 --> 00:24:01.281\ninside that virtual machine there Again,\n\n396\n00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:04.709\nwe can go ahead and utilize LANs.\n\n397\n00:24:04.709 --> 00:24:09.839\nSo this would be where we're saying okay,\nwe want, what what machine are we on here,\n\n398\n00:24:09.839 --> 00:24:14.390\ndemo one to be a part of VLAN2 if we were\nto go ahead and leave this info here.\n\n399\n00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:20.415\nBut, remember we would have to make sure\nthat our internal switch was set up and\n\n400\n00:24:20.415 --> 00:24:23.629\nconfigured to allow for our VLANs there.\n\n401\n00:24:25.727 --> 00:24:30.568\nAll right, so\nI'm trying to think if there's anything\n\n402\n00:24:30.568 --> 00:24:34.482\nelse I need to go ahead and\nshow you guys here,\n\n403\n00:24:34.482 --> 00:24:38.770\nlet's just go ahead and\nwe'll say Apply and OK.\n\n404\n00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:42.610\nFor my virtual switch manager, there\nis one other thing I wanted to mention\n\n405\n00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.919\nhere for these little components for\nMAC addresses, right?\n\n406\n00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.940\nWe can go ahead and set MAC address\nranges for our Hyper-V settings.\n\n407\n00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.970\nIf we wanted our virtual machines,\nor our adapters there\n\n408\n00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:02.120\nto be utilizing a particular scope,\nor range of MAC addresses.\n\n409\n00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.850\nAnd then on the other hand\nyou can configure that for\n\n410\n00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:08.970\nyour individual machines as well.\n\n411\n00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:17.410\nAnd usually, you'll leave it for\nautomatic, for the management there.\n\n412\n00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.190\nBut just know that you do have the option,\n\n413\n00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.445\nI'm trying to think, where was that here?\n&gt;&gt; Expand that\n\n414\n00:25:21.445 --> 00:25:22.826\nout.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n415\n00:25:22.826 --> 00:25:26.470\n&gt;&gt; Under advanced features, yeah.\n\n416\n00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.875\nThere is another section for hardware.\n\n417\n00:25:28.875 --> 00:25:30.630\nWe'll take a look at those two.\n\n418\n00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.250\nBut, yeah, I forgot all about all of them.\n\n419\n00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:36.430\nWe need to talk about these just so\nyou know because they are buried and\n\n420\n00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:37.900\nhidden down here.\n\n421\n00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.640\nYou can keep the dynamic for\nthe MAC addresses.\n\n422\n00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.100\nHowever, if you had an application where\nmaybe it's like a licensing issue and\n\n423\n00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.650\nyou needed to use that static you could\ngo ahead and set that right here.\n\n424\n00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.660\nMAC address spoofing,\nprobably not gonna use that too much, but\n\n425\n00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.640\njust know that it is an option.\n\n426\n00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:00.723\nNow, the other settings here\nare really going to be used for\n\n427\n00:26:00.723 --> 00:26:03.476\nsecurity and/or management.\n\n428\n00:26:03.476 --> 00:26:09.160\nSo DHCP Guard really prevents this\nvirtual machine from sending out.\n\n429\n00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:14.092\nIf you think about how DHCP works and\nyou think about that DORA process, it will\n\n430\n00:26:14.092 --> 00:26:19.400\nprevent this virtual machine from sending\nout our offer packets to the network.\n\n431\n00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.530\nSo, we're really helping others in\n\n432\n00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:27.960\nour network in case we become compromised\nwe don't wanna trick or fool them.\n\n433\n00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.340\nI'm guessing that's the best way to really\nexplain it, what do you think Mike?\n\n434\n00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.194\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I think so,\n\n435\n00:26:32.194 --> 00:26:35.061\nsetting up a rogue DHCP server\ncan cause problems on your\n\n436\n00:26:35.061 --> 00:26:36.560\nnetwork.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n\n437\n00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.850\n&gt;&gt; Whether it's intentional or\n\n438\n00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:38.480\nunintentional.\n\n439\n00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.291\nI might just enable DHCP on one of my VMs,\n\n440\n00:26:41.291 --> 00:26:45.525\nnot realizing that it's connected\nto an external network.\n\n441\n00:26:45.525 --> 00:26:50.387\nWhich means physical machines or other VMs\non the network could attempt to get an IP\n\n442\n00:26:50.387 --> 00:26:52.856\naddress form the wrong DHCP server-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n443\n00:26:52.856 --> 00:26:54.427\n&gt;&gt; And have network connectivity issues,\n\n444\n00:26:54.427 --> 00:26:57.059\nand this would block it,\nit just blocks offers from that particular\n\n445\n00:26:57.059 --> 00:26:57.651\nVM.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n446\n00:26:57.651 --> 00:27:00.103\nsimilarly here with the router guard also,\n\n447\n00:27:00.103 --> 00:27:04.344\nso that's going to be preventing those\noutward communications like router\n\n448\n00:27:04.344 --> 00:27:07.010\nadvertisements there for\nthat solicitation.\n\n449\n00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:11.980\nSo we're not trying to have\nany illegitimate connectivity\n\n450\n00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.330\non our network there, and\nI'm just trying the port mirroring.\n\n451\n00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.970\nPort mirroring is going to be mimicking,\n\n452\n00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.110\nlike if we were running any kind of\nmanagement utility like Wireshark or\n\n453\n00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.765\nsomething like that we do\nhave that capability here.\n\n454\n00:27:23.765 --> 00:27:28.080\nNIC teaming, this is where that polygamy\nkind of conversation came in that I was\n\n455\n00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.730\nmentioning before, if we have multiple\ninterface cards we could aggregate,\n\n456\n00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:34.660\nbind them, create linked aggregation.\n\n457\n00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.440\nAgain, I think that's more\nof a service conversation so\n\n458\n00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.790\nwe'll save that for later,\nalso device naming there.\n\n459\n00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:47.936\nAnother one, hardware acceleration again,\nI think these are gonna be a little\n\n460\n00:27:47.936 --> 00:27:52.505\nmore advanced, more geared towards\nserver side configurations of VMQ.\n\n461\n00:27:52.505 --> 00:27:56.233\nThe way that our interrupts\nare gonna be happening with\n\n462\n00:27:56.233 --> 00:28:01.110\nnetwork adapter in this particular\ninstance here, I'm about to say.\n\n463\n00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:07.927\nWe don't see something which\nis another type of management\n\n464\n00:28:07.927 --> 00:28:13.550\nwhich will be our SRIOV,\nwhich is an option that we do have for\n\n465\n00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:19.420\nour performance optimization for\nour network adapters here.\n\n466\n00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:24.010\nSo, just note that this is something\nwe have available on the client side.\n\n467\n00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.850\nAnd another thing that we\nhave available here for\n\n468\n00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:30.250\nthose network interface cards\nis IPsec task offloading.\n\n469\n00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:35.381\nSo if we wanted to go ahead and\noffload any kind of decryption,\n\n470\n00:28:35.381 --> 00:28:38.010\nencryption capabilities.\n\n471\n00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:42.340\nThen we do have the ability to kind of\nborrow from that operating system to go\n\n472\n00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.290\nahead and offload those IP tasks for us.\n&gt;&gt; Very\n\n473\n00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:45.820\ncool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n474\n00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:49.010\nso just kinda play around with it and\nlook in there.\n\n475\n00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:52.109\nI'm trying to think if\nthere's anything else, so\n\n476\n00:28:52.109 --> 00:28:54.280\ndid we look at creating an adapter?\n\n477\n00:28:55.340 --> 00:29:00.870\nYeah, the only thing I think I wanna\nmention guys you can go ahead and\n\n478\n00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.680\ncreate your adapters in PowerShell\n\n479\n00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.810\njust like with anything else that\nwe've been working with here.\n\n480\n00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.410\nSo for instance, let's go ahead and\n\n481\n00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:14.275\nwe can say add, the syntax is going\nto be add VM network adapter.\n\n482\n00:29:15.515 --> 00:29:19.779\nOops, it's not an NM it's a VM\nnetwork adapter and we'll go ahead and\n\n483\n00:29:19.779 --> 00:29:21.307\ntab through to get that.\n\n484\n00:29:21.307 --> 00:29:25.756\nYou do need to specify here the VM\nname because I'm using this\n\n485\n00:29:25.756 --> 00:29:28.995\ncommand on the actual host,\nso our VM name.\n\n486\n00:29:28.995 --> 00:29:30.710\nAnd go ahead and tap through that.\n\n487\n00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.460\nI don't know if we just\nwanted to go ahead and\n\n488\n00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.248\nsay demo three for that particular one.\n\n489\n00:29:37.248 --> 00:29:42.435\nAnd for adapter name,\nyou can just name that like,\n\n490\n00:29:45.032 --> 00:29:49.110\nDemo ring neck or something like that.\n\n491\n00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.700\nIt's really that simple.\n\n492\n00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:55.650\nYou can modify with the set command\nif you wanted to implement any\n\n493\n00:29:55.650 --> 00:30:00.250\nkind of additional customized\nfeatures management things like that.\n\n494\n00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.240\nBut I definitely encourage you to do that.\n\n495\n00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.840\nI know it's a lot with Hyper-V.\n\n496\n00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.570\nIt is called out on the objective, so\nI want you to be aware of that, but\n\n497\n00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.880\nI think that's all, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; All right, great stuff,\n\n498\n00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.720\ngreat demonstrations there, Cherokee,\non working with our client side Hyper-V.\n\n499\n00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.070\nWe appreciate that.\n\n500\n00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:17.250\nHope everyone out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n501\n00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.160\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n502\n00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.040\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n503\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.763\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n504\n00:30:22.763 --> 00:30:29.077\n[MUSIC]\n\n505\n00:30:29.077 --> 00:30:32.234\n&gt;&gt; Thank

Hey, how's it going, Mike?\n\n12\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.040\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n13\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.100\nSo you got disks and volumes for us today?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a particular\n\n14\n00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.680\ndomain on studying for this exam and\nthere's a lot associated with the storage.\n\n15\n00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.440\nSo I just wanted to break it down and we\ncan look at these components individually.\n\n16\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.730\nI will try to tell you guys as much as\nI can remember because there is a lot\n\n17\n00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.410\nwhen it comes to disks and volumes.\n\n18\n00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.040\nAnd also, this is one of those things\nwhere we're kind of venturing out\n\n19\n00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.980\nof the realm of physical hardware and\ninto the realm of logical storage.\n\n20\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.300\nIt can be a little convoluted for\nsome but was for me.\n\n21\n00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.200\nSo what I am attempting to do in this\nshow Mike is to break it down in\n\n22\n00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.060\na way that makes sense to everyone, right?\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n23\n00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.726\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's go and\n\n24\n00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:16.140\ntake a look at my screen.\n\n25\n00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.733\nAnd this is the first\nthing I could think about.\n\n26\n00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:22.155\nLet's say that I am provisionally\ncreating a system for someone,\n\n27\n00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:25.710\nan end user maybe just like myself\nlike a new gaming rig or something.\n\n28\n00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.566\nAnd I put my fancy new hard disk drive in,\n\n29\n00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:32.774\nit smells like the new hard\ndisk drive smell and I'm happy.\n\n30\n00:01:32.774 --> 00:01:36.040\nAnd then I power on my machine and\nI am good to go.\n\n31\n00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.720\nRight, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; That's it, that's all you gotta do.\n\n32\n00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.770\n&gt;&gt; That's all you gotta do.\n\n33\n00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're good\n\n34\n00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.545\nto go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n35\n00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:41.050\n&gt;&gt; Maybe not.\n\n36\n00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.070\nProbably a little more to it.\n&gt;&gt; It would be too easy though if that\n\n37\n00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.920\nwere the case.\n\n38\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.425\nWe know that.\n\n39\n00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:47.380\nAnd so\nI want to take this time to go ahead and\n\n40\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.360\nshare with you what\nthe next step would be.\n\n41\n00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.396\nSo you plug in your hard drive and then\nyou think, okay what do I have to do now?\n\n42\n00:01:54.396 --> 00:01:57.806\nWell, if you are working within\nthe Graphical User Interface and\n\n43\n00:01:57.806 --> 00:02:01.100\nthat's where I'm gonna stay for\nthis first section of shows.\n\n44\n00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.910\nWe're gonna be, there is a lot guys.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.250\n&gt;&gt; So, right now let's just I'm\n\n46\n00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.850\nsaying in the Graphical User Interface.\n\n47\n00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.010\nSo what we will be doing is we will\nbe marking that drive as online.\n\n48\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.740\nSo when operating system first detects,\nhey,\n\n49\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.000\nCherokee plugged in a hard disk drive.\n\n50\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.180\nIt's not doing anything\nspecific with it so\n\n51\n00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.820\nI have to tell the system how to behave or\nhow to handle that drive.\n\n52\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.550\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and mark it online.\n\n53\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.840\nAnd we're gonna go through all of this.\n\n54\n00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.274\nSo I'm just walking through these steps\nto prepare you for what is to come here.\n\n55\n00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:31.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, I like it.\n\n56\n00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.370\nAll right, so, where do we start?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we start with disk management.\n\n57\n00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.950\nAnd then once we mark it as online and\n\n58\n00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.230\ndisk management,\nwe next need to initilize it.\n\n59\n00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.090\nAnd we're gonna go through each one\nof these topics individually, and\n\n60\n00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.341\nthat's why I wanted to just\nkind of break it down first.\n\n61\n00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:48.700\nBecause there are a lot of options, Mike.\n\n62\n00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.930\nIt's kind of like going\nto a car dealership and\n\n63\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.810\ngetting to pick all\nthe fancy options there.\n\n64\n00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.030\nSo that's why I just don't\nwant you to get confused by\n\n65\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.920\nall of those.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n66\n00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.644\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n67\n00:02:58.644 --> 00:02:59.539\n&gt;&gt; No high pressure no,\n\n68\n00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:03.656\nhigh pressure salespeople.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, this is like a chill kind of\n\n69\n00:03:03.656 --> 00:03:06.460\nthing that I wanna going on here.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n70\n00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.498\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n71\n00:03:07.498 --> 00:03:12.169\nthe next thing we need to take a look\nat is select a partition style\n\n72\n00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:16.679\npartition scheme you may even\nhear this being referenced as.\n\n73\n00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:21.592\nAnd our options in Windows environment\nare gonna be MBR, Master Boot Record or\n\n74\n00:03:21.592 --> 00:03:26.305\nGPT which stands for GUID Partition Table,\nwhich is one of my favorites.\n\n75\n00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:29.839\nAn acronym nested inside of an acronym.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n76\n00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:31.797\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Acronym inside yeah anyways.\n\n77\n00:03:31.797 --> 00:03:36.055\nBecause GUID for our what is it?\n&gt;&gt; Global Unique Identifier.\n\n78\n00:03:36.055 --> 00:03:38.985\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly so we have all of that\n\n79\n00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:41.225\ngoing on but it's a good thing.\n&gt;&gt; Can we say there's three?\n\n80\n00:03:41.225 --> 00:03:45.970\nBecause then ID is for identification.\n&gt;&gt; Wow, look at that.\n\n81\n00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.920\nI like that.\n\n82\n00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.500\n[LAUGH] Anyways multiple layers here.\n\n83\n00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.900\nSo that's why I say we're\ngonna keep it chill,\n\n84\n00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.350\nwe're gonna just relax and soak it all in.\n\n85\n00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.140\nSo we're gonna look at the differences\nbetween those two partition schemes.\n\n86\n00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.540\nAnd then we'll also at some point\nhave the ability to go ahead and\n\n87\n00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.000\ncreate a volume on a disc.\n\n88\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.550\nAnd there's a little bit of\nterminology associated with that.\n\n89\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.776\nAnd we'll see like whenever we first\ncreate a partition, a partition for\n\n90\n00:04:12.776 --> 00:04:13.672\nthe most part.\n\n91\n00:04:13.672 --> 00:04:18.636\nAnd there are good arguments out there in\ncertain scenarios as to how you would use\n\n92\n00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:19.877\nthis terminology.\n\n93\n00:04:19.877 --> 00:04:24.098\nBut for all intents and\npurposes in our conversations here,\n\n94\n00:04:24.098 --> 00:04:29.080\nwe're gonna say partitions is going\nto be pre volume configurations.\n\n95\n00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.530\nSo like before,\nI assigned it a drive letter or whatever.\n\n96\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.842\nAnd we'll talk about\nthat a little bit more.\n\n97\n00:04:33.842 --> 00:04:39.467\nAnd another thing that I have the ability\nto do if I am creating a volume is well,\n\n98\n00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:41.580\nto choose a file system.\n\n99\n00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.500\nWe'll talk about all different types of\nfile systems that we have available to us.\n\n100\n00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.710\nWe'll talk about assigning\noptional drive letters,\n\n101\n00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.830\nwhat to do when you run out of letters\nin the alphabet, things like that.\n\n102\n00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.620\nWe also have the ability, that's the\nanswer, right there, by the way, is opt,\n\n103\n00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.210\nto, yeah, to mount NTFS folders.\n\n104\n00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.090\nAnd of course that's only if\nyou're using an NTFS file system.\n\n105\n00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.898\nAnd, like I said,\nwe'll take a look at each one of these.\n\n106\n00:05:05.898 --> 00:05:10.667\nWe'll also spend a good amount of time\nlooking at the difference between basic\n\n107\n00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:11.906\nand dynamic disks.\n\n108\n00:05:11.906 --> 00:05:18.370\nAnd we'll definitely spend a good portion\nof time looking at dynamic disks.\n\n109\n00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.958\nHowever, with that being said,\nMicrosoft is\n\n110\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:27.281\nphasing out or, what's the word?\n\n111\n00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:29.734\n&gt;&gt; Retiring?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n112\n00:05:29.734 --> 00:05:33.920\n&gt;&gt; Or putting out to pasture?\n\n113\n00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.535\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wow,\n\n114\n00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:37.770\nokay.\n&gt;&gt; Discontinuing?\n\n115\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.995\nWe'll see it on their website,\nit's the one that starts with a C.\n\n116\n00:05:39.995 --> 00:05:42.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll have to wait and see.\n\n117\n00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.981\nThere's a cliffhanger for you.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n118\n00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:49.034\nmy brain is just maybe I'm a little\ntoo chill for this show or something.\n\n119\n00:05:49.034 --> 00:05:54.029\n[LAUGH] No, anyways, we'll take a look\nat that, but they're getting rid\n\n120\n00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:59.118\nof dynamic disks in hopes that you will\nutilize our actual storage spaces.\n\n121\n00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:01.700\nWhich is a newer feature that\nwe have available to us.\n\n122\n00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.930\nHowever, dynamic disks\nare specifically called out for\n\n123\n00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.249\nthis 690, which one are we in, 690\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n124\n00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:10.462\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we're gonna cover that for\n\n125\n00:06:10.462 --> 00:06:11.790\nyou, guys.\n\n126\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.820\nWhen we take a look at those,\nwe will look at the differences and\n\n127\n00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.879\nthe options that we do have available\nthere to create simple volumes.\n\n128\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.360\nLike the name it sounds,\nthey are rather simple,\n\n129\n00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.590\nthey're not spinning\nacross multiple drives.\n\n130\n00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.560\nWe also have the option spanned.\n\n131\n00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.260\nSo, spanned is going to be\nsimilar to filling up caps.\n\n132\n00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.438\nAnd I know this might not make a lot of\nsense right now, but we will come back and\n\n133\n00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:39.386\nlook at all of these individually.\n\n134\n00:06:39.386 --> 00:06:46.117\nAnd when I say filling up cups, I'm just\ngonna give you a quick, little visual.\n\n135\n00:06:46.117 --> 00:06:49.309\nSo that when we start talking about\nthis in the operating system you\n\n136\n00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:52.530\nhave something to relate to,\nbecause we're filling up.\n\n137\n00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.990\nAnd you can see here my little binary\nbits, they're pouring over and\n\n138\n00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.940\nyou see overflow into different cups.\n\n139\n00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.150\nSo this is kind of when we\nget to disk management and\n\n140\n00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.472\nwe see those actual disks set in there.\n\n141\n00:07:05.472 --> 00:07:09.666\nWe can think about these caps\nin a data like filling in as\n\n142\n00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:13.820\na variable first odd space there for\nspend.\n\n143\n00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:19.539\nStripe is going to be different,\nit's going to be comparable to RAID 0.\n\n144\n00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:23.667\nAnd if you guys aren't familiar with\nthat we do have lots of shows on it but\n\n145\n00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:27.740\nI will have I do have a slide here just\nfor a brief refresher or reminder.\n\n146\n00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.700\nBut we have shows that\ndefinitely go into depth\n\n147\n00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.570\nabout different types\nof RAID configurations.\n\n148\n00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.420\nAnd remember RAID just stands for\nRedundant Array of Independent or\n\n149\n00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.160\nInexpensive Disks,\ndepending how old you are.\n\n150\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.920\nAnd then lastly we have the option\nto create mirrored Volumes,\n\n151\n00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.460\nwhich are gonna be similar to RAID 1,\nand, again,\n\n152\n00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.380\nwe'll take a look at those, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a lot\n\n153\n00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.492\nof fun.\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's a lot.\n\n154\n00:07:53.492 --> 00:07:58.510\n[LAUGH] But\nI think is gonna go by pretty well.\n\n155\n00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.535\nLet's take a look first at basic disks,\nokay?\n\n156\n00:08:02.535 --> 00:08:08.540\nSo Basic disks actually let me\nbring it back one more step.\n\n157\n00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.200\nLet me pull up a link that I have here,\nand\n\n158\n00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.320\nwe'll go with one more diagram\nbefore we get into basic disks.\n\n159\n00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.260\nThe reason I am doing this is just so\nwe can have this visual,\n\n160\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.870\nI think it would be good\nto start with the hardware.\n\n161\n00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.985\nAgain, if you're not familiar with that,\nwe do have hardware shows.\n\n162\n00:08:27.985 --> 00:08:31.140\nA+ is a great place to start with that,\nif you're not familiar,\n\n163\n00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.500\nbecause some of this information\nis kind of implied knowledge.\n\n164\n00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.730\nWe're dealing here with Windows 10,\nwhich is software, and a lot of what\n\n165\n00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.150\nwe're dealing with is how our software\nis handling our hardware here.\n\n166\n00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.015\nSo you kind have to have that knowledge.\n\n167\n00:08:46.015 --> 00:08:47.460\nAll right.\n\n168\n00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.344\nSo I do wanna talk about first, before\nwe get into basic versus dynamic disks,\n\n169\n00:08:52.344 --> 00:08:54.890\nlet's talk about MBR versus GPT.\n\n170\n00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:59.870\nSo master boot record versus our GPT for\nour GUI partition table.\n\n171\n00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.600\nThat's what Mike and\nI were just joking about.\n\n172\n00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:08.170\nSo what we see here is an example\nof an optical disk, right?\n\n173\n00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.960\nSo and this is disk with a k?\n\n174\n00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.660\nNot disc with a C, if we have disc\nwith a C we're referencing like media.\n\n175\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.190\nSo our CD ROMs, DVDs, things like that.\n\n176\n00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:27.324\nSo just to kind of differentiate\nbetween the two but they, our CD and\n\n177\n00:09:27.324 --> 00:09:32.100\nDVD drive bay is also gonna\nbe noted in disk management.\n\n178\n00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.150\nSo we're not excluding them, but we're\npredominantly speaking about disk with a K\n\n179\n00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.110\nin for the next few shows here, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.040\nSo we have our platters and\n\n181\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.050\nour platters have individual\nportions called sectors.\n\n182\n00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.520\nSo this is where the data is being\nwritten in individual sector.\n\n183\n00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.334\nWhen we're talking about MBR for\na master boot record,\n\n184\n00:09:55.334 --> 00:10:00.205\nthat master boot record is actually\ngoing to be held that information,\n\n185\n00:10:00.205 --> 00:10:03.380\nhere inside of this first sector.\n\n186\n00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.915\nSo what happens Mike if that\nsector becomes corrupt or\n\n187\n00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:10.770\ndamaged?\n&gt;&gt; I think you're gonna have a hard time\n\n188\n00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.570\naccessing the data on that drive.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n189\n00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.208\nit's not gonna be a good day, is it?\n\n190\n00:10:14.208 --> 00:10:15.361\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n191\n00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:16.487\n&gt;&gt; Cuz there's a lot of important\n\n192\n00:10:16.487 --> 00:10:18.540\ninformation stored there.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n193\n00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.560\nI mean, it has information about the\npartitions that we are gonna be working\n\n194\n00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.960\nwith and we haven't got to partitions yet\nbut That's where your boot information is\n\n195\n00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.830\nstored and information about those\npartitions on that particular drive,\n\n196\n00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.860\nthat physical drive there.\n\n197\n00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.730\nSo if it becomes corrupt,\nand yes, yes they do.\n\n198\n00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.240\nIt is a piece of hardware,\nany kind of mechanical failure.\n\n199\n00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.430\nI mean, there are a lot of moving\ncomponents inside of optical drives.\n\n200\n00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.630\nAnd that's,\nwe're not talking about solid state here.\n\n201\n00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:48.511\nYou're looking at a magnetic optical\ndrive with a spindle we have a lot of\n\n202\n00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:50.060\nthe actuator arm.\n\n203\n00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:54.120\nAll sorts of moving components where\nthere are points of failure potentially.\n\n204\n00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:59.240\nSo, that is a possibility even for just\nthat individual sector to become corrupt.\n\n205\n00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.930\nSo, we're gonna look here at the reason\nI say that, just to give you a visual.\n\n206\n00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.470\nLet's compare the two, all right.\n\n207\n00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.610\nSo, let's not get ahead of ourselves yet,\nwhat we're doing is,\n\n208\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.090\nwe're comparing apples to apples.\n\n209\n00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:19.130\nWe have a basic NBR disk,\nand a basic GPT disk.\n\n210\n00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:23.080\nNow, we can have both NBR,\nbasic work dynamic.\n\n211\n00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.670\nWe can have GPT,\nboth basic work dynamic, but\n\n212\n00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.010\nwe're trying to compare\napples to apples here.\n\n213\n00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:33.580\nSo if we take a look at what we have\navailable with to us with our NBR option,\n\n214\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.740\nour partitioning scheme,\nthis is that master boot code here, and\n\n215\n00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:43.610\nwe see information being stored\nabout potential partition.\n\n216\n00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.780\nAnd that's exactly what we\nwere talking about, right?\n\n217\n00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.555\nSo how many partitions can we have?\n\n218\n00:11:47.555 --> 00:11:49.100\nWell that's a great question, and\n\n219\n00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.840\nit's one that Microsoft might want\nyou to know for the exam, right?\n\n220\n00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.090\nOr anyone talking about MBR.\n\n221\n00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:04.140\nWith your MBR you have the ability to go\nahead and create three primary partitions.\n\n222\n00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:09.350\nNow, one way that you get around\nthat limitation if you wanted\n\n223\n00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:14.610\nto have more partitions is to create\nwhat's called an extended partition,\n\n224\n00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:21.470\nand then you can create logical drives\nwithin that extended partition up to 128.\n\n225\n00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.390\nNow, Cherokee,\ndid you say three partitions on the basic?\n\n226\n00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:24.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I did,\n\n227\n00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.870\nbut thank you for\nkeeping me honest there, Mike,\n\n228\n00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:32.320\nbecause what I meant to say is we\ncan have four primary partitions.\n\n229\n00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.540\nIf we look at our theoretical,\nor, well, our maximums, here.\n\n230\n00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:42.350\nSo if I wanted to max out that particular\ndrive to have as many partitions or\n\n231\n00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:47.630\nlogical units of storage as possible,\nthan the work around to extend or\n\n232\n00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:52.400\nto create multiple storage units,\nwould be to go ahead and\n\n233\n00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.940\nforfeit one of those four\nprimary partitions or\n\n234\n00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:00.470\nan extended partition that would\nthen allow me to go ahead and\n\n235\n00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:05.760\ncreate additional logical drives,\nup to 128 there.\n\n236\n00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.140\nSo.\n\n237\n00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.750\nAnd you can see that here that's what\nthey're referencing this is the MBR,\n\n238\n00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.520\nthe master boot record,\n\n239\n00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.212\nshowing the information about\neach one of those partition.\n\n240\n00:13:15.212 --> 00:13:17.534\nAnd these are just like placeholders and\n\n241\n00:13:17.534 --> 00:13:20.879\nthey show examples of how you\ncould forfeit that fourth for\n\n242\n00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:23.610\nthe third here in this diagram.\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n243\n00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n244\n00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.390\nmaster boot record has been around for\na long time.\n\n245\n00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.068\nIt's actually older than I am-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n246\n00:13:28.068 --> 00:13:30.650\n&gt;&gt; So that's saying a lot, Mike.\n\n247\n00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:31.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I was gonna say,\n\n248\n00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.740\nyou can't say it's older than me,\nI don't think.\n\n249\n00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.760\nBut yeah, It's been around for\na little while.\n\n250\n00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.190\nAnd that's why we see some\nof these limitations, right.\n\n251\n00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.090\nThat master boot record is small.\n\n252\n00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.130\nIt only holds so much data.\n\n253\n00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.285\nThere's only four entry\nspots to hold information.\n\n254\n00:13:44.285 --> 00:13:45.810\nBecause remember, it's storing, okay,\n\n255\n00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.440\nwhere does this partition start,\nwhere does it end.\n\n256\n00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:48.970\nNext entry.\n\n257\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.770\nWhere does the next partition start and\nthere's only four slots in there.\n\n258\n00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:56.600\nWho would have thunk we would need more\nthan four 30 years ago or whenever when\n\n259\n00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.419\nthey decided to develop this.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n260\n00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:00.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n261\n00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.300\n&gt;&gt; 1983 is the year.\n\n262\n00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.340\nYou guys can do the math.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n263\n00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.820\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n264\n00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.300\nSo moving forward, progressing in time,\nlet's just say somewhere around the 90s,\n\n265\n00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.110\nI don't know the exact date\nthat GPT came out, but\n\n266\n00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.930\nit's a lot newer.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-mh.\n\n267\n00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:16.400\n&gt;&gt; And it does have\n\n268\n00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.970\nmore capabilities here.\n\n269\n00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:23.828\nSo, for the most parts, newer Operating\nSystems are gonna be working with GPT.\n\n270\n00:14:23.828 --> 00:14:27.770\nThey are situations where you would want\nlike a backwards compatibility to go ahead\n\n271\n00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.052\nand and choose that but\nwe will take a look at some other\n\n272\n00:14:31.052 --> 00:14:35.100\ndifferent factors that might\ninfluence that decision as well.\n\n273\n00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.070\nLook at the blue here,\non the right-hand column, though.\n\n274\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:47.192\nNotice how for my GPT information\nthe actual good partition entries here,\n\n275\n00:14:47.192 --> 00:14:51.350\nyou see multiple sections where\nthis information is stored,\n\n276\n00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.898\nI'm gonna have to zoom out a little bit,\nwhich the zoom tool that I used today.\n\n277\n00:14:55.898 --> 00:14:57.461\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n278\n00:14:57.461 --> 00:15:01.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But the blue is in, with MBR.\n\n279\n00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.410\nJust in that one little\nsection right up here.\n\n280\n00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:09.750\nThe blue, meaning, any kind of\nconfiguration data information.\n\n281\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.440\nWon't we see multiple portions\nhere on this right hand column.\n\n282\n00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.680\nAnd this is one of the things,\none of the ways that we can\n\n283\n00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:24.540\nactually be redundant and\nhave resiliency within our drives\n\n284\n00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:29.270\nbecause that information is stored in\nmore than just one individual sector.\n\n285\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.880\nSo We're also utilizing CRC or\n\n286\n00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.480\ncyclic redundancy checks\nto help maintain integrity.\n\n287\n00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.470\nSo there really are a lot of different\nreasons why we would choose GPT over MBR.\n\n288\n00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.680\nThat's how I go through\n\n289\n00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.830\nthe majority of the time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n290\n00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:46.604\nIt's really cool and obviously,\n\n291\n00:15:46.604 --> 00:15:50.710\nit was designed to overcome some of\nthe shortcomings, that's not redundant.\n\n292\n00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:51.730\nOf that MBR but\n\n293\n00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:57.091\nyou see things like it still has a fake\nMBR table up there at the beginning and\n\n294\n00:15:57.091 --> 00:16:03.160\nthat's so systems that maybe are designed\nto read GPT or yeah GPT based disks.\n\n295\n00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.880\nCan still see that and find those\npartitions, and that whole redundant.\n\n296\n00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.106\nOne of the problems with MVR disks was\nit was all stored in sector zero, and\n\n297\n00:16:12.106 --> 00:16:18.170\nif that sector became corrupt, we could\nlose access to all the information.\n\n298\n00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:22.920\nWith GPT based disks, that information\nis stored in multiple locations, so\n\n299\n00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.760\nI can lose a copy of it and still get\naccess to those volumes on that drive.\n\n300\n00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.750\nSo, a lot of really cool things they\nadded out of GTP to make up for\n\n301\n00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.330\nit.\n&gt;&gt; To enhance it.\n\n302\n00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you mentioned even before,\n\n303\n00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.030\ntalking about we want more,\nwe want more, with more storage.\n\n304\n00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.920\nAnd if we look at that aspect of it,\n\n305\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.150\nit's really impressive because GPT\nis really designed for scalability.\n\n306\n00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:47.340\nWe are talking up to 198\nprimary partitions, and\n\n307\n00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.450\nalso you can work with volumes up to,\n\n308\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.690\nI think it's like 18 exabytes.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n309\n00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.170\n&gt;&gt; And then if you are looking at\n\n310\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.750\noverall storage in here, what was it?\n\n311\n00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.050\nSupport disks that go up to almost\nzetabytes, so I don't have any hardware.\n\n312\n00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.677\nSo you'll [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n313\n00:17:02.677 --> 00:17:03.643\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so\n\n314\n00:17:03.643 --> 00:17:07.993\nyou are dealing with like the actual\nhardware being that glass ceiling, so\n\n315\n00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:10.560\nto speak, without limiting factor there.\n\n316\n00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.912\nSo, it's pretty cool actually,\n\n317\n00:17:12.912 --> 00:17:16.813\nand if we scroll down,\nwe can just see more factors here.\n\n318\n00:17:16.813 --> 00:17:18.017\nDifferent comparisons,\n\n319\n00:17:18.017 --> 00:17:22.750\nlooking at number of different partitions\nlike we were just talking about there.\n\n320\n00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.479\nLet's see, what else?\n\n321\n00:17:25.479 --> 00:17:27.690\nWhat operating systems can read it?\n\n322\n00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:32.094\nSo, it is important to note here looking\n\n323\n00:17:32.094 --> 00:17:36.890\nat your different 32 bit versus 64 bit.\n\n324\n00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:41.589\nAgain, and VR does go back further, so\nyou'd wanna pay attention to that if you\n\n325\n00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:45.800\nwere working with legacy systems to\nmake sure that you could actually,\n\n326\n00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.616\nyou're making the right decision.\n&gt;&gt; I often need to spin up a copy of\n\n327\n00:17:49.616 --> 00:17:51.159\nWindows 95.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n328\n00:17:51.159 --> 00:17:53.004\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I found a Windows 98\n\n329\n00:17:53.004 --> 00:17:54.374\nFloppy Disk.\n&gt;&gt; Did you?\n\n330\n00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:55.598\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna bring it in for show and\n\n331\n00:17:55.598 --> 00:17:57.557\ntell, when I was cleaning\nthe other weekend [LAUGH]-\n\n332\n00:17:57.557 --> 00:17:58.532\n&gt;&gt; You really should.\n\n333\n00:17:58.532 --> 00:17:59.982\nWe could make a VM out of that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n334\n00:17:59.982 --> 00:18:01.977\n&gt;&gt; I mean, a little segway from our show,\n\n335\n00:18:01.977 --> 00:18:04.580\nI have definitely installed\nthose OSs sometimes,\n\n336\n00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.645\njust to listen to the start of music and\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n337\n00:18:06.645 --> 00:18:07.621\nstuff like that.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n338\n00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:08.753\n&gt;&gt; You remember what it sounded\n\n339\n00:18:08.753 --> 00:18:11.630\nlike in Windows 98?\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember the startup music,\n\n340\n00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.989\nit's been a while.\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, [CROSSTALK].\n\n341\n00:18:14.989 --> 00:18:17.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Anyway, yeah,\n\n342\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.438\nand I mean, again, just looking.\n\n343\n00:18:20.438 --> 00:18:23.703\nOkay, and\nalso notice here how it says maximum size,\n\n344\n00:18:23.703 --> 00:18:26.690\na basic volume, so\nwe have a two terabyte limit.\n\n345\n00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.180\nSo we will look at the differences\nbetween basic volume versus dynamic\n\n346\n00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.390\nvolume as well.\n\n347\n00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.550\nAnything else here.\n\n348\n00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.530\nI'm going to ahead and\nput this information in the shown up so\n\n349\n00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.830\nyou guys can look through.\n\n350\n00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.160\nI think it's a good start on\nthe difference between NBR and\n\n351\n00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.890\nGPT there.\n&gt;&gt; Okay so\n\n352\n00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.150\nwhat else do we need to\ntake a look at next?\n\n353\n00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:55.120\nHow about we go back to be sick and\ndynamic where we started before?\n\n354\n00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.650\nLet's go back here to my screen,\nbasic disks versus dynamic disks.\n\n355\n00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.360\nBasic are just how they sound, basic.\n\n356\n00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.630\nYour partitions and volumes and remember\nI said partitions are gonna be our\n\n357\n00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:13.330\nprevolume logical units of storage\njust before we can figure them out.\n\n358\n00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.020\nWe can call them partitions for\nthis particular context.\n\n359\n00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.630\nThey're confined with a single disk and\n\n360\n00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:25.050\nI'll just say look if they're going to\nbe creating volumes that extent across\n\n361\n00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.780\nmore than one physical disk\n&gt;&gt; then they graduate from basic disks\n\n362\n00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.220\ninto dynamic disks.\n\n363\n00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.160\nSo just to clarify here\non the terminology.\n\n364\n00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.500\nThat's why I'm trying to break it down for\nyou guys because you will have this option\n\n365\n00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.430\nwhen we get into the OS and\nwe'll see that.\n\n366\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.150\nAgain, backwards compatibility.\n\n367\n00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:46.380\nThat would be one of the reasons\nwhy we wanna keep it simple.\n\n368\n00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.010\nThey have that kiss there for\na reason, right.\n\n369\n00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.530\nAgain, going back to our partitions there.\n\n370\n00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.920\nIt does not provide integrated\nsoftware resilience to damage.\n\n371\n00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.190\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, that makes sense.\n\n372\n00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:02.620\nWe see the difference between MBR GPT.\n\n373\n00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.780\nYou also mentioned I've got basic and\ndynamic.\n\n374\n00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.350\nAnd that can be either NBR or\n\n375\n00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:12.970\nGPT so how does that fit in?\n&gt;&gt; Right so if we look at functions here,\n\n376\n00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:17.910\nbasic disks are limited in what they\ncan do because they're basic right?\n\n377\n00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:22.290\nSo you can base [LAUGH]\nbasically you can create and\n\n378\n00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:27.160\ndelete primary and extended partitions,\nwe'll look at this and get in there.\n\n379\n00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.600\nPull up our sleeves and\nstart to work with that.\n\n380\n00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.430\nWe can also create and delete logical\ndrives within an extended partition.\n\n381\n00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.030\nAnd we can also format a partition and\nmark it as active.\n\n382\n00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:41.080\nSo there's not too much\nthat we can do with those.\n\n383\n00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.650\nSo when we compare basic to dynamic,\n\n384\n00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.290\nthat's where we'll really\nsee the difference.\n\n385\n00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.880\nAnd here,\nlet's just take a look at that here.\n\n386\n00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.180\nAnd even on this particular screen\nwe can see there's a lot more there,\n\n387\n00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.655\nexpanded functionalities with multiple\ndisks, and it can be composed of a set of\n\n388\n00:20:57.655 --> 00:21:03.060\nnon-continuous spaces or multiple\nphysical disks, so non-contiguous.\n\n389\n00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.360\nSo if we think about that basic,\nwhenever we write to that disk,\n\n390\n00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.590\nwe're just growing and storing that and\nutilizing that storage space.\n\n391\n00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.480\nTouching, what's another word for that?\n\n392\n00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.110\nI don't know.\n\n393\n00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.330\nFilling it in, right.\n&gt;&gt; Contigeous.\n\n394\n00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.805\n&gt;&gt; Conigeius, exactly.\n\n395\n00:21:17.805 --> 00:21:22.310\n[LAUGH] So with our dynamic\ndisks we have the ability to\n\n396\n00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:25.110\nmanipulate that a little bit and\nso that's whatw e willl look at.\n\n397\n00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:28.720\nAlso Integrated damage resistance.\n\n398\n00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.590\nWell how does that happen, right?\n\n399\n00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:35.290\nThere's actually extra information\non the physical drive itself.\n\n400\n00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:39.060\nA little tiny database that\nstores information about\n\n401\n00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.700\nall dynamic disks in the computer.\n\n402\n00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.480\nThat's pretty awesome because\nif that disk fails there is\n\n403\n00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.890\na replica of that database elsewhere so we\nhave some resiliency there, pretty coll.\n\n404\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.250\nAll right.\n\n405\n00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.990\nI did mentioned this the word,\nI remember the word Mike.\n\n406\n00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.590\nIt didn't start with a c it\nstarted with a d, do you remember?\n\n407\n00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.330\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; Deprecated.\n\n408\n00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:06.370\n&gt;&gt; Deprecated.\n\n409\n00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:06.910\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n410\n00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:11.190\nhere storage spaces will\nreplace dynamic disk.\n\n411\n00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:16.420\nSo while they are currently still and\noption within the operating system.\n\n412\n00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.920\nThey are going to be deprecate.\n\n413\n00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.120\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n414\n00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:23.790\nThis is kind of crazy.\n\n415\n00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:30.190\nYou can have up to 2,000\ndynamic volumes I should say.\n\n416\n00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.890\nHowever 32 is going to be\nthe maximum recommendation there.\n\n417\n00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:39.520\nAnd, let me just say also when\nyou hear the term dynamic volume,\n\n418\n00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.900\nyou're simply referencing\na volume on a dynamic disk, okay.\n\n419\n00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.850\nYou can We won't get into the details\nthere like I said there's a lot with\n\n420\n00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.330\nthe terminology but\njust for now in our context\n\n421\n00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:55.330\nvolume disk you can have a dynamic\nvolume there, all right, okay.\n\n422\n00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.450\nAll right, functions include creating and\n\n423\n00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:02.810\ndeleting simple, spammed, striped,\nmirrored and RAID 5 volumes.\n\n424\n00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:08.630\nYou know what let me change that because\nwhat happened with our RAID five options,\n\n425\n00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:09.440\nMike.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n426\n00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.460\nWe're there.\nYou're taking them away from us?\n\n427\n00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.095\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I am.\n\n428\n00:23:12.095 --> 00:23:15.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not in the client operating system.\n\n429\n00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.210\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n430\n00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:20.360\nSo it's not, so this information\nwould be true currently for\n\n431\n00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.240\nyour server side operating systems.\n\n432\n00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:29.470\nBut here in Windows ten, they've already\nstole that little portion of option for\n\n433\n00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.670\nus because they want you to go ahead and\nreplace that with storage spaces.\n\n434\n00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.650\nSo they're kind forcing that upon you.\n\n435\n00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:38.470\nHowever, hardware RAID configurations\nare still gonna be supported but\n\n436\n00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:42.450\nthat would be with third party hardware.\n\n437\n00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:43.800\nAnyone like, yeah.\n\n438\n00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.220\nOkay.\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n439\n00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.840\nFunctions include, you can create and\n\n440\n00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:51.330\ndelete simple span striped mirror\nYou can extend a simple or\n\n441\n00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:54.750\nspanned volume and again we're gonna\nbe looking at all this throughout.\n\n442\n00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.380\nYou can remove a mirror\nfrom a mirrored volume or\n\n443\n00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.450\neven break that mirrored\nvolume into two volumes.\n\n444\n00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:04.710\nI know it's kind of behind my head but\nI'm just telling you what that says there.\n\n445\n00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:08.170\nAnd then you could also reactive\na missing or offline disk.\n\n446\n00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.690\nAnd we do have a entire section on\njust on troubleshooting disks because.\n\n447\n00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:14.840\nStuff happens, right.\n&gt;&gt; So really then,\n\n448\n00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.640\nit looks like when it comes down to it,\nMBR and GPT are defining\n\n449\n00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.680\nhow i'm storing information\nabout the disk itself and\n\n450\n00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.660\nthe volumes that we're creating\n&gt;&gt; And then basic and\n\n451\n00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.130\ndynamic is, what kind of volumes\nI can create on those disks.\n\n452\n00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you can mix and match.\n\n453\n00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:33.850\nLike I said it's not.\n\n454\n00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.870\nSo that's why I'm saying,\nit's like a car dealership.\n\n455\n00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.230\nYou have lots of options here.\n\n456\n00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.670\nSo understanding your options\nwill help you make the best\n\n457\n00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:40.610\ndecision.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n458\n00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.580\n&gt;&gt; So if we look at both those dynamic and\n\n459\n00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.740\nour basic disk, we do see some\nof those commonalities, right?\n\n460\n00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:51.420\nSo we can choose MBR, we can also check,\nand there is a lot of text on the screen,\n\n461\n00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.792\nbut basically it's a lot of information.\n\n462\n00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:57.863\nYou can disorient information from\nthe graphical user interface as well as\n\n463\n00:24:57.863 --> 00:25:02.323\ncommand line interface utilities within\nthe operating system about both types of\n\n464\n00:25:02.323 --> 00:25:07.319\ndisks, including, partition properties,\noffset, length type, and boot potential.\n\n465\n00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:10.390\nThere is a lot here,\njust knowing we can go ahead and\n\n466\n00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:14.259\nextract that information,\nlike those are the commonalities.\n\n467\n00:25:14.259 --> 00:25:17.744\nBasically, this is a good point here,\n\n468\n00:25:17.744 --> 00:25:23.410\nyou need to have that little let me\nzoom in our full screen, there we go.\n\n469\n00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:29.340\nRight here is where I'm really trying to\nfocusing on And, whenever we're talking\n\n470\n00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.030\nabout our dynamic disks that, a little\ntiny baby database that I mentioned?\n\n471\n00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:36.150\nWell, guess what,\nit's going to be taking up 1 MB of space.\n\n472\n00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:42.260\nSo, that is something to keep Keep in mind\nnormally who cares that it's 1 MB, right?\n\n473\n00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:46.580\nBut if any kind of conversion is happening\nyou do need to account for that just to\n\n474\n00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.860\nmake sure you do have enough space there\nso I just want to keep that in mind.\n\n475\n00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.810\nCuz it's a little, tiny portion\nthose need to be accounted for.\n\n476\n00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.060\nOkay, Mike, so what do you think?\n\n477\n00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.240\nDo we have time to look at\nour different types of raids,\n\n478\n00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.620\nor?\n&gt;&gt; Probably not, probably not, cuz I know\n\n479\n00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.370\nwe've got to talk about one if not two of\nthem of the many types of raid there are,\n\n480\n00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:07.420\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n481\n00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what,\n\n482\n00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:12.250\nlet's stop there, kind of give us a chance\nto digest all of that information we just\n\n483\n00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:17.140\nreceived about MBR, master boot record,\nand GPT, that gooey partition table.\n\n484\n00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.160\nWe take a look at basic.\n\n485\n00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.050\nAnd dynamic disks,\nwe'll chew on that for a little bit.\n\n486\n00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.490\nWe come back and we'll talk about rates.\n\n487\n00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:25.530\nSounds like a plan?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n488\n00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.710\nthat sounds great because we have\nto look at that moving forward.\n\n489\n00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:29.690\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n490\n00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:31.320\nI hope everybody enjoyed\nwatching this one.\n\n491\n00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.070\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n492\n00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.960\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:32.322\nWe did talk a lot in that last show,\nbut we're not quite done,\n\n12\n00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:35.561\nwe're just getting started\non our storage journey here,\n\n13\n00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:38.142\nso, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We did talk about types of partitioning\n\n14\n00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:39.337\nschemes, we saw that.\n\n15\n00:00:39.337 --> 00:00:42.810\nWe had NBR and GPT, and\nthen we talked about types of disks.\n\n16\n00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.038\nWe looked at basic and dynamic,\nwhat's next on our plate?\n\n17\n00:00:47.038 --> 00:00:47.916\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike,\n\n18\n00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:52.314\nI think that's a great place to pick\nup from, because I did say that with\n\n19\n00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:57.250\nour dynamic disks we had extra\nfeatures that basic disks do not have.\n\n20\n00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.829\nSo why don't we take a moment in time and\ntravel back in time?\n\n21\n00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.264\nWell, I guess that's a bad analogy\nbecause RAID configurations\n\n22\n00:01:06.264 --> 00:01:09.324\nare still in use.\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n23\n00:01:09.324 --> 00:01:09.897\n&gt;&gt; Only, and\n\n24\n00:01:09.897 --> 00:01:13.215\nMicrosoft are they phasing\nout software based RAID.\n\n25\n00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:15.779\nWell, actually brings up\na good point because, well,\n\n26\n00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:19.014\nwhat's the difference between\na hardware RAID and a software RAIDd?\n\n27\n00:01:19.014 --> 00:01:22.003\nSo here,\nthis is a Windows 10 class or show.\n\n28\n00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:26.080\nWe're talking about Windows 10,\nwhich is software.\n\n29\n00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.867\nIf you're taking a look at rate\nconfigurations in a hardware capacity or\n\n30\n00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:33.616\naspect, you get a rate controller card.\n\n31\n00:01:33.616 --> 00:01:35.967\nSo they're just like, I don't know,\n\n32\n00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:40.720\nthey look just like any kind of graphics\ncard or network interface card.\n\n33\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.020\nAnd so those RAID controller\ncards are handling the way that\n\n34\n00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.893\nyour operating system can\ndeal with multiple disks.\n\n35\n00:01:48.893 --> 00:01:53.201\nAnd we utilize RAID redundant\narray of independent or\n\n36\n00:01:53.201 --> 00:02:00.020\ninexpensive disks to go ahead and\ncreate well redundancy, hence the name.\n\n37\n00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.642\nI think it's really a great,\na great thing,\n\n38\n00:02:03.642 --> 00:02:08.988\nit definitely has saved me in\nbusiness environments a time or too.\n\n39\n00:02:08.988 --> 00:02:12.088\nWhere hardware raids are always, well I,\n\n40\n00:02:12.088 --> 00:02:18.029\nhardware RAIDs at this moment in time and\nin the past outperforms software RAIDs,\n\n41\n00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.580\nbut who knows in the future\nhow that's gonna go?\n\n42\n00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.765\nBecause we see storage spaces really\nreplacing our RAID configurations\n\n43\n00:02:26.765 --> 00:02:31.695\nhere with the advent of like a mixture\nof utilizing solid state drives\n\n44\n00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:35.783\nthat have operating system\nhandles that read and write.\n\n45\n00:02:35.783 --> 00:02:40.894\nSo we're gonna cover them, but then I\nwant you to remember these ideas and\n\n46\n00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.381\nconcepts as we're looking how to.\n\n47\n00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:47.918\nWe're gonna be graduating here, we're\ngonna take this information, our RAID\n\n48\n00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:52.534\nconfigurations, compare it to dynamic\ndisk, dynamic volume configurations.\n\n49\n00:02:52.534 --> 00:02:57.220\nAnd then, eventually, we'll get to\ntake a look at our storage spaces and\n\n50\n00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.540\nsee how those are gonna be replacing\nsimilar configurations here.\n\n51\n00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.250\nSo just different ways, kind of through\nthat storage evolution, if you will.\n\n52\n00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.270\nSo, the first one I wanted\nto take a look at here,\n\n53\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.164\nlet's just think about RAID 0 for\nstriping.\n\n54\n00:03:12.164 --> 00:03:17.160\nSo, with RAID 0 configurations, you\nhave to have two or more physical disks.\n\n55\n00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.469\nAnd if you can't tell,\nthese cylinders here are my disks, and\n\n56\n00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:25.877\nthis is just a very, very generic\nway of explaining this to you.\n\n57\n00:03:25.877 --> 00:03:28.890\nThere's a lot involved\nwith our algorithms for\n\n58\n00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.360\nhow the information is being\nwritten to these drives.\n\n59\n00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.679\nBut let's just say I have a file,\nand I'm going to go ahead and\n\n60\n00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:39.600\nstore this information to these drives.\n\n61\n00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.430\nSo I have, maybe,\nI don't know, a Word document.\n\n62\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.762\nAnd depending on the size of that file,\nso here I go, I have one portion of that\n\n63\n00:03:46.762 --> 00:03:50.442\nWord document going to this drive,\nthis drive, and this drive.\n\n64\n00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:54.040\nSo it's like writing at a very rapid rate.\n\n65\n00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.189\nBut the problem is that my Word document\nis spread out amongst multiple drives.\n\n66\n00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:05.196\nSo if I have a hardware failure on one\nof these three drives then that Word\n\n67\n00:04:05.196 --> 00:04:10.287\ndocument would be inaccessible because\nI only have a portion of that Word\n\n68\n00:04:10.287 --> 00:04:15.283\ndocument available, if that makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're gonna get right\n\n69\n00:04:15.283 --> 00:04:19.724\nbenefits or a performance boost when it\ncomes to right cuz we're spreading the IO,\n\n70\n00:04:19.724 --> 00:04:22.525\nthe disk input output across\nthree physical disks.\n\n71\n00:04:22.525 --> 00:04:25.440\nBut we also increase\nour points of failure.\n\n72\n00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.248\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n73\n00:04:26.248 --> 00:04:30.729\nwe're gonna be taking a look at these and\nthen keep them in your mind, and\n\n74\n00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.264\nas we move forward,\nI want you guys to think back at this.\n\n75\n00:04:34.264 --> 00:04:39.320\nSo here we're just striping,\nis the terminology that's used more\n\n76\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.629\npretty commonly, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Cherokee, one of our viewers out\n\n77\n00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:48.058\nthere, Jim says RAID 0, aka Scary RAID.\n&gt;&gt; It is scary,\n\n78\n00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:48.773\nMike.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n79\n00:04:48.773 --> 00:04:50.702\n&gt;&gt; I mean if we think about it we don't\n\n80\n00:04:50.702 --> 00:04:52.770\nhave any redundancy there.\n\n81\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.969\nSo, if we do lose that disk and\nwe lose that data as well.\n\n82\n00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:01.760\nAnd even moving forward,\nwe don't cover it too much in 698 here.\n\n83\n00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.665\nBut if you'll look at some server classes,\n\n84\n00:05:04.665 --> 00:05:09.219\nand even with some of those storage\nspace options, you still see some\n\n85\n00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:13.710\nof that scary misfactor, but\nthere are certain use cases for that.\n\n86\n00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.964\nFor instance, if you do take\na look at those newer options and\n\n87\n00:05:18.964 --> 00:05:24.320\nthink about this, files that\ndon't require a lot of reads and\n\n88\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.840\nwrites, maybe files that stay static.\n\n89\n00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.304\nSo if you have maybe your Netflix and you\nhave a catalog of all these video files.\n\n90\n00:05:32.304 --> 00:05:35.476\nVideo files are great for\nsomething like this because you have\n\n91\n00:05:35.476 --> 00:05:38.840\nthat faster write performance\nif you're looking to store them.\n\n92\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.268\nMaybe if you run like corporate\nbackups once a day or a week or\n\n93\n00:05:43.268 --> 00:05:46.636\nsomething where those\nfiles are remaining in\n\n94\n00:05:46.636 --> 00:05:51.400\na static, Tight-\n&gt;&gt; Not a lot of changes.\n\n95\n00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.091\n&gt;&gt; Not a lot of changes.\n\n96\n00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:56.120\nBut for corporations, or\ndata that has rapid reads and writes,\n\n97\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.590\na lot of changes, this is super scary.\n\n98\n00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.792\nTo me anyways.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n99\n00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:04.798\nI've always thought this is a type of\nRAID 0 I would use when performance\n\n100\n00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:09.410\nis my key motivating factor, and\nI'm not worried about the data.\n\n101\n00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.880\nThe data is replaceable or I can-\n&gt;&gt; I have a backup copy and\n\n102\n00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.732\nI can just bring that down there.\n&gt;&gt; I've seen this done in SQL\n\n103\n00:06:16.732 --> 00:06:19.949\nservers with a page file,\nwhere a page file is temporary memory.\n\n104\n00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.954\nIt doesn't matter if I lose that\ninformation, but I take two drives and\n\n105\n00:06:23.954 --> 00:06:28.225\nI stripe them together, I can get some\nreally good write speed going on, and\n\n106\n00:06:28.225 --> 00:06:30.379\nit can help.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it can.\n\n107\n00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:34.623\nAll right, so Mike, what if we\nare concerned with having that extra\n\n108\n00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:36.302\nredundancy-\n&gt;&gt; Then let's not do RAID 0.\n\n109\n00:06:36.302 --> 00:06:37.016\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n110\n00:06:37.016 --> 00:06:38.000\n&gt;&gt; So let's find another RAID.\n\n111\n00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.798\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well,\n\n112\n00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:41.137\nthe good news is I have another RAID here.\n\n113\n00:06:41.137 --> 00:06:42.662\nSo, of course there are a lot or\n\n114\n00:06:42.662 --> 00:06:46.260\nother types of RAID configurations\nthat I'm not covering in this show.\n\n115\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.542\nBut these are the ones that correlate or\n\n116\n00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:52.567\nkind of bridge on over to the concepts\nthat we are gonna be looking at.\n\n117\n00:06:52.567 --> 00:06:54.143\nSo, RAID1 or mirroring,\n\n118\n00:06:54.143 --> 00:06:58.940\nand again there are lots of different\nways you can configure your mirroring.\n\n119\n00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.366\nObviously, the more physical disks,\nthe more duplicate copies you have,\n\n120\n00:07:04.366 --> 00:07:08.365\nthen the safer,\nless scary that situation can become.\n\n121\n00:07:08.365 --> 00:07:13.604\nHowever, with this particular\nsituation I have two physical disks,\n\n122\n00:07:13.604 --> 00:07:16.470\nso this is a two-way mirroring here.\n\n123\n00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.151\nI have something that's\ncalled 50% efficiency.\n\n124\n00:07:18.151 --> 00:07:24.120\nAnd if you think about that,\ntheir really, terminology is utilization.\n\n125\n00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.647\nSo I'm paying for\ntwo physical hard disks and drives but\n\n126\n00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:28.163\nI'm really only utilizing one.\n\n127\n00:07:28.163 --> 00:07:32.472\nOne is like my fail-safe mechanism there.\n\n128\n00:07:32.472 --> 00:07:35.634\nIn case something does\nhappen to that first disk.\n\n129\n00:07:35.634 --> 00:07:40.242\nI'm not giving any kind of performance\nincrease with this configuration,\n\n130\n00:07:40.242 --> 00:07:43.925\nregular read and write functions,\njust exact duplicates.\n\n131\n00:07:43.925 --> 00:07:48.634\nSo, that's where you can seem,\nlike maybe that file being written here,\n\n132\n00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:51.341\nhere, and other file being written here.\n\n133\n00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:55.185\nAnd of course in the block sizes,\naccordingly, but just showing the numbers\n\n134\n00:07:55.185 --> 00:07:58.779\nto kind of solidify the concepts.\n&gt;&gt; So you have an exact copy of your data.\n\n135\n00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:02.060\nIf one disk fails, the other disk holds\na copy of it and you're good to go.\n\n136\n00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.824\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\n\n137\n00:08:02.824 --> 00:08:06.000\nYou have to think about cost here.\n\n138\n00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.540\nSo depending on how many mirrors or\ndiscs that you do have configured.\n\n139\n00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.630\nBut that's the general concept.\n\n140\n00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.400\nOkay.\n\n141\n00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.310\nAnd then, this is my favorite and\nagain this is just a very\n\n142\n00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.240\nbasic representation of what\na RAID 5 with Parity is.\n\n143\n00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.600\nSo, striping like we saw with our RAID 0.\n\n144\n00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.380\nBut here,\n\n145\n00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.220\nwe're taking into the next level we're\nalso adding something called a parity bit.\n\n146\n00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.910\nSo every third bit that is written,\nthere's a bit being utilized\n\n147\n00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:39.750\nin an algorithm to store information for\nduplications.\n\n148\n00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:44.890\nSo let's say this is drive A,\nthis is drive B and this is drive C.\n\n149\n00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:50.860\nIf I have a mechanical failure,\nphysical hardware failure on drive C, then\n\n150\n00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.940\nthis parity bit, one of the other\nparity bits or portions of that drive.\n\n151\n00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.480\nSo, essentially one-third of my drive is\nbeing utilized for parity information.\n\n152\n00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:06.200\nSo, I do have a reduction\nin efficiency as well, and\n\n153\n00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.580\nagain that depends on how many drives you\nhave set up in your RAID configuration,\n\n154\n00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.250\nbecause with this example\nI just have three.\n\n155\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.800\nAnd let it be noted,\nyou have to have at least minimum of\n\n156\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.290\nthree because the parity uses\nat least one third there.\n\n157\n00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.800\nAnd, also with mirroring like you\nhave to have a minimum of two drives.\n\n158\n00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.980\nSo, common sense does come into play here.\n\n159\n00:09:28.748 --> 00:09:31.700\nWe're not like running\nthese configurations\n\n160\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.580\nacross virtual hard disk drive,\nor something like that.\n\n161\n00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.670\nWe're actually running them\non physical drives here.\n\n162\n00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.930\nSo, if the drive fails,\nI love RAID 5 configurations,\n\n163\n00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.110\nbecause you can take a new hard drive,\nplug it into that machine.\n\n164\n00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:53.040\nAnd I tell you, remove the correct one,\nbecause if you remove the incorrect\n\n165\n00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.710\ndrive, then you've lost\neverything in that situation.\n\n166\n00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.640\nSo that's a big caveat there but as long\nas you know which drive has failed you\n\n167\n00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:07.340\nremove the correct drive, you plug the new\ndrive in, that parity bit will take care\n\n168\n00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:13.275\nof rebuilding that third drive in this\nconfiguration so that your data is intact,\n\n169\n00:10:13.275 --> 00:10:18.152\nit's remain, so yeah, pretty cool RAID 5.\n&gt;&gt; That is nice.\n\n170\n00:10:18.152 --> 00:10:23.280\nYou get not quite the same performance\nbenefits from doing a stripe but\n\n171\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.810\nwe get that redundancy, very good.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah now this is a lot, I understand\n\n172\n00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.620\nwe are still making our way here to\nactually getting in the operating system.\n\n173\n00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.068\nBut Mike there is one other option that\nI wanted to spend some time on and\n\n174\n00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:38.870\nthat is file systems\nbecause when we're working.\n\n175\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.980\nTo set up our drives and volumes.\n\n176\n00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.880\nWe're gonna have the option\nto choose a file system.\n\n177\n00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.680\nAnd maybe we don't know\nwhat file systems are and\n\n178\n00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.810\nwe need to take a look at those here.\n\n179\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.618\nSo on my screen I have several.\n\n180\n00:10:50.618 --> 00:10:56.050\nAnd oops,\n[LAUGH] I actually have duplications here.\n\n181\n00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.090\nGive me one second.\n\n182\n00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.530\nLet me just get rid of some of this.\n\n183\n00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.040\nI think the information is the same.\n\n184\n00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.710\nWe're not missing anything there.\n\n185\n00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.880\nI just had NTFS noted twice,\nbut we don't need all of that.\n\n186\n00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:14.180\nAll right, so starting over here in\nthe left hand top corner, I have FAT.\n\n187\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.200\nIt's actually FAT 16 it's kind of crazy.\n\n188\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.640\nThis is a FAT 12 but\nit comes from like 1960s.\n\n189\n00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.010\nAnd as a matter of fact, FAT or\nFAT 16 has been around for a long time,\n\n190\n00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.290\nearly 80s as well.\n\n191\n00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:30.220\nSo we're talking old, antiquated,\nwe don't wanna be using FAT or\n\n192\n00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.520\nFAT 16 in our operating systems.\n\n193\n00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.548\nI mean, maybe you do for\nsome reason but I don't.\n\n194\n00:11:35.548 --> 00:11:36.099\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n195\n00:11:36.099 --> 00:11:39.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's just a basic file system.\n\n196\n00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.600\nYou have a maximum and I don't know\nif I need to zoom it a little bit.\n\n197\n00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.240\nYeah, let's just do that.\n\n198\n00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.780\nYou have a maximum volume size of\n4GB with that FAT file system.\n\n199\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:54.410\nFile size limit of 2 gigs and\nit does not protect any files or folders.\n\n200\n00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.270\nNow, building upon that FAT architecture,\n\n201\n00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.690\nwe're gonna be looking at FAT 32,\nwhich was an improvement.\n\n202\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:08.900\nIt is still out there being utilized,\nit's Windows 95 Service Pack 2 and later.\n\n203\n00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.090\nSo if you had machines older than that.\n\n204\n00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.430\nAnd I know we were kind of\njoking about that Mike.\n\n205\n00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.670\nBut maybe you are working in\nthe older systems, hopefully not.\n\n206\n00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.850\nBut just knowing where that\nline in the sand is drawn might\n\n207\n00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.190\nlimit you as to what type of\nfile system you can choose.\n\n208\n00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:31.410\nSo just keeping that in mind,\nfile size limit of 4 gigs,\n\n209\n00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:36.810\nmax volume size of 32 gigs,\nexFat is a variation,\n\n210\n00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:41.875\nexFat is something that we see for\nour multimedia devices here.\n\n211\n00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:44.550\nAnd let me just pull that up so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n212\n00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:45.450\nAll right.\n\n213\n00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:46.950\nSo where do we see exFAT?\n\n214\n00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.400\nExFAT, most, like if we're using\nremovable media, maybe a flash drive.\n\n215\n00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.540\nSo that's going to be helpful.\n\n216\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.820\nAnd we'll see, we'll also take a look at\nremovable media when we're talking about\n\n217\n00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.920\nour disks in disk management and\n\n218\n00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.770\nother utilities because they\nare still disk, right so.\n\n219\n00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:10.465\nNTFS is going to be the most common\nespecially because we are dealing\n\n220\n00:13:10.465 --> 00:13:14.600\nwith Windows Environments and\nthat's really what we see here.\n\n221\n00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.640\nNTFS currently at the time of this\n\n222\n00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.560\nrecording offers the most\nfunctionality for a file system.\n\n223\n00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:28.650\nSo if we look at the max volume\nsize we have 256 terabytes.\n\n224\n00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.690\nSo that's pretty awesome there.\n\n225\n00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:36.108\nTaking a look just, and that's why also\nI wanted to show you some of those older\n\n226\n00:13:36.108 --> 00:13:41.170\nones because making these improvements and\nthese advancements is pretty impressive.\n\n227\n00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.250\nThere are some, there are a lot of\nother types of file systems and\n\n228\n00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.950\nI'll show you where we can look at that.\n\n229\n00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.150\nThe ones that are even utilized here\nby our Windows operating systems.\n\n230\n00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.100\nThese are just the most common ones that\nwe'll be working with here in our disk\n\n231\n00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:52.660\nmanagement.\n\n232\n00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:54.740\nAll right.\n\n233\n00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.960\nThis is kind of crazy guys.\n\n234\n00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:04.145\nWe have a theoretical limit of 16 EB for\nour file sizes and wow.\n\n235\n00:14:04.145 --> 00:14:06.366\nI can't even.\n&gt;&gt; That's a big VHD.\n\n236\n00:14:06.366 --> 00:14:09.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't even know, Mike.\n\n237\n00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.110\nThat's a lot.\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of data.\n\n238\n00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.780\n&gt;&gt; But you know what,\n\n239\n00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.910\nwe might come to that point in time.\n\n240\n00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.430\nAnd people might be laughing that\nI even said that it was a lot.\n\n241\n00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.975\nWho knows?\n\n242\n00:14:18.975 --> 00:14:24.480\n[LAUGH] But NTFS includes metadata,\nall sorts of information\n\n243\n00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:30.280\nthat we can use for indexing and looking\nat ownership and all sorts of good things.\n\n244\n00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.060\nWe also have the ability to perform\ninspections on that actual disk.\n\n245\n00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:39.830\nWe can run like check disk and\nwe have kind of an intuitive, we have\n\n246\n00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:45.640\nadvancements that we didn't see prior,\nso any kind of management aspects there.\n\n247\n00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.520\nWe can also set disk quotas with NTFS.\n\n248\n00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.500\nSo if we wanted to go ahead and\nlimit how that storage was being utilized,\n\n249\n00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.360\nwe have that ability integrated, nothing\nthat we additionally have to install or\n\n250\n00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.180\ndownload there.\n\n251\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:02.190\nYou can implement security\nthrough the use of our ACLs.\n\n252\n00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.240\nSo that's definitely\n\n253\n00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.250\nsomething that is appreciated here\nwithin our Operating Systems,\n\n254\n00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:13.515\njust to have the ability to go ahead and\npick and chose who can access what?\n\n255\n00:15:13.515 --> 00:15:14.580\nNatively and\n\n256\n00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.570\nwithout again having to download any\nthird party software or anything.\n\n257\n00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.110\nWe also have the option with\nNTFS file systems to encrypt.\n\n258\n00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.630\nSo there's a subset\nfile system called EFS.\n\n259\n00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.910\nFor encrypting file system that\nwill allow that encryption to occur\n\n260\n00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.310\nat that level as well as compression.\n\n261\n00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:40.690\nSo, these are options,\nthey don't have to be used or enabled but\n\n262\n00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.970\nat least we do know that\nthey're available there for us.\n\n263\n00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:49.119\nWe do have some type of self\nhealing capabilities but\n\n264\n00:15:49.119 --> 00:15:54.860\nnot to the extent where we,\npeople really want them to be.\n\n265\n00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:59.000\nSo we'll take a look at that in a moment,\nsome other options available.\n\n266\n00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.740\nThis is kind of interesting.\n\n267\n00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.500\nI don't know if you've\never thought about this.\n\n268\n00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.009\nHonestly it's not something\nthat a lot of people do, but\n\n269\n00:16:06.009 --> 00:16:10.468\nyou do have character limit of 255\ncharacters for file name and path,\n\n270\n00:16:10.468 --> 00:16:13.200\nwhich I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; I've run into that actually.\n\n271\n00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.160\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say because some\n\n272\n00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.490\nof the files that we deal with.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n273\n00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:17.430\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah really easy to do and\n\n280\n00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.054\nall they said you can move a file or\n\n281\n00:16:38.054 --> 00:16:42.670\nit gives you an error because the overall\npath names a C column back slash.\n\n282\n00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.740\nLong folder, backslash,\nlong folder name, backslash,\n\n283\n00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.560\nlong file name is over 255 characters,\nand it's not allowed, right?\n\n284\n00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.770\nIt violates the rules or it's unsupported.\n&gt;&gt;

Not\n\n294\n00:17:07.155 --> 00:17:07.800\nanymore.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n295\n00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:13.945\nI don't have the, goodness, I don't have\nthe amount or the file names on here.\n\n296\n00:17:13.945 --> 00:17:16.580\nI must have typed it but It's a lot.\n\n297\n00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.060\nLike, it's more than I would\never even want to type.\n\n298\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.030\nBut again, who knows?\n\n299\n00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:25.040\nMaybe in ten years, people will be\nscoffing at the fact that I said that,\n\n300\n00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.528\ni don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]-\n\n301\n00:17:26.528 --> 00:17:28.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I thought I had the number,\n\n302\n00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.435\nbut I definitely don't remember\nit at this point in time.\n\n303\n00:17:31.435 --> 00:17:32.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.630\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at some other cool\n\n305\n00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.090\nthings about ReFS.\n\n306\n00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:40.060\nReFS, overall is pretty awesome.\n\n307\n00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.730\nThere are some limitations and reason\nbeing, i'm just trying to move this so\n\n308\n00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.330\nwe can see everything there, perfect.\n\n309\n00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:50.120\nOkay, the reason being is it's newer,\nit's our newest operating system\n\n310\n00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.930\nhere in our Windows environment,\nso it's still being worked on.\n\n311\n00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.398\nSome of this information\nmay change later on, and so\n\n312\n00:17:57.398 --> 00:18:01.127\nif you're like hey that's not how ReF\nworks, you've got to think about when this\n\n313\n00:18:01.127 --> 00:18:04.120\nvideo was recorded because that's\ncurrently how it's set now.\n\n314\n00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:09.359\nSo ReFS is backwards compatible with NTFS.\n\n315\n00:18:09.359 --> 00:18:13.600\nWe have increased data verification and\nerror correction.\n\n316\n00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.410\nSupports larger files,\ndirectories and volumes.\n\n317\n00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:22.620\nAnd again, I don't have the numbers here,\nbut it's crazy.\n\n318\n00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.501\nThe scalability is insane, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say I looked it up for\n\n319\n00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:26.668\nus just to ensure.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n320\n00:18:26.668 --> 00:18:28.859\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We provide that information out there.\n\n321\n00:18:28.859 --> 00:18:32.283\n255 characters for the file name.\n\n322\n00:18:32.283 --> 00:18:34.415\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; 32,000 unicode characters for\n\n323\n00:18:34.415 --> 00:18:35.429\nthe path name.\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n324\n00:18:35.429 --> 00:18:39.200\nthe path, good.\n&gt;&gt; Maximum file size 35\n\n325\n00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.880\nPB.\n&gt;&gt; My\n\n326\n00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.610\ngosh.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n327\n00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember that's right it was PB\n\n328\n00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.170\nand I was just thinking in\nmy mind like that's crazy.\n\n329\n00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.035\n&gt;&gt; It's impossible.\n\n330\n00:18:47.035 --> 00:18:47.628\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:18:47.628 --> 00:18:48.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n332\n00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.070\n&gt;&gt; Definitely built for scalability\n\n333\n00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.160\nas we can see and thank you Mike.\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n334\n00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.840\n&gt;&gt; It does have lower functionality in\n\n335\n00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.770\nsome aspects.\n\n336\n00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.840\nLike if you're comparing it to NTFS,\nbecause it doesn't offer that EFS for\n\n337\n00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:06.100\nan encryption or\ncompression assignments etcetera.\n\n338\n00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.770\nWith that being said, there are components\nsuch as the transactional write model,\n\n339\n00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.260\nproactive repairing and self healing.\n\n340\n00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:22.000\nThat would compensate for some of those\ndeficiencies, or lacking features.\n\n341\n00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.410\nBecause, instead of having to\nworry about compression, ReFS was\n\n342\n00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:33.830\ndesigned innately to be able to\nrepair files as issues came about.\n\n343\n00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.760\nSo as a matter of fact,\nlike with our NTFS and\n\n344\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.300\nwe take a look at how the files\nare stored on those physical disks and\n\n345\n00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.280\nyou might have had to run through\ndisk defragmentation before and\n\n346\n00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:52.000\nthat process because of having\ndisk contiguous files on a drive,\n\n347\n00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.490\nwe don't have that here with ReFS because\nthe files are stored more intelligently.\n\n348\n00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.990\nSo it is pretty cool that way.\n\n349\n00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.400\nThis is a really cool function here.\n\n350\n00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.900\nImproved availability.\n\n351\n00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.250\nMeaning, I don't have to,\n\n352\n00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:10.560\nmy system can actually self-heal while\nit's powered on and still functioning.\n\n353\n00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.200\nThat's really cool.\n\n354\n00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.330\nI did have the scalability.\n\n355\n00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.470\nIf I read my own notes here\nin excess of petabytes, but,\n\n356\n00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.000\nstill just knowing what it was there.\n\n357\n00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.220\nI will say this about ReFS.\n\n358\n00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.920\nIn my opinion, the biggest limitation, and\nI don't even have it written down here.\n\n359\n00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.360\nBut, the biggest limitation is going\nto be that [LAUGH] it's not bootable.\n\n360\n00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.130\n&gt;&gt; That's a pretty big limitation.\n\n361\n00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.810\nSo where we really see this\nbeing utilized is for storage.\n\n362\n00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:38.920\nSo that's what Microsoft, ReFS,\n\n363\n00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.450\nworks wonders when paired\nwith storage spaces.\n\n364\n00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.380\nThat's really what this file\nsystem was designed for or\n\n365\n00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.710\nthey were designed to work together so\nthat\n\n366\n00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:54.430\nReFS could rebuild configurations that\nyou have set up in the storage spaces.\n\n367\n00:20:54.430 --> 00:21:00.450\nSo thinking about file storage,\nnot necessarily bootable space here.\n\n368\n00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:02.670\nOkay.\nWhoops.\n\n369\n00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.820\nI always do that.\n\n370\n00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.630\nAll right.\n\n371\n00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.080\nWhat else are we looking at here?\n\n372\n00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:13.470\nThis is just one little thing that\nI wanted to note comparing the two.\n\n373\n00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.320\nIf you really wanted to look at\nthis in your operating system,\n\n374\n00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.730\nif you have access to an ReFS drive.\n\n375\n00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:26.560\nIf you run the FSutil commands list and,\nCMD or your command line interface.\n\n376\n00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:32.440\nIn operating system it's just fs info,\nso you type in fs util, fs info,\n\n377\n00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:40.260\nvolume info, specify the drive that\nyou want to compare colon Enter,\n\n378\n00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:45.580\nand the ones that are highlighted here,\nyellow, are going to be what NTF provides\n\n379\n00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.790\nthat ReF does not provide, so you can kind\nof see that side-by-side comparison there.\n\n380\n00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:50.830\nI thought that was pretty cool.\n\n381\n00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.360\nAll right, so looking at the time here,\n\n382\n00:21:54.360 --> 00:22:00.010\nI do want to show you\nsomething else IMS info 32 and\n\n383\n00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:04.700\nlet's just go ahead and\nI already have that typed n here and\n\n384\n00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.880\nif you are not familiar with that, if you\njust use your run line to type in IMS\n\n385\n00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.140\ninfo 32 you get information about your\nsystem so we will go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n386\n00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.280\nI'm gonna zoom out a little bit.\n\n387\n00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.550\nOn the left had side here I have\na section that says Software Environment,\n\n388\n00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.780\nso let's go ahead and expand that out.\n\n389\n00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:29.150\nAnd underneath Software Environment\nlet's left-click on System Drivers.\n\n390\n00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:32.440\nNow, on the right-hand pane,\nI'm gonna kinda scroll on over here.\n\n391\n00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.820\nActually let me zoom out so\nyou guys can get the full concept here.\n\n392\n00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.850\nLet me just change my type\nbecause specifically I want\n\n393\n00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:46.130\nto be looking at file system drivers here,\nokay?\n\n394\n00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:49.630\nSo you can see how we change\nthat just by clicking on it,\n\n395\n00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:51.300\nup in this little top area here.\n\n396\n00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:57.920\nLook at all these different file systems\nthat are in the Windows operating system.\n\n397\n00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.670\nI mean we are just down to these\nright now, there are a lot here.\n\n398\n00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:06.120\nSo you guys are probably thinking man\nCherokee you sure were talking for\n\n399\n00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.660\na while here but believe me, I could\ntalk some more but I am not going to.\n\n400\n00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.190\nThe ones that we looked at are gonna\nbe the most relevant to configuring and\n\n401\n00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.840\nmanaging our volumes here.\n\n402\n00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.740\nIn the Windows 10 operating system.\n\n403\n00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:21.320\nThere is one that I do want to\npoint out since I am right here,\n\n404\n00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.020\nthat will also be relevant.\n\n405\n00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:29.640\nNot for really managing so much,\nbut just being cognizant of\n\n406\n00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.990\nthe fact that cdfs is going to\nbe the file system our CDs and\n\n407\n00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.210\nDVDs systems are gonna be using for\nthose drive bays there so.\n\n408\n00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.010\nOr for the actual media that you use\nin the drive base, I should say.\n\n409\n00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:45.710\nAll right, that's it.\n\n410\n00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.350\nI think we have enough back story.\n\n411\n00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.580\nOnly two episodes to get us ready\nto actually dive into the OS,\n\n412\n00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.440\nMike, but yeah that's where we are.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\n\n413\n00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.450\nI am excited and ready to get in there,\nbut unfortunately we're gonna have to do\n\n414\n00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.290\nthat in our next episode cuz,\nwe're already out of time for this one.\n\n415\n00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:01.810\nSo, signing off for It Pro Tv.\n\n416\n00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.065\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n&gt;&gt;

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.643 --> 00:00:17.130\nI'm you host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.980\nToday we're installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n8\n00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.480\nSpecifically in this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.434\nwe're actually continuing our thought\nprocess on configuring disks and volumes.\n\n10\n00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:28.725\nThis is a part three, so if you missed the\nfirst two parts, make sure you go back and\n\n11\n00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:29.780\ncheck those out.\n\n12\n00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.160\nWe defined a lot of the things\nwe're getting ready to do.\n\n13\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.030\nAnd here to show us how to do all\nthat wonderful stuff is none other\n\n14\n00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.720\nthan Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n15\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.690\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n16\n00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.112\nThat is correct, so some of\nthe information that we spoke about in\n\n17\n00:00:42.112 --> 00:00:46.049\nthe last show is directly pertinent to\nwhat we are gonna be looking at here.\n\n18\n00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:49.583\nWe spoke about it long enough, so\nlet's go ahead get started here,\n\n19\n00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.240\nin operating system.\n\n20\n00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.630\nNow, there are different ways\nthat we can go ahead and\n\n21\n00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.690\nmanage our disks here within\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n22\n00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.130\nHowever, for this show I'd like to\nreserve this time to go ahead and\n\n23\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.620\nlook at how we can handle those within\nthe graphical user interface, in our GUI.\n\n24\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.260\nSo the most common way or\n\n25\n00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.790\nhow we're gonna be doing that\nhere is with disk management.\n\n26\n00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.000\nSo a couple different ways you can\ngo ahead and access disk management.\n\n27\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.540\nYou could go ahead an use\nlike your Windows+S\n\n28\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.380\nshortcut to pull up that search or\njust start typing in that search bar.\n\n29\n00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.220\nAnd if you start typing like computer\nmanagement, and we go ahead and\n\n30\n00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.600\npull that up, over on the left hand pane,\nyou'll see the option to access\n\n31\n00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.490\na lot of those common management features\nand that's going to be right over here.\n\n32\n00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.950\nZoom in a little bit so you guys can\nsee that Disk Management option there.\n\n33\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.120\nAlternatively, you could go ahead and\nuse the Run line.\n\n34\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.700\nThat's my personal favorite here.\n\n35\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.830\nSo if we just use the Windows+R key and\nthen go ahead, and I'll zoom in so\n\n36\n00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.270\nyou guys can see that.\n\n37\n00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.580\nIt's going to be D-I-S-K-M-G-M-T\ndot M-S-C, we'll hit Enter.\n\n38\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.690\nAnd then that'll pull up our\nDisc Management Console.\n\n39\n00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.320\nThis is where we'll be spending\nthe majority of our time here within\n\n40\n00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.840\nthis show.\n\n41\n00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.710\nWe have worked with virtual\nhard disks in other areas under\n\n42\n00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.970\nthe Hyper-V section of this show, so\nyou might be a little familiar with them.\n\n43\n00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.930\nIf not, Microsoft does call VHDs out\nagain under this domain objective.\n\n44\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.450\nSo hint, hint, nudge, nudge,\nthere's obviously a reason why, so\n\n45\n00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.470\nwe're gonna be focusing specifically\non VHDs in a different show.\n\n46\n00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.320\nBut just know that we can utilize them\nhere and we'll see them a little bit.\n\n47\n00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.453\nBut yeah, we've got a lot to cover, guys.\n\n48\n00:02:38.453 --> 00:02:40.731\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n49\n00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:43.784\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you're probably thinking, wow,\n\n50\n00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:46.610\nmy computer doesn't look like that.\n\n51\n00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.170\nProbably not, but\nI do have quite a lot going on here.\n\n52\n00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.890\nBut that's because I wanted to show\nyou the different options that we have\n\n53\n00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.420\nhere within Disk Management.\n\n54\n00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.372\nMike was kind of razing\nme about my computer-\n\n55\n00:02:58.372 --> 00:02:58.886\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n56\n00:02:58.886 --> 00:03:00.617\n&gt;&gt; Looking like an airport runway because\n\n57\n00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:03.922\nI have thumb drives sticking out both\nsides of my laptop here with the little\n\n58\n00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:05.000\nblinky lights.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.390\n&gt;&gt; They're all blinking in unison.\n\n60\n00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.540\nIt's pretty cool really.\n\n61\n00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But that's because I\n\n62\n00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.390\nwanted to show you\n\n63\n00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.780\nguys the different types of drives\nthat we can have on our systems here.\n\n64\n00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.950\nSo let me just zoom in a little bit.\n\n65\n00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.400\nAnd here on our C drive,\nthis is going to be, well, where my\n\n66\n00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.260\noperating system is housed and most likely\nyours as well, but it doesn't have to be.\n\n67\n00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.370\nWe'll take a look at our drive letters and\n\n68\n00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.640\nhow we can assign those\nin a little bit here.\n\n69\n00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.000\nWe spoke about file systems in the last\nshow, and here you can see, I said look,\n\n70\n00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.940\nmost commonly, for Windows operating\nsystems, you'll be using the NTFS.\n\n71\n00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.330\nSo remember, NTFS is a file system\nthat will allow me to boot from it, so\n\n72\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.050\nmakes perfect sense that I would go\nahead and use that as my bootable drive.\n\n73\n00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.013\nAll right, what else do we have that\nI really would wanna point out for\n\n74\n00:03:57.013 --> 00:03:57.635\nright now?\n\n75\n00:03:57.635 --> 00:04:03.689\nI do wanna notice here, for\nour file system that we had seen,\n\n76\n00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.820\nI showed you one in our\nMS Info 32 on the last show.\n\n77\n00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.360\nBut just noting here that my\n\n78\n00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.100\noptical drive here formatted\nwith that UDF file system there.\n\n79\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.615\nAnd that's what you can see,\nthe little CD or DVD icon on there, okay.\n\n80\n00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:31.145\nAll these other ones, you can see\ninformation in this table format here.\n\n81\n00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:35.310\nBut you can also click on them\nindividually to get some more detailed\n\n82\n00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.271\ninformation.\n\n83\n00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:41.023\nOkay, so disk zero,\nthat's how the numbering system starts,\n\n84\n00:04:41.023 --> 00:04:44.110\nyou're gonna be starting at zero there.\n\n85\n00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.410\nSo here for my bootable drive,\nI have noted at disk zero.\n\n86\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.360\nI can see and\n\n87\n00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.200\nlet me zoom in, that this, I can get\nsome information just at glance here.\n\n88\n00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.350\nI told you that that was going to be my\ndrive, where the operating system resides.\n\n89\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:06.550\nYou can see that volume C, this is where\nmy operating system is living, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.790\nI have some other partitions\nnoted here that the operating\n\n91\n00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.190\nsystem created upon installation,\nI didn't create those and put them there.\n\n92\n00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.330\nI can see that this is a basic disk, I can\nsee that it's almost 120 gigs in size,\n\n93\n00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.620\nI can see that the current\nstate is online.\n\n94\n00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.979\nThis option here, this line,\n\n95\n00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.258\ncan really clue you in on the health or\nstatus of a drive.\n\n96\n00:05:33.258 --> 00:05:37.937\nWe are gonna have a show specific to\ntroubleshooting where we see things like\n\n97\n00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:42.380\noffline, offline doesn't\nnecessarily mean there's a problem.\n\n98\n00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.682\nI might have just plug the drive,\nattached the drive physically and\n\n99\n00:05:47.682 --> 00:05:49.360\nhaven't got to it yet.\n\n100\n00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.050\nBut if there's a disk that I expected to\nbe up and running, then that may indicate\n\n101\n00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.690\na problem, especially if I'm moving\ndisks from computers and I see foreign.\n\n102\n00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.230\nSo we'll spend some time in another show\ntalking about how we can troubleshoot.\n\n103\n00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.160\nBut for now,\nwe'll look at the basics here.\n\n104\n00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.180\nAll right, so with that being said,\nwhat are these colors about, right?\n\n105\n00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.590\nSo I can see some blue,\na whole lot of black going on here.\n\n106\n00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.010\nAnd I see this term unallocated.\n\n107\n00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.714\nWhat does unallocated mean?\n\n108\n00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:24.197\nUnallocated simply means I haven't\ndone anything with it yet,\n\n109\n00:06:24.197 --> 00:06:27.950\nit's just kind of there,\nit's a storage space that's available.\n\n110\n00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.562\nSo these three disks, disk one,\ntwo and three, they're,\n\n111\n00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:40.030\nlet's just say I tried to set up\na situation that would mimic or\n\n112\n00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:47.420\nreplicate a scenario in which I had just\nplugged or attached three physical disks.\n\n113\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.965\nSo that's what we're looking at here.\n\n114\n00:06:48.965 --> 00:06:53.409\nNow, they're only approximately 5 gigs\nin size, so in real-life experiences,\n\n115\n00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:58.166\nthat's probably not what you're going to\nencounter, you'll be working, hopefully,\n\n116\n00:06:58.166 --> 00:06:59.560\nwith drives much larger.\n\n117\n00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.730\nBut for this demonstration, I have to be\ncognizant of my actual physical storage,\n\n118\n00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.570\nso I have to keep that in mind.\n\n119\n00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:12.780\nSo this is just as if I had attached\nthe drive, plugged in my cables,\n\n120\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.510\npowered up that machine, and\nI see that these disks are offline.\n\n121\n00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.970\nAs a matter of fact, I don't even\nhave to have the machine powered off.\n\n122\n00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.653\nI could attach them, and\nthere is an option up here under Action,\n\n123\n00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:30.760\nlet me zoom in,\nwhere you can rescan disks.\n\n124\n00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.410\nSo if I'm working, adding, removing disks,\nby hitting this Rescan Disks,\n\n125\n00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.940\nthat's going to be helpful in determining\nwhich ones I've just added or whatever.\n\n126\n00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.640\nAnd sometimes, again,\nback with the troubleshooting.\n\n127\n00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.990\nI'm trying to save it for later.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n128\n00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.920\n&gt;&gt; But it's hard when you're\n\n129\n00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.380\ningrained that way.\n\n130\n00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.930\nYou might wanna rescan, unplug and\n\n131\n00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.160\nthen rescan again if they're\nnot showing up initially.\n\n132\n00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.430\nSometimes that happens,\njust silly things like that.\n\n133\n00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.653\nBut okay, so these are my physical drives.\n\n134\n00:07:57.653 --> 00:08:01.170\nI go ahead and I plug them in,\nthis is what they look like.\n\n135\n00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.510\nThe current state is offline, so\n\n136\n00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.362\nthat is going to be The direct\nopposite here of online.\n\n137\n00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:12.273\nSo what I need to do is right-click\non top of this one, and go ahead and\n\n138\n00:08:12.273 --> 00:08:13.728\nbring that online.\n\n139\n00:08:13.728 --> 00:08:17.060\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo that for these disks also,\n\n140\n00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.378\nsimply because we wanna work with them.\n\n141\n00:08:19.378 --> 00:08:22.339\nAnd you have to bring them online.\n\n142\n00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:26.308\nActually okay, so\nI close out my simple diagram here,\n\n143\n00:08:26.308 --> 00:08:30.364\nbut if you think about the steps,\nlet me just go ahead and\n\n144\n00:08:30.364 --> 00:08:34.354\nminimize this machine so\nI can pull that up real quick.\n\n145\n00:08:34.354 --> 00:08:40.009\nBecause I do wanna go ahead and remind\nof you of the steps that we looked at,\n\n146\n00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:42.392\nand that was two episodes ago.\n\n147\n00:08:42.392 --> 00:08:46.544\nSo, let's go ahead and\npull that up real quick.\n\n148\n00:08:46.544 --> 00:08:48.878\nAll right, let me just zoom out.\n\n149\n00:08:53.047 --> 00:08:54.516\nAnd zoom in a little bit.\n\n150\n00:08:54.516 --> 00:08:59.415\nSo if you can recall, we did see that\nthese steps noted in a prior show, and\n\n151\n00:08:59.415 --> 00:09:03.781\nso I said look, you're gonna need\nto go ahead and mark it online.\n\n152\n00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:07.613\nSo that's kind of where we\nare in this timeline here.\n\n153\n00:09:07.613 --> 00:09:11.267\nThe next thing we need to do is initialize\nthe disk, so let's go back into,\n\n154\n00:09:11.267 --> 00:09:13.016\nI just wanted to remind you of this.\n\n155\n00:09:13.016 --> 00:09:17.405\nYou might have it in your notes, or if not\nscreenshot it, so you can just think about\n\n156\n00:09:17.405 --> 00:09:20.805\nthe steps you need to take when\nyou're working with the drives.\n\n157\n00:09:20.805 --> 00:09:24.506\nAll right, So\n\n158\n00:09:24.506 --> 00:09:28.620\nonce we have the drive online,\nwhat was the next step?\n\n159\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.996\nWell, we need to initialize that drive.\n\n160\n00:09:34.923 --> 00:09:39.470\nAll right, so if I'm just gonna\ngo ahead and mark that here,\n\n161\n00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.711\nhold on, give me one second.\n\n162\n00:09:41.711 --> 00:09:44.008\nI think this one has already\nbeen initialized there.\n\n163\n00:09:44.008 --> 00:09:47.890\nYes, initialization is\nkind of a funny one, and\n\n164\n00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:52.921\nalso that reminds me, so\nyou may have to initialize the drive.\n\n165\n00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:56.208\nIn this situation I didn't, I've been\nplaying around with these drives.\n\n166\n00:09:56.208 --> 00:10:00.240\nSo the operating system was aware of that,\nbut that brings in a good point.\n\n167\n00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.298\nMike and I, we were talking about\nvirtual hard disk drives and previous or\n\n168\n00:10:04.298 --> 00:10:08.892\nother shows, I don't know how you're\nwatching these shows in order or whatever.\n\n169\n00:10:08.892 --> 00:10:12.081\nBut we've worked with virtual\nhard disk drives as well.\n\n170\n00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:15.728\nSo let me just pull one in real quick and\nlet's say I'm not gonna create a virtual\n\n171\n00:10:15.728 --> 00:10:18.902\nhard disk because I already had some\nthat I created in another shell.\n\n172\n00:10:18.902 --> 00:10:22.655\nSo I'm just gonna say attach\nvirtual hard disk, and\n\n173\n00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:26.420\nthat's up here underneath our Action menu,\nokay?\n\n174\n00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:31.881\nSo we're gonna be pointing to a VHD or\nVHDX that we've already created,\n\n175\n00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:36.625\nand I already had this location,\njust the navigation path from\n\n176\n00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:40.943\nthat VM demo folder that we created,\nif you guys recall.\n\n177\n00:10:40.943 --> 00:10:47.343\nSo I'm just gonna randomly select one\nof these disks and hit Open, and OK.\n\n178\n00:10:47.343 --> 00:10:51.140\nAlso before I hit OK I do want\nyou to see this option as well.\n\n179\n00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:57.805\nWe can choose this disk to be a read-only.\n\n180\n00:10:57.805 --> 00:11:02.868\nFor whatever intents and purposes,\nif I may be was going to be configuring\n\n181\n00:11:02.868 --> 00:11:07.865\nin any kind of parent-child\nconfigurations, or something like that.\n\n182\n00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:12.860\nDifference in disks with my VHD is here.\n&gt;&gt; This could be a disk of archived\n\n183\n00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.291\ndata that you wanna ensure does\nnot get modified in any way, but\n\n184\n00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:19.615\nyou need to temporarily mount it up so\nyou can read that data.\n\n185\n00:11:19.615 --> 00:11:20.273\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n186\n00:11:20.273 --> 00:11:22.130\n&gt;&gt; Marking it as read-only would ensure\n\n187\n00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.503\nthat no changes were made.\n&gt;&gt; Good one Mike, thanks.\n\n188\n00:11:24.503 --> 00:11:25.364\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:11:25.364 --> 00:11:27.908\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're just gonna have,\n\n190\n00:11:27.908 --> 00:11:33.087\nand if you don't select the [INAUDIBLE]\nit's a readable, writeable, as well.\n\n191\n00:11:33.087 --> 00:11:37.785\nAll right, so I have my long list of,\nand you can see right here, and\n\n192\n00:11:37.785 --> 00:11:43.229\nthe only reason I know really quickly\nthat that's the drive we just attached is\n\n193\n00:11:43.229 --> 00:11:47.237\nbecause that's a really pretty blue color.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n194\n00:11:47.237 --> 00:11:48.275\n&gt;&gt; So the blue is gonna be\n\n195\n00:11:48.275 --> 00:11:49.902\nindicative of our virtual disk.\n\n196\n00:11:49.902 --> 00:11:55.043\nWhether it be VHD or VHDX, so\nit's just a quick indicator there.\n\n197\n00:11:55.043 --> 00:12:00.068\nSo if I scroll down my long list here,\nI can see now that\n\n198\n00:12:00.068 --> 00:12:04.776\ndisk six is going to be my\nvirtual hard disk there.\n\n199\n00:12:04.776 --> 00:12:07.307\nSo that's volume E.\n\n200\n00:12:07.307 --> 00:12:10.947\nAnd so we didn't assign it that,\nthe system did but\n\n201\n00:12:10.947 --> 00:12:13.243\nwe'll talk about that in a few.\n\n202\n00:12:13.243 --> 00:12:14.071\nOkay.\n\n203\n00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.458\nAnd this is one I had\nalready played with there.\n\n204\n00:12:18.458 --> 00:12:23.550\nI can see it's not the full size it\noriginally was, but that's okay.\n\n205\n00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.759\nThat's good, there's a lot to know here.\n\n206\n00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:30.543\nAnd what I'm referencing is\nthat unallocated space in\n\n207\n00:12:30.543 --> 00:12:33.773\ncomparison to the formatted space.\n\n208\n00:12:33.773 --> 00:12:37.946\nAll right, so once we go ahead and if we\nthink back to that list that I showed you\n\n209\n00:12:37.946 --> 00:12:39.762\nwhat do we have to do now, right?\n\n210\n00:12:39.762 --> 00:12:43.472\nSo we have that disk,\nhave it online, initialized it, but\n\n211\n00:12:43.472 --> 00:12:45.264\nwe have unallocated space.\n\n212\n00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:47.537\nMeaning we can't only use it in any way.\n\n213\n00:12:47.537 --> 00:12:52.094\nI mean, it's just kind of there, existing.\n\n214\n00:12:52.094 --> 00:12:54.631\nIf we right-click, and\nsomething else I wanna note.\n\n215\n00:12:54.631 --> 00:12:58.713\nAnywhere you click on\na particular partition,\n\n216\n00:12:58.713 --> 00:13:02.793\nthat focus is noted by\nslashed lines to just help\n\n217\n00:13:02.793 --> 00:13:07.395\nyou identify the location\nin which you're working.\n\n218\n00:13:07.395 --> 00:13:11.143\nIt can be quite detrimental\nif you format or\n\n219\n00:13:11.143 --> 00:13:15.215\ndelete volumes in which\nyou did not intend to.\n\n220\n00:13:15.215 --> 00:13:19.061\nWe're talking catastrophic\nin a sense of data loss.\n\n221\n00:13:19.061 --> 00:13:23.125\nSo, before you go playing around\nwith any of your disks or\n\n222\n00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:27.542\nvolumes on your actual systems,\nmake sure you have backups.\n\n223\n00:13:27.542 --> 00:13:29.777\nBut my recommendation is to set up a lab.\n\n224\n00:13:29.777 --> 00:13:34.436\nThat's exactly what I'm doing here, so\nthat I don't have to have that stress or\n\n225\n00:13:34.436 --> 00:13:36.562\nworries about deleting something or\n\n226\n00:13:36.562 --> 00:13:39.114\ncorrupting any kind of\nfiles along the way.\n\n227\n00:13:39.114 --> 00:13:44.091\nAll right, so now that I have this\nalmost five gigs of unallocated\n\n228\n00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:47.983\nspace on disk one selected,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n229\n00:13:47.983 --> 00:13:51.800\nright-click and\nthen select New simple volume.\n\n230\n00:13:52.805 --> 00:13:58.027\nThis is going to bring up\na new simple volume wizard.\n\n231\n00:13:58.027 --> 00:14:00.537\nAnd if you recall back\nto any earlier show,\n\n232\n00:14:00.537 --> 00:14:05.025\nwe were discussing the differences\nbetween basic disks and dynamic disks.\n\n233\n00:14:05.025 --> 00:14:07.419\nAnd I said look,\na basic disk is pretty basic.\n\n234\n00:14:07.419 --> 00:14:11.771\nThe information resides or\nlives all on one physical disk,\n\n235\n00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:16.568\nand we can see our disks all noted\nin rows here in disk management.\n\n236\n00:14:16.568 --> 00:14:21.500\nBut what if I wanted to think outside\nthe box and utilize some configuration\n\n237\n00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.739\nfeatures similar to reconfigurations\nlike we mentioned also?\n\n238\n00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:29.364\nSo maybe I wanna go ahead and\nspan that data across multiple disks so\n\n239\n00:14:29.364 --> 00:14:33.701\nI can take advantage of actual stored\nspace, or take advantage of redundancy or\n\n240\n00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:35.918\ntake advantage of performance rights.\n\n241\n00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:39.971\nWell we do have that option\nwith our dynamic disks,\n\n242\n00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:43.283\nour dynamic volumes, I should say here.\n\n243\n00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:46.719\nSo let's just go ahead and\nbring up the new simple volume wizard.\n\n244\n00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:50.713\nBut the simple volume is not\nexpanding across additional drives,\n\n245\n00:14:50.713 --> 00:14:52.004\nit is like it sounds.\n\n246\n00:14:52.004 --> 00:14:55.529\nIt's simple,\nyou do get that performance increase but\n\n247\n00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:57.933\nthere's zero redundancy involved.\n\n248\n00:14:57.933 --> 00:15:01.484\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n249\n00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:06.298\nYou can change the size if you,\nthe operating system will go ahead and\n\n250\n00:15:06.298 --> 00:15:11.034\nput the default maximum,\nwhich is the size available on the drive.\n\n251\n00:15:11.034 --> 00:15:14.955\nYou could change that if you wanted\nto just go halfway with the space or\n\n252\n00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:19.298\nwhatever, but for now we'll go ahead and\nhit Next with the defaults there.\n\n253\n00:15:19.298 --> 00:15:25.372\n[COUGH] So that virtual hard disk that we\nhad attached, and if we recall the letter,\n\n254\n00:15:25.372 --> 00:15:27.332\nwhat letter was that?\n&gt;&gt; E,\n\n255\n00:15:27.332 --> 00:15:28.247\necho.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n256\n00:15:28.247 --> 00:15:30.849\nthis show is brought to you\nby the letter E, right?\n\n257\n00:15:30.849 --> 00:15:31.659\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n258\n00:15:31.659 --> 00:15:32.451\n&gt;&gt; We didn't pick\n\n259\n00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:34.130\n&gt;&gt; That, but the operating system did.\n\n260\n00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:38.112\nSo now looking what are its\ntrying to chose for us next.\n\n261\n00:15:38.112 --> 00:15:41.938\nIs there a pattern there?\n&gt;&gt; I think we're going in order.\n\n262\n00:15:41.938 --> 00:15:44.975\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That seems to be about right.\n\n263\n00:15:44.975 --> 00:15:46.834\n&gt;&gt; Assuming the next letter wasn't used.\n\n264\n00:15:46.834 --> 00:15:48.664\n&gt;&gt; Assuming the next letter wasn't in\n\n265\n00:15:48.664 --> 00:15:49.580\nused, correct.\n\n266\n00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.985\nBut what happens when I get to Z?\n&gt;&gt; You're done, no mas.\n\n267\n00:15:53.985 --> 00:15:56.185\n&gt;&gt; And turnkey, how many volumes?\n\n268\n00:15:56.185 --> 00:16:00.194\nThose are NTFS, 128?\n&gt;&gt; 150, uh-huh.\n\n269\n00:16:00.194 --> 00:16:02.284\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what happens?\n\n270\n00:16:02.284 --> 00:16:06.178\nWell It's kind of a funny thing there.\n\n271\n00:16:06.178 --> 00:16:09.065\nYou're only gonna have like Z letters.\n\n272\n00:16:09.065 --> 00:16:13.910\nIn older operating systems, you could use\nspecial characters to attach to that.\n\n273\n00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.589\nTo be honest, I'm not sure about\nthe newest versions of Windows 10.\n\n274\n00:16:16.589 --> 00:16:21.855\nBut I will tell you one thing that I do,\nand that you could do,\n\n275\n00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:28.520\nis you have an alternative to mount\nthe folder into an empty NTFS folder.\n\n276\n00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.337\nSo, the way that those drives\nare accessed or that volume is accessed,\n\n277\n00:16:33.337 --> 00:16:38.498\nbecause remember I say drives but\na volume can span across multiple drives.\n\n278\n00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:43.450\nSo I could be accessing multiple drives\nfrom just one logical unit of space.\n\n279\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.804\nI could access it through a folder,\nlike within File Explorer, right?\n\n280\n00:16:46.804 --> 00:16:49.220\nSo that's an option as well.\n\n281\n00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.801\nAnd we can see here, my A and\nB have not been utilized there, but\n\n282\n00:16:53.801 --> 00:16:57.449\ngoing through I've got all\nthe way down to Z here.\n\n283\n00:16:57.449 --> 00:17:02.060\nSo this would be an option if I\nwere to go ahead and exceed that.\n\n284\n00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.820\nAnd just keep this in mind also\nempty being the keyword here for\n\n285\n00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:06.986\nthat NTFS folder.\n\n286\n00:17:06.986 --> 00:17:11.983\nSo you also have the option to go ahead\nand not assign a drive letter or a path,\n\n287\n00:17:11.983 --> 00:17:14.810\nbut I always try to\ntake advantage of that.\n\n288\n00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.510\nIt's easy for management purposes.\n\n289\n00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.150\nYou can go in and use volume labels,\n\n290\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:24.198\nattach labels through like\ncommand line interface and\n\n291\n00:17:24.198 --> 00:17:29.496\nthings like that, so you can still\nhave some kind of identifier there.\n\n292\n00:17:29.496 --> 00:17:34.197\nBut, like I said,\nit is very catastrophic if you\n\n293\n00:17:34.197 --> 00:17:38.105\nmisconfigure your drives and volumes.\n\n294\n00:17:38.105 --> 00:17:40.986\nSo it's always good in my opinion,\nto have the most\n\n295\n00:17:40.986 --> 00:17:43.071\ndetailed information possible.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:44.870\n&gt;&gt; All right-\n\n297\n00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:45.422\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not too often.\n\n298\n00:17:45.422 --> 00:17:49.532\nI mean I guess there's a couple of\ntimes where I made a volume and\n\n299\n00:17:49.532 --> 00:17:54.010\nnot been ready to decide what\nletter I wanted to assign it.\n\n300\n00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.033\nSo you can go and assign it after the fact\nand chose that option, but you can also go\n\n301\n00:17:57.033 --> 00:18:00.572\nand change it after the fact too, so.\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's not written in stone.\n\n302\n00:18:00.572 --> 00:18:02.175\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there's no point really,\n\n303\n00:18:02.175 --> 00:18:05.070\nin my opinion, you might as well\ngo ahead and grab one, assign it,\n\n304\n00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.160\nbecause until you assign\none it's not usable.\n\n305\n00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.830\nYou can't access it through\nthe operating system.\n\n306\n00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.277\nSo, unless you have other plans for\n\n307\n00:18:11.277 --> 00:18:14.588\nit you might as well.\n&gt;&gt; So what is that called, Mike-\n\n308\n00:18:14.588 --> 00:18:15.340\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n309\n00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.326\n&gt;&gt; Volume, letter, commitment phobe?\n\n310\n00:18:17.326 --> 00:18:17.965\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n311\n00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:19.042\nI think so.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:18:19.042 --> 00:18:21.237\n&gt;&gt; We'll start a new category for\n\n313\n00:18:21.237 --> 00:18:22.727\nwhat you just said.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n314\n00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:23.705\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n315\n00:18:23.705 --> 00:18:25.277\nBut anyways,\nwe're not done with our wizard yet.\n\n316\n00:18:25.277 --> 00:18:30.260\nLet's take a look here we have\nthe option to format our partition.\n\n317\n00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.107\nAnd the reason I took time to\ngo through all that information,\n\n318\n00:18:33.107 --> 00:18:36.612\nlike our file systems before, because\nwhen you get to this screen you really\n\n319\n00:18:36.612 --> 00:18:38.641\nshouldn't just haphazardly be choosing,\n\n320\n00:18:38.641 --> 00:18:41.472\nat this point in time you kind of\nhave to have a game plan here.\n\n321\n00:18:41.472 --> 00:18:49.050\nYou do not, choosing a particular file\nsystem, is part of having a game plan.\n\n322\n00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.439\nSo maybe that is your game plan,\nlike Mike said-\n\n323\n00:18:50.439 --> 00:18:51.304\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe.\n\n324\n00:18:51.304 --> 00:18:52.532\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I have some commitment issues and\n\n325\n00:18:52.532 --> 00:18:54.577\nI'm not gonna go ahead and do that yet.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n326\n00:18:54.577 --> 00:18:55.460\n&gt;&gt; I have a plan, but just not yet.\n\n327\n00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.080\nI have that option.\n\n328\n00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:03.810\nHowever, it is important to note\nabout our different file systems.\n\n329\n00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:08.458\nSo if I wanna be working\nin Microsoft here and\n\n330\n00:19:08.458 --> 00:19:13.736\nusing these drives in\nmultiple configurations,\n\n331\n00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:18.400\ndifferent file systems have limitations.\n\n332\n00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.437\nFAT32 doesn't afford the opportunity,\nfor instance, to shrink and\n\n333\n00:19:22.437 --> 00:19:24.917\nexpand my volume, and things like that.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n334\n00:19:24.917 --> 00:19:28.240\nfor right now we're gonna go ahead and\nselect NTFS.\n\n335\n00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:33.047\nYour allocation unit size is really taking\nit to a level which you don't need for\n\n336\n00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:33.772\nthis exam.\n\n337\n00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:35.907\nWe're just gonna keep it at default, but\n\n338\n00:19:35.907 --> 00:19:39.768\nyou're really determining how that\ndata is being written to that volume.\n\n339\n00:19:39.768 --> 00:19:41.971\nThis is that volume label.\n\n340\n00:19:41.971 --> 00:19:45.240\nI did say that in your command line\ninterface you could label that.\n\n341\n00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.506\nBut hey look, right here, totally forgot\nabout this portion in the wizard,\n\n342\n00:19:48.506 --> 00:19:49.922\nyou could go ahead label as well.\n\n343\n00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:54.367\nSo this could be I don't know what-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n344\n00:19:54.367 --> 00:19:56.833\n&gt;&gt; I can't remember which disk I'm on\n\n345\n00:19:56.833 --> 00:19:57.380\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; F.\n\n346\n00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.860\n&gt;&gt; I have so many there.\n\n347\n00:19:58.860 --> 00:19:59.774\nOkay so F-\n&gt;&gt; F.\n\n348\n00:19:59.774 --> 00:20:00.965\n&gt;&gt; So we could say,\n\n349\n00:20:00.965 --> 00:20:05.052\nI don't want it to get confused\nwith our other labels, so\n\n350\n00:20:05.052 --> 00:20:07.500\nmaybe F is for-\n&gt;&gt; Files?\n\n351\n00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.639\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say\n\n352\n00:20:08.639 --> 00:20:09.603\nfolders.\n&gt;&gt; Folders, with an F.\n\n353\n00:20:09.603 --> 00:20:10.278\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n354\n00:20:10.278 --> 00:20:10.778\n&gt;&gt; I like files.\n\n355\n00:20:10.778 --> 00:20:12.015\nAll right.\n\n356\n00:20:12.015 --> 00:20:13.106\nSo Files.\n\n357\n00:20:13.106 --> 00:20:14.815\nSuper creative. Okay.\n\n358\n00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:16.115\n&gt;&gt; And labels are required just to-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n359\n00:20:16.115 --> 00:20:17.742\n&gt;&gt; To point it out, because I am one\n\n360\n00:20:17.742 --> 00:20:20.210\nof those people that has a label phobia.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n361\n00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.040\n&gt;&gt; I don't like\n\n362\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.931\nlabels.\nI don't know why.\n\n363\n00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:23.913\nIt just doesn't look nice and\n\n364\n00:20:23.913 --> 00:20:25.960\nneat in disk management.\n\n365\n00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.625\nAnd that's just me.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I mean, and that's another\n\n366\n00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:32.320\nthing too, is we don't have to have it,\nbut in my opinion I'm the opposite.\n\n367\n00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.827\nI think that every little bit\nof information helps, and\n\n368\n00:20:34.827 --> 00:20:36.490\nyou can add it even with PowerShell.\n\n369\n00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:38.390\nAnd that's what came into my mind first,\nbut\n\n370\n00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.790\nI totally forgot right here in\nthe OS you can do it as well.\n\n371\n00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:43.724\nAgain, like Mike said, not required.\n\n372\n00:20:43.724 --> 00:20:45.508\nPerform a Quick Format, for\n\n373\n00:20:45.508 --> 00:20:49.780\nthis show I'm gonna try to remember\nto keep this tick box checked.\n\n374\n00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.482\nAnd again, I'm only working with\nthose little tiny five gig drives.\n\n375\n00:20:52.482 --> 00:20:57.035\nBut if you have a large amount of storage\nhere that you were working with and\n\n376\n00:20:57.035 --> 00:21:01.001\nyou didn't have this checked,\nit would perform a full format,\n\n377\n00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:03.640\nwhich can take a little while.\n\n378\n00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.007\nIf you have the time that's\na great thing to do.\n\n379\n00:21:07.007 --> 00:21:11.720\nBut just keep in mind,\nI'm trying to say the performance benefit,\n\n380\n00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.364\nI normally use a quick format, Mike,\n\n381\n00:21:14.364 --> 00:21:17.931\nI don't know about you.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, unless it's a drive that I am\n\n382\n00:21:17.931 --> 00:21:21.759\ngiving to somebody, and they're gonna\nbe recycling it or reusing it, and\n\n383\n00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:24.980\nI'm worried that there might be\nsome fragments of files left,\n\n384\n00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.766\nI've probably already wiped it.\n\n385\n00:21:26.766 --> 00:21:31.322\nBut if doing a slow format can make, it\ncan go through make sure there's none of\n\n386\n00:21:31.322 --> 00:21:33.388\nthose little fragments.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so it's just sweeping it-\n\n387\n00:21:33.388 --> 00:21:34.290\n&gt;&gt; That they might be used-\n\n388\n00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.181\n&gt;&gt; Better than a quick format\n\n389\n00:21:35.181 --> 00:21:35.975\nwe have there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n390\n00:21:35.975 --> 00:21:37.944\nbut if I'm reusing the drive or\nsomething like that,\n\n391\n00:21:37.944 --> 00:21:39.708\nI'll typically just do a quick format.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n392\n00:21:39.708 --> 00:21:42.180\nespecially if you haven't had\nproblems with the drive in the past.\n\n393\n00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.646\nAny kind of indication of bad sectors or\n\n394\n00:21:44.646 --> 00:21:46.113\nanything.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n395\n00:21:46.113 --> 00:21:48.912\n&gt;&gt; This is also some options that I was\n\n396\n00:21:48.912 --> 00:21:51.720\ntalking about earlier with NTFS.\n\n397\n00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.855\nYou have the optional option.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n398\n00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:56.564\n&gt;&gt; To select enable folder and\n\n399\n00:21:56.564 --> 00:21:57.833\nfile compression.\n\n400\n00:21:57.833 --> 00:21:59.455\nYou don't have to use that.\n\n401\n00:21:59.455 --> 00:22:01.975\nWe're not going to for this demo,\nwe're just gonna hit next.\n\n402\n00:22:01.975 --> 00:22:06.845\nThis is just the overall page\nto give you some information.\n\n403\n00:22:06.845 --> 00:22:10.285\nGood for screenshotting and\ndocumenting, but that's about it.\n\n404\n00:22:10.285 --> 00:22:11.975\nIt doesn't take too long either.\n\n405\n00:22:11.975 --> 00:22:12.535\nSo we go ahead and we do that.\n\n406\n00:22:12.535 --> 00:22:15.165\nLet me zoom out so\nwe can see what's happening here.\n\n407\n00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.600\nWe see our little notification for\nfile F there.\n\n408\n00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.880\n&gt;&gt; It's behind your head.\n\n409\n00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.783\nIf we could maybe pop that screen out,\nthere we go.\n\n410\n00:22:23.783 --> 00:22:26.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, it just kinda disappeared.\n\n411\n00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.656\nBut anyways, let's see here,\nand let me go through that.\n\n412\n00:22:31.656 --> 00:22:34.310\nWe can see file F right here.\n\n413\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.310\nNotice now, let me zoom in a little bit.\n\n414\n00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:42.025\nThe top portion here is a blue color,\nit's not black,\n\n415\n00:22:42.025 --> 00:22:47.330\nit's not unallocated anymore,\nit's noted as healthy.\n\n416\n00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.603\nIt's also noted as a healthy\nprimary partition.\n\n417\n00:22:51.603 --> 00:22:55.108\nAnd from that we have\na couple other options here.\n\n418\n00:22:55.108 --> 00:22:59.175\nIf I right-click on top\nof it I can go ahead and,\n\n419\n00:22:59.175 --> 00:23:02.859\nlet me zoom in so\nwe can take a look at those.\n\n420\n00:23:02.859 --> 00:23:06.582\nReally, what I wanna focus in on here\nis changing that drive letter and path,\n\n421\n00:23:06.582 --> 00:23:10.764\nlike Mike said, look, we're not married to\nthat particular letter of the alphabet,\n\n422\n00:23:10.764 --> 00:23:13.750\nyou can change it if\nit is available there.\n\n423\n00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:18.917\nFormat, so if I go ahead and format\nthis volume, anytime you format a volume\n\n424\n00:23:18.917 --> 00:23:24.271\nyou're gonna have data loss, so you\nalways need to think about that, right?\n\n425\n00:23:24.271 --> 00:23:26.220\nI mean, that's serious.\n\n426\n00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.436\nWhat's the term?\n\n427\n00:23:27.436 --> 00:23:30.446\nResume generating event, an RGE.\n&gt;&gt; An RGE,\n\n428\n00:23:30.446 --> 00:23:31.182\nyeah, yep.\n\n429\n00:23:31.182 --> 00:23:31.948\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n430\n00:23:31.948 --> 00:23:33.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n431\n00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.492\nAll right, so you will lose that\ninformation, that's my disclaimer.\n\n432\n00:23:36.492 --> 00:23:40.652\nAll right, we're not gonna go ahead,\nwe already spoke about this before for\n\n433\n00:23:40.652 --> 00:23:43.680\nour different options, same options there.\n\n434\n00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.522\nGonna go ahead and right click again.\n\n435\n00:23:45.522 --> 00:23:51.444\nNow, if I wanna extend\nthe volume then if I had enough\n\n436\n00:23:51.444 --> 00:23:57.782\nphysical disk space,\nthen I could go ahead and do that.\n\n437\n00:23:57.782 --> 00:24:02.799\nFor this drive, but\nbecause I have the ability to extend\n\n438\n00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:09.110\nthe volume across multiple drives,\nthat option is still black here.\n\n439\n00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:13.137\nIt's not greyed out, and\nit's kind of interesting, Mike,\n\n440\n00:24:13.137 --> 00:24:18.636\nbecause any time there is an action that\ncan't be completed, I won't say any time,\n\n441\n00:24:18.636 --> 00:24:22.665\nmost of the time there's\nan action that can't be completed,\n\n442\n00:24:22.665 --> 00:24:25.005\nyou'll see that it's greyed out.\n\n443\n00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:27.983\nSo the operating system will be\nable to help keep you honest and\n\n444\n00:24:27.983 --> 00:24:31.996\nnot configure things the way that you\nshouldn't be, and even when you're working\n\n445\n00:24:31.996 --> 00:24:36.206\nwith storage spaces it's like that too.\n&gt;&gt; And I remember when dynamic disk,\n\n446\n00:24:36.206 --> 00:24:37.493\nI'll date myself.\n\n447\n00:24:37.493 --> 00:24:41.657\nI [LAUGH] remember when dynamic was\nrelatively new, and if it wasn't the right\n\n448\n00:24:41.657 --> 00:24:46.463\ntype of disk, if it wasn't converted over\nto dynamic, these options, extend volume,\n\n449\n00:24:46.463 --> 00:24:50.948\nif you didn't have enough space, it would\nbe greyed out, and now Windows starts to\n\n450\n00:24:50.948 --> 00:24:54.670\ndo things for you in the background.\n&gt;&gt; You know, and that's even,\n\n451\n00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:59.510\nsometimes to be honest, in all fairness,\nsometimes the options aren't even there,\n\n452\n00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.760\nand when you're working in\nyour storage dashboard and\n\n453\n00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.220\nserver manager, they're just omitted,\nso you don't even have that option.\n\n454\n00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.670\nSometimes they're greyed out,\nsometimes they're omitted,\n\n455\n00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:13.960\nand you just kind of totally\nmade me think about something.\n\n456\n00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.768\nWhen we were talking about\nour RAID configurations,\n\n457\n00:25:17.768 --> 00:25:22.843\nwhen we were looking at the older,\nand I keep saying older, but for me,\n\n458\n00:25:22.843 --> 00:25:28.193\nin the past raid would be my go to over\nsoftware, ways to configure drives.\n\n459\n00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:32.497\nSo looking at those,\nyou'd have to have, or should have,\n\n460\n00:25:32.497 --> 00:25:37.919\nsame drive speed, RPMs, same drive size,\nand you could have like a mix and\n\n461\n00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:42.308\nmatch of the size, but\nwhen you're setting up like your RAID\n\n462\n00:25:42.308 --> 00:25:46.959\nconfigurations they're only going\nto allow you to utilize this\n\n463\n00:25:46.959 --> 00:25:51.733\nspace that was the same amongst\nthe drives, if that makes sense.\n\n464\n00:25:51.733 --> 00:25:53.690\nSo you have to have a lot\nsimilarities there.\n\n465\n00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:57.141\nUsually, I would just get like the same\nbrand, like if it were Seagate or\n\n466\n00:25:57.141 --> 00:25:59.340\nWestern Digital, or whatever.\n\n467\n00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.730\nKeep them the same, same size,\n\n468\n00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:05.710\nsame RPMs, but with this configuration,\nthat's not the case here.\n\n469\n00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.481\nThere are a little caveats,\nbut it's not as specific, and\n\n470\n00:26:09.481 --> 00:26:14.468\neven something moving forward with our\nstorage spaces you hear the term JBod.\n\n471\n00:26:14.468 --> 00:26:18.480\nIt's more flexible than RAID.\n\n472\n00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.066\nSo JBod is just a bunch of disks, so I can\nmix and match, which is very smart for\n\n473\n00:26:23.066 --> 00:26:27.866\nMicrosoft to do because I think it's a way\nthat they realize people don't always\n\n474\n00:26:27.866 --> 00:26:29.862\nhave an unlimited budget there.\n\n475\n00:26:29.862 --> 00:26:34.123\nAll right, gosh, I need to stop talking,\nlet's just keep going here.\n\n476\n00:26:34.123 --> 00:26:38.150\nAll right, extending this volume so\nthat's an option.\n\n477\n00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:41.700\nI can also shrink the volume\nif I wanted to do that.\n\n478\n00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:45.400\nAdding a mirror,\nwe looked at that as well.\n\n479\n00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.860\nDeleting the mirror, and\nthen I could just go ahead and\n\n480\n00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.816\nlook at additional properties from here.\n\n481\n00:26:49.816 --> 00:26:50.920\nAll right.\n\n482\n00:26:54.936 --> 00:26:58.117\nLet me just zoom out ever so\nslightly there.\n\n483\n00:26:58.117 --> 00:27:03.845\nWe do have our normal format that you\nguys have probably getting familiar with.\n\n484\n00:27:03.845 --> 00:27:09.425\nOur little tabular format here in this\nwindow for this particular volume,\n\n485\n00:27:09.425 --> 00:27:12.655\nand again,\nthis is just pretty self-explanatory, but\n\n486\n00:27:12.655 --> 00:27:16.055\nI wanna let you know that this stuff\nexists, and like I said, there's so\n\n487\n00:27:16.055 --> 00:27:19.520\nmuch to comb through, I just wanna make\nsure I'm not missing anything here.\n\n488\n00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:24.040\nAllowing this drive to\ncompress to save space.\n\n489\n00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.120\nThis is that label that we had created,\nyet\n\n490\n00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.450\nagain another place where we could\ngo ahead and change that name.\n\n491\n00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:35.235\nThis is a good one here for\nyour disk cleanup.\n\n492\n00:27:35.235 --> 00:27:41.530\nIf you have, I don't know, I'm thinking\nlike, when will be a good time?\n\n493\n00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:46.370\nAfter installations and uninstallations\nof programs, or if you have,-\n\n494\n00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.729\n&gt;&gt; If you deleted a bunch of large files,\n\n495\n00:27:48.729 --> 00:27:52.563\nor not really large files, but\njust deleted a bunch of files,\n\n496\n00:27:52.563 --> 00:27:55.510\ndrive performances a little iffy.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n497\n00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:56.194\n&gt;&gt; Those kind of things.\n\n498\n00:27:56.194 --> 00:27:57.192\nMake sure you-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n499\n00:27:57.192 --> 00:27:59.178\nthis is an easy way you could go ahead and\nhelp with that.\n\n500\n00:27:59.178 --> 00:28:04.015\nYou just hit disk cleanup and it would\ngo ahead and initiate that for you.\n\n501\n00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:11.670\nTools, so this is another management\noption that you have for defragmenting.\n\n502\n00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:17.612\nThere's something to be said about so\nhere, right at this moment in time,\n\n503\n00:28:17.612 --> 00:28:21.924\nwhen I have these drives plugged in,\nI don't have anything screaming\n\n504\n00:28:21.924 --> 00:28:26.185\nat me saying, hey, this is solid state or\noptical, an HDD or an SDD.\n\n505\n00:28:26.185 --> 00:28:31.241\nWe're gonna be looking at I think, later\non, but in PowerShell, and in more server\n\n506\n00:28:31.241 --> 00:28:35.872\nside of things, it's very important to\nknow which drives are solid state and\n\n507\n00:28:35.872 --> 00:28:40.718\nwhich ones are optical, especially when\nyou're dealing with storage tiers and\n\n508\n00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:43.425\nyou're looking at, like that concept where\n\n509\n00:28:43.425 --> 00:28:47.312\nI said Microsoft is allowing you\nto make the most of your budget.\n\n510\n00:28:47.312 --> 00:28:52.728\nStorage tiers is a perfect example of\nthat, because sometimes I might not be\n\n511\n00:28:52.728 --> 00:28:58.580\nable to fort all solid state drives, but I\nhave the budget to kind of mix and match.\n\n512\n00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:03.067\nSo, storage tiers is a really cool feature\non our server side operating systems that\n\n513\n00:29:03.067 --> 00:29:05.152\nwill allow us to best utilize that, and\n\n514\n00:29:05.152 --> 00:29:08.581\nI don't [LAUGH] even remember,\nwhere I was going with that.\n\n515\n00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:12.749\nSo for those drives,\nI'm talking about solid state, right?\n\n516\n00:29:12.749 --> 00:29:16.010\nSo there's a debate as\nto whether you should or\n\n517\n00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:19.112\nshould not defragment solid state drives.\n\n518\n00:29:19.112 --> 00:29:23.345\nLet me just tell you something,\nif you are utilizing VSS in any capacity,\n\n519\n00:29:23.345 --> 00:29:27.940\nyour volume shadow service, you're\ndefragmenting your drives once a month.\n\n520\n00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:32.772\nAt least the operating system is\noriginally programmed to do that, but\n\n521\n00:29:32.772 --> 00:29:37.846\nif you ever needed to defragment manually,\nthat's where you would do it,\n\n522\n00:29:37.846 --> 00:29:41.487\nas well as checking the drive for\nfile system errors.\n\n523\n00:29:41.487 --> 00:29:46.409\nLooking at our hardware here you can see\nthose drives and then go through each one\n\n524\n00:29:46.409 --> 00:29:50.170\nand bring up the properties of,\n[LAUGH] Twilight Zone there.\n\n525\n00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.170\nSharing, this is a good point.\n\n526\n00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:58.810\nWhen we had the option to go ahead and\nmount to a folder,\n\n527\n00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.380\nan empty NTFS folder, you guys are\nprobably already familiar with the fact\n\n528\n00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:07.378\nthat you can share out folders, but\nyou could also share out volumes.\n\n529\n00:30:07.378 --> 00:30:10.780\nSo you can either mount it\ninto an MTNTF folder, or\n\n530\n00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.110\nassign it a drive letter,\nand share it that way.\n\n531\n00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:19.235\nI think this is a great way to kind of,\nI don't want to say mascarade, but\n\n532\n00:30:19.235 --> 00:30:24.527\nkind of hide the backend work of an admin,\nbecause Mike, if I create a drive\n\n533\n00:30:24.527 --> 00:30:29.820\nconfiguration where I'm spanning\nthat storage across multiple drives,\n\n534\n00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:35.222\nwhat if I just start with a small,\nwith one drive, and then I wanna add more?\n\n535\n00:30:35.222 --> 00:30:39.058\nBut if I had assigned it a drive letter,\nmaybe s for the sales team, and\n\n536\n00:30:39.058 --> 00:30:42.700\nall the sales employees put their\ninformation in that s drive, and\n\n537\n00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.407\nthey map a drive over the network\nto that particular shared volume,\n\n538\n00:30:46.407 --> 00:30:49.688\nthey would never know if they\nwere about to run out storage.\n\n539\n00:30:49.688 --> 00:30:54.831\nI could be proactive, I could add\nanother drive, and none less the wiser.\n\n540\n00:30:54.831 --> 00:30:57.374\nIt looks really good,\njust clean management in my opinion.\n\n541\n00:30:57.374 --> 00:31:00.488\nWe do have our permissions\navailable to us,\n\n542\n00:31:00.488 --> 00:31:06.000\nespecially important when we're thinking\nabout sharing those drives out.\n\n543\n00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.186\nJust a few more here,\nways that we can customize those, and\n\n544\n00:31:09.186 --> 00:31:13.482\nthis is that sharing tab, did I already\nclick on that, or quota, sorry, yep.\n\n545\n00:31:13.482 --> 00:31:15.757\nQuota, this is a good one.\n\n546\n00:31:15.757 --> 00:31:19.538\n[LAUGH] I'm almost wondering\nif there's a show for that,\n\n547\n00:31:19.538 --> 00:31:22.585\ncuz I'm looking at the time.\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, absolutely,\n\n548\n00:31:22.585 --> 00:31:24.210\nyeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But I don't know-\n\n549\n00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:25.637\n&gt;&gt; I know we covered that in 697.\n\n550\n00:31:25.637 --> 00:31:26.845\n&gt;&gt; 697 for sure?\n\n551\n00:31:26.845 --> 00:31:30.502\nYeah, I don't know how far on the\nobjectives here if they will cover it, but\n\n552\n00:31:30.502 --> 00:31:32.370\nit just says to configure your disks.\n\n553\n00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:37.680\nSo, this is important, let me zoom in,\nlet's talk about that for a little bit.\n\n554\n00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.303\nEnable management quota, I don't and\nagain, these options are greyed out until\n\n555\n00:31:42.303 --> 00:31:45.319\nI tell the operating system\nI want to use this option.\n\n556\n00:31:45.319 --> 00:31:50.956\nSo I can go ahead and\nenable quota management to go ahead and\n\n557\n00:31:50.956 --> 00:31:57.398\nlog, or I can also set forth what\nare called Hard disk quotas here,\n\n558\n00:31:57.398 --> 00:32:01.654\nto actually deny disk space to end users,\nor\n\n559\n00:32:01.654 --> 00:32:07.090\non that drive, or\nvolume at all from being written.\n\n560\n00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:12.250\nSo, I might wanna do that in\nan environment like with that scenario or\n\n561\n00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.160\nsituation where I said hey,\nI start off with only one drive.\n\n562\n00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:19.255\nWell, until that second drive\ngets mailed to me or whatever,\n\n563\n00:32:19.255 --> 00:32:24.137\nI might wanna impose a disk quota limit,\njust to make sure that everyone is\n\n564\n00:32:24.137 --> 00:32:28.661\nstill able to access that shared\nstorage until I can build it on out.\n\n565\n00:32:31.332 --> 00:32:34.164\nOnce you go ahead and enable it,\nyou do need to go ahead and\n\n566\n00:32:34.164 --> 00:32:35.650\ntake advantage of it though.\n\n567\n00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.060\nIf you don't, then that's kind of\npointless that you would go ahead and\n\n568\n00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:45.310\nset your disk limitations,\nyour upper control limit there.\n\n569\n00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.930\nKilobytes kinds small here,\nprobably gonna be working in gigabytes.\n\n570\n00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:55.570\nI haven't reached these upper\n[LAUGH] thresholds here yet.\n\n571\n00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:58.609\nTerabytes, petabytes and\nexabytes, but who knows.\n\n572\n00:32:58.609 --> 00:33:02.042\nYou also have the option\nto utilize a warning, so\n\n573\n00:33:02.042 --> 00:33:04.906\nyou can let someone know how that works.\n\n574\n00:33:04.906 --> 00:33:08.566\nAnd then, important to go ahead and\nlog if that's what your intents and\n\n575\n00:33:08.566 --> 00:33:12.653\npurposes are to do there, seeking keep\nit track and just good disk management,\n\n576\n00:33:12.653 --> 00:33:14.370\nstorage management if you will.\n\n577\n00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:17.820\nI think we've, men,\n\n578\n00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:19.540\njust when you think you covered all.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n579\n00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.185\n&gt;&gt; I think I covered all these.\n\n580\n00:33:21.185 --> 00:33:23.120\nThis is a good one here.\n\n581\n00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.780\nI totally forgot about Ready Boost, Mike.\n\n582\n00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.413\nThis is kind of like-\n&gt;&gt; Haven't seen that in a while.\n\n583\n00:33:28.413 --> 00:33:29.456\n&gt;&gt; Haven't seen it in a while.\n\n584\n00:33:29.456 --> 00:33:30.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why haven't we seen that in a while\n\n585\n00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:34.275\nMike?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good question.\n\n586\n00:33:34.275 --> 00:33:37.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't think it's super useful.\n\n587\n00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:42.585\nYou guys might have some use for it, but\nbasically utilizing Ready Boost is where\n\n588\n00:33:42.585 --> 00:33:48.875\nyou can utilize storage from removable\ndisks like external drive or\n\n589\n00:33:48.875 --> 00:33:54.025\nflash drive, to go ahead and\nuse it to help speed up your system.\n\n590\n00:33:54.025 --> 00:33:54.835\nI originally,\n\n591\n00:33:54.835 --> 00:33:58.095\nwhen this first came out, played with\nit and I didn't see a huge difference.\n\n592\n00:33:58.095 --> 00:34:00.065\nI think there were some caveats to that\n\n593\n00:34:00.065 --> 00:34:01.352\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n594\n00:34:01.352 --> 00:34:05.238\nI mean obviously your USB paid storage\nis not gonna be nearly as fast as\n\n595\n00:34:05.238 --> 00:34:07.994\nphysical RAM you have\ninstalled in your system.\n\n596\n00:34:07.994 --> 00:34:11.395\nI think I remember this Cherokee,\ncoming out around the time of Vista.\n\n597\n00:34:11.395 --> 00:34:16.278\nAnd there was a pretty steep increase\nin the system resources required to\n\n598\n00:34:16.278 --> 00:34:17.726\nrun Vista versus XP.\n\n599\n00:34:17.726 --> 00:34:20.146\nAnd so if you couldn't\nupgrade your physical memory,\n\n600\n00:34:20.146 --> 00:34:22.039\nyou could throw in a thumb drive.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n601\n00:34:22.039 --> 00:34:23.332\nthat's a good point.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n602\n00:34:23.332 --> 00:34:26.376\nwould offer to use Ready Boost to\nkind of allow you to run Vista.\n\n603\n00:34:26.376 --> 00:34:30.007\nWith Windows 8 or Windows 7,\nWindows 8, Windows 10,\n\n604\n00:34:30.007 --> 00:34:34.450\nthe memory requirements actually\nwent down from Vista, if I remember.\n\n605\n00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:36.660\nNot necessarily went down,\nbut it's definitely not as-\n\n606\n00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.570\n&gt;&gt; Stabilized.\n\n607\n00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:39.338\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't require quite as much\n\n608\n00:34:39.338 --> 00:34:40.381\nto run it efficiently.\n\n609\n00:34:40.381 --> 00:34:44.525\nSo I think we've seen Ready Boost\nkinda fade off in the distance.\n\n610\n00:34:44.525 --> 00:34:45.640\n&gt;&gt; There's a little up scare.\n\n611\n00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:46.865\n&gt;&gt; But again you'll still see it and\n\n612\n00:34:46.865 --> 00:34:48.612\nit's still possible, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n613\n00:34:48.612 --> 00:34:50.178\n&gt;&gt; You can throw a thumb drive in there\n\n614\n00:34:50.178 --> 00:34:54.125\nand you could use it as actual memory.\n&gt;&gt; I mean whatever the current this moment\n\n615\n00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:58.563\nin time, like there are probably are some\nrequirements as far as size I think.\n\n616\n00:34:58.563 --> 00:35:02.023\nIt was not too high.\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to think of\n\n617\n00:35:02.023 --> 00:35:02.808\na useful scenario.\n\n618\n00:35:02.808 --> 00:35:06.180\nMaybe you wanna run client size\nhyper v on your laptop, but\n\n619\n00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:10.810\nyour laptop only has four gigs of\nmemory and your OS needs that already.\n\n620\n00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:15.007\nMaybe you want slap a 32 gigabyte\nthumb drive in there, and use\n\n621\n00:35:15.007 --> 00:35:18.558\nthat as memory with your virtual machines.\n&gt;&gt; It's possible.\n\n622\n00:35:18.558 --> 00:35:19.417\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like that.\n\n623\n00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:20.344\n&gt;&gt; They give you options, right?\n\n624\n00:35:20.344 --> 00:35:21.099\n&gt;&gt; Might be a little slow.\n\n625\n00:35:21.099 --> 00:35:21.738\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n626\n00:35:21.738 --> 00:35:22.331\n&gt;&gt; But you never know.\n\n627\n00:35:22.331 --> 00:35:22.993\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right.\n\n628\n00:35:22.993 --> 00:35:27.081\nMike, I know I said we were gonna look\nat some of those dynamic configurations,\n\n629\n00:35:27.081 --> 00:35:30.010\nwe just haven't made it there yet.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n630\n00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.020\nGreat information there.\n\n631\n00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:35.430\nI know you've got more to share with us,\nbut for now, we're gonna have to sign off.\n\n632\n00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.700\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n633\n00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:38.570\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n634\n00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:41.037\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n635\n00:35:41.037 -->

00:00:08.176\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:12.251\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:16.910\nwelcome to another exciting episode here\nat ITPRO.TV, I'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.350\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n7\n00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.670\nIn this episode, we're configuring\ndisks and volumes, this is a part 4.\n\n8\n00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.949\nSo if you missed the previous parts,\nmake sure you go back and check those out.\n\n9\n00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.003\nHere to continue along with\nus is none other than Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:31.310\nCherokee Boose, welcome back, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for\n\n11\n00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.875\nhaving me, Mike, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, excited to see what\n\n12\n00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:36.960\nyou have in store for us today.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually, I have something on\n\n13\n00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.101\nmy screen that I want to show you\nguys because it's not very common.\n\n14\n00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:45.143\nYou might not see this very often,\nunless you are physically attaching\n\n15\n00:00:45.143 --> 00:00:50.150\nhard disk drives to your systems,\nand I'll zoom in a little bit.\n\n16\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.615\nAnd this is, and we spoke about\nthis already, that process that we\n\n17\n00:00:54.615 --> 00:00:59.186\ngo through whenever we go from\nthe initial hardware installation.\n\n18\n00:00:59.186 --> 00:01:03.619\nAll the way through getting that disk\nreadily available for us to go ahead and\n\n19\n00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:04.600\nwork with.\n\n20\n00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.983\nSo this was that first step,\nthe initializing of the disk, so\n\n21\n00:01:07.983 --> 00:01:11.188\nI kind of wanted to show you\nguys what that looks like here.\n\n22\n00:01:11.188 --> 00:01:14.840\nAnd I actually had created\na few different drives here,\n\n23\n00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.710\nso that's why you see more than one.\n\n24\n00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.320\nAnd I also have the ability to go ahead\nand select if I want to utilize the MBR or\n\n25\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.091\nthe GPT partition schemes\nthat we spoke about before.\n\n26\n00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:33.449\nAnd I kind of feel like, let's just\nkeep one out of that loop there so\n\n27\n00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:36.200\nwe can go ahead and\nmaybe keep that one MBR or\n\n28\n00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.099\nsomething.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n29\n00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:41.080\n&gt;&gt; All right, now let's make this a little\n\n30\n00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.708\nbit bigger here and hold this up, and\n\n31\n00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:50.580\nwhat I'm going to do,\nI don't see them listed up here.\n\n32\n00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.899\nThey are being noted as unknown.\n\n33\n00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.621\nThis one is unknown,\nthe other ones are online, but\n\n34\n00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:03.130\nlet me just do a refresh to see\nif anything will change it there.\n\n35\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.297\nOkay, so what we need to do is go ahead\nand start working with these drives.\n\n36\n00:02:07.297 --> 00:02:10.433\nAnd if we wanted to go ahead and\ninitialize this one,\n\n37\n00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:13.650\nyou can just right-click on top of that.\n\n38\n00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.910\nWe've already gone through\nthis interface a little bit.\n\n39\n00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.319\nAnd looked at properties of\nright-clicking on this space here, but\n\n40\n00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.970\nnot on allocated space.\n\n41\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.499\nBut anyways, just right-clicking and\nthen going into Properties for\n\n42\n00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:27.744\nthe different volumes.\n\n43\n00:02:27.744 --> 00:02:29.801\nYou also have the ability to go ahead and\nright-click,\n\n44\n00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:31.810\nI don't know if I had\nmentioned that before.\n\n45\n00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.901\nBut just really getting in here,\ninto Disk Management, and\n\n46\n00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:38.915\nplaying around with your options,\nbecause here you can see Initialize Disk.\n\n47\n00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:41.830\nSo basically,\nwe'll get that same option that we had for\n\n48\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.920\nthose other disks that we had here.\n\n49\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.658\nBut instead of GPT, like I said,\nwe'll just go ahead and keep this one MBR,\n\n50\n00:02:48.658 --> 00:02:51.487\njust to show you that\nit's really that easy.\n\n51\n00:02:51.487 --> 00:02:56.247\nAnd you can convert MBR to GPT, but\nI think we're going to save that for\n\n52\n00:02:56.247 --> 00:02:58.520\nanother show, Mike.\n\n53\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.919\nBecause things are changing on how\nyou would go ahead and do that.\n\n54\n00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:09.660\nOkay, so in the last show, we spoke about\ndifferent types of rate configurations.\n\n55\n00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.909\nAnd I said it's important to\nunderstand where we're coming from so\n\n56\n00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.968\nwe can see where we're going in this show.\n\n57\n00:03:14.968 --> 00:03:18.520\nAnd how those two concepts relate or\npertain to each other.\n\n58\n00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.732\nSo if we can go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen.\n\n59\n00:03:20.732 --> 00:03:25.121\nI kind of want to us to think back into\nthat mindset about the different types of\n\n60\n00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.050\nrate configurations we\nhad available to us.\n\n61\n00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.080\nAnd if we right-click on top of this\nallocated space, and I'll zoom in,\n\n62\n00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.595\nwe have some options available,\nsome configuration options.\n\n63\n00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:40.715\nSo, New Simple Volume, well,\npretty simple, it's Simple Volume here,\n\n64\n00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:45.760\nif you go ahead and create that, and\nwe'll walk through this a little bit.\n\n65\n00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:53.040\nNothing too serious about this,\nit's kind of self contained.\n\n66\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.592\nIf the drive is going to be\nleaving that physical disk and\n\n67\n00:03:56.592 --> 00:04:00.986\nspanning multiple drives,\nthen it's going to be a dynamic volume.\n\n68\n00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:04.930\nSo that's where the terminology\ndiffers a little bit there.\n\n69\n00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.411\nNow, each one of these\ndrives I've created here\n\n70\n00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:13.903\nare going to be five gigs\nin size approximately.\n\n71\n00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:17.486\nYou really wouldn't be working with\ndrives this small, but just for\n\n72\n00:04:17.486 --> 00:04:20.650\nthis demonstration,\nI wanted to keep things kind of round.\n\n73\n00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.038\nOr it's not a round even number,\nit's an odd number, but still,\n\n74\n00:04:24.038 --> 00:04:27.321\nit's an easy number,\nit's easy math here, yeah, integers.\n\n75\n00:04:27.321 --> 00:04:32.011\nWe are not going in like negative or\nanything, okay, [LAUGH],\n\n76\n00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:34.370\nnot even possible, but okay.\n\n77\n00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.359\nI could decide to use the entire\namount of space on that physical disk.\n\n78\n00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:44.057\nBut for now, there are a lot of\ndifferent configurations that I want to\n\n79\n00:04:44.057 --> 00:04:44.880\nexecute here.\n\n80\n00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.364\nSo what we'll do here is we'll just\nchange this to approximately 1 gig for\n\n81\n00:04:49.364 --> 00:04:52.868\nthat Simple volume,\nwe'll hit Next and we'll go ahead.\n\n82\n00:04:52.868 --> 00:04:57.581\nWe'll just keep the drive letters in the\nalphabetical order to keep things easy for\n\n83\n00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:58.390\nus here.\n\n84\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.653\nAnd then we might even go ahead and\nmount to 1, actually,\n\n85\n00:05:02.653 --> 00:05:05.354\nlet's do this one first to mount it.\n\n86\n00:05:05.354 --> 00:05:09.860\nAnd remember, mounting it, I can't recall\nif we spoke about this before or not.\n\n87\n00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.884\nBut we have A through Z,\n26 characters in the alphabet.\n\n88\n00:05:14.884 --> 00:05:19.591\nAnd once we go ahead and\nutilize all those characters,\n\n89\n00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:26.080\nwe still have the ability to create\nup to 128 volumes, so what do we do?\n\n90\n00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.109\nWell, we do have this option\nwhere we can mount our volume,\n\n91\n00:05:30.109 --> 00:05:34.555\ninto an empty NTFS folder, so,\nwe'll go ahead and do that here.\n\n92\n00:05:34.555 --> 00:05:38.320\nI'll just keep it here under\nmy root here of my C drive.\n\n93\n00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.984\nBut I will go ahead and create a new\nfolder, and we'll just name this,\n\n94\n00:05:43.984 --> 00:05:48.117\nhow about Demo Volume,\nall right, we'll hit OK.\n\n95\n00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.001\nAnd then Next.\n\n96\n00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:58.194\nWe're going to go ahead and,\nlet me zoom in so you guys can see this,\n\n97\n00:05:58.194 --> 00:06:01.950\nkeep that perform a quick\nformat selected here.\n\n98\n00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.475\nBecause I do want to keep these\nall NTFS so I can show you,\n\n99\n00:06:05.475 --> 00:06:07.955\ncreate files inside of these volumes.\n\n100\n00:06:07.955 --> 00:06:11.240\nAnd what we're going to be doing is\nbasically a little experiment here.\n\n101\n00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.187\nTo see how the operating system reacts\nto a simulated hardware failure,\n\n102\n00:06:16.187 --> 00:06:18.870\nso that's what we'll be doing there.\n\n103\n00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.030\nI'll go ahead and hit Next, and Finish.\n\n104\n00:06:29.642 --> 00:06:33.630\nAll right, and so,\nlet me just pull up File Explorer here.\n\n105\n00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.518\nAnd under my C Drive,\nthis is going to be that volume that\n\n106\n00:06:40.518 --> 00:06:45.095\nwe just created, so\nwe see Demo Volume, all right.\n\n107\n00:06:45.095 --> 00:06:50.480\nLet's go ahead and just drop a text\nfile in there, let me zoom out.\n\n108\n00:06:57.601 --> 00:07:01.660\nWe'll just name this one test1.\n\n109\n00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.853\nOkay, minimize that for\nnow, now we can see that.\n\n110\n00:07:08.853 --> 00:07:13.250\nWe have our size over here,\nour first volume, this new volume, and\n\n111\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.750\nit's a healthy, primary partition\nhere on Disk 1, so we're good to go.\n\n112\n00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.741\nWell, what about this\nother space that we have?\n\n113\n00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:24.498\nIf we wanted to really utilize\nour physical hard drives, and\n\n114\n00:07:24.498 --> 00:07:28.260\ntake advantage of what\nwe've already purchased.\n\n115\n00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.150\nThen we could go ahead and\n\n116\n00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.922\nallocate the additional space here in\ndifferent types of configurations.\n\n117\n00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:41.298\nNow I'm not saying to follow this\nmethod in production or in real life,\n\n118\n00:07:41.298 --> 00:07:46.600\nthis is simply a lab or\ndemonstration to show you what you can do.\n\n119\n00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.374\nWhat I'm going to demonstrate doesn't\nmake a lot of sense in production,\n\n120\n00:07:51.374 --> 00:07:54.425\nI just want to show you what will happen,\nokay?\n\n121\n00:07:54.425 --> 00:07:58.456\nSo, we created a simple volume, the next\nthing I want to do is go ahead and\n\n122\n00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:00.119\ncreate a new spanned volume.\n\n123\n00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:01.938\nSo, we'll go ahead and start that wizard.\n\n124\n00:08:01.938 --> 00:08:05.272\nNow, the wizards do look very similar, but\n\n125\n00:08:05.272 --> 00:08:10.785\nreally the configuration and\nthe outcome it's very, very different.\n\n126\n00:08:10.785 --> 00:08:14.883\nSo that's why I wanted to walk through\neach of these individuals, individually,\n\n127\n00:08:14.883 --> 00:08:16.591\naside of, just bear with me here.\n\n128\n00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.590\nWhen we are spanning a volume.\n\n129\n00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.880\nIf you can recall, spanning volumes\nis very similar In my opinion,\n\n130\n00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.150\nto taking that picture of data and\nfolding it up, and\n\n131\n00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.630\nit's spilling over into other cups.\n\n132\n00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.630\nSo, that's the way the data is\nbeing written to the drives and\n\n133\n00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.330\nthe way it's filling those drives up.\n\n134\n00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:46.300\nThe first drive that I had right-clicked\non and initiated this volume creation on,\n\n135\n00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.240\nDisk 1 here It's already\nin the right hand column.\n\n136\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.160\nIt's saying hey,\n\n137\n00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.670\nthis is the one you've already started\nworking with, note the size here.\n\n138\n00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:00.820\nIt's not the full five gigs that we had\noriginally started with for that drive.\n\n139\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.160\nBecause we've already\nallocated at least one gig for\n\n140\n00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.050\nthe creation of that simple volume, so\nthis is the remainder that we have.\n\n141\n00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.190\nSo I'm just going to keep\nthings pretty simple here, and\n\n142\n00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.600\nagain, we'll keep these numbers simple for\nthe demo.\n\n143\n00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.940\nAnd now that is going to\nbe the amount on Disk 1,\n\n144\n00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.460\nthat I'm allocating\ntoward my spanned volume.\n\n145\n00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.720\nSo on the right hand side,\n\n146\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.460\nI have the ability to choose other disks\nthat I wanna include in that array.\n\n147\n00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:33.058\nSo disk number 3, I could go ahead and\nI'm just speaking here randomly.\n\n148\n00:09:33.058 --> 00:09:37.120\nAdd it on over here, and\nthey can also go ahead, and\n\n149\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.230\nI do want you guys to pay\nattention to these numbers here.\n\n150\n00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.200\nI can mix and match in this configuration,\n\n151\n00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.000\nbut some configurations I cannot and the\noperating system will limit me to that.\n\n152\n00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.490\nSo when we get to those, you'll probably\nnotice now that I mention that, so\n\n153\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.150\njust keep that in mind.\n\n154\n00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.180\nSo again, just to keep things simple,\n\n155\n00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.370\nwe'll go ahead and\njust keep a simple number there.\n\n156\n00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.850\nWe'll keep this drive letter as-\n&gt;&gt; Let me back up for just one second.\n\n157\n00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.360\nI think you might have taken it off the,\n\n158\n00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.412\nyeah, just three still has five.\n&gt;&gt; Whoo.\n\n159\n00:10:06.412 --> 00:10:06.926\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n160\n00:10:06.926 --> 00:10:08.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good call, Mike.\n\n161\n00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.100\n&gt;&gt; That's an easy one to do though.\n\n162\n00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:10.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't want to,\n\n163\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.609\nbecause if you click on each one.\n\n164\n00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.916\nThe disc in question should be\nhighlighted in blue if you will.\n\n165\n00:10:17.916 --> 00:10:21.265\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n166\n00:10:21.265 --> 00:10:23.345\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right,\n\n167\n00:10:23.345 --> 00:10:28.070\nand then we will hit next now, [LAUGH].\n\n168\n00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.950\nAnd remember, I was just gonna keep this\nquick volume, quick format selected here.\n\n169\n00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.410\nAnd we did speak about this before,\n\n170\n00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.150\nif you wanted to specify by\nadding specific volume labels,\n\n171\n00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.430\nyou could do that as well, but for\nnow we're just gonna keep that default.\n\n172\n00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.740\nAnd we'll hit finish, okay, you know what?\n\n173\n00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.970\nLet me zoom over so you guys can see this.\n&gt;&gt; That is cool that Windows will\n\n174\n00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:48.860\nconvert them for you.\n\n175\n00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.899\nI'll date myself, and I'll tell ya,\nI remember the day when,\n\n176\n00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:55.838\nthe options were just grilled out, and you\nhad to go convert the drives first, then\n\n177\n00:10:55.838 --> 00:10:58.415\nyou could create those dynamic volumes.\n&gt;&gt; And you remember that too.\n\n178\n00:10:58.415 --> 00:11:01.696\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,it's okay.\n\n179\n00:11:01.696 --> 00:11:05.670\n[LAUGH] So I'll go ahead here and\nwe'll hit okay or\n\n180\n00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.120\nyes because that's what we want to do.\n\n181\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.180\nThe behavior that we want to perform.\n\n182\n00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:19.484\nSo what happened here, let me just\nminimize this for a second, and\n\n183\n00:11:19.484 --> 00:11:22.510\nwe'll put our test file\nin there in one moment.\n\n184\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.680\nBut if I scroll down,\nactually let me pull this up so\n\n185\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.480\nwe give ourselves a little more real\nestate there, you can see disc one.\n\n186\n00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.250\nThat's the disc where we initiated\nthat new volume creation, and\n\n187\n00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.870\nit spanned, now,\nacross to disk three, and remember,\n\n188\n00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.520\nwe did set that 1G size limitation there.\n\n189\n00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.870\nAnd, notice here at the bottom,\nthroughout this demonstration,\n\n190\n00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.260\nwe'll have different\ncolors pop up down here.\n\n191\n00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:55.100\nSo, this is kind of your\nvolume configuration key color\n\n192\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.150\nexplanation.\n&gt;&gt; So we got a pretty purple,\n\n193\n00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.325\nyou'll probably have a nice fancy name for\nthat.\n\n194\n00:12:01.325 --> 00:12:02.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n195\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.590\nit's kind of like\nfuscia,but not as bright.\n\n196\n00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.280\nSo I don't know,\nyou guys tell me what that color is.\n\n197\n00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.000\n&gt;&gt; I had the 16 color box of crayons,\n\n198\n00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.820\nshe had the 128 growing up.\n\n199\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.440\nSo none of those fancy color names.\n\n200\n00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.250\nIt is cool that you can see\nreally quick at a glance,\n\n201\n00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.780\nthat you have that Span volume there.\n\n202\n00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.100\nAnd it shows you the different\npieces that make it up.\n\n203\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:26.120\nYou also notice that the primary\npartition we had on the basic disc,\n\n204\n00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.120\nsoon as that was converted to\ndynamic it's no longer blue.\n\n205\n00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.530\nIt's that golden rod,\nyeah there we go see?\n\n206\n00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.361\nI can give one of those big colors.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n207\n00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:36.210\n&gt;&gt; I converted it to a simple volume\n\n208\n00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.980\ninstead of a primary partition,\ncause' on Dynamics discs,\n\n209\n00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.555\nwe have simple volumes.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, alright.\n\n210\n00:12:41.555 --> 00:12:45.700\n[LAUGHTER] Let's see what other colors we\ncan come up with here Mike, because we\n\n211\n00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.389\nstill have 3GB of unallocated space left.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh!\n\n212\n00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:50.740\nLet's allocate it!\n&gt;&gt; I know, let's allocate it.\n\n213\n00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, we've seen SPAN,\n\n214\n00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.172\nwe've seen simple, so what's next?\n&gt;&gt; How about striped?\n\n215\n00:12:54.172 --> 00:12:54.716\n&gt;&gt; I like it,\n\n216\n00:12:54.716 --> 00:12:56.060\nlet's do striped.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n217\n00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.530\n&gt;&gt; And striped, you were telling us,\n\n218\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.830\nis much like grade one, grade zero.\n&gt;&gt; Grade\n\n219\n00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:01.389\nzero.\n&gt;&gt; Grade zero.\n\n220\n00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:02.206\n&gt;&gt; For our stripes, yes.\n\n221\n00:13:02.206 --> 00:13:06.760\nYeah so if we think aboutm you know that\nwe're striping the information across\n\n222\n00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.141\nthese disks here, but\nwe're not adding any parody bits,\n\n223\n00:13:10.141 --> 00:13:12.910\nwe're not getting any\nredundancy out of this.\n\n224\n00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.480\nWe're just striping for performance, so\n\n225\n00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.430\nthat's where the benefit lies.\n&gt;&gt; We can launch our new striped\n\n226\n00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.510\nvolume wizard,\nagain this part looks pretty similar.\n\n227\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.370\nWe see the drive where we are initially\nbeginning, and let's go ahead and\n\n228\n00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:31.570\njust stripe it across disc two and\ndisk three here.\n\n229\n00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.910\nAnd if go ahead and change, this was that\n3 gigs remaining, and we go ahead and\n\n230\n00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.010\nchange that to 1 gig,\n\n231\n00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:44.570\nlook at what it does to those\nother disc allocation sizes there.\n\n232\n00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:49.580\nSo it's pretty cool, if you think about\nit, like we see with like our raid\n\n233\n00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:55.380\nconfigurations, like read5 and\nanywhere where we're striping that data.\n\n234\n00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.210\nWith raid configurations,\nyou have to be strict about,\n\n235\n00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:03.610\nyou really wanna have drives that\nhave the same RPM and the same size.\n\n236\n00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:08.410\nAnd it's not a bad idea to even get them\nfrom the same hard drive manufacturer, so\n\n237\n00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.600\nthey're very similar.\n\n238\n00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.580\nHere, you can make best use of\nthe disks that you do have,\n\n239\n00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.080\neven if they're not exactly similar.\n\n240\n00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:22.321\nBut, it's pointless in a physical\nraid configuration to have,\n\n241\n00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:26.705\nyou know, two 500 Gig drives and\na terabyte drive,\n\n242\n00:14:26.705 --> 00:14:32.351\nbecause 500 Gigs of that terabyte\ndrive will be wasted basically.\n\n243\n00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:36.686\nSo this just kind of mimics that, and\nyou can actually see it in the operating\n\n244\n00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:39.502\nsystem, so that's pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; There it is, So\n\n245\n00:14:39.502 --> 00:14:43.867\na span we can make each piece a different\nsize it doesn't matter with a stripe each\n\n246\n00:14:43.867 --> 00:14:48.580\npiece has to be the same size.\n&gt;&gt; We'll go ahead and\n\n247\n00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.420\nhit next here and\nagain I'll perform that quick format.\n\n248\n00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.200\nYou guys know the drill, and finish,\nagain we're getting that same notification\n\n249\n00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.160\nwe had seen before.\n&gt;&gt; And this was because you\n\n250\n00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.940\npicked a third drive that wasn't\nconverted in that previous process?\n\n251\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you can see it.\n\n252\n00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.680\nI mean, even if you guys go through the,\nsee that disk,\n\n253\n00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.385\nwhich one was that?\n&gt;&gt; It was two just got\n\n254\n00:15:09.385 --> 00:15:10.111\nconverted.\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n\n255\n00:15:10.111 --> 00:15:10.680\nYeah, do dynamic.\n\n256\n00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.960\nAnd let me zoom out here.\n\n257\n00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.650\nSo what happened before when I minimized,\nwas our volume E popped up here.\n\n258\n00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:23.387\nAnd then the interface in file\nexplorer just to show us like, hey,\n\n259\n00:15:23.387 --> 00:15:26.910\nthis is where volume E is, and\nnow same thing for volume F.\n\n260\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.700\nSo while we're here,\nlet's just go ahead and\n\n261\n00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.770\ncreate a couple of text documents as well.\n\n262\n00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:39.170\nSo we'll just label this one test F for\nthat document.\n\n263\n00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:44.210\nAnd then hop on over here to volume E, and\n\n264\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.300\nwe'll create test E.\n\n265\n00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.078\nAll right.\n\n266\n00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:04.731\nOkay, so, we have Our documents there.\n\n267\n00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:07.360\nThe last one that we wanna go ahead and\ntake a look at, and\n\n268\n00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.510\nwhat color is that, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I would say green, but\n\n269\n00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.600\nI know that's not right.\n&gt;&gt; Your shirt is green.\n\n270\n00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.510\nI would say like a teal color.\n\n271\n00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.010\n&gt;&gt; Teal?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n272\n00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.340\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n273\n00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.260\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n274\n00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.200\nwe have 2 gigs of an allocated space here.\n\n275\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.080\nLet's go ahead and\ncreate a mirrored volume.\n\n276\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.471\nSo this is gonna be similar to that RAID1,\n\n277\n00:16:29.471 --> 00:16:33.910\nMike, where we're utilizing\na two-way mirror here.\n\n278\n00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.220\nSo we're basically getting a 50%\nefficiency out of the deal.\n\n279\n00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.530\nThat's definitely something to consider\nbecause we're not getting the most bang\n\n280\n00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:41.500\nfor our buck.\n\n281\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.810\nBut here, we're not really in it for\nperformance, we're in it for\n\n282\n00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:46.740\nthat redundancy.\n\n283\n00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.640\nSo that's the advantage.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n284\n00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.210\nand that's something I don't think\nwe mentioned with the spanned or\n\n285\n00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.880\nstriped, we get to use all of\nthe space that we allocate.\n\n286\n00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.100\nSo if we take 1 gig from here and\n1 gig from there on our spanned volume,\n\n287\n00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.950\nwe get 2 gigs of usable storage space.\n\n288\n00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.316\nIf we make a stripe of 1 gig\nin size across three drives,\n\n289\n00:17:06.316 --> 00:17:11.580\nwe've got 3gigabytes of usable storage\nspace in that volume that we created.\n\n290\n00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:16.230\nWe do a mirror, if it's a gigabyte, it's\ngonna take a gigabyte off of two drives.\n\n291\n00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.666\nBut you're only going to get, so\nyou have 2 gigabytes being used, but\n\n292\n00:17:19.666 --> 00:17:22.201\nyou only have 1 gigabyte of storage space,\nright?\n\n293\n00:17:22.201 --> 00:17:25.170\nCuz you have to duplicate or\nstore everything twice.\n\n294\n00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.820\n&gt;&gt; That's correct, yeah.\n\n295\n00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.371\nAnd if you're looking for,\nif you have important information,\n\n296\n00:17:30.371 --> 00:17:33.690\nthen that's what you're looking for.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're not as concerned with the,\n\n297\n00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.730\nyou're okay giving up a little bit of\nstorage space for that redundancy,\n\n298\n00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:38.460\nthat piece of mind.\n\n299\n00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:43.086\nIf they're mission critical files, this\nis one of the ways you can protect them.\n\n300\n00:17:43.086 --> 00:17:43.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n301\n00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:48.060\nlet's zoom out a little bit so I can just\nthink about this, who we want to mirror.\n\n302\n00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.684\nI mean, we still have quite a bit of\n\n303\n00:17:49.684 --> 00:17:50.310\nspace.\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n\n304\n00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.500\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna save Disk 4 for\n\n305\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.270\nsome other demo that we're going to.\n\n306\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.890\nSo let's just go ahead and mirror here-\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it on 2 and 3.\n\n307\n00:17:58.890 --> 00:17:59.932\nCan you remove Drive 1?\n\n308\n00:17:59.932 --> 00:18:02.820\nDrive 1 has always appeared in\nthere because you clicked on it.\n\n309\n00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.870\nWhat if you didn't want to use that?\n\n310\n00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.437\nCan you remove that and add two others?\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's try.\n\n311\n00:18:05.437 --> 00:18:08.158\nLet's go ahead, and let me zoom in so\nwe can watch that and\n\n312\n00:18:08.158 --> 00:18:09.700\nsee what happens there, Mike.\n\n313\n00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.900\nAll right, so Disk 1 is highlighted.\n\n314\n00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.290\nThat's where we started.\n\n315\n00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.880\nWe go ahead and\nmove it onto the other side.\n\n316\n00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.690\nI have the wizard still initiated.\n\n317\n00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.770\nAnd you wanted to go ahead and do 2 and 3?\n\n318\n00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.850\nSo we'll move 2 on over, and 3 on over.\n\n319\n00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:31.010\nAnd again, I didn't modify the size yet.\n\n320\n00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.260\nSo notice how that they are the same.\n\n321\n00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:38.230\nBut if I were to go ahead and\nsay 1 gig here,\n\n322\n00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.180\na mirror, again, if it's an exact replica,\n\n323\n00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.630\nthen it's gonna need the same amount of\nstorage space to go ahead and utilize.\n\n324\n00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.182\nSo that's why you see\nthat happening there.\n\n325\n00:18:47.182 --> 00:18:48.273\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n326\n00:18:48.273 --> 00:18:49.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, moment of truth here.\n\n327\n00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:55.717\nWe'll go ahead and keep to that G\nletter format, and see what happens.\n\n328\n00:18:55.717 --> 00:19:00.670\n&gt;&gt; All right, here we go.\n\n329\n00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.418\nDrum roll, please.\n\n330\n00:19:02.418 --> 00:19:02.924\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We don't have a drum roll.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so-\n\n331\n00:19:02.924 --> 00:19:04.150\n&gt;&gt; Still working on that sound board for\n\n332\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.435\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know [LAUGH].\n\n333\n00:19:06.435 --> 00:19:08.929\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at that here.\n\n334\n00:19:10.893 --> 00:19:16.876\nAll right, so let me just see something\nwith this particular Disk 2 and\n\n335\n00:19:16.876 --> 00:19:19.878\nDisk 3.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna call that red.\n\n336\n00:19:19.878 --> 00:19:23.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's [LAUGH] how about crimson?\n\n337\n00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.450\n&gt;&gt; Crimson would work.\n\n338\n00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:25.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n339\n00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.910\nI'm trying to think if this\nis the right color for\n\n340\n00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.670\nthat because it looks a little wrong.\n&gt;&gt; Let's check our key out at the bottom.\n\n341\n00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:33.176\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n342\n00:19:33.176 --> 00:19:34.648\nlet's see what's going on here.\n\n343\n00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:39.160\nOkay, so it says mirrored volume.\n\n344\n00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.448\nI'm just paranoid,\nI feel like red is a warning.\n\n345\n00:19:41.448 --> 00:19:42.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n346\n00:19:42.335 --> 00:19:46.730\nthat's why it's crimson and not red.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There you go [LAUGH].\n\n347\n00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.380\nHow clever, Mike.\n\n348\n00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.740\nSo I guess to answer to your question,\nwe started on one drive and\n\n349\n00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.751\nthen decided to change half way through.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n350\n00:19:53.751 --> 00:19:54.800\nused different drives.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n351\n00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.987\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, I like it.\n\n352\n00:19:55.987 --> 00:20:02.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we have 2 gigs, and let's see.\n\n353\n00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.286\nOkay, I know why I wanted to keep\nthem all on the same one, but\n\n354\n00:20:07.286 --> 00:20:09.038\nthat's okay.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we were gonna, yeah,\n\n355\n00:20:09.038 --> 00:20:12.680\nI know what you're talking about.\n&gt;&gt; I was going to pull that drive out, but\n\n356\n00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.560\nthat's okay.\n\n357\n00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.082\nWe will do two separate hardware\nfailures for this demo.\n\n358\n00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:18.746\n&gt;&gt; Disk 3 has each one of them on there,\n\n359\n00:20:18.746 --> 00:20:21.840\nexcept for the simple volume, I think.\n&gt;&gt; That wold work, then.\n\n360\n00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.440\nYeah, let's kill Disk 3.\n\n361\n00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.288\nOkay.\n\n362\n00:20:24.288 --> 00:20:28.795\n[LAUGH] All right, so that's what\nwe're about to do right now, guys.\n\n363\n00:20:28.795 --> 00:20:34.870\nSo currently, if we see the status is\non-line, I'm faking a hardware failure.\n\n364\n00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.420\nSo what I'm gonna do is just,\nwait do we create a mirror?\n\n365\n00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.950\nNo, we need to do that.\n\n366\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.000\nWe didn't put anything in G, so\nlet me just kinda clean up here,\n\n367\n00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.215\ndo some house keeping.\n\n368\n00:20:44.215 --> 00:20:49.390\nAnd go in to our G volume.\n\n369\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.582\nAnd I do wanna create a document because\nthat's what this whole experiment was\n\n370\n00:20:53.582 --> 00:20:54.478\nabout, right?\n\n371\n00:20:54.478 --> 00:20:56.810\nSo this was test G.\n\n372\n00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:59.470\nAnd we'll go ahead, and\nI've been mixing upper and lower case,\n\n373\n00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.810\nwhich is probably just my OCD kicking in,\nbut all right.\n\n374\n00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:03.800\nGood to go.\n\n375\n00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.750\nTest G is in there in Volume G.\n\n376\n00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.640\nSo, and that's kinda interesting.\n\n377\n00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.409\nWhat we've seen from the end\nuser's perspective is we\n\n378\n00:21:11.409 --> 00:21:14.490\ndon't see multiple disks,\nwe just see that volume letter.\n\n379\n00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.710\nSo it's easy for\nthem to access and associate.\n\n380\n00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:24.200\nSo if we're on the backend changing our\ndifferent drives and swapping them out and\n\n381\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:29.600\nupgrading them as needed, which if you\nlook at things like your mean time\n\n382\n00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.190\nto failure, you can estimate lifes of hard\ndisk drives, especially if you've had\n\n383\n00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:39.330\nthe system up and running and it sees\nthe same amount of usage over time.\n\n384\n00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:43.000\nSo you can be proactive in replacing\nyour drives, especially if you're using\n\n385\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.670\nmirrored configurations, and\nyou'll see why in just one minute.\n\n386\n00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.690\nSo we've gotten Disk 3 online, but\n\n387\n00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:52.160\nwe're gonna go ahead,\nbring it offline to simulate that failure.\n\n388\n00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.840\nAnd then, we'll look at the behavior for\neach one of those volumes here.\n\n389\n00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.210\nSo now,\nyou can see that this drive is offline.\n\n390\n00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:02.520\nNotice the actual status here.\n\n391\n00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.135\nSo you see this, that we have\nthese drives that have failed,\n\n392\n00:22:07.135 --> 00:22:09.678\nfailed redundancy, all right?\n\n393\n00:22:09.678 --> 00:22:14.920\nAnd the unallocated, that is not\naffected in this simulation here.\n\n394\n00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.980\nBut let's check out how\nthe data would be affected,\n\n395\n00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.850\nand that's really what we\nreally wanted to do here.\n\n396\n00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.430\nSo let's see.\n\n397\n00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.260\nI'm trying to think,\nwhat was that first mounted folder?\n\n398\n00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.160\n&gt;&gt; That one was on our C drive, Disk 1.\n\n399\n00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so demo volume.\n\n400\n00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.650\nAll right, and\nthat was going to be Disk 1.\n\n401\n00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.270\nWe didn't do anything to Disk 1 there, so\n\n402\n00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.130\nthat one shouldn't be affected at all,\njust to verify.\n\n403\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.550\nWe're good to go there, all right?\n\n404\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.730\nNow, but let's take a look at each one\nof those other volumes that we had\n\n405\n00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:48.350\ncreated here.\n\n406\n00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:54.400\nAll right, so inside of Volume G,\nthat's the only one I see.\n\n407\n00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.178\nAnd let me zoom in so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n408\n00:22:57.178 --> 00:23:00.600\nThat's the only drive that I see\npresent here in File Explorer\n\n409\n00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.970\n&gt;&gt; And that was our mirrored volume.\n\n410\n00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:03.040\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n411\n00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.060\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n412\n00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:12.420\nSo this is text document, and you can see\nit is associated with that volume, test G.\n\n413\n00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.823\nAnd that is because we still have access\nto the data because it was just a replica.\n\n414\n00:23:16.823 --> 00:23:21.229\nRemember, we said that's the only\nconfiguration that will actually preserve\n\n415\n00:23:21.229 --> 00:23:25.236\nthat data if there were any kind of\nhardware, or it could even be, yeah,\n\n416\n00:23:25.236 --> 00:23:30.630\nany kind of hardware failure in there,\nlike corruption or whatever, mechanical.\n\n417\n00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.770\nSo I guess that shows us\nwhat we wanted to see,\n\n418\n00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:35.810\nMike.\n&gt;&gt; yeah, so\n\n419\n00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:40.260\nit does prove to us that a span volume,\none of the things you gotta\n\n420\n00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.620\nremember about those span volume\ntypes is that you get no redundancy.\n\n421\n00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.930\nSo if any one of those drives fails\nthat contains a part of the span,\n\n422\n00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.200\nthe entire span volume is gone.\n\n423\n00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.143\nWhich is why we probably\nwill never use span volumes.\n\n424\n00:23:53.143 --> 00:23:56.012\nRare circumstance that you're\ngonna use one of those.\n\n425\n00:23:56.012 --> 00:24:00.287\nOccasionally, I've got a D drive and\nI just need to add more space to it.\n\n426\n00:24:00.287 --> 00:24:01.896\nAnd maybe I've got mappings going on.\n\n427\n00:24:01.896 --> 00:24:06.319\nOr for some reason, I don't wanna teach\nthe end user about another drive letter.\n\n428\n00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:10.729\nI could span that drive onto\nanother disk and add space to it.\n\n429\n00:24:10.729 --> 00:24:14.480\nBut I'm simply adding another point of\nfailure without getting any redundancy or\n\n430\n00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.825\nany performance benefit.\n\n431\n00:24:15.825 --> 00:24:17.590\nCuz it's only writing\nto one disk at a time.\n\n432\n00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:24.030\nSo I'm getting absolutely nothing\nin gaining, Failure points, right?\n\n433\n00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.680\nSo never gonna use those.\n&gt;&gt; And actually,\n\n434\n00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.230\nthat's why this configuration,\nlike I've told you before,\n\n435\n00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:33.040\nit's on the exam currently\nas an objective.\n\n436\n00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.041\nBut in real life you really don't\nwanna be starting up, create,\n\n437\n00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:38.949\nand utilizing dynamic disks.\n\n438\n00:24:38.949 --> 00:24:45.833\nIf you're starting a storage,\njust any kind of storage units.\n\n439\n00:24:45.833 --> 00:24:48.700\nYou wanna go ahead and\nstart with storage spaces.\n\n440\n00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.820\nBecause storage spaces takes this concept,\nand brings it to a whole other level.\n\n441\n00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.383\nThat's what it's really created\nto do is replace dynamic disks.\n\n442\n00:24:56.383 --> 00:24:59.690\nI'm showing you this so that you're\nprepared for it for the exam, but\n\n443\n00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.679\nin real life you're gonna wanna\nlean towards storage spaces.\n\n444\n00:25:02.679 --> 00:25:05.257\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely and the stripped volume\n\n445\n00:25:05.257 --> 00:25:08.150\nalso failed, all right,\n&gt;&gt; We might use those now and\n\n446\n00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.645\nagain because you do get one benefit and\nthat's performance, right.\n\n447\n00:25:11.645 --> 00:25:13.673\nI can write a whole lot faster,\n\n448\n00:25:13.673 --> 00:25:17.530\nread a little bit faster when\nit comes to that stripe.\n\n449\n00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.110\nI'm still increasing my points of failure.\n\n450\n00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:23.082\nEvery single drive that I add to that\nstripe is gonna be a point of failure.\n\n451\n00:25:23.082 --> 00:25:26.936\nAnd any one of those drives fails,\nI lose all of that data.\n\n452\n00:25:26.936 --> 00:25:28.888\nBut now I've got to weigh it, right?\n\n453\n00:25:28.888 --> 00:25:33.106\nOkay, I'm increasing my risk of failure,\nbut I'm also increasing my performance,\n\n454\n00:25:33.106 --> 00:25:34.040\nis it worth it?\n\n455\n00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.000\nYou might have something that you really\nneed the most performance you can get, and\n\n456\n00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.610\nyou're not worried about redundancy.\n\n457\n00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.370\nIt's page file type stuff,\ntemporary storage.\n\n458\n00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.390\nAnd you wanna be able to\ngo as fast as you can.\n\n459\n00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.080\nAnd if something happens to the drive and\n\n460\n00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.050\nyou lose that volume,\nno big deal, it's recreate-able.\n\n461\n00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:53.040\nSo there you might see a use case for\na stripe,\n\n462\n00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.730\nthe mirror is the one that survived.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n463\n00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.700\nlet's take a look at that too\nto see what happens with that.\n\n464\n00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.540\nBecause what if we were actually\nable to replace that hard drive?\n\n465\n00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.773\nOr just, maybe it was a loose cable or\nsomething and we wiggle, we unattach and\n\n466\n00:26:06.773 --> 00:26:07.428\nreattach.\n\n467\n00:26:07.428 --> 00:26:10.071\nSo let's go ahead and bring it back\non see what happens there Mike with\n\n468\n00:26:10.071 --> 00:26:10.668\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n\n469\n00:26:10.668 --> 00:26:11.222\n&gt;&gt; All right so\n\n470\n00:26:11.222 --> 00:26:15.056\nlet's bring this drive online, that's\nall I'm doing is right clicking there.\n\n471\n00:26:15.056 --> 00:26:19.525\nAnd let me just close out of volume E,\nwhich you see volume E pop up and\n\n472\n00:26:19.525 --> 00:26:24.006\nvolume F pop up automatically, so\nthat's a good sign right there.\n\n473\n00:26:24.006 --> 00:26:26.853\nI already have that data back, but\n\n474\n00:26:26.853 --> 00:26:31.967\nlet's take a look at these two,\nthis volume here, volume G.\n\n475\n00:26:31.967 --> 00:26:32.954\nThat's what we were really focused on.\n\n476\n00:26:32.954 --> 00:26:35.858\nWe were really worried about that or\ntrying to see how that would behave.\n\n477\n00:26:35.858 --> 00:26:39.390\nBut just note, we do have the other\ndata back, it's still on the drive,\n\n478\n00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:43.120\nlike it wasn't corrupted\nin this simulation.\n\n479\n00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.571\nBut that could potentially happen.\n\n480\n00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:50.108\nFor this mirrored volume, let's go\nahead and hit Reactivate Volume, and\n\n481\n00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:53.360\nit's just recommending that\nwe utilize check disk.\n\n482\n00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.084\nWhich is something that we probably would\nwanna do just to make sure that our files\n\n483\n00:26:58.084 --> 00:27:02.480\nweren't corrupted or anything,\nespecially if there's an unexpected.\n\n484\n00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.494\nNotice the status here,\nresynching, and the percentage.\n\n485\n00:27:06.494 --> 00:27:11.464\nSo what you're doing here it's making\nsure that both of those physical disks\n\n486\n00:27:11.464 --> 00:27:13.763\nhave the same data written to them.\n\n487\n00:27:13.763 --> 00:27:16.130\nThey're just checking to make\nsure we're good to go here.\n\n488\n00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:19.599\nSo they'll take a moment,\nespecially if you have a lot of data and\n\n489\n00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:22.270\nit's larger drives.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if something has\n\n490\n00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.530\nchanged since that mirror had broken and\nnow you reestablish that mirror.\n\n491\n00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.092\nIt needs to update the other\ncopy with any of those changes.\n\n492\n00:27:29.092 --> 00:27:32.630\nProbably also important to note that what\nwe're doing is a little different here.\n\n493\n00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.311\nBy reactivating that drive,\nwe saw the span volume and\n\n494\n00:27:36.311 --> 00:27:39.490\nthe stripe volume come back to life.\n\n495\n00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:43.554\nWhich is cool, but in a real world\nscenario where you had a hard drive\n\n496\n00:27:43.554 --> 00:27:46.635\nfailure and\nyou had to replace that physical disc.\n\n497\n00:27:46.635 --> 00:27:49.726\nThat contained part of that span volume or\ncontained part of that stripe.\n\n498\n00:27:49.726 --> 00:27:50.534\n&gt;&gt; Good point, yes.\n\n499\n00:27:50.534 --> 00:27:51.489\n&gt;&gt; They're not going to come back, right?\n\n500\n00:27:51.489 --> 00:27:52.464\n&gt;&gt; The data's gone.\n\n501\n00:27:52.464 --> 00:27:53.254\n&gt;&gt; The data is gone,\n\n502\n00:27:53.254 --> 00:27:55.580\ncuz you're putting in a new hard drive.\n&gt;&gt; It's empty.\n\n503\n00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this was a little bit of magic.\n\n504\n00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.172\nBecause the fact that we\nbrought the same drive,\n\n505\n00:28:00.172 --> 00:28:02.717\nthat already had part of that stripe,\nback to life.\n\n506\n00:28:02.717 --> 00:28:05.009\nWhich is another real world scenario,\nlike you said-\n\n507\n00:28:05.009 --> 00:28:06.636\n&gt;&gt; If the cable was loose maybe, but\n\n508\n00:28:06.636 --> 00:28:08.705\nthat's like wishful thinking, right?\n\n509\n00:28:08.705 --> 00:28:10.118\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, but just,\n\n510\n00:28:10.118 --> 00:28:13.926\nin the real world, understand that if\nthe drive fails and you replaced it with\n\n511\n00:28:13.926 --> 00:28:17.104\na brand new drive that you got from\nthe big box store or whatever.\n\n512\n00:28:17.104 --> 00:28:21.034\nUnderstand your stripe and\nyour span volume are not gonna come back,\n\n513\n00:28:21.034 --> 00:28:24.850\nyou need to have a backup of those.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we are just about out of\n\n514\n00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.388\ntime but I did wanna point our\na couple of things as well.\n\n515\n00:28:27.388 --> 00:28:31.690\nWithin this category,\nyou do see your options here,\n\n516\n00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.835\ndown here at the bottom,\nlet me, is that, no that's my.\n\n517\n00:28:34.835 --> 00:28:41.617\nAll right, yes, CD-ROM, so\nyou see this here with our format for\n\n518\n00:28:41.617 --> 00:28:45.930\nthat drive bay there.\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n\n519\n00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.450\n&gt;&gt; You're not able to go ahead and\n\n520\n00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:51.030\nperform a lot of functions\nthat you do with the.\n\n521\n00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:56.690\nLet's say if I wanted to convert\nfrom basic, or excuse me,\n\n522\n00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.300\nfrom mdr to gpt or something like that.\n\n523\n00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.890\nIt doesn't allow you as much flexibility\nas you would have with the other\n\n524\n00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:03.750\ndrives there.\n\n525\n00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:08.470\nAnd let me just plug in a flash drive\nreal quick and see if this pops up,\n\n526\n00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:11.360\nif I've configured this ahead of time.\n\n527\n00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.070\nWe'll give it one second there,\nall right cool.\n\n528\n00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.610\nSo we do see it here in the operating\nsystem and let me go ahead and\n\n529\n00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.450\njust either close or\nminimize out of there.\n\n530\n00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:27.030\nAnd I do wanna just point\nout the fact that we\n\n531\n00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:31.900\nare noted to the fact that this\nUSB drive here is removable media.\n\n532\n00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:37.960\nSo you should be able to go ahead and\nwork with it in that way.\n\n533\n00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.520\nNow, we talked about\ndifferent file systems, and\n\n534\n00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.860\nif you wanted to go ahead and format them,\nthis is just the notification.\n\n535\n00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.890\nRemember, any time you're doing a format,\nthat data is gonna be lost.\n\n536\n00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.890\nI'm gonna say, Yes.\n\n537\n00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.880\nWhen, no, I have an unexpected error.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n538\n00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.125\n&gt;&gt; I thought that this drive was already\n\n539\n00:29:55.125 --> 00:29:58.971\nformatted as XFAT and\nthat's what I wanted to show you really.\n\n540\n00:29:58.971 --> 00:30:01.509\nIs and just talk about that for a second,\n\n541\n00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:06.075\nso just note different operating\nsystems have preferred file systems.\n\n542\n00:30:06.075 --> 00:30:10.014\nLike I said before NTFS for\nyour Windows Operating Systems.\n\n543\n00:30:10.014 --> 00:30:16.368\nWhat is it for Mac, HFS plus.\n\n544\n00:30:16.368 --> 00:30:20.639\nFor having that compatibility\nbetween like Mac to Windows,\n\n545\n00:30:20.639 --> 00:30:22.908\nthen XFAT is the way to go there.\n\n546\n00:30:22.908 --> 00:30:24.375\nNormally you would be able to format it,\n\n547\n00:30:24.375 --> 00:30:26.750\nI don't know what's going\non with this one right now.\n\n548\n00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:30.168\nIt takes a pretty good beating\nfrom all the stuff that I do.\n\n549\n00:30:30.168 --> 00:30:31.505\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n550\n00:30:31.505 --> 00:30:33.480\n&gt;&gt; So all right, removable CD,\n\n551\n00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.030\nDVD, I think I showed\nyou everything there.\n\n552\n00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:40.020\nWe still have more to cover, but I think\nwe are out of time right now, Mike.\n\n553\n00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.778\n&gt;&gt; We are a little bit over, but\n\n554\n00:30:41.778 --> 00:30:46.848\nI think it was good information, so\nIt's okay, going a little bit long, right?\n\n555\n00:30:46.848 --> 00:30:49.319\nAll right well hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching these, and\n\n556\n00:30:49.319 --> 00:30:50.433\nthese great demonstrations.\n\n557\n00:30:50.433 --> 00:30:53.405\nSigning off ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n558\n00:30:53.405 --> 00:30:54.088\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n559\n00:30:54.088 --> 00:31:00.870\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.648 --> 00:00:07.967\n[MUSIC]\nYou're watching\n\n4\n00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:12.067\nITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:13.520\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.046\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:18.762\nToday, we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n8\n00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:19.876\nIn this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:25.090\nwe're continuing our thought process\non configuring disks and volumes.\n\n10\n00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.610\nAnd back in studio again is none\nother than Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.430\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.830\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n13\n00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.330\nSo what do we have next with volumes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's one of those things,\n\n14\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.250\nI'm not sure exactly where we\nleft off in the last show.\n\n15\n00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.270\nI think we were just really\nplaying around in disc management,\n\n16\n00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.000\nlooking at the different types of\ndiscs that we have available, and\n\n17\n00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.060\nwe were looking at the different\nconfigurations that we could work with.\n\n18\n00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.460\nWe saw in the graphical user\ninterface how we could go ahead and\n\n19\n00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.110\nchange discs from basic to dynamic and\nvice versa.\n\n20\n00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.426\nSo in this show, I wanted to spend some\ntime here in Command line interfaces,\n\n21\n00:00:57.426 --> 00:01:00.380\nnotably DiskPart in PowerShell.\n\n22\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.310\nSo DiskPart has been our historic,\noldie but goodie.\n\n23\n00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.650\nAnd as a matter of fact, it's crazy,\n\n24\n00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.030\nI was just talking to Wes\nabout this the other day.\n\n25\n00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.360\nFdisk was actually around before DiskPart.\n&gt;&gt; Wow, yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.840\n&gt;&gt; So that's bringing it way back.\n\n27\n00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.160\n&gt;&gt; Way back.\n\n28\n00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n29\n00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.770\nit's kind of interesting, I think I\nmight have referenced in other shows.\n\n30\n00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.318\nSome of the PowerShell commandlets\nthat you might expect to be there for\n\n31\n00:01:22.318 --> 00:01:28.610\ndisk management purposes, associated\nwith dynamic disks, really aren't there,\n\n32\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.750\nbecause they're really pushing us\ninto that storage spaces mentality.\n\n33\n00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.835\nAnd that's something that we'll\nget to look at in another show.\n\n34\n00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:40.265\nBut I think for now, let's go ahead and\njust kinda take a moment to look at\n\n35\n00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:45.501\nMicrosoft's documentation here, that\nreally references just some information we\n\n36\n00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:50.734\nmight want to know about this conversion\nprocess here, whenever we're going from,\n\n37\n00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:54.834\nin this particular article they're\nlooking at dynamic to basic.\n\n38\n00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:57.390\nSo if you were doing it that way.\n\n39\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.255\nAnd I think we did speak about this,\nMike, but it's very important to note.\n\n40\n00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:04.289\nSupposedly, if you take\nyour basic disc and\n\n41\n00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.300\nperform a conversion to dynamic\nthe data will be retained.\n\n42\n00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.030\nConversely, not the case.\n\n43\n00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.320\nSo either way,\n\n44\n00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.630\nI would highly recommend you backing\nup your data in both instances.\n\n45\n00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.880\nBut always Microsoft will tell you to go\nahead and back up if you're converting\n\n46\n00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.840\nfrom dynamic back down to basic.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, backing it up, going from basic\n\n47\n00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.160\nto dynamic is like a a safety net,\nbecause your data should still be there.\n\n48\n00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.640\nBut in case something goes wrong,\nyou gotta backup.\n\n49\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.060\nGoing from dynamic back to basic,\nyou don't have a choice.\n\n50\n00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.850\nYour data will be gone when\nyou do that conversion.\n\n51\n00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.625\nSo you have to do that backup.\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n52\n00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:43.710\nAnd you might think, well,\nwhy would someone want to go ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.110\ngo back to basic if dynamic\nis like the coolest?\n\n54\n00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.505\nBut, it's really not.\n\n55\n00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:53.300\nBut there are reasons why someone\nwould wanna just go back to basic, and\n\n56\n00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.040\nsome of those reasons may be if\nyou had a multiboot environment.\n\n57\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.990\nSo if you think about that, dynamic\ndisks don't play well with multiboot.\n\n58\n00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.130\nSo if you're working with dynamic disks,\n\n59\n00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.230\nthe operating system that you're currently\nin to set those disks to dynamic,\n\n60\n00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.800\nwill be able to retain and understand,\nand work with those dynamic disks.\n\n61\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.860\nBut if you go to boot up\nthe other operating system,\n\n62\n00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.740\nyou're gonna have problems.\n\n63\n00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.260\nThey're not gonna recognize those disks.\n\n64\n00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.210\nIt's just not supported in that fashion,\nso definitely one thing to consider there.\n\n65\n00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.950\nAnother thing, I don't know if we talked\nabout this too much when we were looking\n\n66\n00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.360\nat our disks, but removable media.\n\n67\n00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.675\nAnd if you think about it, it kinda\nmakes sense, the configurations and\n\n68\n00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:41.180\nthe logic, when we're striping or\nspanning data across multiple disks.\n\n69\n00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.631\nAnd the end user's seeing, and\n\n70\n00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:46.030\nthe operating system is seeing those\ndisks as one logical unit of storage.\n\n71\n00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.850\nWhat happens if I rip one out and\nput it in another machine?\n\n72\n00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.590\nWell, part of my volume is missing.\n\n73\n00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.630\nSo other machines, physical machines,\n\n74\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.790\nif I take a flash drive and\nplug it into Mike's computer,\n\n75\n00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.310\nhis operating system's not gonna know\nwhat to do with that disk there.\n\n76\n00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.470\nSo, you may wanna go ahead and\ndo some configuring,\n\n77\n00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.410\nget that removable disk out\nof that particular volume.\n\n78\n00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.290\nJust kind of like move your\ndata around a bit, and\n\n79\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.083\nthen drop it back down to basic so\nthat you can reuse that disk, or\n\n80\n00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:22.270\nformat it, or\nwork with it in any way that you want to.\n\n81\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.457\nSo there are some reasons\nwhy you'd wanna go ahead and\n\n82\n00:04:24.457 --> 00:04:26.600\ndo that.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, well,\n\n83\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.380\nlet's see, how do we go about doing it?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, let me see,\n\n84\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.000\nI don't think I have disk\nmanagement pulled up here.\n\n85\n00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.370\nLet me just minimize this and\nget a machine up here for us.\n\n86\n00:04:39.007 --> 00:04:40.850\nAll right, one second there.\n\n87\n00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.110\nAll right, and, yeah.\n\n88\n00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.610\nI was looking.\n\n89\n00:04:48.602 --> 00:04:50.732\nAll right, so here in disk management,\n\n90\n00:04:50.732 --> 00:04:53.750\nI've added a couple of drives\njust you guys can see this.\n\n91\n00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.384\nI think we've looked at it in\na couple of other shows as well.\n\n92\n00:04:57.384 --> 00:05:02.273\nBut I'm just going to unselect\nthem because we've already\n\n93\n00:05:02.273 --> 00:05:07.660\nworked with the drives in disk management,\ninitializing them.\n\n94\n00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.486\nSo for right now,\nwe'll just not initialize them.\n\n95\n00:05:11.486 --> 00:05:13.370\nWe'll just hit Hold on.\n\n96\n00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.091\nIt wants me to go ahead and initialize at\nleast one of these, so we'll just do that.\n\n97\n00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:21.544\nAt lest, we'll know disk 2 here is\ngoing to be not initialized for\n\n98\n00:05:21.544 --> 00:05:23.590\nthe remainder of the demonstrations.\n\n99\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.240\nWe've got a couple discs there.\n\n100\n00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.170\nLet me zoom out so\nwe can actually see that.\n\n101\n00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.495\nGo full-screen.\n\n102\n00:05:30.495 --> 00:05:35.473\nNow, lets create a volume so\nyou can see how that works here\n\n103\n00:05:35.473 --> 00:05:40.360\nin the GUI with, and\nwe just need any kind of volume here.\n\n104\n00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.020\nSo we'll just go ahead with\na simple volume, the full size.\n\n105\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.840\nSounds good to me.\n\n106\n00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.750\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; Nice quick\n\n107\n00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.822\nformat.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n108\n00:05:48.822 --> 00:05:53.690\nAll right, so I'm already at basic for\nthis particular disk right here.\n\n109\n00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.490\nSo for disk 1, I'm gonna right-click on\ntop of that, and then I'm just going to,\n\n110\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.060\nif you can see that there.\n\n111\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.710\nIt says Convert to Dynamic.\n\n112\n00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.742\nWe'll go ahead and select that.\n\n113\n00:06:02.742 --> 00:06:05.416\nAnd again, I don't want to\nselect any of these other discs,\n\n114\n00:06:05.416 --> 00:06:08.360\nI really just wanna work with Disk 1,\nwhich is already selected.\n\n115\n00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.980\nSo we'll go ahead and hit OK.\n\n116\n00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.429\nAnd then Convert.\n\n117\n00:06:15.165 --> 00:06:16.469\nWe do get a warning here,\n\n118\n00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.380\njust letting us know that we\nare performing that conversion.\n\n119\n00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.620\nWe're not gonna be able to start\ninstalled operating systems for\n\n120\n00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.670\nany volume on the disk.\n\n121\n00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.030\nAre you sure you want to continue?\n\n122\n00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.210\nSo we'll go ahead and hit Yes.\n\n123\n00:06:30.151 --> 00:06:35.342\nNow, if I wanted to go ahead and\ndo the opposite of that, and convert\n\n124\n00:06:35.342 --> 00:06:41.610\nthis now back to basic, notice that\nthe option is grayed out here in the GUI.\n\n125\n00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.540\nSo that's because we have a volume, and\nthe operating system is being overly\n\n126\n00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.730\ncautious, assuming that hey,\nmaybe there's data on that volume.\n\n127\n00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.730\nOr just saying, hey,\nthere's a volume there, right?\n\n128\n00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.976\nSo if we go ahead and\ndelete the volume, all right,\n\n129\n00:06:55.976 --> 00:07:00.748\nwe do get a notification saying that\nall of our information will be erased.\n\n130\n00:07:00.748 --> 00:07:05.153\nSo that's why Mike and I were saying\ndefinitely back your information up.\n\n131\n00:07:05.153 --> 00:07:06.722\nWe'll go head and hit Yes.\n\n132\n00:07:06.722 --> 00:07:08.494\nAnd now, we have that option.\n\n133\n00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:11.210\nWe'll right-click, and\nthen we can convert to dynamic disk.\n\n134\n00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.331\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n135\n00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:14.341\n&gt;&gt; But I think we've seen that a little\n\n136\n00:07:14.341 --> 00:07:17.590\nbit already,\nit doesn't hurt to look at it again.\n\n137\n00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:23.102\nWhy we're really here is to go ahead and\nlook at from command line perspective.\n\n138\n00:07:23.102 --> 00:07:26.717\nOr first, we'll start with DiskPart.\n\n139\n00:07:26.717 --> 00:07:28.503\nAnd I'm just moving this\naround a little bit.\n\n140\n00:07:28.503 --> 00:07:32.160\nI'm trying to find the best\nuse of my real estate here.\n\n141\n00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:39.170\nSo we can kind of keep an eye\non both the GUI and whatever\n\n142\n00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.400\ntool we'll be working with in here.\n&gt;&gt; All\n\n143\n00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.085\nright.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n144\n00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.290\nSo, if we go ahead, and\n\n145\n00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:52.686\nnotice that I am running an administrative\nPowerShell prompt session here.\n\n146\n00:07:52.686 --> 00:07:58.306\nI'm gonna go ahead and type in disk part.\n\n147\n00:07:58.306 --> 00:08:02.934\nAnd although I haven't launched\na separate administrative command prompt,\n\n148\n00:08:02.934 --> 00:08:05.323\nlike I have been, or you might see me do.\n\n149\n00:08:05.323 --> 00:08:09.976\nI also wanted to show you guys that\nyou can run DISKPART right from\n\n150\n00:08:09.976 --> 00:08:12.569\nwithin the PowerShell interface.\n\n151\n00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:17.108\nYou can see that it is actually\nDISKPART here by that notation\n\n152\n00:08:17.108 --> 00:08:21.208\nprevious to that little caret and\ncursor right there.\n\n153\n00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:25.990\nOkay, so now that we're in DISKPART,\nit's always a good idea to go ahead and\n\n154\n00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.180\nselect list disk.\n\n155\n00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.515\nYou can see the different disks\nthat you do have available to you,\n\n156\n00:08:32.515 --> 00:08:34.948\nand I do see zero, all right?\n\n157\n00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:39.399\nThat's my 30 gig operating system, and\nthen they have these tiny little 1 gig\n\n158\n00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:42.416\ndrives that I just added for\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n159\n00:08:42.416 --> 00:08:47.440\nThey'd be pretty useless in real life, but\njust that's what we're working with here.\n\n160\n00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.880\nSo the disk that we wanted to go ahead and\nwork with, let's see.\n\n161\n00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.079\nCurrently, you can look over\nthe right hand side and\n\n162\n00:08:57.079 --> 00:08:59.885\nsee that none of the disks\nare set to be dynamic disks.\n\n163\n00:08:59.885 --> 00:09:03.950\nSo they're all basic at this moment\nin time, if one of them were dynamic,\n\n164\n00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.127\nyou'd see an asterisk, also for GPT.\n\n165\n00:09:06.127 --> 00:09:10.358\nSo by the information\nprovided in this table,\n\n166\n00:09:10.358 --> 00:09:15.246\nI can see that I'm working\nwith basic MBR disks here.\n\n167\n00:09:15.246 --> 00:09:20.993\nOr actually, let me take that back,\nbecause the disks that are unallocated,\n\n168\n00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:24.402\nlike this one hasn't\neven been initialized.\n\n169\n00:09:24.402 --> 00:09:30.502\nSo I haven't even had to choose if it\nwas MBR or GPT at this point in time.\n\n170\n00:09:30.502 --> 00:09:34.839\nAll right, so let's see, which one\ndo we wanna go ahead and work with?\n\n171\n00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:37.633\nI guess it really doesn't matter,\nlet's go with-\n\n172\n00:09:37.633 --> 00:09:38.620\n&gt;&gt; Let's start at the bottom,\n\n173\n00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.098\nlet's do disk three.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n174\n00:09:40.098 --> 00:09:40.921\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n175\n00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:42.554\n&gt;&gt; I know, I feel like there was one that\n\n176\n00:09:42.554 --> 00:09:44.230\nI was trying to save for a demo.\n\n177\n00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.120\nYeah, so we're saving disk two, so that's\ngood, so let's work with disk three then.\n\n178\n00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:54.370\nSo what we're gonna do\nis say select disk 3.\n\n179\n00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:58.750\nAnd we can now see that disk\n3 is the selected disk.\n\n180\n00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.800\nAnd if you wanted to just hit the up arrow\ntwice to perform that same function,\n\n181\n00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.478\nyou can now see right over here that,\nagain, those little asterisks.\n\n182\n00:10:08.478 --> 00:10:09.464\nThey're small, but\n\n183\n00:10:09.464 --> 00:10:13.089\nthey do provide good information about\nhow you're working here in DISKPART.\n\n184\n00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:15.380\nAnd we've been working with this tool for\na little while now,\n\n185\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.710\nyou probably are already\nfamiliar with that.\n\n186\n00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:23.324\nNow that this particular disk is selected,\ndisk 3, so we do know that it's basic.\n\n187\n00:10:23.324 --> 00:10:28.898\nActually, let's go ahead and just create\na new simple volume on here also,\n\n188\n00:10:28.898 --> 00:10:31.786\nso you guys can see what happens there.\n\n189\n00:10:36.823 --> 00:10:38.581\nOkay, jumping back into DISKPART,\n\n190\n00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:41.485\nthe next command that we're\ngonna be using is just convert.\n\n191\n00:10:41.485 --> 00:10:44.175\nSo we'll just say convert, and\n\n192\n00:10:44.175 --> 00:10:49.953\ndepending on if it's basic to dynamic,\nwhichever way you wanna go,\n\n193\n00:10:49.953 --> 00:10:55.420\nthe destination,\nThe outcome is what we wanna type here.\n\n194\n00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.107\nSo for right now,\nI'm gonna go ahead and type dynamic.\n\n195\n00:10:59.916 --> 00:11:01.510\nGo ahead and hit Enter,\n\n196\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:07.034\nyou'll see that DISKPART successfully\nconverted the selected disk to dynamic.\n\n197\n00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:12.048\nSo if we look back here in Disk\nManagement, our volume remains intact.\n\n198\n00:11:12.048 --> 00:11:15.501\nAnd we can see that the status is healthy,\nso in theory,\n\n199\n00:11:15.501 --> 00:11:18.008\nour data should still be there, right?\n\n200\n00:11:18.008 --> 00:11:22.152\nNow if we were to simply go back here\ninto DISKPART, and I go ahead and\n\n201\n00:11:22.152 --> 00:11:25.500\nhit the up arrow, and\nI change this to basic.\n\n202\n00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.160\nSo same disk is selected, we're just\ntrying to switch it back to basic.\n\n203\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.815\nWe'll go ahead and hit empty, but\nnotice that error that I have,\n\n204\n00:11:34.815 --> 00:11:36.750\nit says the disk is not empty.\n\n205\n00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.531\nSo that's the same thing we were seeing\nin the GUI, just in a different format.\n\n206\n00:11:40.531 --> 00:11:45.210\nAnd if we were to go ahead and\ndelete the volume, or we could\n\n207\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.761\ndelete it here from DISKPART as well, but-\n&gt;&gt; Now it should allow us\n\n208\n00:11:49.761 --> 00:11:52.531\nto convert it back.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you'll see here,\n\n209\n00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:56.820\nwe just ran that command again, and\nit says the selected disk, oops,\n\n210\n00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.035\n[LAUGH] is not a dynamic disk,\nselect a dynamic disk.\n\n211\n00:12:00.035 --> 00:12:06.075\nLet me just make sure that that disk is\nactually the one that is still selected,\n\n212\n00:12:06.075 --> 00:12:07.550\ndisk 3, online.\n\n213\n00:12:09.415 --> 00:12:11.922\nLet me refresh this just\nto see what's going on.\n\n214\n00:12:15.044 --> 00:12:18.098\nIt does say basic, [LAUGH] yeah,\nyou guys saw that.\n\n215\n00:12:18.098 --> 00:12:19.986\n&gt;&gt; When you deleted that volume,\n\n216\n00:12:19.986 --> 00:12:23.400\nlet's try it again,\nlet's convert that to dynamic and\n\n217\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.717\nsee what happens, make sure it's selected\n&gt;&gt; Let me go ahead, okay, so\n\n218\n00:12:27.717 --> 00:12:32.972\nit is selected there, and then we're just\ngoing to say convert, and then dynamic.\n\n219\n00:12:37.205 --> 00:12:42.080\nAll right, it says it's successfully\nconverted to dynamic, let's check it.\n\n220\n00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.692\nAnd I'm gonna zoom in so\nyou guys can see this too.\n\n221\n00:12:44.692 --> 00:12:45.247\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n222\n00:12:45.247 --> 00:12:47.120\n&gt;&gt; It does say dynamic, so\n\n223\n00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.844\nwe do know that that is converted.\n\n224\n00:12:49.844 --> 00:12:54.059\nAnd now there shouldn't be an issue\nconverting it back to basic,\n\n225\n00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:57.212\nbecause we do not have any\nvolumes at the moment.\n\n226\n00:12:57.212 --> 00:13:00.033\nGo ahead and convert to basic, okay.\n\n227\n00:13:00.033 --> 00:13:04.944\nSo it says that DISKPART successfully\nconverted the selected disk back to\n\n228\n00:13:04.944 --> 00:13:06.770\nbasic format.\n\n229\n00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.050\nMaybe I was going too fast or\nsomething, I don't know.\n\n230\n00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.560\nIt didn't have time to refresh and\ndetect that change.\n\n231\n00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.010\nBut if you do encounter that,\n\n232\n00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.290\ndisks are one of those things that\nsometimes you do have transient errors.\n\n233\n00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:23.707\nSo I would always try to refresh or\nrescan those disks,\n\n234\n00:13:23.707 --> 00:13:26.310\njust to let the system catch up.\n\n235\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.927\nBut normally,\nyou wouldn't be making, hopefully,\n\n236\n00:13:29.927 --> 00:13:32.846\nthis many changes in\na short amount of time.\n\n237\n00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:37.221\nOkay, so that's how we can perform\nthose particular conversions.\n\n238\n00:13:37.221 --> 00:13:41.720\nBut there are also some other types of\nconversions that we may want to perform.\n\n239\n00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.150\nI'm just gonna go ahead and exit out of\nDISKPART for now and clear our screen.\n\n240\n00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.010\nActually, let me just minimize\nthis entire virtual machine so\n\n241\n00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.230\nI can just show you where you could\nfind additional information for\n\n242\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.210\npartition scheme conversions.\n\n243\n00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.596\nI have that here in Edge,\n\n244\n00:13:56.596 --> 00:14:00.768\nand I don't want you guys to get that\nconfused with what we were just doing.\n\n245\n00:14:00.768 --> 00:14:06.104\nThat was basic to dynamic, but another\nconversion you may want to go ahead and\n\n246\n00:14:06.104 --> 00:14:10.209\nwork with would be working with\nyour partition schemes, or\n\n247\n00:14:10.209 --> 00:14:12.200\npartition styles or types.\n\n248\n00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.585\nSo we have MBR, master boot record,\nas well as our GPT for\n\n249\n00:14:15.585 --> 00:14:19.060\nGUID partition table schema, so\nwe've talked about those as well.\n\n250\n00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.482\nMBR, as you already know,\nor may know from the shows,\n\n251\n00:14:24.482 --> 00:14:27.055\nthat we did say that was an older style.\n\n252\n00:14:27.055 --> 00:14:31.536\nSo in my opinion, most commonly you'll\nbe converting from MBR to GPT, but\n\n253\n00:14:31.536 --> 00:14:33.470\nthat may not always be the case.\n\n254\n00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.358\nSo you probably wanna know about\nworking with those conversions as well.\n\n255\n00:14:37.358 --> 00:14:41.713\nSo here's some information,\nsome light reading for you.\n\n256\n00:14:41.713 --> 00:14:42.365\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n257\n00:14:42.365 --> 00:14:43.506\n&gt;&gt; But don't worry,\n\n258\n00:14:43.506 --> 00:14:47.143\nwe're gonna walk through these\nsteps just to show you kind of\n\n259\n00:14:47.143 --> 00:14:48.794\nwhat that looks like here.\n\n260\n00:14:53.739 --> 00:14:56.957\nAll right, so we're actually,\nI don't know why I closed out of DISKPART.\n\n261\n00:14:56.957 --> 00:14:59.151\nWe're gonna be getting back into DISKPART,\nsilly me.\n\n262\n00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:00.317\n&gt;&gt; To remind us how to get into DISKPART.\n\n263\n00:15:00.317 --> 00:15:01.106\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n264\n00:15:01.106 --> 00:15:02.024\n&gt;&gt; It's always good, repetition is good.\n\n265\n00:15:02.024 --> 00:15:03.995\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Making sure you're typing is\n\n266\n00:15:03.995 --> 00:15:06.500\nalways a good first\nstart to DISKPART there.\n\n267\n00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.734\nSo we'll go ahead and start that,\nwe're back into DISKPART.\n\n268\n00:15:10.734 --> 00:15:14.469\nAnd of course, I always say this, but\nlist disk, for whatever machine you're on,\n\n269\n00:15:14.469 --> 00:15:17.306\nI think it's just a good habit to\ngo ahead and type that first, so\n\n270\n00:15:17.306 --> 00:15:19.643\nyou know where you are,\nwhat you're working with.\n\n271\n00:15:19.643 --> 00:15:23.738\nIn case, for some reason, there might\nalready be an asterisk on a disk.\n\n272\n00:15:23.738 --> 00:15:29.573\nYou wouldn't wanna inadvertently convert\nsome disk that you really didn't want to.\n\n273\n00:15:29.573 --> 00:15:36.740\nThis conversion is pretty invasive,\nand what does that mean?\n\n274\n00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.844\nWell, when we're looking at MBR to GPT or\nvice versa,\n\n275\n00:15:40.844 --> 00:15:43.534\nyou gotta have an empty disk there.\n\n276\n00:15:43.534 --> 00:15:46.062\nSo you will always need to\nperform a conversion, and\n\n277\n00:15:46.062 --> 00:15:47.849\nI'm going to say that with a caveat.\n\n278\n00:15:47.849 --> 00:15:51.657\nBecause at the end of this,\nwhen we're finished with this demo,\n\n279\n00:15:51.657 --> 00:15:54.992\nI will show you a newer way that\nwe can go ahead and do this.\n\n280\n00:15:54.992 --> 00:15:57.945\nBut historically,\nif you're using Diskpart,\n\n281\n00:15:57.945 --> 00:16:01.250\nthen you will definitely\nhave to back your disks up.\n\n282\n00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.110\nBut Microsoft did create a new tool for\nthis for us, but\n\n283\n00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.450\nwe'll get to that in a little bit.\n\n284\n00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.000\nSo for right now, let's see.\n\n285\n00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.730\nWhat do I wanna do here?\n\n286\n00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.360\nLet's pick that same disk we\nwere working with for 3 there.\n\n287\n00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:19.907\nSo we'll go ahead and say select disk 3.\n\n288\n00:16:19.907 --> 00:16:22.660\nAll right, so\nnow Disk 3 should be selected.\n\n289\n00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.610\nI don't trust it, though,\nwe're gonna go [LAUGH] and hit that again.\n\n290\n00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.222\nYeah, just wanna make sure.\n\n291\n00:16:27.222 --> 00:16:33.860\nNow, let me see here.\n&gt;&gt; Can you slide that PowerShell\n\n292\n00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.845\nwindow just a hair over to your right?\n&gt;&gt; To my right, for sure.\n\n293\n00:16:36.845 --> 00:16:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can't see that asterisk.\n\n294\n00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:38.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm trying to think,\n\n295\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.570\nthere's also something else that I\nwanted to go ahead and show you.\n\n296\n00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:43.180\n&gt;&gt; The whole window,\n\n297\n00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.568\nI can't see the asterisk next to\nDisk 3 to make sure it's selected.\n\n298\n00:16:45.568 --> 00:16:46.463\n&gt;&gt; The whole window, I see,\n\n299\n00:16:46.463 --> 00:16:48.030\nit's not on the actual-\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n300\n00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.810\n&gt;&gt; Monitor there.\n\n301\n00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.880\nThere we go, there's disk 3.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n302\n00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.416\n&gt;&gt; Now, you know what, let me switch that,\n\n303\n00:16:54.416 --> 00:16:57.748\nthough, cuz I do wanna show\nyou how to actually bring,\n\n304\n00:16:57.748 --> 00:16:59.571\nlet me see what the status is.\n\n305\n00:16:59.571 --> 00:17:01.515\nYou know what,\nlet me just change that here to offline.\n\n306\n00:17:01.515 --> 00:17:03.125\nWe're gonna pretend here for\na minute, guys.\n\n307\n00:17:03.125 --> 00:17:06.005\nAll right, so now Disk 3 is offline.\n\n308\n00:17:06.005 --> 00:17:07.765\nLet me just hit that command again so\n\n309\n00:17:07.765 --> 00:17:11.238\nwe can verify that in fact the system\nis recognizing it now as offline.\n\n310\n00:17:11.238 --> 00:17:12.285\nYou can see that, okay, it is.\n\n311\n00:17:12.285 --> 00:17:14.075\nAnd that's what I wanted to show you here.\n\n312\n00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:18.205\nAnd that's something that,\nwhen we go through the steps, and\n\n313\n00:17:18.205 --> 00:17:21.235\nif you recall,\nI did have the little diagrams\n\n314\n00:17:21.235 --> 00:17:23.760\ngoing through those individual\nsteps that you'll need to do.\n\n315\n00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.850\nNumber one,\nwe talked about initializing that disk.\n\n316\n00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:31.630\nSo I had skipped a disk here to save\nthat for another part of the demo.\n\n317\n00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:36.250\nBut what if the disk had already been\ninitialized but it was still offline?\n\n318\n00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.670\nThat's kind of what I wanna show now.\n\n319\n00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.520\nHow do you bring that disk\nonline from here in Diskpart?\n\n320\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.756\nSo, what you're gonna go ahead and\ntype is just online disk.\n\n321\n00:17:46.281 --> 00:17:48.240\nAll right, not too difficult.\n\n322\n00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.010\nAnd that's because we simply\nhad Disk 3 already selected.\n\n323\n00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.480\nSo you would need to change the focus and\n\n324\n00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.810\nselect the disk that was offline\nthat you wanted to bring online.\n\n325\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.710\nSo if you go ahead and\nrun that particular command again.\n\n326\n00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.910\nNow you can see that\nthat status is online.\n\n327\n00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.690\nSo I didn't have to go into the GUI and\nchange anything from Disk Management.\n\n328\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:09.700\nI just want you guys to be familiar\nwith other ways of doing things because\n\n329\n00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:14.240\non the exam you might get a couple\ndifferent questions about that.\n\n330\n00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.690\nThey really want to make sure you\nunderstand the operating system.\n\n331\n00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.956\nOkay, so what else do we\nwanna go ahead and do here?\n\n332\n00:18:20.956 --> 00:18:24.240\nLet's check that real quick.\n\n333\n00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.380\nI wanna bring something to your attention.\n\n334\n00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.569\nYou might not have noticed this.\n\n335\n00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.190\nSo Disk 3 here.\n\n336\n00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.050\nYes, we have been working with this.\n\n337\n00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:39.230\nWe just checked the status in that table,\nin Diskpart, and it said it was online.\n\n338\n00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.010\nBut notice now I have\nthis Read Only option.\n\n339\n00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:47.150\nAnd you guys saw, we didn't go in and\nset any special read-only parameter there.\n\n340\n00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.600\nSo in case you encounter that,\n\n341\n00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.904\nI will also show you something that\nyou can do to get rid of that.\n\n342\n00:18:52.904 --> 00:18:57.760\nBecause read-only disks do\nhave their purpose, but for\n\n343\n00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.690\nthe majority of the time, people will\nprobably wanna be writing to those disks.\n\n344\n00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.990\nSo you wanna make sure that that\nisn't gonna cause you any problems\n\n345\n00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.670\ndown the road.\n\n346\n00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.495\nAll right, so what you're gonna go ahead\nand type here is going to be attributes.\n\n347\n00:19:12.947 --> 00:19:13.870\nIf I spelled that correctly.\n\n348\n00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:17.305\nAll right, attributes disk clear, and\n\n349\n00:19:17.305 --> 00:19:23.180\nthen you're gonna go ahead and\nselect read only, or type readonly.\n\n350\n00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.240\nWe'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n351\n00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.437\nWe see that Disk attribute\ncleared successfully.\n\n352\n00:19:27.437 --> 00:19:32.030\nLet me just go ahead and\nverify that here in my Disk Management.\n\n353\n00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:36.130\nAnd hopefully you can see that that Read\nOnly attribute has been removed there.\n\n354\n00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.810\nAnd alternatively you could\nbring this disk offline\n\n355\n00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.040\nif you wanted to do that as well.\n\n356\n00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.510\nSo, all you would type would be,\nsince we're not switching disks,\n\n357\n00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:52.050\nwe're still at Disk 3, we'll go ahead and\nsay, offline disk, Enter.\n\n358\n00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.895\nLet's check it out here.\n\n359\n00:19:54.895 --> 00:19:57.871\nZoom in, Offline.\n\n360\n00:19:57.871 --> 00:20:01.640\nI feel like there's something\nelse I wanted to tell you.\n\n361\n00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.340\nI know what it was.\n\n362\n00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:10.150\nClear disk, or clear,\nthe terminology, disk clear,\n\n363\n00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.878\njust be careful with that one because\nthere's actually a PowerShell cmdlet\n\n364\n00:20:13.878 --> 00:20:18.720\nthat's clear-disk, and\nthat can actually delete a disk.\n\n365\n00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.680\nSo you wanna be careful, that's two\nseparate things here, two syntax versions.\n\n366\n00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:29.414\nAnd there are little checks,\nlittle parameters with the clear-disk,\n\n367\n00:20:29.414 --> 00:20:34.302\nfor your data-only, or whatever,\nit'll help you not clear\n\n368\n00:20:34.302 --> 00:20:36.840\neverything in one fell swoop.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n369\n00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.020\n&gt;&gt; But just be aware\n\n370\n00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.280\nof that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n371\n00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.592\nthat could get us in trouble real fast.\n\n372\n00:20:41.592 --> 00:20:44.368\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.\n\n373\n00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:47.050\nI'm trying to see what else we\nwanna go ahead and look at here.\n\n374\n00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:52.580\nOkay, looking at the time,\nI think we've got time to go ahead and\n\n375\n00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.800\nlook at this from\na PowerShell perspective.\n\n376\n00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.181\nSo let me just exit out\nof Diskpart right here.\n\n377\n00:21:00.921 --> 00:21:05.370\nAnd I will also clear this screen\nwhenever I get a second there.\n\n378\n00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.047\nCool, cool, all right.\n\n379\n00:21:08.047 --> 00:21:14.115\nSo get-disk, I would say is\n\n380\n00:21:14.115 --> 00:21:18.705\na pretty comparable command to list disk,\nwhat we've been working with in Diskpart.\n\n381\n00:21:18.705 --> 00:21:23.406\nGet-disk does have different flavors or\nvariations.\n\n382\n00:21:23.406 --> 00:21:30.930\nYou can use get-physicaldisk to filter and\n\n383\n00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:35.285\nonly render or display information\nassociated with physical disks.\n\n384\n00:21:35.285 --> 00:21:40.150\nGet-disk is more of\nan all-encompassing cmdlet,\n\n385\n00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:44.240\nbecause if the disk is physical or\nvirtual, it'll be listed.\n\n386\n00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.930\nThere's also a get-virtualdisk cmdlet\nthat we'll go ahead and filter\n\n387\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.630\nout to look at those virtual disks there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sometimes it can\n\n388\n00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:57.020\nbe confusing when you're working with a\nlong list of disks and it's including all\n\n389\n00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:01.790\nyour physicals, your virtuals,\nthumb drives, right, USB-based drives.\n\n390\n00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.325\nSo it is nice to be able to filter that\ndown to just the physical disks when you\n\n391\n00:22:04.325 --> 00:22:05.860\nneed to.\n&gt;&gt; For sure, specially when,\n\n392\n00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.920\nlike Mike said, you do have a lot there.\n\n393\n00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.300\nAnd actually,\none thing that I do wanna show you here.\n\n394\n00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.590\nThis is kind of just more of\nan annoyance for me than anything.\n\n395\n00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:20.050\nIf you go ahead and notice how,\nwhen you are working with a lot of disks,\n\n396\n00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.880\nand this is just because of\nthe way that I have things set up.\n\n397\n00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.620\nMy friendly name here is all the same,\nbut you can see how the name goes dot,\n\n398\n00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.360\ndot, dot.\n\n399\n00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.510\nWell, in syntax, there are situations\nwhere you're gonna need to know that\n\n400\n00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.090\nfriendly name and type it in.\n\n401\n00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.070\nSo how do I see that\nentire name right there?\n\n402\n00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.090\nSo if you just take that same command, or\n\n403\n00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:42.220\nwhatever command you're working with,\ncmdlet or combo there.\n\n404\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.970\nWhat I'm gonna do is use my pipe command.\n\n405\n00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.772\nI'm gonna take that output and\n\n406\n00:22:46.772 --> 00:22:51.010\nthen pipe it in to an FT, which is short\nfor format table, and if I use my.\n\n407\n00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:56.508\nSo format table is kind of\nfunny because the default here,\n\n408\n00:22:56.508 --> 00:22:58.390\nit's already formatting in a table.\n\n409\n00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.630\nBut the problem is you'd have\nto use your scroll bar to\n\n410\n00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.890\nscroll over to look at all of this info.\n\n411\n00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:09.409\nIf I use the autosize, A-U-T-O.\n\n412\n00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:12.243\nI'm gonna tap through that\nbecause apparently I can't spell.\n\n413\n00:23:12.243 --> 00:23:16.338\nIf I use the autosize parameter, then\nit'll kind of just pop it all in a nice,\n\n414\n00:23:16.338 --> 00:23:18.350\neasy-to-read format for me.\n\n415\n00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.834\nAnd then I can see that full name for\nthat friendly name there,\n\n416\n00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:25.464\nwhich can help me if I'm trying\nto sort through multiple disks.\n\n417\n00:23:25.464 --> 00:23:27.550\nOkay, so what do we wanna do now?\n\n418\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:31.430\nSo that was Disk 3 that we were working\nwith, how about let's just go ahead and\n\n419\n00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.170\nwork with that one again.\n\n420\n00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:37.400\nSo here, you can use the friendly\nname as an identifier.\n\n421\n00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.730\nFor me, it's easier a lot of\ntimes just to use the number.\n\n422\n00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:44.354\nTyping one character can be a lot easier\nthan typing a long friendly name if you\n\n423\n00:23:44.354 --> 00:23:46.712\nhave some, so\nthat's what we're gonna do here.\n\n424\n00:23:46.712 --> 00:23:53.683\nSo we'll go ahead and say, Set-Disk,\nand I'm gonna use the number parameter.\n\n425\n00:23:53.683 --> 00:23:59.074\nAnd the number that we're working\nwith here We've got number three.\n\n426\n00:23:59.074 --> 00:24:04.210\nAnd it's weird how they have the syntax.\n\n427\n00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.520\nLike one of those backwards\nway of thinking here.\n\n428\n00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.770\nSo we're gonna put\nnumber three is offline.\n\n429\n00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.460\nCurrently you can see that number\nthree is all ready offline.\n\n430\n00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:18.623\nSo what we're gonna add here is\ngoing to be the false parameter,\n\n431\n00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:22.490\nSo what's the opposite,\nwhat's false of being offline?\n\n432\n00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.036\n&gt;&gt; I'd say online.\n\n433\n00:24:24.036 --> 00:24:25.210\n&gt;&gt; I think you're right, Mike.\n\n434\n00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.690\nI don't get any kind of obvious\nanswer there so let's go ahead and\n\n435\n00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:32.000\npull that get disc command back in, and\n\n436\n00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.100\nwe can see now you are right.\n\n437\n00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:34.817\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; It is online.\n\n438\n00:24:34.817 --> 00:24:35.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n439\n00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.670\n&gt;&gt; So that's how you would go ahead and\n\n440\n00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.110\nbring a disk online\n\n441\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:43.400\nwithout actually having to work\nin that graphical user interface.\n\n442\n00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.350\nBut remember what\nhappened when we did that\n\n443\n00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:49.065\nin disk part when we brought it online?\n&gt;&gt; It left it as\n\n444\n00:24:49.065 --> 00:24:49.730\nread-only.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n445\n00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:50.920\n&gt;&gt; Or brought it in as read-only.\n\n446\n00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.770\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n447\n00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.560\nSo let's check on that to make sure\nthat we don't have that problem again.\n\n448\n00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.292\nWe'll go ahead and\njust hit refresh to be safe, refresh.\n\n449\n00:25:04.602 --> 00:25:07.310\nOkay, I think we're good here.\n&gt;&gt; All\n\n450\n00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.875\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if it does bring it in as\n\n451\n00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:13.800\nread-only, it's pretty simple\nto take care of that, though.\n\n452\n00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.640\nWhat we would do,\nlet me just hit my up arrow.\n\n453\n00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.710\nInstead of saying, is offline fault,\nso what you could go ahead and\n\n454\n00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:25.784\ndo is change this particular perimeter,\nAnd\n\n455\n00:25:25.784 --> 00:25:28.681\nwe could say is read-only.\n\n456\n00:25:32.317 --> 00:25:33.480\nAnd then falls.\n\n457\n00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:39.920\nSo by using that syntax, you'd be forcing\nit into being a rewrite disk there.\n\n458\n00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.440\nSo in case you encounter that, I just\nwanted to give you a heads up there.\n\n459\n00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.750\nAll right, what else do we wanna\ngo ahead and work with here?\n\n460\n00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.400\nAll right.\n\n461\n00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.000\nSo I see git disk, and\nthen specifying the number.\n\n462\n00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.950\nTo initialize.\n\n463\n00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:55.180\nThat's what we wanted to go ahead and do.\n\n464\n00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.030\nThat's why I saved that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, disk two.\n\n465\n00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.100\n&gt;&gt; I think it was disk two.\n\n466\n00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.990\nYeah, so let's go ahead and\nlet me just clear all this out here.\n\n467\n00:26:07.945 --> 00:26:10.580\nAll right, so git-disk.\n\n468\n00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.720\nAnd that was going to be 2, and\n\n469\n00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.730\nI could've taken my own advice there and-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n470\n00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.990\n&gt;&gt; Piped it on out to the FT-AutoSize,\n\n471\n00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.650\nso we can see that information\na little bit easier there.\n\n472\n00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:31.960\nAll right, so we can see that the disk\nis currently, is this one, it is online.\n\n473\n00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.470\nNow, I don't know if I mentioned\nthis before about Raw.\n\n474\n00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:42.060\nRaw is, well, this is a brand new disk\nthat essentially we just plugged in.\n\n475\n00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.410\nSo I haven't formatted it before.\n\n476\n00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:47.370\nAnd we'll take a little more\nof a discussion about raw\n\n477\n00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.700\ndisks whenever we talk\nabout trouble shooting.\n\n478\n00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.620\nI know this disk is raw because it's new,\nbut there may be corruption or\n\n479\n00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:57.200\nother reasons why that disk may be raw but\nfor now that's expected.\n\n480\n00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.430\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nuse the command, initialize and oops.\n\n481\n00:27:06.993 --> 00:27:09.266\nLet me see if it'll go ahead and\n\n482\n00:27:09.266 --> 00:27:11.480\nI don't know why it is.\n&gt;&gt; It was slow.\n\n483\n00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.345\nI think it did it as you looked away.\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n\n484\n00:27:13.345 --> 00:27:15.107\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; It was tring to trick you.\n\n485\n00:27:15.107 --> 00:27:15.719\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n486\n00:27:19.144 --> 00:27:20.629\nOkay, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n487\n00:27:20.629 --> 00:27:23.540\nyou might wanna take all that out.\n&gt;&gt; This is like, okay, let\n\n488\n00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.260\nme just clear my screen really quick, too.\n&gt;&gt; There we go, I like that.\n\n489\n00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.940\nI saw it pop up for a second, I thought.\n&gt;&gt; There it is, patience [LAUGH].\n\n490\n00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.620\nOkay, initialize disk, and\nlet's go ahead and give it my number here.\n\n491\n00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.187\nThis one was going to be 2, and\n\n492\n00:27:40.187 --> 00:27:45.620\nat this point in time, I can go ahead and\nchoose that partition style.\n\n493\n00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:46.810\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n494\n00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:47.710\nAnd let me see here.\n\n495\n00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:49.130\nI'm missing a, there we go.\n\n496\n00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.800\nTab through to my partition style.\n\n497\n00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:58.400\nYeah, let's go ahead and\ndo GPT first, all right?\n\n498\n00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.890\nAnd again, not a whole lot of info here.\n\n499\n00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:05.900\nIf you wanted to, let me see if\nI still have this here, yeah.\n\n500\n00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:06.850\nFilter through.\n\n501\n00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:12.640\nYou can see now that it was raw before but\nnow it is at that GPT partition style.\n\n502\n00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.230\nSo we were talking about changing\nthose partition schemas here.\n\n503\n00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:19.670\nNow if I wanna go ahead and change that,\n\n504\n00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:24.820\nit's actually pretty simple to do if the\ndisk is empty, meaning without a volume.\n\n505\n00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:29.370\nSo here I've got set-disk, and we'll\ngo ahead and specify my number again.\n\n506\n00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.440\nNumber 2, oops.\n\n507\n00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.780\nMake sure it has that little\nspace there to get that white.\n\n508\n00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.798\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nagain type in our partition style.\n\n509\n00:28:39.798 --> 00:28:43.790\nThis time, NBR.\n\n510\n00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:44.450\nWe'll hit Enter.\n\n511\n00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.810\nAnd we'll go ahead and check that.\n\n512\n00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.500\nSo you can see that that would be\nthe commandlets to go ahead and\n\n513\n00:28:52.975 --> 00:28:56.125\nto use if in fact you had an empty volume.\n\n514\n00:28:57.375 --> 00:28:58.405\nMike, I know you're looking at me.\n\n515\n00:28:58.405 --> 00:29:00.505\nWe're out of time, I think.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n516\n00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:03.295\n&gt;&gt; And I'm not gonna do enough justice to\n\n517\n00:29:03.295 --> 00:29:07.825\nthe tool that Microsoft has created for\nus to show you guys how to actually\n\n518\n00:29:09.085 --> 00:29:14.525\nretain your information and do an in place\nconversion and even using your system.\n\n519\n00:29:14.525 --> 00:29:16.580\nSo I think we'll save that for\nthe next show.\n\n520\n00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.120\nI didn't think we'd make it to a part six,\nbut Mike, we're there.\n\n521\n00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.400\n&gt;&gt; Wow, it's a cliffhanger too.\n\n522\n00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.360\nI'm dying to see this new tool\nthat'll allow me to convert MBR and\n\n523\n00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.060\nGPT without losing my data.\n\n524\n00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.220\nI'm excited to see that.\n\n525\n00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.870\nI hope everybody out there is as well.\n\n526\n00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:32.040\nBut for now, signing off for ITProTv,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n527\n00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.845\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n528\n00:29:32.845 --> 00:29:35.500\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n529\n00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:41.225\n[MUSIC]\n\n530\n00:29:41.225 --> 00:29:44.077\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

Yeah, thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n14\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.215\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\n\n15\n00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:35.472\nexcited to see what you have for us next.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so\n\n16\n00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:38.160\nin the last show we were taking a look at\ndifferent things that we could do with\n\n17\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.760\nthe command line interface.\n\n18\n00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.180\nWe spent a lot of time in disk part.\n\n19\n00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.980\nAnd in this show, I did promise\nthat I would show a tool that\n\n20\n00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.980\nMicrosoft had created because\nwe left off in the last episode,\n\n21\n00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.770\nat the very end of the episode,\nlooking at partition scheme conversions.\n\n22\n00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.390\nAnd we noted that the methods that we\nhad used, you would have to go ahead and\n\n23\n00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.820\ndelete that data before you could go\nahead and perform that conversion.\n\n24\n00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.130\nHowever, Microsoft did come out\nwith a tool called MBR to GPT,\n\n25\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.260\nit's an executable.\n\n26\n00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.220\nAnd in order to obtain that tool,\nyou do have to download the Windows ADK.\n\n27\n00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.477\nAnd if we take a look at my screen,\n\n28\n00:01:16.477 --> 00:01:20.520\nhere's just a link to that assessment and\ndeployment kit.\n\n29\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.500\nI know it's really small,\nI've included that into the show notes.\n\n30\n00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.450\nBut also, if you do a quick Google search,\n\n31\n00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.340\nyou do wanna make sure that you\ndo have the latest version.\n\n32\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.370\nOr, yeah, I would just take the latest\nversion because if it's a newer\n\n33\n00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.560\nversion than what your windows 10 is,\nit should be backwards compatible with it.\n\n34\n00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.360\nBut just kinda keep that in mind there.\n\n35\n00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.971\nSo once you go ahead and\ndownload your ADK.\n\n36\n00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:45.471\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.010\n&gt;&gt; If I can say, not ADT,\n\n38\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.654\nthe security alarm system, no.\nBut you've got your ADK, and\n\n39\n00:01:50.654 --> 00:01:52.420\nthen you should be good to go there.\n\n40\n00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.206\nYou do have a couple of things to\nthink about if you wanna go ahead and\n\n41\n00:01:56.206 --> 00:01:57.098\nrun this tool.\n\n42\n00:01:57.098 --> 00:02:01.331\nAnd let me just pull this page up here,\nthere's also additional notes just\n\n43\n00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:05.157\nto kinda get you prepped and\nlet you know what this tool has to offer,\n\n44\n00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:08.262\nas well as the different\nswitches that are available.\n\n45\n00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:11.278\nThere's even a video there you could\nwatch that Microsoft provides, so\n\n46\n00:02:11.278 --> 00:02:13.660\nI'll go ahead and\ninclude this link in the notes as well.\n\n47\n00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.180\nWe'll talk about this here.\n\n48\n00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.470\nOne thing to keep in mind, though, for\nthe prerequisites, this is a big one here.\n\n49\n00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.010\nSo as the name implies, MBR2,\nand they used the number 2,\n\n50\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.910\nGPT, that's usually because that's,\nlike I said before,\n\n51\n00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.920\nthe way people wanna ahead and\nperform that conversion.\n\n52\n00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.350\nKind of I guess upgrading to\nthe newer GTP partition scheme.\n\n53\n00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.052\nSo in order to do that,\nif you think about the layout for MBR,\n\n54\n00:02:44.052 --> 00:02:49.588\nthe partitions and your maximum use\nof your primary partitions there,\n\n55\n00:02:49.588 --> 00:02:51.847\nyou can have up to how many?\n&gt;&gt; Four, yeah.\n\n56\n00:02:51.847 --> 00:02:52.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n57\n00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.050\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so with this tool, and\n\n58\n00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.150\nyou guys should know that because\nwe've already talked about that.\n\n59\n00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.570\nBut for this particular tool, you have\nall four partitions being utilized,\n\n60\n00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.060\nyou have to have at least\none partition available for\n\n61\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.180\nthis tool to have, for its magic to work\ninside of that partition, if you will.\n\n62\n00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.940\nSo something to think about there.\n\n63\n00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.716\nAlso, if you are running BitLocker,\nyou will need to go ahead and\n\n64\n00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:19.747\nsuspend that protection\nprior to this conversion.\n\n65\n00:03:19.747 --> 00:03:22.600\nAnd then afterwards, of course,\nyou can re-enable that.\n\n66\n00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.010\nBut just keep that in mind as well.\n\n67\n00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.700\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nbring up a machine that I have here.\n\n68\n00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.460\nAnd I just have an administrative\ncommand prompt already pulled up.\n\n69\n00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.136\nAnd it's pretty simple actually,\nif I just type in the MBR2,\n\n70\n00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:42.594\nthe number 2, if I'm typing there, MBR2.\n&gt;&gt; No focus.\n\n71\n00:03:42.594 --> 00:03:45.069\n&gt;&gt; No focus.\n\n72\n00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.585\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n73\n00:03:45.585 --> 00:03:46.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n74\n00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.840\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you gotta click it.\n\n75\n00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.234\n&gt;&gt; Just keep clicking and clicking.\n\n76\n00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:50.145\nOkay, no, don't.\n\n77\n00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:54.234\nAll right, MBR2, GPT.exe now,\nI'm not going to go ahead and\n\n78\n00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.430\nuse the proper switch yet, just so\n\n79\n00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.410\nyou guys can see the difference\nswitches that are available there.\n\n80\n00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.370\nAnother alternative to using that web\npage that I had shown you, but just\n\n81\n00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.600\nknowing that you do have those options,\nand we'll take a look at that here.\n\n82\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.140\nSo full disclosure, I actually had\nto run this tool on my personal\n\n83\n00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.480\ncomputer one time and I was very nervous\nabout this because, as you already know,\n\n84\n00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.535\nwe talked about how you had to\nremove all your files previously.\n\n85\n00:04:25.535 --> 00:04:27.345\nAnd I'm like, wait a second,\nthere's a tool, and\n\n86\n00:04:27.345 --> 00:04:30.595\nyou don't have to clear that partition and\nbackup your files?\n\n87\n00:04:30.595 --> 00:04:33.888\nWell, let me rephrase that,\nyou should always back up your files.\n\n88\n00:04:33.888 --> 00:04:37.095\nAnd I definitely did because I\ndidn't know if this tool would work.\n\n89\n00:04:37.095 --> 00:04:41.437\nI was a little skeptical,\nbut I can tell you,\n\n90\n00:04:41.437 --> 00:04:44.762\nit was so easy, it was to the book.\n\n91\n00:04:44.762 --> 00:04:49.602\nAnd of course, sometimes the guidelines\nand steps have little minor issues that\n\n92\n00:04:49.602 --> 00:04:53.320\nyou have to work out or little kinks,\nbut this was super easy.\n\n93\n00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.830\nSo I definitely think it's a cool tool.\n\n94\n00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.410\nAnd the syntax that we use,\nit's really just a one liner here.\n\n95\n00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.640\nSo I am just gonna ahead and\nhit the up arrow, there.\n\n96\n00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.713\nAnd actually,\nlet me take off the .exe, either way.\n\n97\n00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:11.640\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nhit a convert switch, so this is /convert.\n\n98\n00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.580\nYou do need to know the disc\nthat you are working with.\n\n99\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.961\nIn this particular situation,\nit's gonna be disc 0, but you could also,\n\n100\n00:05:18.961 --> 00:05:23.274\nlike we've done several times,\nuse different tools such as DiskPart to go\n\n101\n00:05:23.274 --> 00:05:27.939\nahead and list that out, to make sure\nyou're working with the right disk there.\n\n102\n00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:32.630\nAlso, alternatively, you could use\nthe Get-Disk cmdlet in PowerShell.\n\n103\n00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.490\nSo you just need to specify your disk,\nthis is going to be disk.\n\n104\n00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.870\nAnd the syntax here, you do need to add\na colon, zero, so just be aware of that.\n\n105\n00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.039\nAnd because I have an operating system\nalready running on this machine, and\n\n106\n00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:53.288\nthis isn't just like a storage disk\nthat I'm performing the conversion on,\n\n107\n00:05:53.288 --> 00:05:58.075\nI need to also add an additional\nswitch here, and it's allowFullOS.\n\n108\n00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:01.379\nAnd this will just allow\nthe operating system to go ahead and\n\n109\n00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:03.710\nlet that conversion take place.\n\n110\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.340\nAnd really, that's it, and\n\n111\n00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.090\nyou can see It, like I said,\ndoing its magic here.\n\n112\n00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.180\nI'm going to go ahead and attempt\nto convert the disk and run through\n\n113\n00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.330\neverything, and it really is that easy.\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\n\n114\n00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.980\nthat was quick.\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n115\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.796\nI couldn't believe that.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n116\n00:06:21.796 --> 00:06:22.700\nCherokee, well, that was pretty easy.\n\n117\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.950\nThat's all we have to do?\n&gt;&gt; So that's not everything we have to do.\n\n118\n00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.930\nWe actually need to think\nabout performing that restart,\n\n119\n00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.660\nyou did see there at\nthat little notification.\n\n120\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.740\nYou need to restart the system, but\nalso, you have to make sure that that\n\n121\n00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.620\nsystem does support UEFI firmware\nbecause you need to change that.\n\n122\n00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.350\nSo it's gonna be slightly\ndifferent depending on what kinda\n\n123\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.250\nsystem you're running, so\nthat's why I didn't show you guys.\n\n124\n00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.930\nWe've already been into our\nfirmware settings before, so\n\n125\n00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.190\nyou would just need to change\nthat from BIOS to UEFI.\n\n126\n00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.570\nAnd then you should be good to go.\n\n127\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.620\nIf you don't do that, then the system\nis unusable, so I mean, you're\n\n128\n00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.500\nnot gonna forget about that step because\nyou won't be able to use the system.\n\n129\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.800\nThat is something you have to do.\n\n130\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.565\nBut aside from that.\n&gt;&gt; I remember you telling us about that in\n\n131\n00:07:05.565 --> 00:07:08.846\na previous episode, though,\nthat if it's a GPT-based disk,\n\n132\n00:07:08.846 --> 00:07:11.659\nit has to be UEFI to boot from.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, otherwise, and\n\n133\n00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:14.714\nthat's kind of, I probably should have\nmentioned that first, as one of your\n\n134\n00:07:14.714 --> 00:07:17.970\nprerequisites there, but just knowing\nthat you do have a few things like that.\n\n135\n00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.563\nBitLocker, making sure you\nhave those partitions,\n\n136\n00:07:20.563 --> 00:07:22.638\nat least one partition available for you,\n\n137\n00:07:22.638 --> 00:07:26.335\nand then knowing that your hardware\ncan support this conversion as well.\n\n138\n00:07:26.335 --> 00:07:29.295\nBut overall, it's pretty simple and\nstraightforward.\n\n139\n00:07:29.295 --> 00:07:30.345\n&gt;&gt; And no data loss.\n\n140\n00:07:30.345 --> 00:07:31.795\n&gt;&gt; I know, and I just couldn't believe.\n\n141\n00:07:31.795 --> 00:07:34.545\nI'm like, I can't believe this\nactually works, this is so cool.\n\n142\n00:07:34.545 --> 00:07:37.135\nSo yeah, good things.\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget Cherokee's advice.\n\n143\n00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:39.715\nBack up your data anyway, just in case.\n&gt;&gt; Just in case.\n\n144\n00:07:39.715 --> 00:07:40.595\nThat's right.\n\n145\n00:07:40.595 --> 00:07:42.470\nSkeptical Sally over here.\n\n146\n00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.705\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Better safe than sorry.\n\n147\n00:07:43.705 --> 00:07:45.494\n&gt;&gt; That's right, okay.\n\n148\n00:07:45.494 --> 00:07:49.929\nNow, guys, we did spend a lot of time in\ndisk part in the last show, so I wanna pay\n\n149\n00:07:49.929 --> 00:07:54.320\nsome attention to PowerShell here because\nMicrosoft is really pushing that.\n\n150\n00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.159\nAnd that's kind of the way\nwe wanna manage things.\n\n151\n00:07:57.159 --> 00:08:00.904\nAs a matter of fact, when we're going\nthrough a lot of these commandlets, and\n\n152\n00:08:00.904 --> 00:08:04.710\nI've provided a list for you guys to\njust work through and study with.\n\n153\n00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:09.590\nBecause you'll find with our dynamic disk,\nthere's not a lot of,\n\n154\n00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.210\nwell there are commandlets really,\nto help us out there and\n\n155\n00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.360\nthat's simply because Microsoft\nhas developed the use and\n\n156\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.680\nthe technology of storage spaces, which\nwe've covered in this particular series.\n\n157\n00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.070\nSo they want you to use that instead\nof using the older dynamic disk\n\n158\n00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.220\nconfigurations that we were looking at.\n\n159\n00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.720\nHowever, like I said several times,\nthey still are on the objective list\n\n160\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.000\nas of the time of this recording, so\njust make sure you know how to use them.\n\n161\n00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.750\nIf we take a look at my screen.\n\n162\n00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.660\nI know you guys are probably getting\nsick of disk management here.\n\n163\n00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.910\nBut I wanted to give you\nan idea of where we are,\n\n164\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.700\nwhat kind of configuration I\ncurrently have set up here.\n\n165\n00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.470\nNow, my system,\nI just rolled it back to a snapshot.\n\n166\n00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.040\nI am using virtualization here.\n\n167\n00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.110\nSo if you're like hey,\nyou said your system wouldn't be usable.\n\n168\n00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.700\nI didn't go through with\nthe conversion here but just so\n\n169\n00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.900\nwe could continue with our demos,\nI have a couple of disks.\n\n170\n00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:07.600\nTwo 3 Gig disks and then I have one 1 Gig\ndisk that has not yet been initialized.\n\n171\n00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.960\nSo everything that you can do in the GUI,\nyou can also and even in disk\n\n172\n00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.440\npart we saw how to initialize those disks,\nbring them online and format them.\n\n173\n00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.100\nThat's what we're going\nto be looking at here\n\n174\n00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.060\ninside of PowerShell.\n&gt;&gt; Cool\n\n175\n00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.050\n&gt;&gt; Alright let me just go ahead\n\n176\n00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.030\nand pull that up.\n\n177\n00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:28.770\nNow if you’re not part of that back up\noperators or administrative, logged in as\n\n178\n00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.690\nan administrator, one of those two there,\nyou just need to get those credentials.\n\n179\n00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.920\nBecause again we are modifying\nthe hardware the disks here.\n\n180\n00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.900\nI am logged in as a local admin.\n\n181\n00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.490\nI also have an administrative\nPowerShell session here pulled up,\n\n182\n00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.840\nso that is something that you'll need.\n\n183\n00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.790\nNow when we are working in disk part,\n\n184\n00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.950\nI was hounding you about using\nthat list disk command so\n\n185\n00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:55.700\nthat we could see and verify that we\nwere working with the correct disk.\n\n186\n00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.020\nA similar command in PowerShell\nis going to be get-disk and\n\n187\n00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.970\nI think we've spoke about this before and\nthe different flavors for\n\n188\n00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:08.670\nthe, get physical disk, get virtual disk,\nget-disk to show all your disks.\n\n189\n00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.760\nSo that's what we're gonna go ahead and\nrun here.\n\n190\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.890\nAnd just scrolling over I could have\ndone the format to the autosize there,\n\n191\n00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:16.810\nI probably should've done that.\n\n192\n00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.790\nBut we can see those disks that we\nare just working with the inside\n\n193\n00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.840\nof disk management as well, and\n\n194\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.370\njust noting their current stats before\nwe start playing around in here.\n\n195\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.510\nAll right the first thing I wanted\nto do is take one of those disks and\n\n196\n00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:36.600\ncreate a volume and go ahead and assign\na drive letter and things like that.\n\n197\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.733\nSo the first command I want to use\nis going to be new- partition.\n\n198\n00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:47.895\nNow don't get hung up on the verbage\nhere because new volume is also\n\n199\n00:10:47.895 --> 00:10:50.120\na commandlet that we can use.\n\n200\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.830\nBut its' used in a slightly\ndifferent manner.\n\n201\n00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.750\nSo for now just trust the process.\n\n202\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.010\nAnd we are going to go\nnow with new- partition.\n\n203\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:03.050\nI'm also gonna go ahead and\nspecify my particular disk number here.\n\n204\n00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:09.924\nSo disk number and the disk that we'll\nchoose here maybe like disk number 1,\n\n205\n00:11:09.924 --> 00:11:15.341\nand if we're thinking about what\nwe wanna do with this disk.\n\n206\n00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:19.289\nIf you wanted to go ahead and\nput a drive letter,\n\n207\n00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:24.620\nwe could say drive letter and\nthen specify a drive letter.\n\n208\n00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.730\nOr something that I think is pretty cool.\n\n209\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:31.730\nIf you go with a sign drive letter,\nthe system will go through\n\n210\n00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.900\nthe alphabet and order there, to assign\nit that next available drive letter.\n\n211\n00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.170\nWe'll leave it as that.\n\n212\n00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:38.940\n&gt;&gt; Convenient.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n213\n00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.915\nAlso, something that's kind of cool,\nanother convenient one, a commandlet,\n\n214\n00:11:43.915 --> 00:11:48.360\nour parameter that we have available\nto us here, is use maximum size.\n\n215\n00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.170\nSo let me just start\ntyping that a little bit.\n\n216\n00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:57.010\nSo if you see use maximum size, that\nwill go ahead and create that volume or\n\n217\n00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.510\nthat partition to fill that\nentire size of the disk there.\n\n218\n00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:07.130\nBut you can also specify a specific\nsize so if I want to say size\n\n219\n00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:11.950\none gig for this particular one that's\nwhat we'll stick with for this demo.\n\n220\n00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.420\nAnd then also if I wanted to\ntake that information and\n\n221\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:23.170\npipe that into specify a particular\nfile system, we can do that also.\n\n222\n00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.130\nSo I am going to go ahead and\nsay format- volume.\n\n223\n00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:33.650\nAnd for my file system here,\nwe'll go with something I probably\n\n224\n00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.348\nwouldn't go with here in real life.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n225\n00:12:36.348 --> 00:12:39.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Fat32 and just to keep in mind\n\n226\n00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.290\nwe are working with a smaller drive so it\nwill work for this particular formatting.\n\n227\n00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.040\nAnd because you do have those\nlimitations for the larger drives there.\n\n228\n00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.270\nWe can see that our\ndrive has been assigned,\n\n229\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:56.170\ndrive letter E we can see our file\nsystem type also that it's fixed,\n\n230\n00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.880\nit's healthy, and our sizes.\n\n231\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.520\nOkay so we can see the size remaining,\n\n232\n00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.050\nthe size that that actual\npartition was created.\n\n233\n00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.860\nAnd we're good to go there, but\nnot everything is set in stone here.\n\n234\n00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:16.410\nSo if I wanted to,\nmaybe I just approached a system that\n\n235\n00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.890\nalready had some partitions configured,\nwhat are some things that we could do.\n\n236\n00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:24.482\nLet me go ahead and\nclear this and if I wanted to use\n\n237\n00:13:24.482 --> 00:13:29.533\nthe get- partition P, A,\nR, I always mess this up.\n\n238\n00:13:29.533 --> 00:13:31.138\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n239\n00:13:31.138 --> 00:13:32.947\n&gt;&gt; P, A, R, T, I, T, I, O, N,\n\n240\n00:13:32.947 --> 00:13:35.897\nsorry, I had to spell that one out for\nsome reason.\n\n241\n00:13:35.897 --> 00:13:39.550\nGet- partition will show\nme the partitioners for\n\n242\n00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:44.900\nthe entire system here, but if I wanted\nto really hone in on one particular disk,\n\n243\n00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.090\nthen I would just hit my up arrow.\n\n244\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.980\nAnd then specify a disk number.\n\n245\n00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.110\nSo we could say like, disk number one.\n\n246\n00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.540\nAnd then look more specifically\n\n247\n00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.120\ndown here at that drive that\nwe had been working with.\n\n248\n00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.410\nSo just a couple different things.\n\n249\n00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.590\nAnd like I said, there's so many\ndifferent commandlets you just gotta play\n\n250\n00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.370\naround with them and\nlook at the configurations, but\n\n251\n00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.830\nI've tried to highlight the most important\nones and note them in the show notes here.\n\n252\n00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.910\nOkay, so what if I wanted to go ahead and\nmaybe my current,\n\n253\n00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:24.722\nif I take a look at my size here and say\nokay look, this one gig just really isn't\n\n254\n00:14:24.722 --> 00:14:28.470\ncutting it for me, I need to go ahead and\nincrease that size or shrink that size.\n\n255\n00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.660\nWe do have the ability to resize and\nguess what?\n\n256\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.535\nThat's going to be resize-partition.\n\n257\n00:14:35.535 --> 00:14:38.587\nResize-partition.\n\n258\n00:14:41.698 --> 00:14:42.615\nMy gosh.\n\n259\n00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:45.642\n[LAUGH] That's like the italian version\n\n260\n00:14:45.642 --> 00:14:46.190\npartition.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n261\n00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.710\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n262\n00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:52.680\nBut let's go ahead and specify that\ninformation, also letting it know hey,\n\n263\n00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.210\nwe're still working with disc number\ntwo here, and then I also need, or\n\n264\n00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.010\nwait, disk number 1.\n\n265\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:03.784\nI also need to specify\nthe particular partition,\n\n266\n00:15:03.784 --> 00:15:07.776\nespecially if I had more, P, A, R, T I.\n\n267\n00:15:07.776 --> 00:15:10.332\nI [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n268\n00:15:10.332 --> 00:15:13.190\n&gt;&gt; If I had more than one partition it\n\n269\n00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.830\nwould be extremely important to make sure\nthat I'm working with the correct one.\n\n270\n00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:21.820\nWe can see here that I do have that\nsystem reserved noted as one so\n\n271\n00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:27.020\nthe one we want to work with Drive\nletter E is actually in position too.\n\n272\n00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:27.590\nCan you see that?\n\n273\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:28.520\nYeah, we're good, all right.\n\n274\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.570\nSo we'll just go ahead and here put in,\nmake sure you have that space there,\n\n275\n00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.230\nsomething I get, you know,\ntyping and that's not right.\n\n276\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.960\nYou need to have that little space.\n\n277\n00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:43.139\nSo we say partition number two and then\nwe'll go ahead and change this size, so\n\n278\n00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:50.008\nInstead of,\nI guess we could do the full maximum.\n\n279\n00:15:50.008 --> 00:15:51.056\nLet's go ahead and do that.\n\n280\n00:15:51.056 --> 00:15:54.379\nSo we will say use.\n\n281\n00:15:54.379 --> 00:15:56.247\nIs it not going to let me do it here?\n\n282\n00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:58.160\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe not with the resize.\n\n283\n00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.846\n&gt;&gt; Well, maybe not with the resize, yeah.\n\n284\n00:15:59.846 --> 00:16:02.220\nWe'll go ahead and specify,\nI wanted to try it, though.\n\n285\n00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.323\nI was like I usually just do size,\nbut let's try it.\n\n286\n00:16:03.323 --> 00:16:04.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n287\n00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.805\n&gt;&gt; We'll go ahead and go with 2 gigs for\n\n288\n00:16:06.805 --> 00:16:10.683\nour size, we said that we wanted\nto go ahead and increase that, so\n\n289\n00:16:10.683 --> 00:16:12.590\nwe should be good to go here.\n\n290\n00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:17.180\nWe'll hit Enter, and, oops,\nResize-Partition not supported.\n\n291\n00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.109\nLet's see what the issue is here,\nDiskNumber 1,\n\n292\n00:16:22.512 --> 00:16:27.283\nPartitionNumber 2, Size 2 gigs.\n\n293\n00:16:27.283 --> 00:16:31.906\nLet me try in, it doesn't say anything\nabout the size but we are working,\n\n294\n00:16:34.107 --> 00:16:37.133\nI know what it is, sorry.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:16:37.133 --> 00:16:39.677\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm not working with an NTFS\n\n296\n00:16:39.677 --> 00:16:41.213\ndrive.\n&gt;&gt; Its FAT32.\n\n297\n00:16:41.213 --> 00:16:42.383\n&gt;&gt; So, that's right, so\n\n298\n00:16:42.383 --> 00:16:44.194\njust a few things to think about, and\n\n299\n00:16:44.194 --> 00:16:47.776\nthat's why I [LAUGH] definitely encourage\nyou to go in and play with this.\n\n300\n00:16:47.776 --> 00:16:51.108\nBecause there are like I said,\nlittle gotchas here and\n\n301\n00:16:51.108 --> 00:16:53.070\nthere with these commandlets.\n\n302\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:58.765\nSo what we could do is perform\na conversion, so let's just go ahead and\n\n303\n00:16:58.765 --> 00:17:03.986\ndo that to get it going and\nthen we can resize, so how about that?\n\n304\n00:17:03.986 --> 00:17:09.891\nLet me clear my screen, and\nwe could say Format-Volume,\n\n305\n00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:12.790\nand let me think about this.\n\n306\n00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:20.523\nNow, for our drive letter, Specify E,\nand if I wanted to go ahead and\n\n307\n00:17:20.523 --> 00:17:25.325\nchange that file system, let's see,\nshould just be FileSystem.\n\n308\n00:17:25.325 --> 00:17:29.494\nAnd then now if I specify, and\nI could tab through here to MTFS, and\n\n309\n00:17:29.494 --> 00:17:31.441\nwe'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n310\n00:17:31.441 --> 00:17:35.485\nGive it a second for\nthis conversion to actually take place and\n\n311\n00:17:35.485 --> 00:17:38.455\nthen now let's try to\nresize our drive here.\n\n312\n00:17:38.455 --> 00:17:45.449\nSo Resize-Partition, And again,\nwe need to specify DiskNumber.\n\n313\n00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.352\nDiskNumber 1, PartitionNumber,\n\n314\n00:17:51.218 --> 00:17:56.620\nPartitionNumber 2, and then add that size.\n\n315\n00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.262\nSo let's say we want it to do two gigs,\nAll right.\n\n316\n00:18:01.262 --> 00:18:06.102\nSo if you wanted to just verify and\ncheck that we could do\n\n317\n00:18:06.102 --> 00:18:12.057\nGet-Partition, And\nthis would show everything.\n\n318\n00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:15.653\nBut that's okay,\nlet's just pay attention to drive E here,\n\n319\n00:18:15.653 --> 00:18:18.120\nthe one we've been working with.\n\n320\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.212\nAnd we can now see that that size is at 2\ngigs here, so that's [LAUGH] definitely\n\n321\n00:18:22.212 --> 00:18:24.410\nsomething to remember.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.539\n&gt;&gt; Let me clear my screen,\n\n323\n00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:27.126\nthere's another one like that.\n\n324\n00:18:27.126 --> 00:18:32.100\nAnd if you think about the difference and\nwhy that error happened was because NTFS\n\n325\n00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.480\ndoes support features that\nother file systems do not.\n\n326\n00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.140\nAnd we have talked about that, so\nthat was just a silly error on my behalf.\n\n327\n00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.892\nBecause if you think about things\nlike file system labels, well,\n\n328\n00:18:42.892 --> 00:18:45.505\nFAT32 does not support file system labels.\n\n329\n00:18:45.505 --> 00:18:50.334\nBut now that our volume is in\nNTFS format we can go ahead and\n\n330\n00:18:50.334 --> 00:18:53.070\nadd a FileSystemLabel volume.\n\n331\n00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.760\nSo let's go ahead and do that Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n332\n00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.868\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, we could use,\n\n333\n00:18:57.868 --> 00:19:02.452\nthis is a good one here,\nspecifically like for, you know,\n\n334\n00:19:02.452 --> 00:19:05.869\nmaybe future exams or something.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n335\n00:19:05.869 --> 00:19:08.413\n&gt;&gt; Knowing the difference between those\n\n336\n00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:11.600\ndifferent verbs like get, new, set, right?\n\n337\n00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.860\nSo here we can see them in action.\n\n338\n00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.950\nWhat we want to do is Set-Volume, and for\n\n339\n00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:23.530\nour FileSystemLabel, we'll go ahead and\nstart typing through there.\n\n340\n00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:29.410\nMaybe I wanna go ahead and\nassign this one, you know what?\n\n341\n00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:33.718\nI need to also specify my drive\nletter here, so let's see,\n\n342\n00:19:33.718 --> 00:19:36.142\nSet-Volume FileSystemLabel.\n\n343\n00:19:38.287 --> 00:19:42.086\nI'm just gonna go ahead and hit Shopping\nso I can show you that if I wanted to\n\n344\n00:19:42.086 --> 00:19:46.255\nchange it to Shipping, maybe I wanted to\nset this for the shipping department and\n\n345\n00:19:46.255 --> 00:19:49.099\nif I make an error that is\nsomething we can change also.\n\n346\n00:19:49.099 --> 00:19:53.077\nBut let me just specify\nmy drive letter here for\n\n347\n00:19:53.077 --> 00:19:57.160\ndrive letter E,\nwe'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n348\n00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.414\nLet's see, cannot be resolved\nusing specific parameters,\n\n349\n00:20:01.414 --> 00:20:03.440\nShopping, drive letter E.\n\n350\n00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.147\nLet me try something else here.\n\n351\n00:20:14.797 --> 00:20:18.324\nLet me see, Get-Partition and\n\n352\n00:20:18.324 --> 00:20:23.080\nwe can say, I'm trying to think here.\n&gt;&gt; DiskNumber?\n\n353\n00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.073\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, DiskNumber and then,\n\n354\n00:20:27.963 --> 00:20:35.554\nPartitionNumber, And\nthen we can pipe that in.\n\n355\n00:20:35.554 --> 00:20:37.378\nI'm gonna try something here on the fly.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n356\n00:20:37.378 --> 00:20:39.643\n&gt;&gt; To Set-Volume.\n\n357\n00:20:43.651 --> 00:20:47.745\nAnd this is what I would encourage you to\ndo, [LAUGH] just to really go through and\n\n358\n00:20:47.745 --> 00:20:48.711\nplay with these.\n\n359\n00:20:48.711 --> 00:20:52.495\nBecause again, like I said,\nsome of them, and let's tab on through,\n\n360\n00:20:52.495 --> 00:20:57.610\nFileSystemLabel, and then here,\nwe'll go ahead and name that.\n\n361\n00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:02.356\nSo we'll say shopping,\ncome on shopping, you never fail me.\n\n362\n00:21:02.356 --> 00:21:03.073\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What about,\n\n363\n00:21:03.073 --> 00:21:05.339\nshould it be new FileSystemLabel,\nsince it doesn't have one currently?\n\n364\n00:21:05.339 --> 00:21:05.893\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes,\n\n365\n00:21:05.893 --> 00:21:08.346\nit is, my goodness, thank you, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n366\n00:21:08.346 --> 00:21:12.704\nThere are two commandlets there, so\nthat's, thank you for pointing that out.\n\n367\n00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:19.621\nOkay, FileSystemLabel if there is\ncurrently one, if there's a new one, new.\n\n368\n00:21:19.621 --> 00:21:22.705\nSo this should be good,\nlet's see if that was actually the culprit\n\n369\n00:21:22.705 --> 00:21:27.350\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n370\n00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.930\n&gt;&gt; No, let me go back a few.\n\n371\n00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.461\nIt might have taken it that first time.\n&gt;&gt; That first one, yeah.\n\n372\n00:21:32.461 --> 00:21:33.373\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n373\n00:21:33.373 --> 00:21:38.029\nWith, Let's see here.\n\n374\n00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.327\nThat was the long way.\n\n375\n00:21:43.327 --> 00:21:44.612\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Have\n\n376\n00:21:44.612 --> 00:21:47.195\na good at the way these commands work?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n377\n00:21:47.195 --> 00:21:50.045\nI mean you guys are definitely\nseeing this first hand here.\n\n378\n00:21:50.045 --> 00:21:51.473\nLet's just minimize this so\n\n379\n00:21:51.473 --> 00:21:55.104\nyou can [LAUGH] compare this to\nthe graphical user interface, how silly.\n\n380\n00:21:55.104 --> 00:22:00.090\nThree little letters and that's, you know,\njust to show you, let me zoom in here.\n\n381\n00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.471\nShopping, E [LAUGH].\n\n382\n00:22:02.471 --> 00:22:04.730\nThere you go.\n&gt;&gt; All right now, Cherokee,\n\n383\n00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.040\nwhat if we didn't want Shopping,\nwhat if we wanted to make it Shipping?\n\n384\n00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:08.540\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n385\n00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.880\nwhat if we actually did\nmake an error in real life?\n\n386\n00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.430\nBecause I mean,\n\n387\n00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.205\nwho actually makes errors in real life?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n388\n00:22:13.205 --> 00:22:15.210\n&gt;&gt; That never happens, right?\n\n389\n00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:19.774\nThis is where the whole FileSystemLabel\ncommandlet comes into play.\n\n390\n00:22:19.774 --> 00:22:24.394\nBecause now that that FileSystemLabel\nhas already been established,\n\n391\n00:22:24.394 --> 00:22:28.629\nI can go ahead and say Set-Volume and\nthen use FileSystemLabel,\n\n392\n00:22:28.629 --> 00:22:31.590\nI was getting ahead of myself there.\n\n393\n00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:38.357\nAnd if I take that current Shopping\nFileSystemLabel, I could go ahead now and\n\n394\n00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:44.730\nuse the new FileSystemLabel,\nParameter here.\n\n395\n00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:48.748\nAnd we'll go ahead and\ngive it the correct name for\n\n396\n00:22:48.748 --> 00:22:52.295\nthat Shipping department, if I can spell.\n\n397\n00:22:52.295 --> 00:22:55.938\nAll right, so we should be good to go\nthere, and [LAUGH] we minimize that.\n\n398\n00:22:55.938 --> 00:22:56.958\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n399\n00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:57.958\n&gt;&gt; We'll go ahead and\n\n400\n00:22:57.958 --> 00:23:01.905\ntake a look here in disk management,\nand you can see the correct spelling.\n\n401\n00:23:01.905 --> 00:23:02.525\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n402\n00:23:02.525 --> 00:23:04.633\n&gt;&gt; So just knowing again that you do have\n\n403\n00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:08.490\noptions, as long as you-\n&gt;&gt; Really, that -FileSystemLabel is more\n\n404\n00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.819\nof a way to identify an existing label.\n&gt;&gt; Pre-existing,\n\n405\n00:23:10.819 --> 00:23:12.800\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then new FileSystemLabel if you\n\n406\n00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.955\nwanna change it up or set it initially.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, Mike.\n\n407\n00:23:15.955 --> 00:23:16.899\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go,\n\n408\n00:23:16.899 --> 00:23:18.761\nI knew we'd figure it out.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n409\n00:23:18.761 --> 00:23:22.508\nAll right, so what else do you\nwant to do here with our disks?\n\n410\n00:23:22.508 --> 00:23:25.081\nYou can do a lot actually.\n\n411\n00:23:25.081 --> 00:23:29.100\nLet's pull PowerShell up again,\nlet me just clear this screen.\n\n412\n00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.352\nYou know, we are going to take a look\na little bit at troubleshooting, but\n\n413\n00:23:33.352 --> 00:23:37.612\nsince we're already here in our,\nPowerShell,\n\n414\n00:23:37.612 --> 00:23:39.941\nthat's where we are now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n415\n00:23:39.941 --> 00:23:42.373\n&gt;&gt; There's a commandlet that I wanted to\n\n416\n00:23:42.373 --> 00:23:45.875\nbring to your awareness and\nit's Optimize-Volume.\n\n417\n00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:49.524\nNow depending on how that\ndisk is already configured,\n\n418\n00:23:49.524 --> 00:23:54.682\nthis is pretty cool because the operating\nsystem will actually recognize how\n\n419\n00:23:54.682 --> 00:23:59.786\nthe disk is configured and then tailor\nthe command To optimize that volume.\n\n420\n00:23:59.786 --> 00:24:04.953\nSo for us we're just working with\nsomething pretty specific, we don't have\n\n421\n00:24:04.953 --> 00:24:09.890\nany kind of trim or slab setup for\nany of those high level configurations.\n\n422\n00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:14.860\nSo what the system will do for\nour particular volume here\n\n423\n00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:21.980\nis just gonna go ahead and run an analysis\nand then defrag if we specify that.\n\n424\n00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.565\nSo just by default there, let me verify.\n\n425\n00:24:24.565 --> 00:24:26.500\nYep, it's just analyze and defrag.\n\n426\n00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.630\nThat's what we got here for\nour simple volume configuration.\n\n427\n00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.260\nSo we'll go ahead and say optimize volume.\n\n428\n00:24:38.554 --> 00:24:41.714\nAnd here we're gonna go ahead and\nspecify that drive letter E.\n\n429\n00:24:44.137 --> 00:24:47.330\nOops, not drive latter in underscore.\n\n430\n00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.160\nThat's what I get for trying to rush here.\n\n431\n00:24:53.033 --> 00:24:53.970\nDrive letter E.\n\n432\n00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:59.910\nNow if I don't specify anything here,\nit's gonna go ahead and\n\n433\n00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:04.300\nrun that analysis and\nthen just a quick optimization.\n\n434\n00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.430\nIf you wanted to really\ncheck that drive and\n\n435\n00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:13.250\nlook at each individual component, then\nwhat we could do is we would go ahead and\n\n436\n00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:19.530\nuse this but also specify to go ahead and\nhave that verbose cmdlet here.\n\n437\n00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:26.410\nSo we'll go ahead and say analyze and then\nverbose to get that extra information.\n\n438\n00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:31.411\nAnd you'll see it propagate here for\nspecific fragmentations and\n\n439\n00:25:31.411 --> 00:25:36.240\nhow the system is handling\nindividual portions on that volume.\n\n440\n00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:41.115\nWe have just created this volume, I don't\nexpect any fragmentation to be there\n\n441\n00:25:41.115 --> 00:25:43.820\nbecause we haven't put anything on there.\n\n442\n00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.420\nSo that's why it was quick.\n\n443\n00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.434\nDepending on the size of your drive and\nthe amount of\n\n444\n00:25:48.434 --> 00:25:53.356\nfragmentation that drive currently has,\nso looking at that health to begin with.\n\n445\n00:25:53.356 --> 00:25:57.720\nOurs with healthy, but I just wanted,\nand you can see that being noted here.\n\n446\n00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.620\nIt gives you that analysis output,\nyou do not need to defragment this volume.\n\n447\n00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.990\nSo if you just wanted to check on that,\n\n448\n00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:06.584\nthat would be a good cmdlet to use there.\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokkee,\n\n449\n00:26:06.584 --> 00:26:08.242\nyou know a lot of PowerShell,\nyou know I love scripting.\n\n450\n00:26:08.242 --> 00:26:12.010\nSo I've gotta ask,\ncan we combine all of this up?\n\n451\n00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:13.900\n&gt;&gt; That's the beauty of PowerShell and\n\n452\n00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.220\nits robustness here, Mike, so you know it.\n\n453\n00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.720\nAnd can't take credit for this particular\nscript and the way it's laid out, but\n\n454\n00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.262\nthis is a pretty common thing.\n\n455\n00:26:21.262 --> 00:26:23.240\nAt least think it's really cool.\n\n456\n00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.305\nIf we take a look at my screen,\nlet me actually change.\n\n457\n00:26:27.305 --> 00:26:29.980\nOkay, yeah, we'll keep that one with\nshipping too because we already\n\n458\n00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.640\nused shipping.\n\n459\n00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.720\nI'm trying to look at this.\n\n460\n00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.721\nBut whats going on here, right?\n\n461\n00:26:33.721 --> 00:26:38.970\nSo this is one way that we can really\ntake those individual cmndlets\n\n462\n00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:45.360\nthat we learn about, and then use them\ntogether in a very resourceful way.\n\n463\n00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.501\nSo you guys have already seen me,\n\n464\n00:26:47.501 --> 00:26:52.290\nand I'm sure you are familiar with\nthis cmndlet here, so get-disk.\n\n465\n00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.450\nThen we can pipe the information\nout into the next line, and\n\n466\n00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:56.960\nthat's what you're seeing here.\n\n467\n00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:02.790\nSo I can say, get all the disks where\nthe partition style is equal to raw.\n\n468\n00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:08.290\nAnd of course, what are these operational-\n&gt;&gt; Parameters.\n\n469\n00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:09.230\n&gt;&gt; Operational parameters.\n\n470\n00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:14.920\nSo you can change those to equal to, less\nthan, and really get creative with it.\n\n471\n00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.100\nThis is where ingenuity comes into play,\n\n472\n00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.820\nand you can style these\nscripts anyway you want.\n\n473\n00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:23.060\nSo we're saying getting all those\ndisks that are raw, that have yet\n\n474\n00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:27.828\nto be initialized or formatted, and\nwe'll go ahead and initialize them.\n\n475\n00:27:27.828 --> 00:27:31.360\nThen let's slap the partition\nstyle of GPT on there, and\n\n476\n00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:36.330\nthen we'll pass this information\nthrough to the next line here to create\n\n477\n00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:41.160\na partition, go ahead and assign it\na drive letter, max out those drives.\n\n478\n00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:46.125\nYou guys have seen, you've seen now\nthese individual cmndlets, format it\n\n479\n00:27:46.125 --> 00:27:51.580\nwith the NTFS file system, and then\nalso provide that new file system label.\n\n480\n00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.140\nAnd we'll just go ahead, and\nwe don't need that confirmation, so\n\n481\n00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.020\nwe'll push that through,\nand we'll hit Enter.\n\n482\n00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.100\nAnd give it a second to go ahead and\nrun and\n\n483\n00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.320\nreally do everything that\nwe've just specified there.\n\n484\n00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.430\nAnd we can see, I mean how easy was that?\n\n485\n00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:07.446\nHow quick was that?\n\n486\n00:28:07.446 --> 00:28:12.404\nSo for one drive, if you wanted to compare\ntyping all that out to running through\n\n487\n00:28:12.404 --> 00:28:16.402\nthe GUI wizard or something,\nthere might not be a huge benefit.\n\n488\n00:28:16.402 --> 00:28:22.044\nBut on a massive scale, and if you only\nhad to do this one time and specify\n\n489\n00:28:22.044 --> 00:28:25.820\nthose drives, it just makes more sense.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n490\n00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:30.258\nI can see I've got 50 machines that I've\ngot, we've got a case of new hard drives,\n\n491\n00:28:30.258 --> 00:28:33.350\nI've gotta go put them in 50 different\nclient machines or something like that.\n\n492\n00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:36.660\nAnd I can just take a drive, slap it in\nthere, my thumb drive with my script,\n\n493\n00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.790\nrun it, boom, next machine.\n\n494\n00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:42.060\nI can do that script faster than\nI could open up Disk Management.\n\n495\n00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:42.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for\n\n496\n00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.146\nsure, it's definitely useful there.\n\n497\n00:28:45.146 --> 00:28:50.260\nThe syntax also is in your notes,\nand again I\n\n498\n00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:54.510\nhad bootlegged that from, what's his name,\nEd Wilson, one of the scripting guys.\n\n499\n00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:58.320\nHe has some really great PowerShell\nblogs if you wanted to go ahead and\n\n500\n00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.070\nlearn more about that.\n\n501\n00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.140\nI mean of course,\nnot to underestimate Mike and\n\n502\n00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.727\nhis really great shows.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n503\n00:29:03.727 --> 00:29:05.656\n&gt;&gt; But also another good source of\n\n504\n00:29:05.656 --> 00:29:08.410\ninformation there, I think.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n505\n00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:09.930\nAnd the scripting guy is fantastic.\n\n506\n00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.292\nI look at his site all the time.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n507\n00:29:12.292 --> 00:29:12.997\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n508\n00:29:12.997 --> 00:29:13.870\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n509\n00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:17.870\none other thing I wanted to show you,\nI know we're getting close on time, Mike.\n\n510\n00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:22.360\nI did mention this in passing,\nthe new dash volume cmndlet here.\n\n511\n00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.990\nAnd I kind of touched on that also in\nanother show where we really look at how\n\n512\n00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:28.944\nto configure storage spaces.\n\n513\n00:29:28.944 --> 00:29:33.065\nI did promise you guys that\nwe would identify how we can\n\n514\n00:29:33.065 --> 00:29:36.200\nuse storage spaces within PowerShell.\n\n515\n00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.422\nSo I wanted to share this link with you\nand also provide it in the show notes.\n\n516\n00:29:39.422 --> 00:29:43.361\nI'm gonna scroll down to the bottom\nwhere Microsoft gives us some examples,\n\n517\n00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:46.101\nbecause it is going to be\nunique on your environment.\n\n518\n00:29:46.101 --> 00:29:50.856\nBut also this new -volume parameter,\nand just to give you\n\n519\n00:29:50.856 --> 00:29:56.099\nan example of how they really\nare using it in another intelligent\n\n520\n00:29:56.099 --> 00:30:01.758\nway here with storage pools, or\nwith our storage spaces there.\n\n521\n00:30:01.758 --> 00:30:06.577\nAnd also, so I'm gonna scroll through\nhere just to kind of show you you can set\n\n522\n00:30:06.577 --> 00:30:08.070\nresiliency settings.\n\n523\n00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.320\nWe've already spoke about those,\nlike with our mirrors.\n\n524\n00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.020\n&gt;&gt; Mirror parity.\n\n525\n00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.880\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and again applying,\n\n526\n00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.510\nlike if you wanted to create a volume and\nprovide that file system there,\n\n527\n00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.360\nand also setting your provisioning types.\n\n528\n00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.640\nLet me scroll down just a little bit\nmore because I did mention this as well,\n\n529\n00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.870\ntiered storage.\n\n530\n00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:30.890\nIf you had a mixture of drives on\nyour system, like the solid state or\n\n531\n00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:32.320\nthe optical drives.\n\n532\n00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.730\nYou can configure your system and\neven pin particular files, like\n\n533\n00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:41.830\nfiles that accessed more frequently than\nothers, to use a higher tier of storage.\n\n534\n00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:46.800\nSo basically those files are being\naccessed, the faster reads and\n\n535\n00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.427\nwrites can be used on a drive\nthat has the higher performance.\n\n536\n00:30:51.427 --> 00:30:54.870\nAnd again,\nthis is just an example of that syntax.\n\n537\n00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.280\nI did want to share with you\nwhere you could go ahead and\n\n538\n00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.240\nuse that to specify those\nstorage tiers there.\n\n539\n00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:08.430\nAt this scope for the exam,\nare they gonna ask you to set this up?\n\n540\n00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:12.110\nI doubt it, but\nshould you know what storage tiers are?\n\n541\n00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.930\nMost definitely, so I did want to take\nsome time to show you that there.\n\n542\n00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:18.880\nBut I think that's it for now, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, that was a lot and\n\n543\n00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.710\na great look, in depth coverage of\nmanaging disks and volumes in Windows 10.\n\n544\n00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:27.600\nFrom using the GUI to using\nDiskPart to using PowerShell.\n\n545\n00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.420\nSo we thank you for that, we hope\neverybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n546\n00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.160\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Roderick\n\n547\n00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:33.950\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n548\n00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.350\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n549\n00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:42.299\n[MUSIC]\n\n550\n00:31:42.299 --> 00:31:45.631\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.020\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, today, we\nare installing and configuring Windows 10.\n\n7\n00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.810\nIn this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at configuring storage spaces.\n\n8\n00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.950\nHere to show us how that's done is Ms.\n\n9\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.774\nCherokee Boose, welcome, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for\n\n10\n00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:28.551\nhaving me, Mike, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, so\n\n11\n00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:31.560\nstorage spaces, what are these all about?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n12\n00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.070\nthis is going to be Microsoft's latest and\ngreatest when it comes to storage, Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.775\nAnd what we're talking about is really\nthat evolution that we've been going\n\n14\n00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:43.882\nthrough within the past few episodes here,\ntalking about how to configure storage.\n\n15\n00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:47.972\nWe looked at everything\nthat we can imagine so far,\n\n16\n00:00:47.972 --> 00:00:50.360\nexcept storage spaces here.\n\n17\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.480\nAnd it's just a better way\nof handling our storage, and\n\n18\n00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.535\ncreating logical units of storage.\n\n19\n00:00:57.535 --> 00:01:02.478\nAs a matter of fact,\nI've tried to get that out in\n\n20\n00:01:02.478 --> 00:01:05.995\nan artistic format here.\n&gt;&gt; Visual aids.\n\n21\n00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:08.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I don't know if it's\n\n22\n00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.590\nreally gonna help, but hopefully it'll\nhelp create that visual concept.\n\n23\n00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.630\nJust because everything we've spoke about\nso far, and just kind of seal the deal.\n\n24\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.630\nLet's take a look at my screen and\nsee if it does, I don't know.\n\n25\n00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.190\nBut I tried to kind of create\nthis hierarchy of storage here.\n\n26\n00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.230\nAnd at the bottom,\nI have direct attached storage.\n\n27\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.673\nSo a couple different ways you could\nhave some direct attached storage.\n\n28\n00:01:34.673 --> 00:01:39.029\nOn the left hand side,\nI just have a mixture of optical drives.\n\n29\n00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:42.604\nThose are my hard disk drives, if you\nweren't able to tell from my artistic\n\n30\n00:01:42.604 --> 00:01:46.160\nability, and then I have a few\nsolid state drives as well.\n\n31\n00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.921\nOn the right hand side over here,\nI have a disk enclosure.\n\n32\n00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:54.877\nA lot of concepts that are really\nassociated with storage spaces\n\n33\n00:01:54.877 --> 00:01:56.987\nare going to be advanced and\n\n34\n00:01:56.987 --> 00:02:02.050\ncan scale extremely well to be\nused in a production environment.\n\n35\n00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.825\nSo in a production environment we would\nreally be using a server side operating\n\n36\n00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:07.209\nsystem, not Windows 10.\n\n37\n00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.701\nIt is a feature available\nto us in Windows 10, but\n\n38\n00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:13.800\nI was really introduced\nto it in server side.\n\n39\n00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.192\nSo when I had storage spaces, excuse me,\nI keep on wanting to say pools,\n\n40\n00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:21.362\nbut there is a difference\nin the terminology there.\n\n41\n00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:24.152\nI was thinking, well, that's interesting,\nit's available in the client side.\n\n42\n00:02:24.152 --> 00:02:28.257\nBecause there are a lot of\nadvanced configuration options,\n\n43\n00:02:28.257 --> 00:02:32.420\nbut not all of them carry\nthrough here to client side OS.\n\n44\n00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.863\nDisk enclosures are one of those things\nthat you probably will have on the server\n\n45\n00:02:36.863 --> 00:02:38.862\nside, not so much the client side.\n\n46\n00:02:38.862 --> 00:02:45.131\nJust know that it is a possibility to have\nthose additional physical capabilities.\n\n47\n00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:48.100\nAll right,\nwe've looked at RAID configurations.\n\n48\n00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.440\nA few things about RAID that I said,\nright?\n\n49\n00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.922\nFor setting and configuring those,\n\n50\n00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:56.612\nwe need to have disks with the same RPM,\nthe same size.\n\n51\n00:02:56.612 --> 00:02:58.896\nOtherwise it would be wasted, right,\n\n52\n00:02:58.896 --> 00:03:01.885\nas well as usually the same manufacturer,\nright?\n\n53\n00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:08.338\nWith the direct attached storage that we\nhave to our client side systems here or\n\n54\n00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:12.833\nwith storage spaces,\nit can be varied in type, size,\n\n55\n00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:16.430\nspeed, even optical and solid state.\n\n56\n00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.347\nAs a matter of fact, that's actually\na really cool option that storage spaces\n\n57\n00:03:21.347 --> 00:03:25.754\nhas available for us, and\nthat's something called tiered storage.\n\n58\n00:03:25.754 --> 00:03:30.240\nSo if you think about having\na mixture of optical and\n\n59\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.099\nmagnetic, so mechanical drives, right,\n\n60\n00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.919\nversus electronic drives,\nlike solid state drives.\n\n61\n00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.029\nWhich one's faster, well, currently-\n&gt;&gt; Solid state.\n\n62\n00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:43.729\n&gt;&gt; Generally speaking, solid state, right,\n\n63\n00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:45.844\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; By a long shot, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n64\n00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:47.889\n&gt;&gt; So how can I most, and\n\n65\n00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.420\nso software developers know this.\n\n66\n00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.290\nAnd they're thinking, how can I most\nefficiently utilize that space?\n\n67\n00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.857\nSo when we think of functions that\nare quick and used for fast reads and\n\n68\n00:04:00.857 --> 00:04:05.450\nwrites, like cached information,\npage files, things like that.\n\n69\n00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.710\nWe're typically gonna be trying\nto use the solid state drives for\n\n70\n00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.810\nthose actions, and more permanent\nstorage for the mechanical drives.\n\n71\n00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.210\nSo with storage pools and\ntiered storage, that becomes a reality.\n\n72\n00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.830\nIn the graphical user interface in\nWindows 10, you can access that.\n\n73\n00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.071\nAgain, that's one of those\nfeatures that was really designed,\n\n74\n00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:35.552\nin my opinion, for\nthe server side implementation.\n\n75\n00:04:35.552 --> 00:04:38.281\nAnd it kind of trickled on down\nthrough to the client side.\n\n76\n00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:43.200\nIt's just not fully optimized for\nmost end users.\n\n77\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.419\nSo the feature is available,\n\n78\n00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.223\nit's just not as prevalent as what\nyou would see in server side.\n\n79\n00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:52.995\nBecause you would typically use\nServer Manager to go ahead and\n\n80\n00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:55.358\nmanage all of your storage pools and\ntiers and such.\n\n81\n00:04:55.358 --> 00:04:59.770\nAll right, so\nif we take a look at my screen again, so\n\n82\n00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.930\nthat about does it for\nthe hardware, right?\n\n83\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.900\nSo like I said, it could be a mixture\nof different types of hardware.\n\n84\n00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.690\nYou can have a couple different rules,\nthough.\n\n85\n00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.610\nYou can have different pieces of hardware.\n\n86\n00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.870\nSo lets go with our direct attached\nstorage over here on the left side,\n\n87\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.880\nsome disks.\n\n88\n00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.140\nYou can take a disk, and\nyou can take multiple disks,\n\n89\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.740\nactually, up to 160 per pool,\nto go ahead and create pools.\n\n90\n00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.270\nI don't have 160 drives, but it's pretty\ncool that you have that scalability here.\n\n91\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:39.200\nYou are limited to the fact that you can't\nhave a hard drive span multiple pools.\n\n92\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.180\nSo that hard drive does have to be\nattached to one individual pool,\n\n93\n00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.460\nbut again, up to 160 there.\n\n94\n00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.490\nSo if we think about having multiple,\n\n95\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.620\nvaried types of physical disks, we can\ngo ahead and arrange and concatenate,\n\n96\n00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.320\nor aggregate, whatever term you wanna use,\nbasically, marry them into a little group.\n\n97\n00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.830\nAnd that creates a logical\nunit called a pool, all right?\n\n98\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.340\nSo from those pools,\nwe can then further allocate or\n\n99\n00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.500\ndisperse that storage space into,\nwell, spaces.\n\n100\n00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.283\nAlso, Microsoft does use\nthe terminology virtual disks, right?\n\n101\n00:06:18.283 --> 00:06:25.690\nSo we can create multiple disks from\na pool, one disk from a pool, or whatever.\n\n102\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.520\nThe end result up here at the very\ntop is basically, it's just what we\n\n103\n00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.400\nhave been working with and we're already\nfamiliar with, are those volumes.\n\n104\n00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.270\nSo you can take that virtual disk, format\nit, and treat it just as you would or\n\n105\n00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.400\nvery similarly to a regular dynamic disk.\n\n106\n00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.020\nOr even you can create a simple\nstorage space which would be\n\n107\n00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.800\ncomparable to a simple volume as well.\n\n108\n00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.511\nAnd it can be mounted into a folder,\nthis is my manilla folder there, Mike.\n\n109\n00:06:58.511 --> 00:06:59.801\n&gt;&gt; I see it, nice, [LAUGH].\n\n110\n00:06:59.801 --> 00:07:01.629\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or you can go ahead and\n\n111\n00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:05.613\nassign it a drive letter,\nlike I have here, F or whatever.\n\n112\n00:07:05.613 --> 00:07:10.077\nSo from the end user's perspective,\nnothing has changed, but really,\n\n113\n00:07:10.077 --> 00:07:12.024\neverything under the hood has.\n\n114\n00:07:12.024 --> 00:07:15.080\nSo that's what we'll be\nlooking at in the show today.\n\n115\n00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.009\n&gt;&gt; And it really is a pretty cool concept,\n\n116\n00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:19.702\nand it's kind of a tricky\none to understand, I think.\n\n117\n00:07:19.702 --> 00:07:22.945\nYou've done a good job there\ntalking about how really,\n\n118\n00:07:22.945 --> 00:07:26.460\nwe're hiding the underlying storage,\nright?\n\n119\n00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.620\nWe're almost putting a layer of\nabstraction, I think I can talk.\n\n120\n00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.240\nA layer of abstraction between\nthe hardware and what we're doing with it.\n\n121\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.893\nYou can take random disks to\ncreate this pool of space.\n\n122\n00:07:37.893 --> 00:07:39.925\nAnd then within that pool of space,\n\n123\n00:07:39.925 --> 00:07:42.982\ncreate virtual disks that\nwe use like any other disk.\n\n124\n00:07:42.982 --> 00:07:45.659\nBut you have no idea what\nhardware's underneath it,\n\n125\n00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:50.181\nwhether they're solid states, mechanicals,\na mixture of drives and things like that,\n\n126\n00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:53.729\nso it's really pretty neat.\n&gt;&gt; It is, there is a lot to think about,\n\n127\n00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:54.262\nthough.\n\n128\n00:07:54.262 --> 00:08:00.231\nBut luckily for you, for this exam,\nthey do not go into depth\n\n129\n00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:05.869\nlike you do see in maybe the 70-410 or\nServer 16.\n\n130\n00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:10.590\nExams are even more specific\nstorage type exams.\n\n131\n00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:11.990\nThere's a lot to learn.\n\n132\n00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.630\nAs a matter of fact,\nlet's take a look at my screen.\n\n133\n00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.100\nMicrosoft does do a really great\njob documenting this information.\n\n134\n00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.870\nSo what I'm going to highlight will\nbe what is pertinent to us here for\n\n135\n00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.750\nthis exam in Windows 10.\n\n136\n00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:29.060\nAnd so this page, I think it's\nreally cool because if you're not,\n\n137\n00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.050\nI know we've talked about\nrave configurations and\n\n138\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.330\ntalked about the efficiency or\nutilization of certain configurations\n\n139\n00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:41.340\nlike looking at mirroring and strafing,\nlike a raid five configuration.\n\n140\n00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.190\nHopefully that'll make sense to you and\nyou've understood that.\n\n141\n00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.820\nIf not, you can go back and\nwatch the shows that we did.\n\n142\n00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.690\nOther shows here in our course library\ntalk about this type of configurations or\n\n143\n00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.430\nread this document here that\nMicrosoft has available.\n\n144\n00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.760\nBecause a lot of the options,\n\n145\n00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.860\nwell the options that we do have available\nhere in storage spaces, in Windows 10, can\n\n146\n00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.500\nbe compared to those raid previous, those\nraid configurations that we spoke about.\n\n147\n00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:14.960\nSo let me just scroll down and\nwe'll take a look at this one, mirroring.\n\n148\n00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.490\nSo again, this one just kind of\nharkening that raid one configuration,\n\n149\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.130\nif you guys can see that.\n\n150\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:29.390\nAnd what I want you guys to note here,\nthis is a two-way mirroring.\n\n151\n00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.610\nIn Windows 10, we do have the ability\nto add additional drives and\n\n152\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:37.000\nwe'll see that as one of our\noptions in the actual interface.\n\n153\n00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.870\nHowever, you have to think about\nthe physical disks that you have.\n\n154\n00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:46.990\nSo in our demo, we'll have three disks,\nwhich we'll allow for two way mirroring.\n\n155\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:52.970\nif we were looking at additional drive\nfault tolerances or having the ability\n\n156\n00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:57.600\nto overcome additional drive failures we\nwould need to have additional drives.\n\n157\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.350\nSuch as here with a three way mirror\nwith a minimum of five drives.\n\n158\n00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:08.780\nWith that being said, storage space is,\nthere might be some discrepancies\n\n159\n00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.510\nin this document because they really are\nfocusing in on the server side of things.\n\n160\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:17.160\nSo they are talking about different\nmachines, different servers,\n\n161\n00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.640\njust note here we are really\ngonna be focusing in on\n\n162\n00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.620\none machine instead of\nspreading this job out.\n\n163\n00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.390\nSpreading our drives out\namongst multiple servers,\n\n164\n00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.810\nwhich would be common in a server\nside implementation of this.\n\n165\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.780\nWe're also gonna take a look at parity.\n\n166\n00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.880\nSo parity is going to be very similar\nto what we spoke about previously,\n\n167\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.570\nlike similar to a rate 5 configuration.\n\n168\n00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.720\nParity is often called erasure in coding.\n\n169\n00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.920\nThere is actually two\ndifferent types of encoding.\n\n170\n00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.890\nWe don't really see duo\nparity though in plain sight.\n\n171\n00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.950\nAgain, that's gonna be, like I said,\nthere are a lot of server-side features\n\n172\n00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.800\nthat do exist, and\nyou can read about them here.\n\n173\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.380\nAnd as a matter of fact, let me zoom in,\nso you guys can see this.\n\n174\n00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.440\nSo erasure coding provides\nfault tolerance, oops.\n\n175\n00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.620\nLet me move my little cursor over here.\n\n176\n00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.580\nUsing bitwise algorithms or arithmetic.\n\n177\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.500\nAnd it can get remarkably complicated,\n\n178\n00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.450\nif you see that portion [LAUGH]\nright there that's highlighted.\n\n179\n00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:25.770\nThey have separate lengths and let me\nzoom out, that really go into detail.\n\n180\n00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:31.650\nThis one guy wrote a little dummy's\nguide to erasure coding here.\n\n181\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.880\nSo it's kinda crazy when\nyou actually look at that.\n\n182\n00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.050\nLet me try to zoom out here.\n\n183\n00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.590\nI think we're in as far as I can.\n\n184\n00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:48.120\nIt's kind of crazy when you look at\nthe actual concept that's behind it.\n\n185\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:53.450\nBut I will tell you that it's\nbasically going to be a way for\n\n186\n00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:58.790\nyou to go ahead and\nhave some faults tolerance without,\n\n187\n00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:02.370\nI'm trying to think of\na good way to put this.\n\n188\n00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.250\nYou're not duplicating or\n\n189\n00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:09.340\nreplicating every single file\nlike you would with mirroring.\n\n190\n00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.160\nSo you don't have that 50% efficiency.\n\n191\n00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.590\nYou do have I think with a,\nwhich configuration?\n\n192\n00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:21.090\nFor the Two-way mirroring,\nI think is like 33.33% efficiency there.\n\n193\n00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.890\nLet me just verify that for\nour single parity.\n\n194\n00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.630\nI saw it somewhere, but anyways,\nthey're not gonna ask you all about that.\n\n195\n00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:35.110\nBut just know that you have a, it's a more\nefficient way to store information.\n\n196\n00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:40.140\nSo basically, like with your RAID 5\nconfigurations, if you have three drives,\n\n197\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.140\nyou lose one, but\nparity is going to be able to rebuild\n\n198\n00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.730\nthe information on the new\ndrive that is put in.\n\n199\n00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.000\nAnd the same concept applies here.\n\n200\n00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.790\nIf I have two drives fail in a parity\nconfiguration, data is lost.\n\n201\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:00.330\nI'm only going to be\nable to recover from one\n\n202\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.980\nhardware failure here with a parity\nconfiguration, if that makes sense.\n\n203\n00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.210\nAll right, and what else?\n\n204\n00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.440\nSimple, just like it sounds.\n\n205\n00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.300\nAnd we've seen that before\nalso in the past shows.\n\n206\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.710\nWe've created our simple volumes as well,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n207\n00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:23.320\nget started and set up a storage pool.\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n208\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:23.820\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n209\n00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.160\nLet me just get my machine going here.\n\n210\n00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.940\nSo here I have a virtual machine that\nall ready has some drives attached and\n\n211\n00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.590\nI had to do a little bit of work\nto make it appear as though\n\n212\n00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.930\nthese drives are physical disks.\n\n213\n00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:44.230\nSo if you think about the logic behind\nthis is a little silly to go ahead and\n\n214\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.445\nset up some of these\nconfigurations with virtual disks.\n\n215\n00:13:47.445 --> 00:13:51.625\nBecause if the original data is stored\nonly on one piece of hardware and\n\n216\n00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:55.695\nif that physical hardware were to fail,\nthen you've lost everything.\n\n217\n00:13:55.695 --> 00:14:00.955\nSo what you really wanna be working with\nhere is the direct attached storage,\n\n218\n00:14:00.955 --> 00:14:05.690\nto have those different disks available to\nprovide that fault tolerance, if that's\n\n219\n00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.800\nwhy you're setting up your storage spaces.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n220\n00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.230\n&gt;&gt; Usually, that's why people set them up.\n\n221\n00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.030\nAll right, so here are some disk\nthat we'll be working with.\n\n222\n00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:17.360\nAgain, I just chose those same 5 gig\ndrives that we've been working with here.\n\n223\n00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:24.240\nAnd disk management, we've been working\nwith the disk management quite a bit.\n\n224\n00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.040\nGetting familiar with the way that the\ndisks behave within the operating system.\n\n225\n00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.750\nHowever, again,\n\n226\n00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:37.190\nI think storage spaces was really\ndesigned to work well with sever manager.\n\n227\n00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:42.000\nSo I've had issues in the past\nwhere number one you're not gonna\n\n228\n00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.450\nreally be able to work hands on with\nthe disks and see them until you get them\n\n229\n00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.710\nformatted with volumes.\n\n230\n00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.960\nAnd sometimes there's a bit discrepancy.\n\n231\n00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.530\nI don't know.\nIt's kind of hard to explain,\n\n232\n00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.760\nbut even if you refresh you're not\ngonna be able to have that full\n\n233\n00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.170\nfunctionality that you would\nhave in server manager.\n\n234\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:08.130\nBut you do have PowerShell available for\nyou to work with these\n\n235\n00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:12.460\nhere in the client side, so let me just\ngo ahead and minimize disk management.\n\n236\n00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.270\nWhat we're gonna be looking for\nhere they actually have\n\n237\n00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:19.140\na separate interface a little\npage that they've designed here.\n\n238\n00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.970\nAnd if you start typing in storage,\nall right,\n\n239\n00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:28.120\nthis is that page I was talking about it\nsimply just says Manage Storage Spaces.\n\n240\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.507\nNow that's a tongue twister.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n241\n00:15:30.507 --> 00:15:31.786\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n242\n00:15:31.786 --> 00:15:36.000\nso here under our Control Panel applet\nwe have the ability to go ahead and\n\n243\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.080\nmanage storage spaces.\n\n244\n00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.120\nAnd you see your UAC or your shield for\nthat advanced credentials.\n\n245\n00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.570\nJust make sure you do have that, because\nyou will be prompted here, it's asking,\n\n246\n00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.750\nlook, do you wanna allow this app\nto make changes to your device?\n\n247\n00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.796\nBecause we are messing with hardware here,\nso that's a good thing.\n\n248\n00:15:50.796 --> 00:15:56.100\nAll right, couple things.\n\n249\n00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:01.465\nYou have to have drives that are ready to\nbe used, ready to be put in storage pools.\n\n250\n00:16:01.465 --> 00:16:06.455\nSo if I had drives that are formatted and\nmaybe I used for storage on this\n\n251\n00:16:06.455 --> 00:16:12.037\nmachine They would show up here in this\ninterface, but just underneath of it,\n\n252\n00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:15.263\nand it would say, formatted drives.\n&gt;&gt; Unavailable?\n\n253\n00:16:15.263 --> 00:16:16.333\n&gt;&gt; Just to make sure, right.\n\n254\n00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:18.453\nBecause they're not gonna be added.\n\n255\n00:16:18.453 --> 00:16:22.761\nThe operating system is going to\nassume that you wanna retain your\n\n256\n00:16:22.761 --> 00:16:25.830\nformatted drives and\nany data that is on them.\n\n257\n00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:30.660\nBecause these drives do need to be\nempty and available for use here.\n\n258\n00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.760\nSo these are those three disks that\nI was telling you about there.\n\n259\n00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.400\nLet's go ahead and\njust keep them all checked here.\n\n260\n00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.953\nAnd so\nnow we're moving from that bottom level up\n\n261\n00:16:41.953 --> 00:16:46.558\nto the second level here to create\nour pool, if you can recall.\n\n262\n00:16:46.558 --> 00:16:50.494\nAnd we can go ahead and\nname our storage space.\n\n263\n00:16:50.494 --> 00:16:57.008\nLet's just say,\nlet's call this one Demo Storage space.\n\n264\n00:16:57.008 --> 00:17:01.977\nDrive letter E is fine,\nactually let's do, I'm gonna change\n\n265\n00:17:01.977 --> 00:17:06.772\nthis one here on the fly,\nsimple we'll do simple for first.\n\n266\n00:17:11.191 --> 00:17:16.420\nNow, notice how it does say,\nno resiliency.\n\n267\n00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.060\nThis is just going to be like we\nwere creating those simple volumes.\n\n268\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:24.450\nAs a matter of fact,\nstorage space is designed to go ahead and\n\n269\n00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:29.000\nreplace the other methods that we\nhad seen previously, to go ahead and\n\n270\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.130\nmanage that storage.\n\n271\n00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:35.013\nSo just kind of get familiar with it,\nbecause that's the way we're going here.\n\n272\n00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:41.030\nNow also, the little information bubbles\nare helpful throughout the wizard,\n\n273\n00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.841\nor the interface here.\n\n274\n00:17:42.841 --> 00:17:46.058\nIt says a simple storage space\nwrites one copy of your data and\n\n275\n00:17:46.058 --> 00:17:48.406\ndoesn't protect you from drive failures.\n\n276\n00:17:48.406 --> 00:17:51.390\nA simple storage space\nrequires at least one drive.\n\n277\n00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.830\nThat's all pretty common, right,\nlike pretty straightforward.\n\n278\n00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.053\nOne thing that is a little interesting\nhere, you can actually create,\n\n279\n00:18:00.053 --> 00:18:02.390\nand let me zoom in so\nwe can see the second bubble here.\n\n280\n00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:09.307\nA storage space can be larger than\nthe amount of available capacity in\n\n281\n00:18:09.307 --> 00:18:10.586\nthe storage pool.\n\n282\n00:18:10.586 --> 00:18:15.180\nSo when you run low on capacity in\nthe pool, you can add more drives.\n\n283\n00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:19.892\nI'm not a huge fan of thin\nprovisioning drives or,\n\n284\n00:18:19.892 --> 00:18:24.040\nI feel like it's posing when you do this.\n\n285\n00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.250\nBut there may be really good\n\n286\n00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:32.420\nreasons as to why you want to provide that\nillusion of additional storage space.\n\n287\n00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:38.430\nI'm just gonna keep everything\nsmaller than my physical allotment for\n\n288\n00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:43.900\nthis demonstration purpose, but just\nknow that you do have that availability.\n\n289\n00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.260\nHowever, if you do reach full\ncapacity of that physical storage\n\n290\n00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.470\nyou will have to add additional\ndrives to your storage pool.\n\n291\n00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.390\nSo we just added three drives and\nas a matter of fact if\n\n292\n00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.450\nI don't have another drive to\nadd right here on the fly.\n\n293\n00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.620\nBut let's say I wanted to\nadd a fourth drive, or\n\n294\n00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.510\nmaybe five drives because\nyou'll see here in a moment,\n\n295\n00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.920\nsome of the configurations are limited\nby he number of drives I have.\n\n296\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.850\nSo if I add another drive or\ntwo other drives, I have the ability,\n\n297\n00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.680\nthe option, to optimize my storage pool.\n\n298\n00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:25.820\nSo what that means is that the percentage\nof storage per drive will be recalculated\n\n299\n00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:31.850\nand allocated evenly, or as configuration\npermits, if I choose to do so.\n\n300\n00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.330\nThat's not something you have to do, but\n\n301\n00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:38.900\nit's just an optimization technique that\nwill be presented to you when you add,\n\n302\n00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.620\nattach additional drives.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, and\n\n303\n00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.480\nI've used both of these that\nyou've been talking about.\n\n304\n00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.890\nI know that when I set up, not a\nprofessional thing, when I set up a media\n\n305\n00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.995\ncenter at home to store all my movies and\nthings like that that, of course, I own.\n\n306\n00:19:50.995 --> 00:19:55.403\n[COUGH] I tried to calculate how much\nspace overall I was going to need and\n\n307\n00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:58.179\nI couldn't afford to\nbuy all of the drives.\n\n308\n00:19:58.179 --> 00:20:03.750\nSo I went ahead and set up my storage\npool and used the two drives that I had.\n\n309\n00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:08.764\nAnd then made the pool, or made the space,\non that pool bigger than I actually had.\n\n310\n00:20:08.764 --> 00:20:11.728\nKnowing that I could eventually buy more\ndrives and add them in as I need it.\n\n311\n00:20:11.728 --> 00:20:16.016\nI know in a business environment you might\ncalculate out, well each user is using\n\n312\n00:20:16.016 --> 00:20:20.385\nthis amount of data so we need about this\nmuch space to store all this information.\n\n313\n00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:23.030\nBut in two years where is that gonna be?\n\n314\n00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.400\nSo we can make that storage pool\nlarger than what we actually have, and\n\n315\n00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.270\nwe have time to purchase\nthe extra storage.\n\n316\n00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.812\nCuz storage, even though it's\na lot cheaper than it used to be,\n\n317\n00:20:32.812 --> 00:20:35.607\ncan still add up when you're talking\nabout terabytes and terabytes.\n\n318\n00:20:35.607 --> 00:20:36.807\nSo I on the other hand,\n\n319\n00:20:36.807 --> 00:20:40.405\nopposite of Cherokee-\n&gt;&gt; I know I was gonna say Mike's a glass\n\n320\n00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:45.200\nhalf full kinda guy, and I'm a glass\nhalf empty kind of person I guess.\n\n321\n00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.475\nI don't know, so.\n&gt;&gt; I like that\n\n322\n00:20:46.475 --> 00:20:49.310\nability to do that thin provisioning,\nbecause I could plan out,\n\n323\n00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.434\neven though I don't have all the resources\nyet, I know I'm going to need it.\n\n324\n00:20:52.434 --> 00:20:55.824\nAnd it gives me that time to get it,\nand then we can add it in later.\n\n325\n00:20:55.824 --> 00:20:59.397\nRather than like with traditional Raid,\nwhere if I needed to add space to\n\n326\n00:20:59.397 --> 00:21:01.790\na traditional Raid, I've got to.\n&gt;&gt; It is what it is, yep.\n\n327\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:02.860\n&gt;&gt; Back everything up.\n\n328\n00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.181\nBlow the whole Raid array away.\n\n329\n00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:09.563\nAdd more drives, and\nthen dump all my data back on there.\n\n330\n00:21:09.563 --> 00:21:12.026\nSo that's always been a, I like that fact.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:21:12.026 --> 00:21:12.850\n&gt;&gt; And then the,\n\n332\n00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:16.153\nwhat were you talking about\nelse with the storage pools?\n\n333\n00:21:16.153 --> 00:21:17.220\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, but\n\n334\n00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:21.571\nyou did remind me of something when you\ndid mention thin provisioning again.\n\n335\n00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:25.041\nWhen tiered storage does not allow for\nthin provisioning.\n\n336\n00:21:25.041 --> 00:21:28.358\nJust FYI, if you are setting that up and\nyou're trying to use thin provisioning.\n\n337\n00:21:28.358 --> 00:21:29.500\nAnd you're like, why isn't it working?\n\n338\n00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.745\nIt's because you have to utilize fixed\nprovisioning, which if we haven't spoke\n\n339\n00:21:32.745 --> 00:21:35.864\nabout that, if you haven't seen it in\nour shows yet, we will talk about that.\n\n340\n00:21:35.864 --> 00:21:39.449\nI can't remember at this point in time\nif we have or have not covered it, but,\n\n341\n00:21:39.449 --> 00:21:40.400\nit will be covered.\n\n342\n00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.298\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what's next, so\n\n343\n00:21:42.298 --> 00:21:46.557\nno time provisioning for Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; No thin provisioning for Cherokee,\n\n344\n00:21:46.557 --> 00:21:51.804\nas a matter of fact, I'm going to be\nsuper frugal with my storage here.\n\n345\n00:21:51.804 --> 00:21:56.150\nYou'll notice also, so\nfive times three is?\n\n346\n00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:56.889\n&gt;&gt; 15.\n\n347\n00:21:56.889 --> 00:21:58.693\n&gt;&gt; However, look at my availability here,\n\n348\n00:21:58.693 --> 00:22:01.139\nwhat do I have?\n&gt;&gt; 12.\n\n349\n00:22:01.139 --> 00:22:02.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah 12.7 and\n\n350\n00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.789\nthen even my availability is only at 12.\n\n351\n00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:10.374\nSo there is some storage that\nis utilized for overhead, and\n\n352\n00:22:10.374 --> 00:22:12.970\nthat's why we see that discrepancy.\n\n353\n00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:17.970\nNo big deal because the benefits in my\nopinion do outweigh what storage is today.\n\n354\n00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.990\nWe're gonna go head and\ngo with 3 GB for now.\n\n355\n00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:27.914\nAnd we'll just go ahead and hit create\nstorage space, it's really that easy.\n\n356\n00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.350\nAll right, so now,\nhere we have our file explorer.\n\n357\n00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.680\nAnd again, this is what I said\nfrom the end-user perspective.\n\n358\n00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.447\nThis just looks like hey, let's go\nahead and store this on the E drive.\n\n359\n00:22:41.447 --> 00:22:46.051\nNone the wiser, so you could go ahead and\ncreate files and store them and\n\n360\n00:22:46.051 --> 00:22:49.055\nshare them,\njust as you would any other type.\n\n361\n00:22:49.055 --> 00:22:50.752\nBut that one's simple, right?\n\n362\n00:22:50.752 --> 00:22:52.820\nAnd let me just minimize this.\n\n363\n00:22:52.820 --> 00:23:00.030\nIf we full screen this and then,\nnotice my storage space is noted here.\n\n364\n00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.140\nIf I expand out this\noption down at the bottom,\n\n365\n00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.350\nwe'll see, I think this is pretty cool.\n\n366\n00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:10.260\nWhen you're setting up your labs and\nplaying around,\n\n367\n00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:15.967\nplay close attention to your numbers,\nyour percentages being utilized here.\n\n368\n00:23:15.967 --> 00:23:23.371\nSo currently, if we think about that we\nset aside 3 GB for our E volume here.\n\n369\n00:23:23.371 --> 00:23:28.610\nAnd each on of these 5 GB\ndrives is utilizing 21.2%\n\n370\n00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:33.200\nof it's storage space\non the physical disk.\n\n371\n00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.364\nSo it's pretty easy to see\nhow it's evenly dispersed.\n\n372\n00:23:37.364 --> 00:23:41.777\nAnd although it's dispersed amongst those\ndrives, there is no fault tolerance.\n\n373\n00:23:41.777 --> 00:23:47.727\nSo if one of these physical drives were to\nmalfunction I would lose my information,\n\n374\n00:23:47.727 --> 00:23:48.414\nmy data.\n\n375\n00:23:48.414 --> 00:23:53.844\nSo not to be used in place of backups.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah which kinda reminds\n\n376\n00:23:53.844 --> 00:23:57.725\nme of a span volume where you're really\njust increasing your points of failure.\n\n377\n00:23:57.725 --> 00:23:58.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n378\n00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:59.729\n&gt;&gt; On this cuz now you've got\n\n379\n00:23:59.729 --> 00:24:03.922\nmore than one drive hosting that volume,\n&gt;&gt; Any one of those drives fails,\n\n380\n00:24:03.922 --> 00:24:06.163\nI potentially lose all my data.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, Mike.\n\n381\n00:24:06.163 --> 00:24:10.636\nKnowing and understanding that is\nessential for, especially test taking and\n\n382\n00:24:10.636 --> 00:24:13.549\njust real life to make sure\nyou're not Expecting or\n\n383\n00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:16.410\ncounting on something\nthat really isn't there.\n\n384\n00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:20.130\nHaving that false sense of security or\nsomething.\n\n385\n00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:24.770\nHowever, if you do wanna go ahead and\nset up some type of security blanket,\n\n386\n00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.150\nlet's take a look at some of\nthe options we have available to us.\n\n387\n00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:30.950\nLet me just zoom in so\nwe can take a look at that.\n\n388\n00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.540\nWe do have some links here.\n\n389\n00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.450\nWe're able to create a storage space.\n\n390\n00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:37.370\nThis is that option here\nwhere I said Add drives when\n\n391\n00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.380\nwe were talking about\nreconfiguring that optimization.\n\n392\n00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:44.859\nYou can rename the pool, and\nthen if I am working with the drives,\n\n393\n00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:49.093\nmaybe I've added and\nI decided not to optimize at that time and\n\n394\n00:24:49.093 --> 00:24:54.631\nwaited a little bit, I can go back at any\npoint in time to optimize my drive usage,\n\n395\n00:24:54.631 --> 00:24:56.929\njust knowing that is available.\n\n396\n00:24:56.929 --> 00:25:00.290\nBut let's create another\nstorage space right now.\n\n397\n00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.535\nAnd just looking at the options\nthat are available to us, for us.\n\n398\n00:25:03.535 --> 00:25:08.492\n[LAUGH] Anyways so-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE],\n\n399\n00:25:08.492 --> 00:25:10.620\nexactly.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.484\n&gt;&gt; Two way mirroring, right?\n\n401\n00:25:11.484 --> 00:25:12.276\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n402\n00:25:12.276 --> 00:25:12.939\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n403\n00:25:12.939 --> 00:25:14.840\nso let's take a look at that.\n\n404\n00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.250\nTwo-way mirroring is going\nto be taking an exact\n\n405\n00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:23.200\nduplicate of the data that you're writing\nand putting it onto another disc.\n\n406\n00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.850\nSo you have to have,\n\n407\n00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:30.848\nin this configuration, at least two\ndrives and it's noted right here.\n\n408\n00:25:30.848 --> 00:25:34.860\nThat's because we're writing\ntwo copies of your data, so\n\n409\n00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.420\nyou have to have a minimum\nof two drives here.\n\n410\n00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.870\nYou can add more drives, like I said.\n\n411\n00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:45.610\nHowever, okay,\nsometimes in the server side operating\n\n412\n00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:50.470\nsystem you'll see options grayed\nout that you can't select.\n\n413\n00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.470\nAs a matter of fact, let's try to\nswitch this to three-way mirroring.\n\n414\n00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:56.820\nAnd then it says a three-way\nmirror storage space writes\n\n415\n00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:01.970\nthree copies of your data, helping protect\nyou from two simultaneous drive failures.\n\n416\n00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:06.430\nA three-way mirror storage space\nrequires at least five drives.\n\n417\n00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.920\nSo we only have three in this particular\npool, so we're not able to go ahead and\n\n418\n00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.700\nset that up.\n\n419\n00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:16.410\nBut just know the difference, again,\nespecially from, maybe, real life\n\n420\n00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:21.350\nsituations and planning out deployments,\nas well as a test taking perspective.\n\n421\n00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:27.190\nSo let's go ahead and\njust name this one our Mirror,\n\n422\n00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:31.560\nif I can type, oops, Storage Space there.\n\n423\n00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.032\nWe'll just keep that as Drive F.\n\n424\n00:26:35.032 --> 00:26:42.760\nAnd, let me zoom in so\nyou guys can see this change.\n\n425\n00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.380\nI'm gonna change this to 3 gig just so\nyou can see how this affects,\n\n426\n00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.870\nreally if you think about it,\ncommon sense here,\n\n427\n00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:54.930\nit was 4 and 8, you're essentially\njust doubling that space,\n\n428\n00:26:54.930 --> 00:27:00.440\nbecause 3 gigs will be my\nactual usable storage space.\n\n429\n00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.590\nThat additional or total number here of 6,\n\n430\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:09.010\nyou have to think about an additional 3\ngigs is reserved for that duplicate copy.\n\n431\n00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:13.960\nSo that's where that efficiency comes\ninto play in those percentages that I was\n\n432\n00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.470\nmentioning.\n\n433\n00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:19.700\nI don't think they'll be quizzing\nyou on anything like that.\n\n434\n00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:25.059\nBut really understanding how those drives\nbehave, and then most importantly,\n\n435\n00:27:25.059 --> 00:27:29.887\nin my opinion, is understanding what\nthose tolerances will allow for.\n\n436\n00:27:33.184 --> 00:27:37.444\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\ncreate this storage space.\n\n437\n00:27:37.444 --> 00:27:41.903\nAnd again,\nthis will just appear like another volume\n\n438\n00:27:41.903 --> 00:27:46.459\nhere to that end user and\nwe can see it noted right here,\n\n439\n00:27:46.459 --> 00:27:49.190\nMirror Storage Space.\n&gt;&gt; And, Cherokee,\n\n440\n00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:55.040\nyou created this particular space on\nthe same storage pool that you used for\n\n441\n00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.405\nthe first one, right?\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n442\n00:27:56.405 --> 00:27:57.257\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] simple.\n\n443\n00:27:57.257 --> 00:27:58.768\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's because I'm\n\n444\n00:27:58.768 --> 00:28:02.960\nworking here with that limited\nsubset of physical drives.\n\n445\n00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.490\nAnd really you can do this in\nwhatever way it makes sense for you.\n\n446\n00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:10.716\nIf you wanna utilize the drives that you\ndo have or if you wanna max out your\n\n447\n00:28:10.716 --> 00:28:15.150\nsystem and add as many physical drives\nas you can to have that separation, so\n\n448\n00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:19.863\nyou do have less points of failures,\nadding those additional drives into having\n\n449\n00:28:19.863 --> 00:28:23.482\na three way mirror or something.\n&gt;&gt; But you can create multiple storage\n\n450\n00:28:23.482 --> 00:28:25.970\nspaces in a single storage pool.\n&gt;&gt; For sure, yep.\n\n451\n00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.360\nAll right, so what we wanna do,\nlet's go ahead and look at parity.\n\n452\n00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.790\nI mentioned it but\n\n453\n00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:37.480\nwe will actually create our third\nstorage space onto this particular pool.\n\n454\n00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.130\nSo we'll go ahead and\ncreate a storage space.\n\n455\n00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.480\nSo, as long as you have storage available\nthat's the key component there.\n\n456\n00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.713\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n457\n00:28:44.713 --> 00:28:45.604\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n458\n00:28:45.604 --> 00:28:48.660\nthis one is going to be\nour parity storage space.\n\n459\n00:28:51.234 --> 00:28:52.960\nAnd we'll go ahead and change that here.\n\n460\n00:28:54.342 --> 00:28:59.080\nAnd again, like I mentioned before, there\nare additional configurations available\n\n461\n00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.970\nwith your server side storage spaces.\n\n462\n00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:06.345\nBut at least we do have that option here\nin our client site operating system.\n\n463\n00:29:06.345 --> 00:29:10.510\nAnd parity storage space writes\nyour data with parity information,\n\n464\n00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:14.810\nthat erasure encoding, that parity bit or\n\n465\n00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:19.800\nparity arithmetic, to go ahead and help\nprotect you from a single drive failure.\n\n466\n00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.430\nA parity storage space requires\nat least three drives.\n\n467\n00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.797\nActually, let me cancel this real quick so\nwe can take a look at our\n\n468\n00:29:29.797 --> 00:29:34.510\ncurrent state of the drives,\nthe percentage usage.\n\n469\n00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:39.330\nAnd then I wanna compare that with\nyou guys after we've completed that.\n\n470\n00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:45.250\nSo, take a look at my utilization here.\n\n471\n00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.474\nSo, on Disk 1, I'm at 31.7%.\n\n472\n00:29:48.474 --> 00:29:54.826\nDisk 2, 36.9, as well as Disk 3, 36.9.\n\n473\n00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:57.493\nSo, I wanted to just bring\nthat to your attention,\n\n474\n00:29:57.493 --> 00:29:59.920\nbecause if we think about mirroring,\nright?\n\n475\n00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.690\nSo we have exact duplicates.\n\n476\n00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.380\nSo we're utilizing two\nof those three drives.\n\n477\n00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.090\nSo, if we were actually\nutilizing three-way mirroring,\n\n478\n00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:14.370\nyou would see three of those\ndiscs with that influx of\n\n479\n00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:17.670\npercentage being utilized there,\nif that makes sense.\n\n480\n00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.852\nSo not all drives are used in\nthat mirroring configuration as\n\n481\n00:30:21.852 --> 00:30:25.548\nthey were with our previous\nsimple volume creation.\n\n482\n00:30:28.786 --> 00:30:31.945\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead and walk you\nthrough these steps again to go ahead and\n\n483\n00:30:31.945 --> 00:30:33.960\ncreate that parity storage space.\n\n484\n00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.356\nI just wanted to back up and\nshow you guys that real quick.\n\n485\n00:30:43.662 --> 00:30:45.555\nAnd again I'm gonna change this to 3 gigs.\n\n486\n00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.597\nNothing special here and we'll go\nahead and create that storage space.\n\n487\n00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.932\n&gt;&gt; Bada-bing.\n\n488\n00:30:57.932 --> 00:30:59.519\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna wade\n\n489\n00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:01.913\nthrough the alphabet here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n490\n00:31:01.913 --> 00:31:03.023\n&gt;&gt; So, E, F, and G,\n\n491\n00:31:03.023 --> 00:31:06.050\nwe can see those different\ntypes available to us.\n\n492\n00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.140\nIt really didn't take long.\n\n493\n00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.650\nIt was super easy.\n\n494\n00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:12.370\nI think understanding how\n\n495\n00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:16.990\nthe data will respond to those\nfailures is very important.\n\n496\n00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.200\nAnd also let's take a look at\na couple other things here.\n\n497\n00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.390\nI know we're getting closer on time but\nwe're almost finished.\n\n498\n00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:29.006\nAnd now you can see that percentage\nincreasing as we're adding different\n\n499\n00:31:29.006 --> 00:31:30.575\nconfigurations there.\n\n500\n00:31:30.575 --> 00:31:34.950\nAnd you do have the ability to go\nahead and change a few things.\n\n501\n00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:41.810\nYou can rename the individual\n\n502\n00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:47.200\ndisks here, the physical disks,\nyou can delete the actual pool,\n\n503\n00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:55.770\noops, view files associated with that\npool over here on the right hand side.\n\n504\n00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:59.132\nYou can create a new pool and\nstorage space as well, so\n\n505\n00:31:59.132 --> 00:32:01.616\nif you wanted to add additional pools.\n\n506\n00:32:01.616 --> 00:32:06.599\nSo, really just navigating and\ngetting familiar with this interface,\n\n507\n00:32:06.599 --> 00:32:11.592\nlike I said, you do have PowerShell\nto execute these functions as well.\n\n508\n00:32:11.592 --> 00:32:16.614\nSo I think, moving forward,\nwe're getting close to end of storage,\n\n509\n00:32:16.614 --> 00:32:20.018\nbut we'll look at different\ntypes of ways we can\n\n510\n00:32:20.018 --> 00:32:24.720\nmanage via command line interfaces\nas well as troubleshooting.\n\n511\n00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.170\nAnd then I think just looking at\nsome virtual hard disc drives.\n\n512\n00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:31.130\nWe're chugging along on our journey\nthough, our storage evolution.\n\n513\n00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.070\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good, Cherokee.\n\n514\n00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:36.410\nThank you for those great demonstrations\nthere on storage spaces and storage pools,\n\n515\n00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:37.700\nwe appreciate that.\n\n516\n00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.750\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n517\n00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:42.620\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n518\n00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:43.410\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n519\n00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.693\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n520\n00:32:44.693 --> 00:32:51.474\n[MUSIC]\n\n521\n00:32:51.474 --> 00:32:54.787\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

at you live from\nSan Francisco, California.\n\n4\n00:00:05.726 --> 00:00:07.077\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:07.077 --> 00:00:08.481\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:12.770\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n7\n00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.926\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:16.785\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:19.642\nToday, we're installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n10\n00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:23.041\nAnd, specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be troubleshooting storage.\n\n11\n00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:25.309\nAnd, here to help us with that is\nnone other, than Miss Cherokee Boose,\n\n12\n00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:26.281\nwelcome back Cherry.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n13\n00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:29.062\nthanks for having me Mike, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good.\n\n14\n00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.824\nSo, storage,\nwe're gonna have problems now and again.\n\n15\n00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:33.753\nWe need to be able to figure out,\nwhat's going on right?\n\n16\n00:00:33.753 --> 00:00:35.754\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's the just a bit Mike,\n\n17\n00:00:35.754 --> 00:00:39.487\nso you know we've been talking\nabout storage for quite a while.\n\n18\n00:00:39.487 --> 00:00:42.961\nNow, in all the different configurations\nthat are possible, and you know,\n\n19\n00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:44.945\nwith all those different configurations.\n\n20\n00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:49.279\nYou have all of these additional variables\nthat are just thrown into the mix of\n\n21\n00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:51.354\npotentially, what could be wrong.\n\n22\n00:00:51.354 --> 00:00:55.148\nSo, normally,\nwhen we look at objectives on the exam for\n\n23\n00:00:55.148 --> 00:00:58.875\nlike troubleshooting,\nI try to work it in to the shows.\n\n24\n00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:02.093\nWhen were covering the topic,\nbut for this one Mike, I think,\n\n25\n00:01:02.093 --> 00:01:05.696\nthis might even be a two-parter,\njust looking at troubleshooting.\n\n26\n00:01:05.696 --> 00:01:10.615\nBecause there are a lot of\ndifferent reasons and solutions,\n\n27\n00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:13.807\nfor disk issues that we may encounter.\n\n28\n00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:19.011\nSo, I think we're gonna start by really\nstretching our sleuth skills, and\n\n29\n00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:23.046\nmaybe Sherlock and Holmes, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, do a little detective work?\n\n30\n00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:23.773\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n31\n00:01:23.773 --> 00:01:25.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like it.\n\n32\n00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.306\n&gt;&gt; So, where would you go ahead and\n\n33\n00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:27.184\nstart that, right?\n\n34\n00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:33.048\nWell, you could go in, I have noted here,\nI wanna check out like event viewer.\n\n35\n00:01:33.048 --> 00:01:37.659\nAnd I have device manager, and disc part,\nthose are all good places you guys\n\n36\n00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.505\nare already familiar with a lot of these\ntools that we spoke about, there it is.\n\n37\n00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:47.701\nOne area of the Operating System\nthat kinda collects those tools,\n\n38\n00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:51.614\nthose Microsoft snap in,\nthose consoles for us.\n\n39\n00:01:51.614 --> 00:01:53.492\nAnd that's gonna be under\nAdministrative Tools.\n\n40\n00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:57.587\nSo, if we take a look at my screen, a\ncouple different way you can get there, of\n\n41\n00:01:57.587 --> 00:02:01.698\ncourse, you can always just start typing\nthat in, and give it a second there.\n\n42\n00:02:01.698 --> 00:02:05.159\nTo look for\nthose Administrative Tools right here.\n\n43\n00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.051\nAnd if you wanted the path\nunder Control Panel, and\n\n44\n00:02:08.051 --> 00:02:11.695\nthat's going to be under your System and\nSecurity, I believe.\n\n45\n00:02:11.695 --> 00:02:15.122\nLet's go ahead and launch that.\n\n46\n00:02:15.122 --> 00:02:18.795\nI say that, and it's just kind of mad\nat me, give it a second [CROSSTALK]\n\n47\n00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:19.483\n&gt;&gt; It's thinking about it.\n\n48\n00:02:19.483 --> 00:02:20.026\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n49\n00:02:20.026 --> 00:02:21.968\n&gt;&gt; There it goes, all right,\n\n50\n00:02:21.968 --> 00:02:23.915\nnow I have it twice, yeah.\n\n51\n00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:28.116\nSystem and Security, yes for\nunder three times, there we go.\n\n52\n00:02:28.116 --> 00:02:31.067\n[LAUGH] For our Control Panel there.\n\n53\n00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:34.788\nAnd, so this is just a nice little\ncollection of those tools, right?\n\n54\n00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:39.002\nSo, of course you can use\nthe Run Lines for each one of those,\n\n55\n00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:42.583\nfour times, that's embarrassing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n56\n00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:43.567\n&gt;&gt; Hold on I just gotta check and\n\n57\n00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:45.379\nmake sure,\nokay we not working with anything else.\n\n58\n00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.999\n[LAUGH] And let me zoom in a little bit,\nso you guys can see this.\n\n59\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.500\nAll right, so, we'll just specifically in\nthis show be focusing on tools that we can\n\n60\n00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.173\nuse here for\nour troubleshooting with our disks.\n\n61\n00:02:59.173 --> 00:03:04.344\nSo, the first thing you might\nwanna do is go into Event Viewer.\n\n62\n00:03:04.344 --> 00:03:07.529\nI don't think we have spoke\nabout Event Viewer as of yet.\n\n63\n00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:11.732\nWe are gonna have a whole topic\nthat's gonna be it's own topic, and\n\n64\n00:03:11.732 --> 00:03:14.768\nwe'll discuss how we can\nutilize Event Viewer.\n\n65\n00:03:14.768 --> 00:03:16.869\nIf this is brand new to you, just know,\n\n66\n00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:20.769\nthat this is going to be a really good\nplace to begin that investigation.\n\n67\n00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.688\nCan look Exploratory because,\nthere might be clues in our logs, so\n\n68\n00:03:24.688 --> 00:03:27.458\nEvent Viewer is gonna be\nretaining those logs.\n\n69\n00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:30.364\nAnd let me zoom in, a little bit.\n\n70\n00:03:30.364 --> 00:03:34.897\nWe get different event types,\nclassified by triage or\n\n71\n00:03:34.897 --> 00:03:41.017\nlevel of importance or severeness,\nI guess, of that particular event.\n\n72\n00:03:41.017 --> 00:03:46.057\nSo if you had issues and your end user\nwas complaining about any kind of,\n\n73\n00:03:46.057 --> 00:03:51.349\njust strange things happening,\nmaybe the drive is not being recognized,\n\n74\n00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.296\nsystem performance, things like that.\n\n75\n00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:58.254\nA lot of crashes, hanging up\nOperating Systems, applications,\n\n76\n00:03:58.254 --> 00:04:03.289\nthings like that, you could go in here and\nthen check expand all under your warning.\n\n77\n00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:07.394\nAnd see if there were any\nkind of glaring remarks or\n\n78\n00:04:07.394 --> 00:04:12.694\nwarning notifications,\nespecially if they were repetitive.\n\n79\n00:04:12.694 --> 00:04:18.108\nBecause with discs usually\nthey're going to be a transient.\n\n80\n00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:22.448\nMeaning they might happen sometimes,\nnot all the times, and then usually,\n\n81\n00:04:22.448 --> 00:04:25.142\nthey're progressively\nworse as time goes on.\n\n82\n00:04:25.142 --> 00:04:26.440\nSo that's what you wanna kinda look for.\n\n83\n00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.810\nLook for that event ID to help,\n\n84\n00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.653\nyou might find some good information\nto put you in the right direction here.\n\n85\n00:04:34.653 --> 00:04:37.808\nAll right, another thing that\nwe have at our disposal here.\n\n86\n00:04:37.808 --> 00:04:40.301\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nclose out of event viewer.\n\n87\n00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:42.076\nActually, let me just\nuse my run line here.\n\n88\n00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:46.647\nWe'll go ahead and type in,\nnot Disk Management but for here,\n\n89\n00:04:46.647 --> 00:04:50.541\nI wanna go ahead, and\nuse my Device Manager Run Line.\n\n90\n00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:55.012\nSo that's gonna be DEV and\n\n91\n00:04:55.012 --> 00:04:58.471\nthat is mgmt.msc.\n\n92\n00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:02.271\nAnd I'll zoom in so you guys can see that,\nmake sure that's correct.\n\n93\n00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:04.511\nAll right, we'll go ahead and hit OK.\n\n94\n00:05:07.483 --> 00:05:10.208\nAnd, I wanna bring a Device Manager,\n\n95\n00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:15.927\nbecause we looked at Device Manager\nwhen we're talking about Device Drivers.\n\n96\n00:05:15.927 --> 00:05:19.123\nBut if you think about it,\nHard Drives do have drivers,\n\n97\n00:05:19.123 --> 00:05:21.097\nthey actually have controllers.\n\n98\n00:05:21.097 --> 00:05:24.362\nAnd back in the day, they were\nseparate physical components, but\n\n99\n00:05:24.362 --> 00:05:27.514\nnow the controllers are gonna be\nintegrated and built right into\n\n100\n00:05:27.514 --> 00:05:30.977\nthe enclosure with your drives, and\nthey do require drivers to work.\n\n101\n00:05:30.977 --> 00:05:36.040\nSo there might be some issues there\nas well so, well, what can we do?\n\n102\n00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.148\nLet's go ahead and zoom in and then,\n\n103\n00:05:38.148 --> 00:05:41.216\ntake a look at those drives\nthat we have on the system.\n\n104\n00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:46.070\nSo here, I am utilizing virtualization,\nso as a matter of fact, let me get\n\n105\n00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.016\nout of this Virtual Machine here, and\nwe'll take look at my Local Machine.\n\n106\n00:05:53.327 --> 00:06:02.254\nWe'll just go ahead and Very good.\n\n107\n00:06:07.832 --> 00:06:11.672\nAll right so, I already have my Disk\nDrives pulled out here, I was looking at\n\n108\n00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:15.576\nthem earlier, and this one in particular,\nyou'll even notice right here.\n\n109\n00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:19.237\nSo the first thing you wanna do is expand\nout that little care to check out.\n\n110\n00:06:19.237 --> 00:06:22.155\nWhat's going on in this\nmachine just assess, right?\n\n111\n00:06:22.155 --> 00:06:27.471\nAnd I can see that I have two\nHard Drives here in my computer.\n\n112\n00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:31.167\nAnd now, without just looking at that,\nI can see some information like the size.\n\n113\n00:06:31.167 --> 00:06:34.334\nYou might have already renamed them or\nsomething in your system.\n\n114\n00:06:34.334 --> 00:06:39.453\nBut for this one, notice that\nthere's a little blue down arrow.\n\n115\n00:06:39.453 --> 00:06:44.516\nAnd that's because, I manually,\nhad what I did was,\n\n116\n00:06:44.516 --> 00:06:47.828\nI disabled this particular drive.\n\n117\n00:06:47.828 --> 00:06:52.050\nSo, just, I mean, never really know what\ncould have happened on that machine, and\n\n118\n00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.124\nwhy it was disabled?\n\n119\n00:06:53.124 --> 00:06:55.884\nBut, just things like that you might\njust want to go ahead and check.\n\n120\n00:06:55.884 --> 00:07:01.638\nYou can hit Enable, and sometimes\nthe system doesn't recognize the drive.\n\n121\n00:07:01.638 --> 00:07:04.100\nSo, I were to,\nthis is just a little SD card.\n\n122\n00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.828\nIf I were to take this SD card out,\nyou can see it's removed there.\n\n123\n00:07:07.828 --> 00:07:12.101\nBut what if you were expecting to see\na drive there, and you didn't, right?\n\n124\n00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:17.138\nSo, what you could do is, let's go\nahead and let's see is it under file or\n\n125\n00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:21.877\nactions, it's under action, and\nthen scan for hardware changes.\n\n126\n00:07:21.877 --> 00:07:25.239\nSo, when you're adding and\nremoving drives sometimes,\n\n127\n00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:29.214\njust to kind of refresh this view\nthat we have here in Device Manager,\n\n128\n00:07:29.214 --> 00:07:32.385\nyou might wanna go ahead and\nhit that Scan for changes.\n\n129\n00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:37.940\nI'm gonna put this SD card back in,\nit should recognize it automatically.\n\n130\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.845\nAnd if it doesn't right away, then you\ncould hit that Scan for changes, just to\n\n131\n00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:44.320\nsee if it'll actually show up here.\n&gt;&gt; I tell you,\n\n132\n00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.798\nI've used that in troubleshooting before,\n\n133\n00:07:46.798 --> 00:07:50.068\nwhere I have uninstalled\na device through Device Manager.\n\n134\n00:07:50.068 --> 00:07:52.988\nBut without rebooting the system,\nI uninstalled it and\n\n135\n00:07:52.988 --> 00:07:54.984\nthen said Scan for Hardware Changes.\n\n136\n00:07:54.984 --> 00:07:58.581\nAnd since I uninstalled it, it sees the\npiece of hardware cuz I never took it out\n\n137\n00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:00.283\nand it goes, look, a new device.\n\n138\n00:08:00.283 --> 00:08:01.394\nAnd I was able to reinstall the driver and\n\n139\n00:08:01.394 --> 00:08:04.441\nget everything to work again.\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes that's a really good\n\n140\n00:08:04.441 --> 00:08:09.406\npoint, Mike, because that could be a\nviable option here in our troubleshooting\n\n141\n00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:14.169\nand you could even replicate that here\nby uninstalling a particular device.\n\n142\n00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:17.280\nAnd then going through that process,\nthe scanning for\n\n143\n00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.384\nthe new hardware to bring it back in.\n\n144\n00:08:19.384 --> 00:08:24.014\nYou could also try to go ahead and update\nthat driver, and if you wanted to check in\n\n145\n00:08:24.014 --> 00:08:28.233\nthat version to see if it were,\nwith the manufacturer, if it were the most\n\n146\n00:08:28.233 --> 00:08:32.622\nup-to-date version of that driver,\nthat's also one thing you could do.\n\n147\n00:08:32.622 --> 00:08:37.046\nBut yeah, just know don't\nforget about Device Manager,\n\n148\n00:08:37.046 --> 00:08:39.854\nit's still there available for us.\n\n149\n00:08:39.854 --> 00:08:47.981\nAll right, so\nmaybe I look into my Event Viewer there.\n\n150\n00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:51.019\nAnd I'm getting ahead of myself here,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n151\n00:08:51.019 --> 00:08:52.865\nget back into my virtual machine.\n\n152\n00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:55.311\nI look into Event Viewer and\nI notice a few things.\n\n153\n00:08:55.311 --> 00:08:58.598\nSo maybe I notice that I\nkeep getting errors or\n\n154\n00:08:58.598 --> 00:09:02.847\neven warnings that I was starting\nto get low on disk space.\n\n155\n00:09:02.847 --> 00:09:07.486\nSo that also could be something\nthat causes issues on a disk.\n\n156\n00:09:07.486 --> 00:09:12.439\nEven if the disk is overall healthy, and\nwhen I mean healthy, I mean, maybe if\n\n157\n00:09:12.439 --> 00:09:17.090\nit were a mechanical disk with moving\nparts, all the parts were moving and\n\n158\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:22.444\nfunctioning properly, there weren't any\nbad sectors or corruption on that disk.\n\n159\n00:09:22.444 --> 00:09:27.358\nOnce that disk gets to a certain amount\nof utilization, and data has been,\n\n160\n00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:29.860\nso that disk is getting full, right?\n\n161\n00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.863\nYou'll wanna think about that as well,\nbecause once a disk is so\n\n162\n00:09:34.863 --> 00:09:41.552\nfull, it has a really hard time searching,\nso performing those reads and or writes.\n\n163\n00:09:41.552 --> 00:09:46.172\nSo just normal functions like\nnavigating through the operating system\n\n164\n00:09:46.172 --> 00:09:49.876\ncan be at a snail's pace,\nreally slow, just annoying.\n\n165\n00:09:49.876 --> 00:09:54.642\nAnd even applications might hang\nthat you normally are really going\n\n166\n00:09:54.642 --> 00:09:56.743\nthrough without any issues.\n\n167\n00:09:56.743 --> 00:10:01.207\nSo you wanna go ahead also and\ncheck on size.\n\n168\n00:10:01.207 --> 00:10:04.423\nSo let me just go ahead and\nminimize out of these,\n\n169\n00:10:04.423 --> 00:10:07.023\nI don't think I'll need them for now.\n\n170\n00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:11.877\nBut what you could do is go ahead and\njust even, in File Explorer,\n\n171\n00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:15.231\nfind the drives that you\nhave in your system,\n\n172\n00:10:15.231 --> 00:10:19.234\nright-click on them, and\nthen select Properties.\n\n173\n00:10:19.234 --> 00:10:24.388\nAnd what that'll do is at least give you\nan idea of what you're working with here.\n\n174\n00:10:24.388 --> 00:10:26.254\nSo for this particular drive,\n\n175\n00:10:26.254 --> 00:10:29.856\nit will show you the amount of\nused space versus free space.\n\n176\n00:10:29.856 --> 00:10:33.309\nAnd there's that 80/20\nrule out in the universe,\n\n177\n00:10:33.309 --> 00:10:37.494\nthat's a good one to abide by, but\nagain, once you start getting,\n\n178\n00:10:37.494 --> 00:10:41.331\nI think that's a good number,\nin my opinion, to stick with.\n\n179\n00:10:41.331 --> 00:10:43.725\nOnce you start getting to\nthat level of utilization,\n\n180\n00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:47.086\nyou might wanna look at additional\noptions, maybe adding another drive.\n\n181\n00:10:47.086 --> 00:10:51.376\nCleaning out, purging some of those or\narchiving some files, or\n\n182\n00:10:51.376 --> 00:10:54.028\nwhatever it may be using cloud storage,\n\n183\n00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:57.224\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think what I always forget\n\n184\n00:10:57.224 --> 00:10:58.673\nabout is page file.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n185\n00:10:58.673 --> 00:11:01.670\n&gt;&gt; And as you run low on space, it starts\n\n186\n00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.003\ngetting a little tight and becomes,\n&gt;&gt; Memory issues.\n\n187\n00:11:05.003 --> 00:11:07.288\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't have room to page,\n\n188\n00:11:07.288 --> 00:11:12.007\nyour machine needs to page, in other\nwords, take some data out of memory and\n\n189\n00:11:12.007 --> 00:11:16.906\nwrite it to disk, there's not much space\nleft, and it gets very, very slow.\n\n190\n00:11:16.906 --> 00:11:19.121\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it definitely can do that, and\n\n191\n00:11:19.121 --> 00:11:23.420\nthat's the thing is although it isn't,\nyou might see those lockups.\n\n192\n00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.203\nAnd usually you might be thinking, well,\n\n193\n00:11:25.203 --> 00:11:27.838\nusually application lockups\nare associated with lack of RAM.\n\n194\n00:11:27.838 --> 00:11:31.262\nBut if you think about how that works,\nlike Mike was saying,\n\n195\n00:11:31.262 --> 00:11:35.560\nif our systems are looking for RAM, and\nthen they're trying to use that page\n\n196\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.060\nfile or any kind of portion of that hard\ndrive to mimic RAM that's not there, and\n\n197\n00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.178\nthat's where you see those issues.\n\n198\n00:11:42.178 --> 00:11:44.022\nAll right, so what else do we have?\n\n199\n00:11:44.022 --> 00:11:46.547\nJust here from this Properties window,\n\n200\n00:11:46.547 --> 00:11:50.046\nwe can also see a few other\nthings that we have access to.\n\n201\n00:11:50.046 --> 00:11:52.669\nIf we go on over to our Tools tab here,\n\n202\n00:11:52.669 --> 00:11:57.420\nwe'll select that, this first option,\nit says error checking.\n\n203\n00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.458\nAnd this option that we\nhave available to us, and\n\n204\n00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:07.368\nthe GUI has a comparable action in\nthe command line interface which is,\n\n205\n00:12:07.368 --> 00:12:12.712\nCHKDSK or check disk, and\nthat's what this tool will do for us.\n\n206\n00:12:12.712 --> 00:12:19.074\nSo we can go ahead and select this, note,\nwe will be prompted with our UAC here.\n\n207\n00:12:19.074 --> 00:12:21.476\nOops, I'm already logged\nin as an administrator, so\n\n208\n00:12:21.476 --> 00:12:23.316\njust keeping that in mind if you're not.\n\n209\n00:12:23.316 --> 00:12:28.779\nNow, right away the operating system is\nbecoming more intuitive over the years,\n\n210\n00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:33.068\nlike you would have to go ahead and\nspecify what you wanted to do.\n\n211\n00:12:33.068 --> 00:12:36.125\nBut here, look,\nI didn't even have to hit anything and\n\n212\n00:12:36.125 --> 00:12:40.156\nright away this window is telling me,\nyou don't need to scan this drive,\n\n213\n00:12:40.156 --> 00:12:43.624\nif there were any errors then\nthat would already be prevalent.\n\n214\n00:12:43.624 --> 00:12:48.151\nHowever, I still do have the option\nto if I wanted to, as well.\n\n215\n00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:52.553\nBut we're just gonna go ahead and\njust hit Cancel for now.\n\n216\n00:12:52.553 --> 00:12:57.518\nActually, let me go ahead and\npull up our command prompt here,\n\n217\n00:12:57.518 --> 00:13:00.341\nI don't think I have one pulled up.\n\n218\n00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:00.940\nDo I have a partial?\n\n219\n00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.459\nNope, all right.\n\n220\n00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:10.688\nJust go ahead and change this real quick.\n&gt;&gt; That's good, I wasn't able to see that,\n\n221\n00:13:10.688 --> 00:13:15.328\nmy old eyes can't see that, little fonts.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Mine either,\n\n222\n00:13:15.328 --> 00:13:19.704\nMike, not at all, so all right.\n\n223\n00:13:19.704 --> 00:13:20.843\nNow, CHKDSK,\n\n224\n00:13:20.843 --> 00:13:26.631\nlet's take a look at the actual switches\nthat we have associated with CHKDSK.\n\n225\n00:13:29.994 --> 00:13:33.040\nOops, did I not run that as administrator?\n\n226\n00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.718\nWell, prime example here,\nsorry about that, I thought I did.\n\n227\n00:13:36.718 --> 00:13:41.781\nLet me go ahead and, I guess I didn't run\nas administrator, just like we saw in\n\n228\n00:13:41.781 --> 00:13:47.181\nthe graphical user interface, we still\nneed to have that elevation there as well.\n\n229\n00:13:47.181 --> 00:13:52.277\nAll right, so here we go,\nchkdsk, and then we'll say here,\n\n230\n00:13:52.277 --> 00:13:55.707\nwe'll do /?, so that we can see those.\n\n231\n00:13:55.707 --> 00:13:57.785\nMy goodness.\n\n232\n00:14:03.113 --> 00:14:06.404\nAll right, and there we go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n233\n00:14:06.404 --> 00:14:10.675\n&gt;&gt; Now, just running CHKDSK alone is gonna\n\n234\n00:14:10.675 --> 00:14:14.073\nexactly what that sounds like.\n\n235\n00:14:14.073 --> 00:14:16.702\nIt'll check your disk,\nit will perform that analysis.\n\n236\n00:14:16.702 --> 00:14:20.346\nHowever, there won't be any\nactions that are taken.\n\n237\n00:14:20.346 --> 00:14:24.348\nSo it's very important to note\na few of these switches here.\n\n238\n00:14:24.348 --> 00:14:28.583\nSo number one, it's going to be\nthe forward slash f switch, and\n\n239\n00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:32.361\nthat's going to go ahead and\nfix the errors on that disk.\n\n240\n00:14:32.361 --> 00:14:37.447\nSo after that analysis is performed, it's\na great little bundle to have, otherwise\n\n241\n00:14:37.447 --> 00:14:41.844\nyou're just performing an analysis\nwithout any kind of action, right?\n\n242\n00:14:41.844 --> 00:14:46.386\nAnd another really good one that I\nlike here is going to be the /R,\n\n243\n00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:51.275\nwhich can also locate bad sectors and\nrecover readable information.\n\n244\n00:14:51.275 --> 00:14:54.245\nYou can also bundle these switches, so\n\n245\n00:14:54.245 --> 00:14:59.645\nyou could just type check disk space\nforward slash f, forward slash R,\n\n246\n00:14:59.645 --> 00:15:03.965\nhere, to go ahead and\nhave both of those actions, well,\n\n247\n00:15:03.965 --> 00:15:09.924\ntechnically three of those actions being\nperformed there in that one script.\n\n248\n00:15:09.924 --> 00:15:15.188\nSo, definitely you have\nCHKDSK at your disposal.\n\n249\n00:15:15.188 --> 00:15:17.449\nJust take a look at\nthe different switches there.\n\n250\n00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:20.868\nSo that's pretty cool,\nI'm trying to think, okay.\n\n251\n00:15:20.868 --> 00:15:24.994\nNow, this is what I had pulled up on\nmy local machine there, optimize and\n\n252\n00:15:24.994 --> 00:15:28.458\ndefragment the drive,\nlet's talk about that for a second.\n\n253\n00:15:28.458 --> 00:15:35.513\nSo we're still in that same Properties\nwindow for this specific disk.\n\n254\n00:15:35.513 --> 00:15:40.335\nSo if I go ahead and select Optimize,\nit'll display some information for\n\n255\n00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:43.617\nme, and I have a volume located here,\nmy C drive.\n\n256\n00:15:43.617 --> 00:15:46.738\nAnd again,\nI have the option to go ahead and\n\n257\n00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:51.793\nperform an analysis without actually\nexecuting any kind of action.\n\n258\n00:15:51.793 --> 00:15:55.423\nOptimize will go ahead and\ntake that action and\n\n259\n00:15:55.423 --> 00:15:58.440\nthat Powershell cmdlet that we had.\n\n260\n00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.760\nYou saw there in the background,\nwe've seen it in other shows.\n\n261\n00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.110\nIt's optimize-volume.\n\n262\n00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:10.350\nSo older methods of\ntroubleshooting storage.\n\n263\n00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.890\nWe're gonna kinda save towards the end and\nlooking in disk management and\n\n264\n00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.920\nreally focusing on how some of\nthose even dynamic disks behave.\n\n265\n00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.605\nBut moving moving forward,\nI can assume that Microsoft will really\n\n266\n00:16:22.605 --> 00:16:27.175\ndevelop the different,\nthey have a storage module currently and\n\n267\n00:16:27.175 --> 00:16:31.495\nthat's part of, the optimize-volume\ncmdlet is part of that storage module.\n\n268\n00:16:31.495 --> 00:16:34.065\nBut I can only imagine that it's\ngoing to be developed more and\n\n269\n00:16:34.065 --> 00:16:38.130\nthat will really be the way of\ntroubleshooting in the future.\n\n270\n00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.000\nBut for now, what we're learning and\nour techniques and tools here,\n\n271\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.810\nthey're not in vain.\n\n272\n00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:46.400\nAnd even some of the older dynamic\ndisk troubleshooting, that\n\n273\n00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.990\nthe concepts carry over into\nwhat we see with storage space,\n\n274\n00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.470\nis it's just a different\nway of executing that.\n\n275\n00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.890\nAll right, now with Windows 8.1,\nWindows 10,\n\n276\n00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.300\ndefragmentation actually\nhappens in the background.\n\n277\n00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.340\nYou don't need, usually you\nshould not need to go ahead and\n\n278\n00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.860\nmanually initiate a defragmentation.\n\n279\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:11.505\nIn the past,\n\n280\n00:17:11.505 --> 00:17:15.400\nthat was something that was recommended\nas just normal maintenance, right.\n\n281\n00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.668\nWe could even utilize something like Task\nScheduler to go ahead and set that up for\n\n282\n00:17:19.668 --> 00:17:21.800\nus, maybe like once a month or however,\n\n283\n00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.598\ndepending on the level of\nfragmentation that disk would see.\n\n284\n00:17:25.598 --> 00:17:28.850\nBut now, even you can see\nhere on this current status,\n\n285\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.700\nlet me zoom in little bit so\nyou can see that.\n\n286\n00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.980\nI am at 0% fragmentation.\n\n287\n00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.820\nNow granted this is a virtual\nmachine that I really haven't done\n\n288\n00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.540\na whole lot of different\nfiles being written to it.\n\n289\n00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:47.160\nBut I mean 0% that is pretty\nimpressive there for our machine.\n\n290\n00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.300\nAnd that is because it's\nhappening in the background.\n\n291\n00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:49.960\nSo it's pretty cool.\n\n292\n00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.940\nThat is defragmentation.\n\n293\n00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:58.241\nYou know what let me just go ahead and\nI will minimize this and\n\n294\n00:17:58.241 --> 00:18:03.515\nwe will take a look at,\nwhere did I have that Powershell.\n\n295\n00:18:03.515 --> 00:18:07.093\nRight here it is, alright so\nthis was that first,\n\n296\n00:18:07.093 --> 00:18:11.796\nactually I will just clear my screen and\ngo ahead and run it again.\n\n297\n00:18:11.796 --> 00:18:15.993\nThis was that first cmdlet that\nwe had spoke about before,\n\n298\n00:18:15.993 --> 00:18:18.340\nit's just optimize -volume.\n\n299\n00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.910\nAnd then you specify the drive letter.\n\n300\n00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.660\nSo if you even were working\nwith storage spaces and\n\n301\n00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.400\nyou had volumes spanning\nmultiple physical disks.\n\n302\n00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.380\nThen that would be fine here because\nyou're really calling out those specific\n\n303\n00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.660\nvolumes to be analyzed there.\n\n304\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.685\nAnd it's really cool because let me see if\nI can just pull up a webpage here, okay.\n\n305\n00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:45.780\nGo to the optimize volume,\nthis is what I was saying with\n\n306\n00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:51.310\nthe admin of storage spaces and\nmoving that way towards Powershell.\n\n307\n00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:56.770\nBecause this particular command line\nright here optimize volume is intuitive.\n\n308\n00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.980\nWell what does that mean Cherokee?\n\n309\n00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.408\nYou know?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n310\n00:19:00.408 --> 00:19:01.330\n&gt;&gt; It's true.\n\n311\n00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:05.800\nThe operating system\nwill look at that volume,\n\n312\n00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:12.110\nlook at the configuration, and then tailor\nthat cmdlet to that volume's needs.\n\n313\n00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.890\nSo if you're just dealing\nwith a basic volume,\n\n314\n00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:18.550\nthen things like defragmentation\nwould be the limitation there.\n\n315\n00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:22.710\nBut if you were looking at more advanced\noptions, storage tiers, and so forth.\n\n316\n00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:28.060\nThen you would have trim options if\nyou are utilizing SSD drives and\n\n317\n00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.800\njust different things like that.\n\n318\n00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.340\nYou don't even have to.\n\n319\n00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.360\nThe operating system chooses for you.\n\n320\n00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.633\nSo it's really cool.\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty cool.\n\n321\n00:19:34.633 --> 00:19:37.815\nSo it's gonna recognize what\ntype of drive I have and\n\n322\n00:19:37.815 --> 00:19:40.510\nwhat best to do for that type of drive.\n\n323\n00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:43.610\nAnd perform those actions.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we'll be out of a job,\n\n324\n00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.429\nMike.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n325\n00:19:46.429 --> 00:19:49.470\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; Actually, and if you wanted to,\n\n326\n00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:54.130\nremember there were a couple of,\nlet's see defrag.\n\n327\n00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.660\nIf you wanted additional\ninformation on that,\n\n328\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.970\nd, that's because I'm not\nspelling it correctly.\n\n329\n00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:04.080\nIt's D-E-F-R-A-G all right?\n\n330\n00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.000\nDefrag and\nthen add a verbose command here.\n\n331\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.950\nRemember that's just gonna go ahead and\ngive you a more granular output of\n\n332\n00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:16.080\nthat information to show you exactly\nwhat that fragmentation would occur.\n\n333\n00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.620\nSo that's kind of the way\nof how things are going.\n\n334\n00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.315\nBut like I said we still have\nthe other options available.\n\n335\n00:20:21.315 --> 00:20:22.847\nTo us.\n\n336\n00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.374\nOkay.\n\n337\n00:20:24.374 --> 00:20:29.070\nWhat about potential?\n\n338\n00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:34.930\nWhat if you suspect that your system\nis missing some kind of system files,\n\n339\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.890\nor corrupt system files?\n\n340\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:42.540\nSo something that you could think about\nin that type of situation would be.\n\n341\n00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.980\nMaybe I'm trying some of these other\nthings and they are not working.\n\n342\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.360\nOr maybe I look in my event, you will\nnotice that it's the same files or\n\n343\n00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.290\nmaybe a Windows feature isn't there or\navailable to me.\n\n344\n00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:52.235\nThat was before.\n\n345\n00:20:52.235 --> 00:20:54.170\nAnd you're like, what is going on here?\n\n346\n00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.120\nWell.\n\n347\n00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.880\nthere are a few things that we can do\nto go ahead and check that as well.\n\n348\n00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.950\nLet me see if I'm missing\nanything in this tab.\n\n349\n00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:06.860\nI think, I think we're good for\nthere under our properties for now.\n\n350\n00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.980\nI showed you all that that I wanted to,\nI believe.\n\n351\n00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.930\nLet's go ahead and pull up our\ncommand prompt and clear this out.\n\n352\n00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:21.138\nSo what we can do is run something\ncalled SFC for system file checker.\n\n353\n00:21:21.138 --> 00:21:23.990\nAnd system file checker is going to be\n\n354\n00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.980\na tool at our disposal that\nwill allow us to go ahead and\n\n355\n00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.020\ncheck those system files, right, to see\nif someone accidentally deleted them.\n\n356\n00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.570\nOr to see if they were corrupt or\nwhatever.\n\n357\n00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.990\nNow in the past if you were to run system\nfile checker like with older versions of\n\n358\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:44.370\nWindows XP, you would have to have\nthe installation media Windows 10,\n\n359\n00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.830\neven starting in Windows XP,\nyou didn't need that.\n\n360\n00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.720\nSo what we're gonna do\nhere is just type in sfc.\n\n361\n00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:56.870\nWe will go ahead and use the /scannow\nparameter to go ahead and initiate that,\n\n362\n00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.720\nand I'm typing this in here, but\nI'm really not gonna go ahead and\n\n363\n00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:05.050\ninitiate that because It will take between\n10 to 20 minutes to check all those files.\n\n364\n00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.130\nThere are a lot of system\nfiles still in the system.\n\n365\n00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:12.710\nBut just know that that is an option\nthat you do have available to go ahead.\n\n366\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:17.210\nAnd again note that this isn't, remember,\nthis is an administrative type function,\n\n367\n00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.810\nso we will need to have that\nelevated command prompt there.\n\n368\n00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.280\nAll right,\nwhat is do we have available to us.\n\n369\n00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.850\nWhat if we run system file checker\nthat doesn't fix the problem and\n\n370\n00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:34.850\nwe still suspect that it's corrupt\nWindow files or system file, right?\n\n371\n00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:41.700\nSo one thing we could do and this would\nkind of be like a last ditch effort.\n\n372\n00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.800\nSo if we had already gone through\nthe normal means of troubleshootings\n\n373\n00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.190\nboth software and\nhardware which we'll look at hardware.\n\n374\n00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:52.970\nTalk about that in a second, but something\nthat you could do as like a kind of\n\n375\n00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:57.080\na last resort which actually we\ndid this yesterday with Wes.\n\n376\n00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:57.620\n&gt;&gt; Right that's right.\n\n377\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.650\n&gt;&gt; With a computer that we had\n\n378\n00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.200\nthat got brought in and\n&gt;&gt; It's not\n\n379\n00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.210\nas invasive as it has been in the past.\n\n380\n00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:11.466\nSo what you can do is hold down your\nshift key and go ahead and pull up your.\n\n381\n00:23:11.466 --> 00:23:13.280\nI meant to right click on there.\n\n382\n00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.500\nBut what you can do is just\nhold down the shift key and\n\n383\n00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.730\nthen select restart which will bring you.\n\n384\n00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.150\nYou can let go of the shift key\nas soon as you hit restart.\n\n385\n00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.930\nBut that will bring you into that.\n\n386\n00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:27.070\nWhen PE type environment where you can\nperform some troubleshooting functions and\n\n387\n00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.650\nthat's exactly what we're gonna do here.\n\n388\n00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:33.924\nSo if you go ahead and\nselect this troubleshoot option,\n\n389\n00:23:33.924 --> 00:23:36.220\nit will bring you into a screen and\n\n390\n00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.575\nyou know we have the availability\nto go ahead and reset this PC.\n\n391\n00:23:40.575 --> 00:23:46.562\nNow I would always recommend\nperforming any kind of back-up of very.\n\n392\n00:23:46.562 --> 00:23:48.762\nAny information that you\ncan't live without, right?\n\n393\n00:23:48.762 --> 00:23:50.112\nBefore you do this but\n\n394\n00:23:50.112 --> 00:23:53.870\nI mean the way it is now you can\nsee here it says reset this PC.\n\n395\n00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.970\nLet's you choose to keep or\nremove your personal files and\n\n396\n00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.470\nthen reinstalls Windows.\n\n397\n00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:02.450\nSo if you suspect that you do have\na problem with those system files.\n\n398\n00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:07.460\nThen resetting is gonna go ahead and\ntake care of those problems there Mike.\n\n399\n00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.390\nLet me see, yeah.\n\n400\n00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:13.980\nAnd if you wanted to go ahead and\nsystem restore, I don't know,\n\n401\n00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.820\nI think resetting would be\nthe best option for that.\n\n402\n00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.790\nRemember system restore\nis gonna be good for\n\n403\n00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:22.530\nany kind of configuration changes\nthat it may have happene.\n\n404\n00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.540\nYou have the ability to\nget into command prompt.\n\n405\n00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.900\nThen I look at you know,\n\n406\n00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.940\nmaybe I wanna just not allow certain\napplication to start during startup.\n\n407\n00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.430\nWhen you're going through\nthis troubleshooting, and\n\n408\n00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:34.710\ninvestigative process.\n\n409\n00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:39.240\nYou wanna be eliminating other reasons,\nother things it could be.\n\n410\n00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:45.500\nMaybe it's a haywire application, maybe\nit's some form of not necessarily malware.\n\n411\n00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:50.990\nBut bloatware that's in your system\nstarting up at startup Who knows?\n\n412\n00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:56.050\nBut just checking a few things,\nI think would be a good option for you.\n\n413\n00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:59.520\nAnd let's, I'm looking at the clock here,\nbut let's talk about hardware for\n\n414\n00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.480\na second, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n415\n00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.230\n&gt;&gt; I think we have time to do that.\n\n416\n00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:07.080\nDon't ever underestimate hardware issues.\n\n417\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.810\nBecause you know especially\nwith the drives,\n\n418\n00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.870\nwe're talking about all those\nmechanical moving parts.\n\n419\n00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.400\nAnd it's hardware, right?\n\n420\n00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.400\nIt's going to fail.\n\n421\n00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:20.700\nAs a matter of fact, if you can\nreally be proactive in department,\n\n422\n00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.190\nthen that's awesome.\n\n423\n00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:26.560\nAnd what I mean by being proactive is,\nit will take some work on your part.\n\n424\n00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.030\nSo if you're a sys admin and\n\n425\n00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:34.170\nyou're getting to know your environment,\nand maybe you're not getting to know.\n\n426\n00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:35.880\nBut you already have good documentation.\n\n427\n00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:42.560\nWhat you can do is get the historical\ndata and analyze the lifespan of.\n\n428\n00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.390\nLook at receipts from other techs\nbefore you or something and say, okay.\n\n429\n00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.310\nSo I see that you guys\npurchased drives at this date.\n\n430\n00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:51.890\nKind of talk to someone say why, and\n\n431\n00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:56.840\nthen overtime you can perform\nforecast type work to say.\n\n432\n00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.550\nI think these drives looks like for this\nsystem the amount of utilization at this\n\n433\n00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.780\nmachine is putting on to these drives.\n\n434\n00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.280\nThey're gonna last X amount of time.\n\n435\n00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.520\nSo then you can preemptively\nchange out the drives.\n\n436\n00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.000\nSo you're not dealing with any\nkind of emergent type work and\n\n437\n00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.870\nyou have a maintenance window.\n\n438\n00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:16.760\nIt's scheduled, you've performed backups.\n\n439\n00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.670\nyou're not interrupting people.\n\n440\n00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.350\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n441\n00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.812\nAnd don't forget about things like cables.\n\n442\n00:26:23.812 --> 00:26:28.730\nWhile usually cables aren't an issue,\nthey can be.\n\n443\n00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.230\nAnd sometimes, even on desktops,\nyou're thinking, well,\n\n444\n00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.410\nthey're not getting moved around.\n\n445\n00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:37.620\nYeah, a lot of times, desktops do get\naround in different cubicles and so forth.\n\n446\n00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.200\nServers not as much, but I wouldn't\ntotally discount that possibility.\n\n447\n00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.650\nI mean, if someone's pulling\nsome Ethernet cables, and\n\n448\n00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:48.160\nthen jostle your actual drive cables,\nthat could happen as well.\n\n449\n00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.160\nSo always check for cables.\n\n450\n00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.700\nAnd even the process of elimination or\n\n451\n00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.810\nthe process of swapping out good hardware,\nknown good, right?\n\n452\n00:26:56.810 --> 00:27:00.630\nSo okay, well let me Take this drive and\nput it on Mike's PC and\n\n453\n00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.000\nsee how it behaves there.\n\n454\n00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.650\nOr maybe let me just take this cable and\nswap it out.\n\n455\n00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:07.550\nThings like that are gonna\nbe important here, and\n\n456\n00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.740\nespecially if you're dealing\nwith external drives, right?\n\n457\n00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:16.800\nSometimes we do deal with external drives,\nsome of them require AC power.\n\n458\n00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:22.430\nSo you might wanna go ahead and power\ndown that drive, reboot your machine.\n\n459\n00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.770\nPower back on that drive, okay?\n\n460\n00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.400\nAnd see if the system will recognize it.\n\n461\n00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:32.090\nRemove any kind of other external drives\nthat are plugged into that machine.\n\n462\n00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.740\nBecause that can definitely\ncause issues sometimes, right?\n\n463\n00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.060\nSo you're just like process\nof elimination here.\n\n464\n00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.890\nYou wanna get rid of Hubs,\nis you have a USB drive and\n\n465\n00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.660\nit's plugged into a hub,\nget rid of that hub.\n\n466\n00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.890\nPlug it directly into the USB port.\n\n467\n00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.970\nAnd it could even be that USB port,\nso you might wanna go ahead and\n\n468\n00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:51.280\ntry another USB port, something like that.\n\n469\n00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.670\nThese are all possibilities, and\n\n470\n00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:54.880\nthis is why I said we're\nprobably gonna need a part two.\n\n471\n00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.450\nBecause we still have more to cover, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good.\n\n472\n00:27:58.450 --> 00:27:59.190\nWell, a great list so\n\n473\n00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:02.640\nfar of things to look at As we\nare troubleshooting our storage.\n\n474\n00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.890\nSo we appreciate that, hope everybody\nout there enjoyed watching this one.\n\n475\n00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.610\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been you host, Mike

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.184 --> 00:00:08.345\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:12.390\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.299\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.820\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.690\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguting Windows 10.\n\n9\n00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.126\nGetting ready for that 70-698 exam,\nand specifically in this episode,\n\n10\n00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:27.314\nwe're gonna be creating and\nconfiguring good old VHDs.\n\n11\n00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:29.435\nHere to help us with that is none\nother than Mr. Cherokee Boose.\n\n12\n00:00:29.435 --> 00:00:31.100\nPlease welcome Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.249\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n14\n00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:34.190\nSo what do we got with VHDs?\n\n15\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.648\nSeems like we've gone over some of this.\n\n16\n00:00:36.648 --> 00:00:39.330\n&gt;&gt; We've been talking about storage for\na while now Mike.\n\n17\n00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.710\nSo, in my opinion I feel like\nthis is going to be a recap, so\n\n18\n00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.140\nit shouldn't be too difficult for us,\nlike no major surprises here, but\n\n19\n00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.010\nit is pretty intragale to\nthe actual exam portion.\n\n20\n00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.950\nYou really need to get familiar with\ndifferent ways that you can work with\n\n21\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.686\nstorage, and so that's, virtualization is\nso such a big part of our lives nowadays.\n\n22\n00:00:57.686 --> 00:01:00.989\nIt hasn't always been that way,\nbut it's super popular and\n\n23\n00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.650\nit's best just to understand and know it.\n\n24\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, everything is really moving\ntowards virtualization, even down to\n\n25\n00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.530\nthe now we've seen that in the service\nside of things, it is moving towards\n\n26\n00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.985\nthe client ends with virtual desktop\ninfrastructures and things like that.\n\n27\n00:01:11.985 --> 00:01:15.162\nThat's more and more, and\nWindows is a service.\n\n28\n00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:17.812\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so if you've already\nseen some of this information,\n\n29\n00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:20.214\nI don't want you to you know\nworry about this too much, but\n\n30\n00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:23.525\nI would like to provide it for you again,\nso it's all in one nice little bundle.\n\n31\n00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:27.635\nSo, if you're studying and you're really\njust trying to focus on your VHD's and\n\n32\n00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:32.980\nVHDX, your Virtual Hard Disk files, then\nthat's what we'll take a look at here.\n\n33\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.970\nJust to cover some fundamentals,\nremember that two\n\n34\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.180\nmain versions of those file extensions,\nif we can take a look at my screen.\n\n35\n00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.880\nYou guys have seen this before if you've\nwatched previous episodes of the series.\n\n36\n00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.462\nI just want to remind you of\nsome of these things, right,\n\n37\n00:01:49.462 --> 00:01:54.239\nso our VHD was going to be our\nolder version that we had.\n\n38\n00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:58.619\nWhat was it, my PC coming off of those\ndays when Microsoft acquired that\n\n39\n00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.219\norganization and kind of you know built\noff of that technology, and you can\n\n40\n00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.964\nsee that a lot of the features or options\nthat we have here for those VHD files,\n\n41\n00:02:07.964 --> 00:02:12.540\nwe don't necessarily have,\nwe have more flexibility with the VHD app.\n\n42\n00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.770\nSo, usually you're gonna\nwanna use the HDX, but\n\n43\n00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.210\nnot only always, you might need\nsome backwards compatibility for\n\n44\n00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.760\nspecific situations, and also you know\nmaybe even you're working in Azure,\n\n45\n00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.670\nyou're gonna need a HD files, so\nit is an option for you there.\n\n46\n00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.523\nBut just knowing the difference between,\nand we spoke about this when\n\n47\n00:02:32.523 --> 00:02:37.128\nwe were looking at our Hyper-V shows,\nthe differences between,\n\n48\n00:02:37.128 --> 00:02:42.987\nhey if a virtual machine is on, how can we\nmodify that individual virtual hard disk?\n\n49\n00:02:42.987 --> 00:02:46.708\nWell, there are differences between\nthat machine being on or off, and\n\n50\n00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.890\nwhat are some things that we can do there?\n\n51\n00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.200\nSo I just wanted to remind you of that.\n\n52\n00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.533\nI know we spent time on it, but\nthis information is good to know there.\n\n53\n00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:56.980\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great little chart.\n\n54\n00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.248\nIt makes it really easy to study for\n\n55\n00:02:58.248 --> 00:02:59.844\nthat exam, cuz-\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n56\n00:02:59.844 --> 00:03:02.965\n&gt;&gt; These are easy questions to\nwant to ask you on the exam.\n\n57\n00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:06.378\nYou wanna be able to do this, can you do\nthis with a VHDX, and you just yes or no.\n\n58\n00:03:06.378 --> 00:03:08.727\nSo thank you for that, appreciate that.\n\n59\n00:03:08.727 --> 00:03:10.195\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no doubt, no doubt.\n\n60\n00:03:10.195 --> 00:03:14.235\nSo the next thing I wanna do, if we\ntake a look at this portion right here,\n\n61\n00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:17.567\nyou do see that I have fixed,\ndynamic, and differencing.\n\n62\n00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:21.124\nIf you aren't familiar with those, that's\ngreat because we're gonna cover them.\n\n63\n00:03:21.124 --> 00:03:21.634\nIf you are,\n\n64\n00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:25.025\nwell it's even better because you're\ngonna get that extra studying in here.\n\n65\n00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:26.424\nSo we're gonna cover it again.\n\n66\n00:03:26.424 --> 00:03:31.920\nLet me just pull up and minimize this,\nand you guys are in for a treat here.\n\n67\n00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.360\nI'm going to color so [LAUGH] yeah,\nso that's gonna be interesting.\n\n68\n00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.530\nLet's see, let's go with black here, and\n\n69\n00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.936\nI just wanna kind of, hold on, that's not\nrectangular enough for me here [LAUGH].\n\n70\n00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:51.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Gosh I think that's actually even more\n\n71\n00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.450\nsquare, it's okay.\n\n72\n00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.380\nAll right, sorry.\n\n73\n00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.730\nI'm going to just apologize ahead of time.\n\n74\n00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.206\nOkay, so\nthese are my hard disk drives [LAUGH], and\n\n75\n00:04:05.206 --> 00:04:10.324\nover here let's say this is my fixed\ndrive, and here I have dynamic.\n\n76\n00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:20.540\nOkay, so I don't know,\nmaybe these drives are a particular size.\n\n77\n00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.190\nLet's just say 80 gigs, and\n\n78\n00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.260\nthis is not drawn to scale obviously,\nnot drawn by any kind of standards here.\n\n79\n00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.440\nBut if we think about, let's say both\nof these drives are 80 gigs here,\n\n80\n00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.250\nand maybe I want to,\nthese are my physical drives,\n\n81\n00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.020\nright, so maybe I want to attach these\nphysical drives into a machine and\n\n82\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.280\nthen use the storage space and\nallocate it amongst virtual machines.\n\n83\n00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.446\nSo something I can do here\nwith my fixed drives,\n\n84\n00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:55.299\nif I wanna go ahead and\ncreate a fixed drive,\n\n85\n00:04:55.299 --> 00:05:00.613\nI can allocate a segment or\nportion of this physical drive and\n\n86\n00:05:00.613 --> 00:05:06.678\nthat space on this physical drive\nis reserved for that virtual file.\n\n87\n00:05:06.678 --> 00:05:11.243\nSo that's what we're doing, is we're\nreally writing a file to a volume on\n\n88\n00:05:11.243 --> 00:05:14.080\na physical drive here with our VHDs and\nVHDXs.\n\n89\n00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.093\nNo other systems or\napplications can utilize this space.\n\n90\n00:05:22.093 --> 00:05:27.149\nIt's contiguous, it's reserved,\nI have an exclusive access to that little\n\n91\n00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:32.663\nslice of the pie here, and maybe my drive\nthat I'm creating there, we'll say this or\n\n92\n00:05:32.663 --> 00:05:37.568\nwe'll keep it green, that's gonna be\nmy 20 gig, maybe this is my VHDX.\n\n93\n00:05:37.568 --> 00:05:44.950\n&gt;&gt; The advantages then\nof using the fixed VHDX?\n\n94\n00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.190\n&gt;&gt; So fixed disk,\nyou're gonna see performance increase,\n\n95\n00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.210\nbut it may take a little bit of time to\ngo ahead and create that, because if we\n\n96\n00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.899\nlook at dynamic, I think you'll understand\nthe difference there why it could\n\n97\n00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000\ntake more time to create and format all\nof that space at once and allocate it,\n\n98\n00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.440\ncuz we're tackling it head on, we're\nhandling business, we're saying, okay,\n\n99\n00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.320\nI'm gonna format all of this slash\nof the pie, it's gonna be mine.\n\n100\n00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.085\nSo with dynamic you gonna go about\nthat a little bit different here, so\n\n101\n00:06:15.085 --> 00:06:20.170\nmaybe I wanna create a 20\ngig VHDX over here for\n\n102\n00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:25.270\nmy dynamic disk, but instead of filling\nall that in what's gonna happen\n\n103\n00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.810\nis maybe I only have a little bit of\nfiles here, maybe like five gigs worth.\n\n104\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.498\nSo, I'm not formatting\nthat entire space here for\n\n105\n00:06:35.498 --> 00:06:40.513\nmy dynamic disks,\nonly the amount that I'm using, so\n\n106\n00:06:40.513 --> 00:06:46.965\nmy VHDX file is still represented\nas 20 gigs in my operating system.\n\n107\n00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:52.309\nSo from the end user's perspective, or\nif you're navigating through the GUI or\n\n108\n00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:56.551\nCLI, you're gonna see that disk\nas being 80 gigs in size but,\n\n109\n00:06:56.551 --> 00:06:59.240\nreally it's not being fully utilized.\n\n110\n00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.880\nSo, you can have that space, which again,\nwe've talked about this before,\n\n111\n00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.290\nyou know Mike, this like the great debate,\nif you wanna go ahead and\n\n112\n00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.170\nutilize this fixed disks or\ndynamic disks, and\n\n113\n00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.130\nit really just depend on your situation,\nbecause you might not be able to\n\n114\n00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:21.450\nafford all the actual physical storage,\nwhenever your setting up a system.\n\n115\n00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:26.241\nSo, its a great way to, I guess kinda\nfake it till you make it, cuz your like\n\n116\n00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:31.133\npreplanning, or your planning ahead\nof potential storage been utilized.\n\n117\n00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:34.630\nI kind of like fix just because\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n118\n00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.167\nI mean, there's no guess work and\nyou know exactly how much\n\n119\n00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:43.994\nstorage you have used or\nwhat's available kind of deal there.\n\n120\n00:07:43.994 --> 00:07:47.687\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, the dynamics\ndefinitely have their place, right,\n\n121\n00:07:47.687 --> 00:07:51.855\nespecially the little test environments\nseems to spin things up quickly because it\n\n122\n00:07:51.855 --> 00:07:53.403\ndoesn't take long to create,\n\n123\n00:07:53.403 --> 00:07:57.055\nbecause it starts out as a 4 MB file\nuntil you start putting data into it.\n\n124\n00:07:57.055 --> 00:07:58.385\nDownside's performance, right?\n\n125\n00:07:58.385 --> 00:08:03.380\nEvery time it has to stop and grow, then\nallocate more space, we're going to see\n\n126\n00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.810\na performance hit, as well as\nthe potential to becoming fragmented.\n\n127\n00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.330\nBecause as that dynamic disk starts\nto grow, and it says, all right,\n\n128\n00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:16.860\nwe need to grab some more space off your\nphysical disk to add to this dynamic VHDX.\n\n129\n00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.170\nThat space it's grabbing\nmight not be contiguous.\n\n130\n00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:24.690\nSo now your VHDX file itself is\nfragmented across your physical disk.\n\n131\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.410\nThe fixed, allocating all that\nspace at one time, it's nice and\n\n132\n00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.150\ncontiguous, as you were saying.\n\n133\n00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.840\n&gt;&gt; It's braiding in a nice little row.\n\n134\n00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's not all over the place,\n\n135\n00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.590\nyou don't have to run a defragmenter or\nany kind of check disk.\n\n136\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.350\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to worry about it\ngetting fragmented, the performance is\n\n137\n00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:44.240\nthere when you need it, but,\nas you said, that can limit you in how\n\n138\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.080\nmany you can create, because you need the\navailable space in order to create them.\n\n139\n00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.870\n&gt;&gt; Well, that drawing,\nI just looked at it, and like,\n\n140\n00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.780\nit really looks like\na kindergartender drew it.\n\n141\n00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that's okay, we're gonna,\n\n142\n00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.940\nlet's just clear it all off right now,\nand get rid of that, and\n\n143\n00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.400\nactually just get out of that for now.\n\n144\n00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.540\nI did have one, I'm not going to\nattempt drawing this of a disk here,\n\n145\n00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.570\nMike, because it's\na little more complicated.\n\n146\n00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.692\nSo [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're donig a great job with that one.\n\n147\n00:09:09.692 --> 00:09:10.526\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks.\n\n148\n00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:14.440\n[LAUGH] It's amazing what tools can do for\nyou.\n\n149\n00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.980\nAlright, there's this something\ncalled differencing disk, and so,\n\n150\n00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.320\nif you're not familiar with these,\nthis is you're first time,\n\n151\n00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.255\nit might seem like a strange concepts\nbecause well, it kind of this.\n\n152\n00:09:25.255 --> 00:09:29.882\n[LAUGH] It's kind of like\nI have a disk and again,\n\n153\n00:09:29.882 --> 00:09:34.590\nlooking at, I think in my opinion,\nthe biggest\n\n154\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:40.332\nbenefits utilizing differencing\ndisk is storage capacity and\n\n155\n00:09:40.332 --> 00:09:44.450\nthat savings that you'll see with\ndifferencing disk utilization.\n\n156\n00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.890\nSo if I were to have, and\nthese are discs by the way.\n\n157\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:54.590\nLet's just say this was a disc and\nit was housing an operating system.\n\n158\n00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.480\nMaybe Windows 10.\n\n159\n00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.300\nSince we're in a Window's 10 show.\n\n160\n00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.250\nSo, we know that with the 64-bit\nversion of Windows 10,\n\n161\n00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:07.130\nwe need to have at least 20 gigs of\nstorage here for that space available.\n\n162\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:12.440\nSo, let's just say, at minimum,\nwe install Windows 10 on this disk,\n\n163\n00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.150\nthis disk down here and\nthis disk over here.\n\n164\n00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.370\nSo quick math here Mike.\n\n165\n00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.950\nWe're looking at 60 gigs right off the bat\nwithout any kind of additional software\n\n166\n00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.320\napplications, what have you.\n\n167\n00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.040\nSo what if we could kind of\npiggyback off of one disk and\n\n168\n00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:36.630\nsay look I know that I want to use Windows\n10 on this other machines, so I can take\n\n169\n00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:43.540\neverything from this parent and then,\nkind of just borrow it for a little bit.\n\n170\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.810\nMove it on down to these,\nwell here's the thing and\n\n171\n00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.490\nthat's what I wanted to show you\nby having this portion grayed out.\n\n172\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.560\nBecause really, the only information\n\n173\n00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:58.770\nbinary that is being written to\nchild disk, you have this parent,\n\n174\n00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:03.520\nchild relationship we see here,\nis going to be any changes or deltas.\n\n175\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:10.160\nSo, the base I guess template or\nthe base data, the binary\n\n176\n00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.950\nthat is the same for both of these\nchildren is stored up here on the parents.\n\n177\n00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:23.950\nAny kind of deltas or changes are gonna\nbe stored on any dependent disks here.\n\n178\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.250\nSo these are our child disks.\n\n179\n00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.310\nNow, we're not limited\nto having fixed disks or\n\n180\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.854\ndifferencing disks for that parent.\n\n181\n00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:41.160\nExcuse me, fixed, dynamic, or\neven differencing, and what that means is,\n\n182\n00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.960\nI could have an additional tier underneath\nthese children if that makes sense.\n\n183\n00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.200\nIt's not the best idea,\n\n184\n00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.320\nreason being is, okay, so\nif I am looking, maybe I'm Child2.\n\n185\n00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.160\nAnd I'm looking back up to parent for\nthe operating system.\n\n186\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:06.470\nWell, number one, Child1 is also looking\nto parent for the operating system.\n\n187\n00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.500\nSo both of those VHG Or\n\n188\n00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.760\nVHDX files are gonna be competing for\nthe reads and writes off of parents.\n\n189\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.370\nSo you are going to see some\nperformance degradation there and\n\n190\n00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.810\nalso what happens if parent\nbecomes unavailable?\n\n191\n00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:27.950\nCorruption or any kind of failure, really.\n\n192\n00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:32.180\nSo, then the children,\nare not able to function and\n\n193\n00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.330\nif you have multiple tiers of that\ngoing on, holy cow what kind of like\n\n194\n00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.500\nissues would you have, if you didn't know\nexactly where that break were to occur.\n\n195\n00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.990\nSo documentation with differencing\ndisk it's super important.\n\n196\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.250\nAs a matter of fact you probably don't\neven want to use them in a production\n\n197\n00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.350\nenvironment.\n\n198\n00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.380\nI think it would be really great for\ntesting purposes,\n\n199\n00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.530\nif you're like a developer or\njust spinning up some labs.\n\n200\n00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.110\nBecause of we think about the reason\nI'd said it's most beneficial,\n\n201\n00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.160\nlook at how much space we have here.\n\n202\n00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.720\nIf I have 5GB of changes on Child 1 and\n10GB worth of changes on Child 2.\n\n203\n00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:14.480\nSo, here I have 35GB of physical storage,\nstorage being utilized here.\n\n204\n00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:21.095\nWhereas before just getting this operating\nsystems, we're looking at 60 gigs so\n\n205\n00:13:21.095 --> 00:13:27.330\nI think that's the biggest advantage?\n\n206\n00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah she said performance can\ndefinitely be an issue we start talking\n\n207\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.720\nabout differencing discs Let's say you\nneed to install Windows 10 and you wanna\n\n208\n00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.020\nrun two different apps and compare them\nbut they can't run on the same machine.\n\n209\n00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.590\nThey're incompatible.\n\n210\n00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:42.210\nTwo different versions of the same\nprogram that you wanna test side by side.\n\n211\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.540\nSo you need to install Windows twice but\n\n212\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.480\nif you use this differencing disk system,\nthere's a lot of common files.\n\n213\n00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.740\nAll of the Windows files themselves\ncan be stored on that parent disk and\n\n214\n00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.830\nthen only the changes get stored on those\nchild disks or those differencing disks.\n\n215\n00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.860\nI've done this with server operating\nsystem where I've installed server once\n\n216\n00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:05.400\nand then spun up three different\nservers based off of that parent disk.\n\n217\n00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.270\nOne running DNS, one running DHCP,\n\n218\n00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.470\none doing I think certificate services I\ncan't remember was doing that lab, but\n\n219\n00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:15.380\nI only had to install server\none time on the parent disk.\n\n220\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:20.220\nAnd then the child disk were only\nhousing the differences, DNS, DHCP and\n\n221\n00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.460\ncertificate authority.\n\n222\n00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.279\nDefinitely not something I would do in\nproduction but it saved me a lot of time\n\n223\n00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:25.654\nspinning up my test [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n224\n00:14:25.654 --> 00:14:26.524\nthat's what I was just thinking.\n\n225\n00:14:26.524 --> 00:14:29.420\nI did forget about that, because time.\n\n226\n00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.900\nSo once you go ahead and\nget that operating system set up and\n\n227\n00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.470\ninstalled on there.\n\n228\n00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.440\n&gt;&gt; Do all your Windows updates.\n\n229\n00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.050\nI've only got one drive to update.\n\n230\n00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:38.380\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen you already have that file existing.\n\n231\n00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.130\nI point to use that file.\n\n232\n00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.320\nI just turn it on, and\nI don't have to go through that\n\n233\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:43.970\nprocess again-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm\n\n234\n00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:44.870\n&gt;&gt; So that's a,\n\n235\n00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.660\nthank you for reminding me.\n\n236\n00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.150\nYou've got not only the storage,\nbut also that time.\n\n237\n00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And we all know, time is money, right.\n\n238\n00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:50.992\n&gt;&gt; Time is money.\n\n239\n00:14:50.992 --> 00:14:51.539\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n240\n00:14:51.539 --> 00:14:55.106\nthe only other thing we have to do make\nsure we point out is once you create\n\n241\n00:14:55.106 --> 00:14:58.125\nthose differencing disk,\nthe parent disk cannot change.\n\n242\n00:14:58.125 --> 00:14:59.265\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise,\n\n243\n00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:03.255\nthe child will no longer recognize\nthe parent and it will fail.\n\n244\n00:15:03.255 --> 00:15:05.985\nSo you have to make sure your\ncareful with that parent disk.\n\n245\n00:15:05.985 --> 00:15:07.154\nYou can't make changes to it.\n\n246\n00:15:07.154 --> 00:15:10.118\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Microsoft says just go ahead and\nmark this one read-only.\n\n247\n00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:12.978\nSo any and\nnot just the top of the tier but\n\n248\n00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:17.399\nany drives where you have\nsubordinates looking up to them you\n\n249\n00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:21.830\nare going to want to go ahead and\nset those to read only there.\n\n250\n00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.070\nBecause like Mike said you do\nnot want someone going in and\n\n251\n00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.910\nchanging those because it is going to\naffect those dependent disks as well.\n\n252\n00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.100\nSo just be careful that.\n\n253\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:36.080\nThe next type of disk, Mike, I'm thinking\nabout it, I don't have a diagram for that.\n\n254\n00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.290\nSo I'm gonna have to go back\nto the drawing board here, and\n\n255\n00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.380\nas a matter of fact,\nI don't even know how I'm gonna draw this.\n\n256\n00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.240\nSo we're winging it here.\n\n257\n00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.197\n&gt;&gt; I can see our viewers out there,\naccording to the chat are enjoying your\n\n258\n00:15:45.197 --> 00:15:47.179\ndrawing so far, so\nlet's see what we got next.\n\n259\n00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:47.976\n&gt;&gt; I'm using my finger.\n\n260\n00:15:47.976 --> 00:15:50.761\nI'm still stylus shopping.\n\n261\n00:15:50.761 --> 00:15:53.840\nSo it is what it is for now.\n\n262\n00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.024\nLet's change this color here and\nif I want to talk\n\n263\n00:15:57.024 --> 00:16:01.850\nabout what a pass through disk is you\nmight not be familiar with this term.\n\n264\n00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:06.410\nBut, all right this is gonna be\na very rudimentary version, or\n\n265\n00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:10.890\nbreakdown of our hardware and abstraction\nlayers with virtualization here.\n\n266\n00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:15.590\nSo, let's say this is my PC,\n\n267\n00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.740\ninside my PC I have my components,\nbut notably we're talking about disks.\n\n268\n00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.370\nSo let's just say that this is my\nvirtual hard disk inside my PC.\n\n269\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.430\nAnd remember I said we\nare actually in here,\n\n270\n00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:31.100\nI'll just do my little circle and\ndraw that.\n\n271\n00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.160\nAnd if I were to create a VHD or\nVHDx file,\n\n272\n00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.400\nremember we were like writing\nto a portion of the drive there.\n\n273\n00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.760\nSo I literally have a file\nsitting on my physical drive.\n\n274\n00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.510\nSo what if I have a virtual machine,\n\n275\n00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.398\nwe will go with blue for\nour virtual machines.\n\n276\n00:16:50.398 --> 00:16:57.290\nOkay, and\nmaybe VM 1 is pointing to use the VHD or\n\n277\n00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:01.999\nVHDX file that we've created and\n\n278\n00:17:01.999 --> 00:17:07.060\nstored on that physical drive.\n\n279\n00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.760\nOur virtual hard disk, right?\n\n280\n00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.725\nSo, that's fine, that's one of\nthe greatest things about virtualization.\n\n281\n00:17:14.695 --> 00:17:22.665\nHowever, if we have any kind of latency\nsensitive database or exchange server,\n\n282\n00:17:22.665 --> 00:17:27.765\nsomething that gets a lot of utilization\nand a lot of fast read and writes.\n\n283\n00:17:27.765 --> 00:17:30.475\nWe might wanna consider something\ncalled a pass through disk.\n\n284\n00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.910\nAnd what we're doing is we're\nactually just going, so\n\n285\n00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:39.418\nmay be with our VM 2 here,\nwe're reading and writing straight to.\n\n286\n00:17:39.418 --> 00:17:44.584\nLet's just sit for demonstration\npurposes here, of course output\n\n287\n00:17:44.584 --> 00:17:50.304\nthe arrow going to the opposite direction\nto make things confusing [LAUGH].\n\n288\n00:17:50.304 --> 00:17:54.670\nBut let's just say VM 2 is\nusing a real hard drive.\n\n289\n00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:58.050\nSo I am essentially passing through.\n\n290\n00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:02.720\nPass through disk, passing through the\nhypervisor saying hey I'm just gonna kinda\n\n291\n00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.120\ncircumnavigate you for a moment and\nspeak directly to the hardware.\n\n292\n00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.940\nSo I have no obstruction layers to\ntraverse I'm just gonna read and\n\n293\n00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.880\nwrite straight to this hard drive.\n\n294\n00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.500\nWhich, when this technology first\ncame out it was really cool.\n\n295\n00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.240\nBecause it would satisfy those needs for\n\n296\n00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.800\nthose latency dependent services and\napplications.\n\n297\n00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.640\nHowever, with that being said and\nthe configuration,\n\n298\n00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:33.725\nthe I guess evolution of virtualization\nand how our storage is handled.\n\n299\n00:18:33.725 --> 00:18:39.900\nPass-through disks aren't\nalways required now because,\n\n300\n00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:44.740\nusually, you can get that performance\nout of the VHD and VHDX files.\n\n301\n00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.940\nSo are they still available?\n\n302\n00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.960\nYes, do you need to know about them?\n\n303\n00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.390\nMaybe, for the exam.\n\n304\n00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:51.970\nIn real life are you gonna use them?\n\n305\n00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:52.630\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n306\n00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:53.665\n&gt;&gt; So now you know,\n\n307\n00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:56.080\n[LAUGH] those are pass through disks.\n\n308\n00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the technology's definitely\ncome a long way with the HDXs and\n\n309\n00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.890\nthe performance is there.\n\n310\n00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:06.630\nTo almost give us what we've come\nto expect from a physical disk.\n\n311\n00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:10.990\nStill, sometimes you might want as much as\nyou can get out of that performance, and\n\n312\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.186\nyou don't have any contention, right?\n\n313\n00:19:13.186 --> 00:19:15.922\nWith a VHDX it's a file\non a physical disk,\n\n314\n00:19:15.922 --> 00:19:18.810\nthere's other files on that physical disk.\n\n315\n00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:23.440\nSo you're not only thinking about\nyour VM accessing that VHDX.\n\n316\n00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.360\nAnd that performance there going\nthrough the virtualization but\n\n317\n00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.600\nwhat else is talking to\nthat physical hard drive.\n\n318\n00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.620\nThe host operating system, other VMs and\ntheir VHDXs stored on that same\n\n319\n00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.200\nphysical disc and so\nyou can get some contention there.\n\n320\n00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.180\nWhere as if you pass through to a physical\ndisc, typical that's the only thing that's\n\n321\n00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.920\ntalking to that disk,\nthere is less contention.\n\n322\n00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.950\nSo you can get a little of a bit\nof a performance benefit there.\n\n323\n00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so here's the thing.\n\n324\n00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.970\nNo more drying for now [LAUGH].\n\n325\n00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.890\nOkay, it's all right,\nI know you're disappointed.\n\n326\n00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.610\nWe've spent a lot of time looking at\ndifferent ways we can work with the disks\n\n327\n00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:00.850\nin general.\n\n328\n00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:06.660\nYou shouldn't be unfamiliar with disk\npart at this juncture in our series.\n\n329\n00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.300\nIf you are unfamiliar with that I would\ndefinitely urge you to go back and\n\n330\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.430\ntake a look at.\n\n331\n00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:16.830\nGeez, what I mean, we've been doing out\nfor a while and I think one where we\n\n332\n00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:22.143\nspent a good amount of time when we were\ntalking about native with VHD and VHDX.\n\n333\n00:20:22.143 --> 00:20:28.020\nWith Hyper-V and also excluded\nfrom Hyper-V because remember,\n\n334\n00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:34.860\nwe can use these VHD and VHDX files in\ntandem with Hyper-V and virtualization.\n\n335\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.340\nBut we always don't have to have\na hypervisor to actually use a VHD or\n\n336\n00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.380\nVHDX file.\n\n337\n00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.640\nWe can actually mount it natively, on\nthe physical machine, and use it that way.\n\n338\n00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.830\nSo, I would definitely\nurge you to go back.\n\n339\n00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.990\nWe looked, we could mount the drive,\nwe could modify it.\n\n340\n00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.990\nYou know, and\nwork with offline disks there.\n\n341\n00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:00.560\nSo Disk Part is a great tool for that,\nbut I just want to remind you of that.\n\n342\n00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.510\nLet me just pull up\na virtual machine here.\n\n343\n00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:07.277\nJust give me a second,\nand also I have it up now.\n\n344\n00:21:07.277 --> 00:21:11.192\nWhat we can do is I'm just\ngonna go ahead and search for\n\n345\n00:21:11.192 --> 00:21:14.770\nmy command line if I can\nget my cursor going here.\n\n346\n00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:22.400\nCmd, and remember actually I'll show you,\nif you run\n\n347\n00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.310\nyour cmd as administrator then\nthis part is fine good to go.\n\n348\n00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.680\nIf you just run a regular command prompt,\nit's not the end of the world but,\n\n349\n00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.730\nwhat will happen is you'll\nget a pop out windows.\n\n350\n00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.430\nSo, secondary you will know and\n\n351\n00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:40.630\nalso just port can be ran in powershell\nas well as long as it's administrative.\n\n352\n00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.420\nIf it's not administrative,\nyou'll get that pop out and\n\n353\n00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.960\nyou'll see what I'm talking about here.\n\n354\n00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.910\nIf I go ahead and type in disk part, I get\nmy UAC and that's simply because we need\n\n355\n00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:54.410\nto go ahead and be an administrator to\ngo ahead and work with these disks.\n\n356\n00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.760\nSo, now you can see if\nI zoom in a little bit.\n\n357\n00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.050\nI couldn't remember if\nI zoom it on this one.\n\n358\n00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.550\nI'm actually in disk part and\n\n359\n00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:07.290\nthen my command prompt the one I\noriginally launched is right behind me.\n\n360\n00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.300\nSo, either way,\n\n361\n00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.760\nit's gonna remind you, you try to launch\none up that's not administrative.\n\n362\n00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.950\nWhat do I wanna do here, I just wanted\nto remind you of a really basic\n\n363\n00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:23.760\nthing that we could do here is\nto go ahead and Create a disk.\n\n364\n00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.250\nSo not only do I have the gooey at my\ndisposal and we'll take a look at that.\n\n365\n00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.150\nAnd looking at the time I think\nwe'll have time in the show, but\n\n366\n00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:35.200\nwe do have the different\ncommand line options as well.\n\n367\n00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:40.146\nSo, the syntax that I'm gonna be using\nhere, I'm gonna go ahead and say create,\n\n368\n00:22:40.146 --> 00:22:46.350\nnow the verbiage is\na little bit different.\n\n369\n00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.810\nAs a matter of fact to let me go ahead and\nchange my properties here and\n\n370\n00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:55.780\nbump that font up so\nyou guys can see what we're working with.\n\n371\n00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:59.810\nIt's not the same as what you\nmight expect for the syntax and\n\n372\n00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:06.400\npower shell, okay, that's better.\n\n373\n00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:12.900\nSo it's going to be create vdisk and\nI need to specify the location so\n\n374\n00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.840\nour file here is going\nto be on my C drive.\n\n375\n00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.240\nI actually have created a folder for\nthis show, it's just labeled vhd.\n\n376\n00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.610\nSo, let's go ahead and put point turd,\n\n377\n00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.480\nplace where that VHD file\nis going to live there.\n\n378\n00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.090\nSo, here is the VHD\ninside of that folder and\n\n379\n00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.680\nthat's going to be that first location.\n\n380\n00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:39.388\nWe also need to specify\nan actual disk name so,\n\n381\n00:23:39.388 --> 00:23:45.062\nmaybe I'll say demo disk one,\nand then I need to specify\n\n382\n00:23:45.062 --> 00:23:50.038\nif I'm gonna be working with a VHD or\nVHDX files.\n\n383\n00:23:50.038 --> 00:23:53.493\nSo for now, well I'll just go ahead and\n\n384\n00:23:53.493 --> 00:23:57.579\ndo .vhdx because that is\nthe newer version and\n\n385\n00:23:57.579 --> 00:24:02.216\nMost of the time you'll be\nworking with DHDX files.\n\n386\n00:24:02.216 --> 00:24:08.600\nI need to set a maximum size, there are a\nfew things that you'll see here we need.\n\n387\n00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:15.810\nSo maximum, if I spell that correctly,\nis going to be equal to,\n\n388\n00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:23.340\nI'm working in megabytes and\n\n389\n00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:28.800\nI need to think about the storage\nthat I have available to me.\n\n390\n00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:34.880\nSo right now, I'm creating a 5gig drive,\nwhich is silly in real life.\n\n391\n00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.380\nYou'd wanna have drive that's much larger,\nbut just demonstration purposes.\n\n392\n00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:42.985\nWe're gonna creating a lot and that's\nsomething you have to think about is you\n\n393\n00:24:42.985 --> 00:24:46.986\ncan't create drives even if we\nare dealing with VHD and VHDX files.\n\n394\n00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:51.016\nAnd we've even planned to use them on\nvirtualization you have to think about how\n\n395\n00:24:51.016 --> 00:24:55.064\nI'm slicing and dicing that pizza to hand\nit off to perhaps my virtual machine.\n\n396\n00:24:55.064 --> 00:24:59.347\nYou can't just make it up,\n[LAUGH] all right, so\n\n397\n00:24:59.347 --> 00:25:04.930\nI also need to specify here my\ntype of file that I'm creating.\n\n398\n00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.038\nSo, my type is going to be fixed,\n\n399\n00:25:07.038 --> 00:25:11.010\nlet me see if I can go ahead and\ntype that correctly.\n\n400\n00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.661\nAnd it'll go ahead and create that file,\n\n401\n00:25:13.661 --> 00:25:17.232\nshouldn't take too long with\nthat smaller size there.\n\n402\n00:25:17.232 --> 00:25:22.187\nBut what we can do is while that's\nhappening maybe just navigate to\n\n403\n00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:27.330\nthe C drive there so you guys can see\nit pop in whenever it does arrive.\n\n404\n00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:29.959\nAnd I got click-happy.\n\n405\n00:25:29.959 --> 00:25:30.896\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n406\n00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:36.690\nI have a couple different,\nFile explorers, windows happening here.\n\n407\n00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.071\nLet me close out of one of those.\n\n408\n00:25:45.943 --> 00:25:52.046\nOn my C drive, inside that VHD\nfolder that was pre-existing.\n\n409\n00:25:55.122 --> 00:26:00.660\nAnd okay, this one was already there, so\nthat's not the one that we're waiting for.\n\n410\n00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.240\nThe one that we have, but\nwhat did we name that one?\n\n411\n00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:09.790\nJust demo disk I think,\nlet me see, Demo1Disc.Vhdx.\n\n412\n00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:13.214\nLet me take a look, so this is\nthe one guys I've been playing around\n\n413\n00:26:13.214 --> 00:26:16.407\nwith these discs and\nI don't get too creative with the names.\n\n414\n00:26:16.407 --> 00:26:20.314\nOkay, so it is there it just\nwasn't fully created yet so\n\n415\n00:26:20.314 --> 00:26:25.400\nit did put that little placeholder in\nwe can verify that by taking a look.\n\n416\n00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.880\nDown here it says DiskPart\ncreated the virtual disk file.\n\n417\n00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:35.040\nSo, I also wanna note here\nif we look at the size,\n\n418\n00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.180\nand I will just zoom\nin a little bit there.\n\n419\n00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:45.290\nThe size is gonna true to size here\nbecause we created a fixed drive.\n\n420\n00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:50.220\nIf we had created a dynamic drive,\nthen only the amount of that drive for\n\n421\n00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.010\noverhead, very slight amount.\n\n422\n00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:54.870\nAnd any kind of storage that\nwas being utilized would\n\n423\n00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:58.860\nbe shown within the operating\nsystem here for that size.\n\n424\n00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.930\nAll right,\nI think we are good to go there.\n\n425\n00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:07.310\nJust remember, DiskPart is available,\nit's an older tool but it's a great tool.\n\n426\n00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:12.820\nThere's a lot that you can do with this,\nso what else do I wanna show you here?\n\n427\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.700\nLet's pull up Hyper-V manager,\n\n428\n00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.393\nI think we got a little bit of time, okay.\n\n429\n00:27:21.393 --> 00:27:25.383\n[LAUGH] Actually, change of plans, let's\ngo ahead and save this because I wanna run\n\n430\n00:27:25.383 --> 00:27:29.316\nthrough all of the different ways that we\ncan create different types of disks but,\n\n431\n00:27:29.316 --> 00:27:31.180\nthen look at that also in PowerShell.\n\n432\n00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.861\nSo, I think it will go together nicely\nif we look at those together, so.\n\n433\n00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:35.850\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan.\n\n434\n00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.340\nAll right, Well, great stuff so far.\n\n435\n00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:41.360\nGreat drawings, great demonstrations\nlooking at VHDs and VHDXs.\n\n436\n00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.410\nWe appreciate that Cherokee.\n\n437\n00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.730\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n438\n00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.297\nSigning out for ITProTV.\n\n439\n00:27:46.297 --> 00:27:47.600\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n440\n00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.345\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:15.110\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.030\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.960\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n7\n00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.200\nSpecifically, in this episode,\nwe are creating and configuring VHDs.\n\n8\n00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.710\nThis is a part two, so if you missed\nthe first one, make sure you go back and\n\n9\n00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.620\ncheck that out.\n\n10\n00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.770\nHere to continue our\nconversation with VHDs and\n\n11\n00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.870\nVHDXs is none other than Cherokee Boose.\n\n12\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.590\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me.\n\n14\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.843\nIn the last show, although it\ndid say create and configure for\n\n15\n00:00:37.843 --> 00:00:40.169\nthe headline,\nwe just really talked about it,\n\n16\n00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:43.332\nwe did not click create or\nwe created it in One Drive in this part.\n\n17\n00:00:43.332 --> 00:00:44.262\n&gt;&gt; We did, we did, we did.\n\n18\n00:00:44.262 --> 00:00:45.760\n&gt;&gt; So okay, so we did create.\n\n19\n00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.650\nBut let's go ahead and\ncreate some more in this show.\n\n20\n00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.510\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's jump right in.\n\n21\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.980\nI wanna start with the graphical\nuser interface first.\n\n22\n00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.045\nI think that's a good place if\nyou've never worked with any kind of\n\n23\n00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:57.080\ncommand-line interface.\n\n24\n00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.860\nAlthough I say that and we just one.\n\n25\n00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.720\nSo either way, we're good to go.\n\n26\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.930\nHere, I have Hyper-V Manager pulled up.\n\n27\n00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.460\nThis is one easy way that I can go\nahead and work with VHDs and VHDXs.\n\n28\n00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.985\nRemember though, those are not the only\nfiles associated with file extensions,\n\n29\n00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:19.944\nI should say, surrounding a virtual\nhard drives, we also have\n\n30\n00:01:19.944 --> 00:01:24.345\na .AVHD file extension, we talked about\nthat a little bit in our Hyper-V shows,\n\n31\n00:01:24.345 --> 00:01:29.775\nbut that's gonna be the file extension\nused for any kind of saved state or\n\n32\n00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:33.136\nlike system checkpoint,\nthat's the word I'm,\n\n33\n00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:37.310\n[LAUGH] they changed the name from,\nso many times, snapshots,\n\n34\n00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.490\ncheckpoint, so that's gonna be that file\nassociated with that virtual machine.\n\n35\n00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.090\nNow, in more advanced\nseries that we look at,\n\n36\n00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.380\nyou know, if you really are moving forward\nwith server side operating systems,\n\n37\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.620\nyou'll also wanna think about\nhow you can create clusters and\n\n38\n00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.380\ndifferent types of, you know,\nnetwork attached storage,\n\n39\n00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.510\ndirect storage and\nyou have the ability to create VHD sets.\n\n40\n00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.890\nSo if you see VHDS,\nthat'll be referring to a file\n\n41\n00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.760\nthat is a drive that is part of\na larger set, if that makes sense.\n\n42\n00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.330\nIt's part of a cluster or\ndirect storage configuration there.\n\n43\n00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.910\nSo just thrown those out.\n\n44\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.690\nBut under Hyper-V Manager here,\n\n45\n00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.760\na couple different ways I can go ahead and\ncreate these virtual hard drives.\n\n46\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.620\nOver here, under New,\nzoom in a little bit.\n\n47\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.090\nI do not have zoom in on here.\n\n48\n00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.640\nLet me use my Windows zoom feature.\n\n49\n00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.670\nI can go ahead and create a hard disk.\n\n50\n00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.160\nJust a couple of different ways.\n\n51\n00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.480\nMicrosoft gives you a few different\nways to access or create something.\n\n52\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.690\nOver on the left hand side,\nunder Action and under New,\n\n53\n00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.990\nI get that same context\nmenu as well over here.\n\n54\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.650\nSo you know, just a couple of\ndifferent ways of doing that.\n\n55\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.970\nAlso, if I had multiple machines and I was\n\n56\n00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.060\nperforming remote management or something,\nthose other machines will be listed here.\n\n57\n00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.590\nSo for now,\n\n58\n00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.370\nI just have the default name of\nthe virtual machine that I'm using here.\n\n59\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.910\nThe actual machine that I had spun up.\n\n60\n00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.100\nAnd I can right-click\non top of that machine,\n\n61\n00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.280\nagain, same context menu\nunder the New option.\n\n62\n00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.420\nSo just a few ways, so\ngo ahead and access that.\n\n63\n00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.960\nNow, this is just the original,\nlike welcome page,\n\n64\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.110\nthe first time you ever launch this,\nyou'll see this option,\n\n65\n00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.150\nyou can check this, so you don't have\nto see that every single time there.\n\n66\n00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.630\nWe'll go ahead and hit Next.\n\n67\n00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.450\nNow, these are gonna be\nthose file extensions that\n\n68\n00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.790\nwe're just talking about some of them.\n\n69\n00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.100\nAnd most notably the first two are what\nwe would really be focusing in on.\n\n70\n00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.860\nHowever, remember with our VHD\nfile extension or version,\n\n71\n00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.380\nwe have some limitations there, however.\n\n72\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.290\nWe've just passed previously why or\nwhy we don't wanna use them.\n\n73\n00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.980\nFor now I'm just gonna go ahead,\nand you know what,\n\n74\n00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.590\nlet's create a VHD because I'll show you\nmaybe I don't wanna keep that permanently.\n\n75\n00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.100\nAnd we can go ahead and change that.\n\n76\n00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:19.450\nNow, this next page, this screen should\nalso be somewhat familiar to you as well.\n\n77\n00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.140\nWe've spoke about Fixed size\nversus Dynamically expanding,\n\n78\n00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.080\nas well as Differencing, if you\nare wondering, what is she talking about?\n\n79\n00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.110\nDefinitely check out that last\nepisode because that's where we really\n\n80\n00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.160\nexplain the differences,\nI won't spend too much time here.\n\n81\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.220\nFor now, let's just go ahead and\nkeep it up fixed, go ahead and hit Next.\n\n82\n00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.390\nNow, looking at the name of\nmy virtual hard disk, let's\n\n83\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.860\nsay I wanna go ahead and I just keep\nwith my, what did I say before?\n\n84\n00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.349\nDemoDisk1.\n\n85\n00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.500\nSo we'll call this one DemoDisk2.\n\n86\n00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.340\nThis is going to be that default location\n\n87\n00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.876\nthat HyperView wants to use to go ahead,\nand store those disks.\n\n88\n00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:09.500\nIf I want to change that,\nI can go ahead and re-create it or\n\n89\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.015\nwe're using, and let me zoom out a little\nbit so you can see what we're doing here.\n\n90\n00:05:13.015 --> 00:05:19.031\nWe're using a file located on this C\ndrive and that was going to be VHD.\n\n91\n00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:21.400\nThat was the name of that\nfolder that we are using.\n\n92\n00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.220\nSo that's where we're kind of just\nplacing our virtual drives here.\n\n93\n00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.646\nSo go ahead and place that there and\nwe will hit Finish.\n\n94\n00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.260\nAnd we'll go ahead and create that disk.\n\n95\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.750\nSo it doesn't take a very long time here.\n\n96\n00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.810\nAnd let's see, oop,\nunable to create the virtual disk.\n\n97\n00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.170\nLet's go ahead and\nlet me check on one thing.\n\n98\n00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.294\nLet me go back here.\n\n99\n00:05:47.391 --> 00:05:49.400\nLet's try VHDX here.\n\n100\n00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.346\nI did not change that fixed.\n\n101\n00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:57.550\nAll right, also I do wanna point out.\n\n102\n00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.430\nIf you noticed before it\nwas VHD file extension.\n\n103\n00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.840\nThis is where we did see that.\n\n104\n00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.150\nIt really shouldn't make a difference.\n\n105\n00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.380\nBut let me go ahead and hit Next now.\n\n106\n00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.320\nAll right, for the size, that's probably\n\n107\n00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.330\nthe issue we came across because for\nmy demo here, my actual machine,\n\n108\n00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.140\nmy host machine, only has 120 gigs,, so\nI have to be careful with my size here.\n\n109\n00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:31.228\nSo whether it's VHD or\nVHDX is irrelevant, I just changed it.\n\n110\n00:06:31.228 --> 00:06:32.240\nActually, let's just go back and\n\n111\n00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.070\nchange that now to show you\nthat file extension there.\n\n112\n00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.330\nBut I do need to be\ncognizant of my storage.\n\n113\n00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.980\nAnd we've spoke about this before,\nyou can't over allocate.\n\n114\n00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.156\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nif you're gonna make a fixed disk,\n\n115\n00:06:45.156 --> 00:06:49.151\nthen you need all of that space available\nso that it can create that VHD or VHDX.\n\n116\n00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:52.640\nIf you don't have enough space,\nit is gonna fail.\n\n117\n00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do something really\nsmall here, now I'm like a parent and\n\n118\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.120\nI'll be super stingy which I usually am\npretty frugal with my storage, anyways,\n\n119\n00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.520\nand you know what, let's just spend\nsome time looking at this page as well,\n\n120\n00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.980\nyou do have the ability to copy\ncomponents of a specific disk.\n\n121\n00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.720\nBut for now, we're creating a really tiny,\n\n122\n00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.690\nwe're not really able to copy too\nmuch only the three gigs here.\n\n123\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.580\nAnd you can also copy contents of\nsome other disk that you were working\n\n124\n00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.800\nwith as well.\n\n125\n00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.680\nBut for now, let's create our own blank\ndisk and we'll hit Next, and this page\n\n126\n00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.560\nis just that last page that really gives\nyou an overview or summarization of\n\n127\n00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.740\nwhat you've just done, great for\ndocumentation purposes, we'll hit Finish.\n\n128\n00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.640\nAnd now, let's hop on over to that folder.\n\n129\n00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.390\nWe'll give it a second,\nI'm being impatient here.\n\n130\n00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.758\nThat's nothing new, though,\nif you have watched any other shows.\n\n131\n00:07:42.758 --> 00:07:47.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] down to that folder.\n\n132\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.040\nAnd here we do see, DemoDisk2.\n\n133\n00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.250\nBut I used capital letters here, so yeah.\n\n134\n00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.525\nSpicing it up a little bit.\n\n135\n00:07:54.525 --> 00:07:57.613\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we can see our size and\n\n136\n00:07:57.613 --> 00:07:58.702\nwe've got that.\n\n137\n00:07:58.702 --> 00:08:00.859\nSo pretty easy, pretty straightforward.\n\n138\n00:08:00.859 --> 00:08:04.651\nAs long as you think about your storage\nit's all about pre-planning too, here.\n\n139\n00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:08.760\nIn the GUI, I'm just gonna minimize\nthat or in any, whether you're GUI or\n\n140\n00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.858\ncommand line, just on your systems.\n\n141\n00:08:10.858 --> 00:08:15.750\nSo it's still fully creating or\nfinished creating that, let's also,\n\n142\n00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.638\nlet me create virtual machine because\nthere are some options that I can,\n\n143\n00:08:20.638 --> 00:08:23.580\nadditional options that we spoke about.\n\n144\n00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.530\nWe saw differencing,\nin the graphical user interface there.\n\n145\n00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.770\nActually, let's do that one first.\n\n146\n00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.168\nWe'll go through that, we'll just say,\nto show you what it looks like.\n\n147\n00:08:34.168 --> 00:08:38.849\nSo again, we're gonna go under action or\na different way here, and\n\n148\n00:08:38.849 --> 00:08:44.035\nwe'll select Hard Disk, and we'll go\nahead and keep again with our VHDX.\n\n149\n00:08:44.035 --> 00:08:48.212\nFor this portion here,\nwe'll select the Differencing.\n\n150\n00:08:48.212 --> 00:08:53.365\nNow, the reason I wanted you to\nshow you this and a few others just\n\n151\n00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:58.616\nto get familiar with it,\nis it's going to be pretty similar, but\n\n152\n00:08:58.616 --> 00:09:04.270\nyou do have to have that parent VHD or\nVHDX to piggyback off of, right?\n\n153\n00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:10.240\nSo first, it's gonna ask what's the name\nof the disk that we're creating.\n\n154\n00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.020\nSo we had DemoDisk1 and 2,\n\n155\n00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.730\nagain let's just say,\nDemoDisk3, all right?\n\n156\n00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.696\nAnd let's also keep it in that\nsame location under my (C:) Drive,\n\n157\n00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:26.880\nin our VHD folder, and\nwe'll go ahead and put it there.\n\n158\n00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.720\nWe'll hit Next.\n\n159\n00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.080\nI'll zoom out, so\nwe can see what's going on.\n\n160\n00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.920\nNow, it says, okay, so\nwe've just put that placeholder there.\n\n161\n00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.290\nWe're starting to create the disk.\n\n162\n00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.610\nWho do you wanna copy from?\n\n163\n00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:48.054\nSo you need to be aware of the fact\nthat you cannot copy a VHD file,\n\n164\n00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:54.321\nhave a .vhd extension and\nthen create a child.vhdx.\n\n165\n00:09:54.321 --> 00:09:56.200\nThey have to be the same.\n\n166\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.540\nSo that's gonna be a limitation there, but\nother than that, you should be good to go.\n\n167\n00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:05.480\nSo if we go to our actual (C:)\nDrive under that VHD folder,\n\n168\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.320\nlet's just say, here, I'll go ahead and\n\n169\n00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.290\ncreate or choose DemoDisk1 for\nmy parent there.\n\n170\n00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.510\nWe'll go ahead and select Open.\n\n171\n00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.050\nThat will work for us for now.\n\n172\n00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.720\nSo you do see the same information\nthat we saw on that previous screen,\n\n173\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.860\nbut you also have\nthe information of that parent.\n\n174\n00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.710\nSo Mike and I were talking about\nthis in the previous show,\n\n175\n00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.540\nwhy it's super important to\nunderstand that hierarchy, and\n\n176\n00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:40.070\nunderstanding any kind of child or\nsubordinate-type disks, because they\n\n177\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:45.630\nare going to be affected if the parent is\nmoved, changed, or corrupt in any way.\n\n178\n00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.110\nSo that's just something\nto think about there.\n\n179\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.500\nAnd we'll go ahead and hit Finish.\n\n180\n00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.979\nDynamic, you guys saw that radio button\nthere, it's really the only difference,\n\n181\n00:10:53.979 --> 00:10:55.506\nI'm not gonna run through that one.\n\n182\n00:10:55.506 --> 00:10:58.641\nBut I did wanna create a virtual machine,\nso\n\n183\n00:10:58.641 --> 00:11:04.220\nI could show you something else that\nwe spoke about in the last show.\n\n184\n00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:10.130\nI'm just creating, let's say, here, Show1\n\n185\n00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:15.050\nfor the show, and\nwe'll keep it in the default location.\n\n186\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:20.008\nWe'll create a Gen 2 machine because\nremember, we wanna be working with those\n\n187\n00:11:20.008 --> 00:11:25.340\nVHDX files if we want to, here, which I'm\nsure we will, create our default memory.\n\n188\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.530\nWe're really not gonna be\nspeeding this machine up.\n\n189\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:34.190\nI don't need networking, as a matter\nof fact, I will just, one gig for\n\n190\n00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.785\nthis machine here, because we're not\ngonna really do anything with it.\n\n191\n00:11:36.785 --> 00:11:40.492\nWe'll keep in the default location and\nwe'll be good to go.\n\n192\n00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:42.648\nYou know what?\nLet me bring this to your attention\n\n193\n00:11:42.648 --> 00:11:43.345\nhere also.\n\n194\n00:11:43.345 --> 00:11:47.905\nWe've talked about this in the Hyper-V\nshell, but just in case you haven't seen\n\n195\n00:11:47.905 --> 00:11:51.804\nthose, I do have the ability to,\nas I'm creating a virtual machine,\n\n196\n00:11:51.804 --> 00:11:54.937\ncreate a virtual hard disk and\nattach to it at that time.\n\n197\n00:11:54.937 --> 00:11:59.014\nHowever, I could create just a shell and\nsay, hey, I'll go ahead and\n\n198\n00:11:59.014 --> 00:12:03.454\nattach a virtual hard disk later,\nwe have the ability to do that right here.\n\n199\n00:12:03.454 --> 00:12:04.090\nAnd then,\n\n200\n00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.980\nI also have the ability right here to\nselect the pre-existing virtual hard disk.\n\n201\n00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.970\nSo there aren't any real\nset-in-stone rules,\n\n202\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.950\nhey you have to create your virtual\nmachine first or your hard disk,\n\n203\n00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:21.160\nlike your virtual disk that can be at your\nchoosing there so, go ahead and hit next.\n\n204\n00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.700\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ninstall an operating system later,\n\n205\n00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.413\nwe don't need one right now,\njust for this demo.\n\n206\n00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.040\nNext, all right, it's really quick.\n\n207\n00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.540\nFinish.\n\n208\n00:12:33.316 --> 00:12:39.412\nOnce I have this machine spun upwards in\nthe off state, but it's in existence now.\n\n209\n00:12:39.412 --> 00:12:40.304\n&gt;&gt; Created, mm-hm.\n\n210\n00:12:40.304 --> 00:12:41.907\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n211\n00:12:41.907 --> 00:12:43.836\nconnect to it to pull\nup some settings here.\n\n212\n00:12:43.836 --> 00:12:47.830\nAnd of course, you can get to those\nsettings a couple of different ways.\n\n213\n00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.470\nLike I said, I just wanted to show you.\n\n214\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.452\nNow, this is the actual hard drive that\nwe just created within that wizard.\n\n215\n00:12:54.452 --> 00:13:00.176\nThe VHDX that if we hadn't created and\nwe selected the option to add a virtual\n\n216\n00:13:00.176 --> 00:13:05.820\nhard drive later, then we wouldn't\nsee that here, but, it is what it is.\n\n217\n00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.455\nAll right, so if I click on top\nof my scuzzy controller here for\n\n218\n00:13:10.455 --> 00:13:15.359\nmy Gen 2 machine, I have the option\nover in this right pane here,\n\n219\n00:13:15.359 --> 00:13:17.610\nto add additional hardware.\n\n220\n00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.870\nI can add it, a hard drive, I'll zoom\nin so you guys can see that hard drive,\n\n221\n00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.550\nDVD drive, shared drive, but\nlet's stick with hard drive for now.\n\n222\n00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:29.130\nSo we'll go ahead and select Add.\n\n223\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:34.670\nNow, this is going to be,\nright this first option here, just like if\n\n224\n00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:40.690\nI had that option in the wizard to\nselect a pre-existing VHD or VHDX file.\n\n225\n00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.970\nI can specify my controller type,\nas well as location for\n\n226\n00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.550\nthe limitations that we have,\nthe different types of controllers,\n\n227\n00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.700\nespecially if they were Gen\n1 versus Gen 2 machine.\n\n228\n00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.830\nBut, what I really wanna show you here,\nsomething that's grade out,\n\n229\n00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:59.000\nits called physical hard disk group,\nso it's labelled that here.\n\n230\n00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.600\nBut really, what the operating system is\nreferring to, is that pass-through disk.\n\n231\n00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.590\nSo I wanna make that, bring that to\nyour attention because on the exam,\n\n232\n00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.580\nthey may use the term, physical hard disk.\n\n233\n00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.970\nBut probably not, because it's really\nreferring to a pass-through disk for\n\n234\n00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.640\nthis configuration.\n\n235\n00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.970\nNow, pay attention to this also.\n\n236\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.040\nBehind my head, if we could go full\nscreen for one moment, if we read this,\n\n237\n00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.030\nit says, if the physical hard\ndisk you wanna use is not listed,\n\n238\n00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.600\nmake sure that the disk is offline.\n\n239\n00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.920\nUse Disk Management on the physical\ncomputer to manage physical hard disks.\n\n240\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.020\nOkay, so let's do that.\n\n241\n00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:43.283\nLet me just minimize this, and let's\nsee here, minimize our Hyper-V manager,\n\n242\n00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:47.837\nwe can just close this we really\ndon't need to get in there.\n\n243\n00:14:47.837 --> 00:14:51.795\nActually, I'll just minimize it,\nI'm going on a minimizing spree here.\n\n244\n00:14:51.795 --> 00:14:54.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't email, I saw that pop up earlier.\n\n245\n00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.619\nWhat I wanted to show you here is, and\n\n246\n00:14:56.619 --> 00:14:59.448\nyou guys are probably\nfamiliar with this interface.\n\n247\n00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:01.530\nWe've been working with\nit quite a bit now,\n\n248\n00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:04.180\nthis is going to be\nDisk Management Console.\n\n249\n00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:09.826\nAnd I do have a physical disk\nattached to this machine.\n\n250\n00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:12.050\nAnd so the system, that notification,\n\n251\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:17.260\nthat information section we were just\nreading says, look, it has to be offline.\n\n252\n00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.230\nWhat kind of state are we currently in?\n\n253\n00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.040\nAnd you guys probably know this from\nall the work that we've been doing,\n\n254\n00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.010\nwe are not just in an offline state.\n\n255\n00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.630\nWe are in an unknown state\n\n256\n00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.560\nbecause this disk has just been\nplugged into that computer, right?\n\n257\n00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.820\nSo number one,\nin order to utilize a pass-through disk,\n\n258\n00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.980\nyou have to have that physical,\ntangible hardware component.\n\n259\n00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.390\nThat's what we have here,\nwe're simulating this environment.\n\n260\n00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.390\nFirst thing I need to do\nis to initialize the disks.\n\n261\n00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.280\nSo okay, we'll go ahead and\ninitialize, and\n\n262\n00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.400\nthen we choose our partitions scheme\nlike we have been this whole time.\n\n263\n00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.713\nA GPT looks good to me, we'll say, Okay.\n\n264\n00:15:55.713 --> 00:15:58.787\nBut, let's pay attention\nto the status of this disk.\n\n265\n00:15:58.787 --> 00:16:02.710\nSo now,\nthat disk is still being noted as online.\n\n266\n00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:07.402\nSo, what we really need to do is just\nmake sure that we actually take this\n\n267\n00:16:07.402 --> 00:16:08.900\ndisk offline.\n\n268\n00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.541\nCouple of different ways, you can\nuse PowerShell, you can use the GUI,\n\n269\n00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:14.470\nyou can use disk part to go ahead and\nperform that function.\n\n270\n00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.252\nBut now, we should be able to go ahead and\n\n271\n00:16:18.252 --> 00:16:22.269\nget back into our Settings options there.\n\n272\n00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:26.253\nAnd actually whatever\nstate that machine was,\n\n273\n00:16:26.253 --> 00:16:31.740\nwhen you pulled this window up,\nit usually still reflects that.\n\n274\n00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.809\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ngo back under my file here and\n\n275\n00:16:35.809 --> 00:16:40.291\nthen go back into Settings and\nit should reflect that change there.\n\n276\n00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:44.974\nSo if I go into our SCSI Controller,\nselect Add for new hardware.\n\n277\n00:16:44.974 --> 00:16:49.670\nNow I zoom in and\nthis option down here is now grayed out.\n\n278\n00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.020\nSo I do have the ability to go ahead and\ncreate that pass through disk.\n\n279\n00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.860\nI'd simply click this radio button and\nthen go ahead.\n\n280\n00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.422\nYou do need to specify the location.\n\n281\n00:16:59.422 --> 00:17:04.589\nAnd you see this information here,\nit's really easy because I only had that\n\n282\n00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:09.769\none 3 gig drive at this point in the show,\nso that's the only option I have.\n\n283\n00:17:09.769 --> 00:17:12.829\nSo again it will be grayed\nout if you do select or\n\n284\n00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:17.150\nhave the disk in offline state or\neven have a physical disk at all.\n\n285\n00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.130\nSo, all right.\n\n286\n00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:21.980\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\nclose out of here.\n\n287\n00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.520\nWe really don't wanna create one for now.\n\n288\n00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.160\nAnd we'll get out of this machine.\n\n289\n00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.040\nWhat do we wanna do?\n\n290\n00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.850\nHow about, let's do some PowerShell, Mike.\n\n291\n00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:31.912\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n292\n00:17:31.912 --> 00:17:33.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna be running as\n\n293\n00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.210\nan administrator here because\nwe are working with our drives.\n\n294\n00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:38.360\nYou guys know the drill.\n\n295\n00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.640\nLet me change my font so you can read\nthis, otherwise I'll be in trouble here.\n\n296\n00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.606\nI'm already going against the grain.\n\n297\n00:17:46.606 --> 00:17:50.708\nAll right,\n\n298\n00:17:50.708 --> 00:17:56.860\nnow everything that we can do plus more\nhere in PowerShell with our drives.\n\n299\n00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.110\nSo the first thing I wanna go ahead and\nlet's just say New.\n\n300\n00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.320\nWe're gonna create a drive, right?\n\n301\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.900\nWe just created a couple of drives\nin the GUI, so let's do it here.\n\n302\n00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:11.210\nNew-vhd is going to be\na parameter that we use.\n\n303\n00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.570\nAs a matter of fact, let me minimize this.\n\n304\n00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.010\nI do have links in the show notes for\n\n305\n00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:20.380\nyou guys to really just\nperuse at your own leisure.\n\n306\n00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.900\nLet's see, where is that New-VHD.\n\n307\n00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.037\nJust get familiar with the cmdlets and\n\n308\n00:18:27.037 --> 00:18:29.983\nthe different switches that\nyou do have available.\n\n309\n00:18:29.983 --> 00:18:34.828\nWe're gonna look at some basic ones but\nagain pretty robust, pretty powerful,\n\n310\n00:18:34.828 --> 00:18:37.047\nhence the name PowerShell, right.\n\n311\n00:18:37.047 --> 00:18:38.970\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n312\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.020\nSo you do have that available for\nyou in the show notes but\n\n313\n00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.010\nwe'll go back in here and\nactually perform some of that.\n\n314\n00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:49.650\nAll right, with our New-VHD,\nthe same type of of information\n\n315\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.060\nthat the system was requesting in the GUI,\nwe're gonna need to provide here.\n\n316\n00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:56.760\nSo we need to specify that path.\n\n317\n00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.014\nSo, the path, we'll go ahead,\nand keep the same.\n\n318\n00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:06.720\nC:\\, that was our VHD folder\nthat we had been working with.\n\n319\n00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.220\nFor this one, let's say demodisk.\n\n320\n00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.124\nWhat are we up to?\n\n321\n00:19:10.124 --> 00:19:10.886\nThree?\n&gt;&gt; Four.\n\n322\n00:19:10.886 --> 00:19:12.160\n&gt;&gt; Four, goodness.\n\n323\n00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:12.820\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure.\n\n324\n00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.136\n&gt;&gt; All right, we'll go with four,\njust so we don't get yelled at if we-\n\n325\n00:19:15.136 --> 00:19:15.665\n&gt;&gt; Better safe than sorry.\n\n326\n00:19:15.665 --> 00:19:16.759\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n327\n00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:17.306\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n328\n00:19:17.306 --> 00:19:20.573\n&gt;&gt; All right, so demo disc four and\n\n329\n00:19:20.573 --> 00:19:24.450\nwe'll go ahead and create a VHD here.\n\n330\n00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.810\nWe've been working with VHDX files and\n\n331\n00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.160\nI'm not gonna discriminate\nagainst them in any way.\n\n332\n00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.620\nLike I said sometimes you might need\nthem but you might need to convert them.\n\n333\n00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.520\nAgain we can create a fixed drive.\n\n334\n00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.790\nWe do need to specify if we\ndo create a fixed drive here.\n\n335\n00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:46.424\nWell, we wanna create fixed or dynamic we\nneed to specify there are a few required\n\n336\n00:19:46.424 --> 00:19:50.458\nparameters including like for\nour size here, so our size, in bytes,\n\n337\n00:19:55.437 --> 00:20:00.756\nI always get impatient [LAUGH] size and\nbytes.\n\n338\n00:20:00.756 --> 00:20:05.723\nI'm just gonna go ahead and stick with\nthat 1 gig because of storage purposes but\n\n339\n00:20:05.723 --> 00:20:09.100\nthat's fine, and\nwe'll go ahead and hit enter here.\n\n340\n00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.920\nWe've seen this before maybe you\nhaven't so that's why I didn't wanna,\n\n341\n00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.700\nthis could be a great review for you if\nyou have, but it specifically called out\n\n342\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.410\non the exams going to make sure we\ndefinitely know how to at least create and\n\n343\n00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:25.970\njust managed some drive\nhere we've seen this before\n\n344\n00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:30.630\nthe actual computer name that we were\nworking with way of the location\n\n345\n00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:35.330\nas to where that drive is being stored and\npertinent information so just type and\n\n346\n00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:40.150\nsize and style of its fixed\ndifferent seeing dynamic.\n\n347\n00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:44.250\nSo forth, nothing major there,\nI'll go ahead and hit clear.\n\n348\n00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:50.800\nWhat if I decide I wanna change my mind,\ndoes that ever happen to you Mike?\n\n349\n00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.856\n&gt;&gt; Once in a while.\n\n350\n00:20:51.856 --> 00:20:52.926\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n351\n00:20:52.926 --> 00:20:54.730\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I've goofed something up and\n\n352\n00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:55.830\nI need to fix it.\n\n353\n00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so maybe I'm like okay, hey I\ncan't really work with a VHD file for\n\n354\n00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.600\nthis particular project,\nI need to go ahead and have a VHDX.\n\n355\n00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.532\nSo, [SOUND], convert.\n\n356\n00:21:04.532 --> 00:21:09.590\nWe have a convert cmdlet available and\nwe can go ahead and use that.\n\n357\n00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:13.850\nYou will need to obviously know\nthe location of the disk in the name.\n\n358\n00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:19.100\nSo just a few bits of information here but\nwe'll say convert VHD,\n\n359\n00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:25.975\nspecify the path that we our path here,\nthis is our sequel\\VHD\\ and\n\n360\n00:21:25.975 --> 00:21:31.690\nagain I can't remember if I did capital or\nlower case but, it shouldn't matter here.\n\n361\n00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.940\nWe're working with our demo disk forward\nisn't important to know the actual name of\n\n362\n00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.299\nit and that was the VHD file extension.\n\n363\n00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.802\nNow the next commandlet that I wanna\nuse is going to be destination path.\n\n364\n00:21:46.493 --> 00:21:48.170\nI'm gonna go ahead and tab through that.\n\n365\n00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:49.590\nLess painful for you guys.\n\n366\n00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.770\nNow, I can move the location.\n\n367\n00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.960\nSo this is my source basically\nwhere I'm starting just that path.\n\n368\n00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.130\nIt doesn't say source, but\nthat's okay for the actual convert there.\n\n369\n00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:03.060\nDestination.\n\n370\n00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.160\nI'm gonna keep it in the same place just\nto make it easy for us to go ahead and\n\n371\n00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.570\nlook for that.\n\n372\n00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:11.648\nSo we'll say, sequel\\ not pipe,VHD\\ and\n\n373\n00:22:11.648 --> 00:22:16.812\nagain what I did in our case here,\nit shouldn't matter.\n\n374\n00:22:16.812 --> 00:22:21.700\nDemo disk, if I spell in demo disk\n4 then it'll just for now for\n\n375\n00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.310\nthe file extension I mean to say VHDX so\n\n376\n00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:30.270\nthis is really where that conversion is\nhappening we'll go ahead and hit Enter and\n\n377\n00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:35.140\nnoticed here now how the disc is\nactually changing it's converting it\n\n378\n00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.050\nshouldn't take too long this is a very\nsmall disk that we've been working with.\n\n379\n00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:41.790\nPerforming that conversion there.\n\n380\n00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.280\nI will say this though.\n\n381\n00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.730\nYou can perform conversions,\njust kind of be careful.\n\n382\n00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.385\nSometimes everything might not work\nthe way you think it might work.\n\n383\n00:22:56.385 --> 00:22:58.995\nBut it does [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Backup of the VHD before you\n\n384\n00:22:58.995 --> 00:23:01.727\ntry the conversion\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, always.\n\n385\n00:23:01.727 --> 00:23:05.280\nAll right, and if I wanted to\ngo ahead into that location and\n\n386\n00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.620\njust verify which, we did have that.\n\n387\n00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.750\nSo here,\nI see two different File extensions.\n\n388\n00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:17.445\nI might just need to refresh here in\nthe GUI but alternatively you can do like\n\n389\n00:23:17.445 --> 00:23:23.080\nget-disc to see different types of.\n\n390\n00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.350\nNow, we've spoke about this command\nbefore, get-disc, to go ahead and\n\n391\n00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:33.035\nit's kinda weird environment that\nI have going on here Let me state,\n\n392\n00:23:33.035 --> 00:23:38.330\nget-virtualDisk to render or\n\n393\n00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:41.400\nreturn my virtual disk, so\nlet's give that a second.\n\n394\n00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.770\nI'm using virtualization\ninside a virtualization, so\n\n395\n00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.970\nit looks a little funny for\nthat option there.\n\n396\n00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:55.590\nWe'll see what we've got here\n&gt;&gt; Didn't find it.\n\n397\n00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.055\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, alright, that's okay.\n\n398\n00:23:59.055 --> 00:24:05.582\nLet me see here, there's one way that,\nanother way, we'll come back to this.\n\n399\n00:24:05.582 --> 00:24:07.322\nBut I wanna show you.\n\n400\n00:24:07.322 --> 00:24:10.942\nWe can work with drives associated for\na particular machine.\n\n401\n00:24:10.942 --> 00:24:13.642\nI just have something going on with\nmy configuration right now but\n\n402\n00:24:13.642 --> 00:24:16.350\nwe'll try something out in a little bit.\n\n403\n00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:17.890\nAll right, what else have we done?\n\n404\n00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:22.930\nWe've created a new, we created a vhd,\nwe converted it to a vhdx.\n\n405\n00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.170\nI used the -fix parameter.\n\n406\n00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:33.410\nIf I don't specify fix, the system will\nautomatically generate a dynamic disk.\n\n407\n00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.520\nWe spoke about the differences there,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n408\n00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.125\nI still need to include my size for\nthat dynamic disk.\n\n409\n00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.990\nBut remember it's only gonna be creating\n&gt;&gt; Well you'll just set in the max size.\n\n410\n00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.607\n&gt;&gt; Right, the max size.\n\n411\n00:24:47.607 --> 00:24:53.090\nYup, and let's create a difference in\ndrive here because we saw that in the GUI.\n\n412\n00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.290\nSo let me clear my screen.\n\n413\n00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:00.656\nWe're gonna go ahead and say new-vhd.\n\n414\n00:25:00.656 --> 00:25:05.255\nAnd for this particular one we had\nto specify that parent location,\n\n415\n00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:10.270\nso that's what we're going to do here so\nwe'll say Parent path.\n\n416\n00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:13.630\nAnd that's the primary\nthat we need to use here.\n\n417\n00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:19.100\nWe'll specify that location and,\nshoot what did we just create?\n\n418\n00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.780\nWe created what was demodisk4 was VHDX.\n\n419\n00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:27.248\nOkay, so we'll use demodisk4.\n\n420\n00:25:27.248 --> 00:25:34.890\nOops sorry, I got to put my path in\nhere to C: \\vhd for that folder.\n\n421\n00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:40.740\nAnd then that was demodisk4.vhdx.\n\n422\n00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.599\nAll right,\nnow we also need to go ahead and\n\n423\n00:25:43.599 --> 00:25:48.767\nspecify just the regular path where\nwant that child to go ahead and reside.\n\n424\n00:25:48.767 --> 00:25:53.099\nSo we'll go ahead and put that path,\nagain, we're just going to keep things\n\n425\n00:25:53.099 --> 00:25:56.912\npretty simple and straightforward,\nkeep it all in the same place.\n\n426\n00:25:56.912 --> 00:26:03.550\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nlabel this one demo, child disk.\n\n427\n00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:04.354\nHow about that?\n\n428\n00:26:04.354 --> 00:26:06.500\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n429\n00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.727\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I just looked weird\nwith the two Ds there but\n\n430\n00:26:10.727 --> 00:26:15.178\nwe'll do a capitalization,\nchilddisk1.vhdx.\n\n431\n00:26:15.178 --> 00:26:19.750\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nspecify that.\n\n432\n00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:25.209\nCreating a virtual disk,\nwe do see that differencing is, and\n\n433\n00:26:25.209 --> 00:26:29.769\nthe term differencing, I don't know\nif I mentioned this before, but\n\n434\n00:26:29.769 --> 00:26:33.327\nif you think about the differences\nbetween the disks,\n\n435\n00:26:33.327 --> 00:26:36.833\nwe're only saving\nthe differences on childdisk1.\n\n436\n00:26:36.833 --> 00:26:42.338\nSo where the information that is same or\nsimilar is being stored on our parent\n\n437\n00:26:42.338 --> 00:26:47.423\nwhich in this instance is demo disk Or,\nso just be familiar with that.\n\n438\n00:26:47.423 --> 00:26:51.647\nIt's actually pretty easy\nas long as you keep in mind\n\n439\n00:26:51.647 --> 00:26:55.683\nthe diversions of VHD to VHD and\nvice versa there.\n\n440\n00:26:55.683 --> 00:26:59.972\n&gt;&gt; And I noticed that you didn't have to\nspecify differencing in the command, once\n\n441\n00:26:59.972 --> 00:27:04.830\nit saw that parent path, it said, well,\nthere's only one kind of drive to create.\n\n442\n00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.590\nThat uses the parent path switch.\n\n443\n00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I mean there is\na differencing parameter there but\n\n444\n00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:14.110\nreally here I'm telling you,\nwho my parent is so.\n\n445\n00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.590\nWhat else do we have time for here Mike?\n\n446\n00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:20.640\nHow about attaching a VHD\nbecause we saw in the GUI, okay,\n\n447\n00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.696\nI can have a virtual machine without\nany kind of virtual hard disk drive.\n\n448\n00:27:25.696 --> 00:27:27.537\nAnd what if I wanna go ahead and\nattach one later?\n\n449\n00:27:27.537 --> 00:27:30.264\nI can do that here from\nPowerShell as well.\n\n450\n00:27:30.264 --> 00:27:35.790\nSo, clearing the screen we'll go ahead and\nfor this one we'll say, add.\n\n451\n00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:40.610\nSo, this is that important verb and\nour verb now in syntax to use for\n\n452\n00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.620\nadding a hard drive to a virtual machine.\n\n453\n00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.390\nThat's going to be add,\nnow this is a little bit different here.\n\n454\n00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:52.298\nWe're gonna actually\ntype in VM hard disk and\n\n455\n00:27:52.298 --> 00:27:55.569\nit's like not dirdisk.\n\n456\n00:27:55.569 --> 00:28:01.383\nWe've been using, holy cow turkey, vhd and\n\n457\n00:28:01.383 --> 00:28:08.430\nvhdx so you see the syntax\nis slightly different here.\n\n458\n00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.050\nJust calling that out so\nyou're aware of it.\n\n459\n00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:17.450\nSo we're gonna say VM hard disk drive,\nthat's the false cmdlet here.\n\n460\n00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:22.881\nNow, I could be working with multiple\nvirtual machines on this one host,\n\n461\n00:28:22.881 --> 00:28:24.469\nso how does this SML?\n\n462\n00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:27.934\nWell, we have to tell it,\nso we're gonna go ahead and\n\n463\n00:28:27.934 --> 00:28:32.323\nspecify that VM name And,\nI don't even remember what that name is,\n\n464\n00:28:32.323 --> 00:28:34.675\nI think it was just Show 1,\n&gt;&gt; Show 1?\n\n465\n00:28:34.675 --> 00:28:35.580\n&gt;&gt; We'll try it, yeah.\n\n466\n00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.740\nI think that's what it was.\n\n467\n00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.590\nSo VM name is Show 1.\n\n468\n00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.070\nWe also need to, again,\n\n469\n00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:49.870\nspecify the path as to where we\nwanna go ahead and put this.\n\n470\n00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:54.715\nSo again, same spot C:/VHD and\n\n471\n00:28:54.715 --> 00:28:59.041\nwe'll just say demodisk6 or\n\n472\n00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:04.067\nwait [CROSSTALK] I don't have six.\n\n473\n00:29:04.067 --> 00:29:05.331\nYeah.\nSo we'll say-\n\n474\n00:29:05.331 --> 00:29:08.320\n&gt;&gt; Childdisk or disk3.\n\n475\n00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll do disk3.\n\n476\n00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:10.450\nThat will be good.\n\n477\n00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:11.088\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n478\n00:29:11.088 --> 00:29:13.293\nI can't remember if disk3 was VHD or VHDx.\n\n479\n00:29:13.293 --> 00:29:14.254\nWe're gonna go with VHDx.\n\n480\n00:29:14.254 --> 00:29:15.180\n&gt;&gt; Tab, will find that for you.\n\n481\n00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n482\n00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.700\nThat's true too.\n\n483\n00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.910\nSo, and also look at it fixed\nmy capitalization there too.\n\n484\n00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:27.786\nSo if you do use the tab, like in the\ngraphical user interface when we went to\n\n485\n00:29:27.786 --> 00:29:34.319\nchoose our some things are hidden from us\nwhen we're going through those wizard and\n\n486\n00:29:34.319 --> 00:29:40.630\nonly shows the drives that are going\nto be conducive to the function.\n\n487\n00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:44.920\nSo by hitting that tab you're essentially\nhaving [CROSSTALK] you're getting those\n\n488\n00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.910\ntraining wheels.\n\n489\n00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:46.598\nThat's what's happening here.\n\n490\n00:29:46.598 --> 00:29:48.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; With the operation systems.\n\n491\n00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.630\nSo it's yes cycling through and helping\nyou with any kind of available options.\n\n492\n00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:58.270\nSo we have to specify which drive we\nwanna attach to that virtual machine.\n\n493\n00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.750\nAnd then it will go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n494\n00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.270\nAnd if you wanna verify our work,\n\n495\n00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.420\nvirtual machines have a couple of\ndifferent ways we can identify them.\n\n496\n00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:12.420\nSo, by that syntax there we\nutilize the actual machine name.\n\n497\n00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:18.090\nHowever, they utilize virtual machine IDs,\nthese really long alphanumeric strings,\n\n498\n00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:21.950\nand an easy way to.\n\n499\n00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:26.090\nIdentify a machine without typing at\nall out is by using your pipe tool.\n\n500\n00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:30.427\nSo what we can do is get -VM, and\n\n501\n00:30:30.427 --> 00:30:36.090\nwhat I'm gonna do here is I am gonna use\nthe name, or not name, it's a VM name,\n\n502\n00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:43.490\nshow one, and what I'm gonna do\nis pipe that out into a select.\n\n503\n00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:49.145\nAnd like Mike says, I'm tabbing but\n\n504\n00:30:49.145 --> 00:30:53.373\nI'm [LAUGH] being patient select-object.\n\n505\n00:30:53.373 --> 00:30:58.063\nSo, what I'm saying here is grab\nthis virtual machine ID, so\n\n506\n00:30:58.063 --> 00:31:01.229\nI'm selecting that particular object.\n\n507\n00:31:01.229 --> 00:31:05.040\nAnd actually let me just hit enter so\nthat you guys can see what it looks like.\n\n508\n00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.590\nThis is what that VM ID looks like here,\nthat alpha numeric string.\n\n509\n00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:12.270\nBut what I'm gonna do is I'm just\ngonna hit my up arrow to get\n\n510\n00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:16.740\nthat same information, but\nthen pipe that one out to something else.\n\n511\n00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:21.407\nSo what I can do is get-vhd.\n\n512\n00:31:21.407 --> 00:31:25.280\nNow remember,\nVHD is kind of like an umbrella term.\n\n513\n00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.224\nWe're not really saying, oops.\n\n514\n00:31:27.224 --> 00:31:29.640\n&gt;&gt; If you get that VHD, check that, yeah.\n\n515\n00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.606\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let me see here.\n\n516\n00:31:31.606 --> 00:31:34.967\n&gt;&gt; This is VDH there at the end, yeah.\n\n517\n00:31:34.967 --> 00:31:37.092\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so much with my typing there.\n\n518\n00:31:37.092 --> 00:31:41.901\nRemember, we're not excluding\nthis VHDX files because you\n\n519\n00:31:41.901 --> 00:31:45.130\ncan see that being noted here.\n\n520\n00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.310\nAnd this going to be that demodisk3.\n\n521\n00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:54.010\nSo if we look at our results that\nwere returned to us any drives,\n\n522\n00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:56.940\nvirtual drives here because\nwe did specify VHDX.\n\n523\n00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.316\nWe're not talking about physical drives,\nbut if we look at those virtual\n\n524\n00:32:00.316 --> 00:32:04.020\ndrives associated with that particular\nvirtual machine, this is what I said and\n\n525\n00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:04.735\nyou guys okay.\n\n526\n00:32:04.735 --> 00:32:08.295\nWe will check to see which drives\nare associated with that virtual machine.\n\n527\n00:32:08.295 --> 00:32:10.265\nAnd that's what's returned here.\n\n528\n00:32:11.593 --> 00:32:17.165\nThis is that drive we just created, so\nif we wanted to verify and make sure that\n\n529\n00:32:17.165 --> 00:32:21.295\nwe did attach it properly and add it, then\nthat's one way we could check on that.\n\n530\n00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:27.089\nThere's so much you could do, there's no\nway to squeeze that into a 30 minute show.\n\n531\n00:32:27.089 --> 00:32:31.181\nI just want you guys to be familiar with\ndifferent things, different ways you can\n\n532\n00:32:31.181 --> 00:32:34.322\ngo ahead and work with and\nexecute drives here in PowerShell.\n\n533\n00:32:34.322 --> 00:32:38.053\nDisk part as well as\ngraphical user interface.\n\n534\n00:32:38.053 --> 00:32:42.809\nSo who knows what you'll be presented\nwith if you are taking that exam or\n\n535\n00:32:42.809 --> 00:32:44.248\njust in the field so.\n\n536\n00:32:44.248 --> 00:32:45.335\nI think that's about it for now Mike.\n\n537\n00:32:45.335 --> 00:32:47.031\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely fantastic stuff,\n\n538\n00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:50.529\nwhen you're working out there it might\nhave opportunity to work in the query or\n\n539\n00:32:50.529 --> 00:32:53.620\nyou might wanna script it out, so\nyou need to know your PowerShell.\n\n540\n00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:57.350\n&gt;&gt; Now and as you said the exam will\ndefinitely hit you on some PowerShell\n\n541\n00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.250\nas well as other things.\n\n542\n00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:59.360\nSo good, thanks for that,\n\n543\n00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.860\nhope everybody out there enjoyed watching\nthis one, signing off for ITPRO TV,\n\n544\n00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.270\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick,\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee

Thanks for having me, Mike,\n\n11\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.300\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\n\n12\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.156\nso file system permissions?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n13\n00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:35.110\nI think we'll spend some time looking\nat NTFS permissions specifically.\n\n14\n00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.960\nWe will also take a look at share\npermissions a little bit down the road.\n\n15\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.230\nI may mention them here, but I think\nthis is a good place to go ahead and\n\n16\n00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.580\nstart, like what's an NTFS permission,\nand why do I need it?\n\n17\n00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.430\nWell, that's a good question.\n\n18\n00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.280\nSo if you think about\nthe NTFS file system,\n\n19\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.360\nit does have additional integrated,\nbuilt-in features so\n\n20\n00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.490\nwe can take advantage of, and\none of them would be permissions.\n\n21\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.110\nAnd if I create an object like a file,\nor a folder, or\n\n22\n00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.435\nlet's think about what objects can be-\n&gt;&gt; Protected?\n\n23\n00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.073\n&gt;&gt; Protected here, yeah, so\n\n24\n00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:12.240\nwe'll be looking at that.\n\n25\n00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.060\nFiles and folders, there are slight\ndifferences, we'll get into that.\n\n26\n00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.220\nBut let's say I have a document and\nI create it and\n\n27\n00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.160\nI have it in some kind of\ncentral location on my network.\n\n28\n00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.050\nI may not want everyone in\nthe organization to have access to that\n\n29\n00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.010\ndocument.\n\n30\n00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.860\nSo this is where setting permissions\ncan really come in handy.\n\n31\n00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.180\nSo I can go ahead and reduce that,\n\n32\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.950\nI can specify who should have\naccess to that document.\n\n33\n00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.142\nAnd that's gonna be following\nthe principle of least privilege,\n\n34\n00:01:43.142 --> 00:01:46.391\nand that's something that we wanna\nadhere to within our networks,\n\n35\n00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:48.621\nif we think about security and\nhow that works.\n\n36\n00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:53.109\nAs a matter of fact,\nthinking about security holistically, and\n\n37\n00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:57.523\nwe go way back to our CIA triad,\nconfidentiality, integrity.\n\n38\n00:01:57.523 --> 00:01:59.404\nI don't know,\nI have to do my little triad.\n\n39\n00:01:59.404 --> 00:02:00.278\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:02:00.278 --> 00:02:02.248\n&gt;&gt; Confidentiality, integrity, and\n\n41\n00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:03.140\navailability.\n\n42\n00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.350\nSo this also goes with\navailability because,\n\n43\n00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.820\nyes, we do want to lock\nthese documents down.\n\n44\n00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.000\nBut what good are those documents if the\npeople who need them can't access them?\n\n45\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n46\n00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.600\nThis is one of the more important roles\nthat we have in an IT environment is to\n\n47\n00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.840\nmake sure that our users can access\nthe resources they need, but\n\n48\n00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.970\nin a secure fashion.\n\n49\n00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.860\nAnd a lot of times when we say secure\nfashion, we think security encrypt,\n\n50\n00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.310\nprotect from the bad guy.\n\n51\n00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.020\nBut we also can mean making sure\nthat if you should have access,\n\n52\n00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.175\nyou do have access, but\nif you shouldn't have access, you don't.\n\n53\n00:02:38.175 --> 00:02:42.520\nThere's resources that I'm not allowed to\naccess on our network, and we use NTFS\n\n54\n00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.094\npermissions to control that access.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and you guys probably\n\n55\n00:02:47.094 --> 00:02:51.950\nhave already heard me say this but\nit's Shrek, ogres are like onions, right?\n\n56\n00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.139\nWell, our security is like onions.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n57\n00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.085\n&gt;&gt; Because it's just little tiny things\n\n58\n00:02:56.085 --> 00:02:57.280\nthat we can do.\n\n59\n00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.660\nLittle enhancements or\n\n60\n00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.600\nfeatures that we could implement,\nthat strengthen the overall security.\n\n61\n00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.090\nIt's not just a light switch\nthat we can switch on or off.\n\n62\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.460\nSo with that being said, let's go\nahead and take a look at my screen.\n\n63\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.106\nI have some terms that I\nwould like to just explain.\n\n64\n00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:18.615\nAnd we'll also look at also how they\napply in the operating system, but\n\n65\n00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:23.580\nthis is just a page off Microsoft Docs\nthat explains access control lists.\n\n66\n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.575\nNow you may already be familiar with\nthis term, It's used all over the place,\n\n67\n00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:32.523\nin documentation, firewalls,\njeez, all sorts of things.\n\n68\n00:03:32.523 --> 00:03:38.280\nIt's basically just a list, like it says,\nexplaining, well, who has access.\n\n69\n00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.710\nA little more to it than that,\nwe do have a list.\n\n70\n00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.348\nThe list is composed of something\ncalled ACEs, or access control entries.\n\n71\n00:03:50.348 --> 00:03:55.270\nAnd you could also use the term\nhere when we're talking about NTFS\n\n72\n00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.690\npermissions as a security principal.\n\n73\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.020\nSo I can assign a user, a group,\nor a computer permissions.\n\n74\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.480\nAnd that's what we'll be doing\nin the operating system.\n\n75\n00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.748\nSo you may hear me say security principal,\nor user group, or\n\n76\n00:04:10.748 --> 00:04:15.291\neven ACE, for access control entry there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,it's a great point,\n\n77\n00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:19.049\ncuz a lot of times we get hung up on the\nfact that we use permissions to control\n\n78\n00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.270\nusers' access to resources, which we do.\n\n79\n00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.000\nBut we can also use those same\npermissions to control devices,\n\n80\n00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.820\nwhether they're allowed to make\na connection, service accounts,\n\n81\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.900\nwhether they're allowed to run and\nwhat they're allowed to access.\n\n82\n00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.180\nSo it's not just user accounts.\n&gt;&gt; No doubt, Mike.\n\n83\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.693\nI mean, if you think about maybe I have\nany kind of shift work or a computer that\n\n84\n00:04:38.693 --> 00:04:42.664\nsits in an area that's shared and\nI have multiple users logging in.\n\n85\n00:04:42.664 --> 00:04:46.108\nIt would be more beneficial\nif I were to go ahead and\n\n86\n00:04:46.108 --> 00:04:51.280\nassign that computer permissions\ninstead of the individual users.\n\n87\n00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.955\nAnd really, as we go through the show,\nI want you to think about that.\n\n88\n00:04:54.955 --> 00:04:58.100\nBecause I might be assigning\nindividuals permissions,\n\n89\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.320\nwe might be working with groups.\n\n90\n00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.704\nJust kind of however this demo goes,\nI don't know, we'll plan it as we go.\n\n91\n00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:07.892\nBut [LAUGH] I want you to understand\nthat in business environments,\n\n92\n00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:10.902\nmost likely,\nyou'll be working with groups.\n\n93\n00:05:10.902 --> 00:05:14.670\nAnd that's simply because it makes\nmore sense, it's easier to manage.\n\n94\n00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.322\nAnd we'll talk about that as we continue.\n\n95\n00:05:16.322 --> 00:05:19.950\nBut yeah, we wanna work smart here.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n96\n00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.480\n&gt;&gt; Now, in our Windows environments,\n\n97\n00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.000\nwe utilize the discretionary access model.\n\n98\n00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.265\nSo the term ACL is going to be a little\nmore specific by adding a D for\n\n99\n00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.605\ndiscretionary access model.\n\n100\n00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:37.475\nIf you think about the person\nwho creates a folder or file,\n\n101\n00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:40.255\nthen they inherently are the owner.\n\n102\n00:05:40.255 --> 00:05:44.119\nSo ownership is not set in stone.\n\n103\n00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:48.318\nOthers can take ownership of\na particular object as well.\n\n104\n00:05:48.318 --> 00:05:52.153\nBut just when you hear this term DACL and\nwe'll see it In a few moments,\n\n105\n00:05:52.153 --> 00:05:55.729\nthat's what we're looking at,\nthe actual way it is displayed,\n\n106\n00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.612\nthat discretionary access\ncontrol list the no ROS.\n\n107\n00:05:58.612 --> 00:06:03.425\nWe're also gonna take a look at something\na little bit later called system access\n\n108\n00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:04.922\ncontrol list, or SACL.\n\n109\n00:06:04.922 --> 00:06:11.507\nWhich is going to be a way where we\ncan add entries for auditing purposes.\n\n110\n00:06:11.507 --> 00:06:13.025\nSo yeah, right there, so\n\n111\n00:06:13.025 --> 00:06:17.786\nbasically it enables administrators to\nlog attempts to access secured objects.\n\n112\n00:06:17.786 --> 00:06:19.330\nAnd so we'll also take a look at that.\n\n113\n00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.560\nAll right, so let's go ahead and do that.\n\n114\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:30.220\nLet me pull up a VM that I have here, and\nI'm currently just residing on my root.\n\n115\n00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.560\nAnd let's go ahead and, yeah,\nI'll just create something new so\n\n116\n00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.970\nyou guys don't think I have any kind of\npermissions already set, just brand new.\n\n117\n00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:45.478\nWe'll go ahead and set New &gt; Folder,\nand we will call this,\n\n118\n00:06:45.478 --> 00:06:49.375\nI don't know, Top Secret.\n&gt;&gt; Oops.\n\n119\n00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.141\n&gt;&gt; Oops is right.\n\n120\n00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:54.125\n[LAUGH] All right,\nI'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n121\n00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:58.740\nSo we've just created our Top Secret\nfolder, and if I right-click on this and\n\n122\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.990\nselect Properties.\n\n123\n00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.130\nAll right, let me zoom in so\nyou can see what I'm talking about here.\n\n124\n00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.340\nI'm using my wrong tool to zoom in,\nforgot I do have ZoomIt, one second.\n\n125\n00:07:13.303 --> 00:07:16.130\nNow that I've gone crazy, it's okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.620\n&gt;&gt; We'll use the other one.\n\n127\n00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.950\nAll right, I just wanted to make\nsure you guys can see this.\n\n128\n00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.430\nNow, on this third tab over,\nI have a Security tab.\n\n129\n00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.330\nThis is where we really wanna spend\nour time when we're talking about our\n\n130\n00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.360\npermissions or NTFS permissions.\n\n131\n00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.324\nWe'll get to this second\nSharing tab in another show.\n\n132\n00:07:34.725 --> 00:07:39.135\nBut for now, I wanna just bring attention\nto that folder that we just created and\n\n133\n00:07:39.135 --> 00:07:40.595\nwhat we're looking at here.\n\n134\n00:07:40.595 --> 00:07:46.581\nSo this is going to be our DACL,\ndiscretionary access control list.\n\n135\n00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:50.691\nHere I have ACEs, so\ncurrently I just have groups.\n\n136\n00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:54.030\nWe did not just go add additional groups.\n\n137\n00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:59.294\nThere are special groups that\nthe operating system does use, and\n\n138\n00:07:59.294 --> 00:08:06.140\nI can also see that these groups have\npermissions and they have been inherited.\n\n139\n00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.500\nAll from just a quick glance.\n\n140\n00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.710\nAnd you might ask, well, how would you\nknow that and what does inherited mean?\n\n141\n00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.890\nThe actual interface,\nthe UI here, is very telling.\n\n142\n00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.480\nIf they're two different\ntypes of NTF permissions.\n\n143\n00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.360\nA few different types, but\nlet me just focus on two first of all.\n\n144\n00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.348\nI really wanna really call\nout explicit permissions.\n\n145\n00:08:29.348 --> 00:08:33.658\nAn explicit permission\nsays here's an object,\n\n146\n00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:38.360\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nassign a permission to it.\n\n147\n00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.580\nAt the act of assigning\nthat permission and\n\n148\n00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.296\nhaving it editable is explicit.\n\n149\n00:08:46.296 --> 00:08:51.990\nIf I inherit permissions, it's not\neditable and it would be grayed out.\n\n150\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:56.460\nThere are other situations, such as if\nI were utilizing special permissions,\n\n151\n00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.160\nwhere it will also be gray.\n\n152\n00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.310\nAnd that simply indicates that you cannot\n\n153\n00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.200\nedit those permissions\nfrom this UI window.\n\n154\n00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.010\nYou would need to go to a separate,\na secondary window here with the advanced.\n\n155\n00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.270\nSo, let's just take a look at that for\na second.\n\n156\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.100\nLet's go ahead and add it and ask here.\n\n157\n00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.700\nSo, we'll go ahead and select Edit and\n\n158\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.560\nwe'll select Add, and I think I have\nMike in here but you know what,\n\n159\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.400\nI like I said, let's stick with groups for\nnow because maybe.\n\n160\n00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.890\nJust to be a little more\nrealistic in the real world.\n\n161\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:28.440\n&gt;&gt; Best practices, right?\n\n162\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.010\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so Managers,\n\n163\n00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:35.690\nI had created a Managers group\nin Active Directory previously.\n\n164\n00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.860\nSo this computer is already\na member of the domain.\n\n165\n00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:44.070\nYou can also utilize NTFS permissions\non work group computers, but if you're\n\n166\n00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.750\nin a business environment, most likely\nthere be leveraging Active Directory.\n\n167\n00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.950\nSo, go ahead and hit OK,\n\n168\n00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:55.540\nthis is the most able to find that group\nthat security group that I had created.\n\n169\n00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.360\nAnd you wanna make sure that\n\n170\n00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.350\nthe access control entry that you want\nto work within modify is selected.\n\n171\n00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:08.670\nBecause I could've accidentally\nbeen on a different component here,\n\n172\n00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.460\nbut we wanna work with our Managers.\n\n173\n00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:16.690\nNow, you can see the different\nboxes that I have right here,\n\n174\n00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.570\nthat are available to me.\n\n175\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.290\nAnd let's talk about those for a second.\n\n176\n00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.230\nBy default, and it's always good if you've\nnever worked with permissions before,\n\n177\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.840\nthat's why I wanted to create\na brand new folder here.\n\n178\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.090\nSo that you could see what's\nthe default looking like, and\n\n179\n00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.950\nthat's always good to know and understand.\n\n180\n00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.880\nBecause you can get into trouble\nif someone is going in and\n\n181\n00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.570\nchanging permissions,\nrandomly, haphazardly, and\n\n182\n00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.860\nthen you're tasked with going back and\nfixing them.\n\n183\n00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.970\nSo knowing and being familiar with\nthose default settings is important or\n\n184\n00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.890\nhelpful I should say.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n185\n00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.180\njust to make sure we're all on\nthe same page with the terminology,\n\n186\n00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.110\nwhat you did was you just added an A to\nthe access control entry to the DAC,\n\n187\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.240\nthe dicretionary access control list and\nassign permissions.\n\n188\n00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.840\nAnd by doing that you are explicitly\nassigning those permissions cuz you\n\n189\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.480\nare working with the object and\nyour adding the permissions directly.\n\n190\n00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.280\n&gt;&gt; That's perfect Mike.\n\n191\n00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.160\nThat's exactly it.\n\n192\n00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.200\nYes, we're not talking code speak or\nanything.\n\n193\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.310\nYou might just have to get use to it,\nbut that's yeah.\n\n194\n00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:21.500\nAll right, so the first permission that\nI would like to talk about here now.\n\n195\n00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.910\nThese are not the only permissions,\n\n196\n00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.310\nbut this is where we will start,\nbaby steps, right?\n\n197\n00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:30.680\nSo, Microsoft has organized\nin the UI right here,\n\n198\n00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.960\nthe most common permissions\nthat we encounter.\n\n199\n00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.180\nAnd the majority of the time,\nthis is where we will stay.\n\n200\n00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.050\nWhen we start getting fancy and\nmore advanced, sometimes it's required and\n\n201\n00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:41.700\nnecessary.\n\n202\n00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.987\nBut it can be and that works,\nif you haven't already figured this out,\n\n203\n00:11:46.987 --> 00:11:52.646\nit's a lot easier to manage networks\nthat are similar with less variables.\n\n204\n00:11:52.646 --> 00:11:55.920\nBecause all of those variables\nintroduce potential problems and\n\n205\n00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.970\njust make trouble shooting more difficult.\n\n206\n00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:59.780\nSo we'll try to stick,\n\n207\n00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.140\nas a matter of fact, Microsoft,\nthey recommend using these.\n\n208\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.040\nBut again, it's all about options and\n\n209\n00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.180\nhaving those.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n210\n00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.170\n&gt;&gt; This one right here, Write.\n\n211\n00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:13.080\nAnd let's just uncheck the defaults for\nnow, so we can see the behaviors,\n\n212\n00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:18.790\nhow other permissions are going to be\naffected when we're working with these.\n\n213\n00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:24.630\nSo write is pretty well hopefully\nself-explanatory meaning I can write or\n\n214\n00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.360\nmodi- I can [LAUGH].\n\n215\n00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.407\nI'm trying not to,\n&gt;&gt; It's hard to not use\n\n216\n00:12:27.407 --> 00:12:27.962\nthat word.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n217\n00:12:27.962 --> 00:12:28.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.940\n&gt;&gt; It's hard because one of the other\n\n219\n00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.640\npermissions are modify.\n&gt;&gt; To make changes.\n\n220\n00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good one.\n\n221\n00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.210\nAnd I don't want to use\nthe terms in a confusing way.\n\n222\n00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:41.150\nSo, whenever we're writing,\nwe can make changes to document and\n\n223\n00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.510\nwe can also create new documents,\nall right?\n\n224\n00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:50.100\nSo, if I have the Write permissions to\nthis folder, that means I can drag and\n\n225\n00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:55.100\ndrop a documents, a file into this folder.\n\n226\n00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.980\nNow, the one right above it is read, okay.\n\n227\n00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:04.740\nSo, when I selected write, read did\nnot automatically get selected nor,\n\n228\n00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.420\nif I select read, is write selected.\n\n229\n00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.420\nThey're completely exclusive,\nindependent of each other.\n\n230\n00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.610\nAnd, you might think well that's silly,\n\n231\n00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:18.230\nit's almost like it should be implied\nthat if I can open and read a document.\n\n232\n00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.970\nOr if I am allowed to write to a document,\nI should be able to open it and\n\n233\n00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.060\nread it, but that's not the case here.\n&gt;&gt; It is kind of crazy to\n\n234\n00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.610\nthink that you can give\nsomebody write permissions\n\n235\n00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:31.150\nwithout giving them read permissions.\n&gt;&gt; I mean in certain situations I guess it\n\n236\n00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.020\nwould work,\nbecause like what we were talking about.\n\n237\n00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:38.810\nIf I wanted to put a document into\na folder so, maybe I don't know if\n\n238\n00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:44.350\nI were submitting my sales for\nthe month to get my spiffs or bonus.\n\n239\n00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.280\nI might not want to as a sales manager,\n\n240\n00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.850\nI might not want the individual\nemployees knowing each others finances.\n\n241\n00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:57.560\nBut I may have one area where there\nare signed to turn that in on the network.\n\n242\n00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.460\nI don't know.\n\n243\n00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.488\nI'm trying to come up with it good.\n&gt;&gt; I like this, so\n\n244\n00:14:00.488 --> 00:14:05.700\nthat way they could create a document or\nupload a document to that directory.\n\n245\n00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.777\nBut they couldn't read other people's\nstuff cuz they don't have read permssions.\n\n246\n00:14:07.777 --> 00:14:08.362\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n247\n00:14:08.362 --> 00:14:10.646\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n248\n00:14:10.646 --> 00:14:12.874\n&gt;&gt; So read that is simply going to be\n\n249\n00:14:12.874 --> 00:14:13.750\nreading.\n\n250\n00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.900\nThe one right above it here for\nlist folder contents.\n\n251\n00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.680\nThis one is only,\nsince we are looking at the properties for\n\n252\n00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.240\na particular folder here,\nthen obviously they apply.\n\n253\n00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.800\nIf this were a text document or\n\n254\n00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:34.080\nsome other file, list folder contents\nwould not be an option for us.\n\n255\n00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:41.050\nNow, read and\nexecute above that one, right there.\n\n256\n00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:46.520\nPretty similar, but notice how the other\noptions here were propagated and\n\n257\n00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:52.280\nfilled in these checkboxes, I didn't\ndo that, the operating system did that.\n\n258\n00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.780\nAnd that's because if there were\nany associated, files or anything\n\n259\n00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:02.880\nI needed then I would go ahead and see\nthose to be able to read and also execute.\n\n260\n00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.812\nSo if it were like a .exe or\nsomething .msi I would\n\n261\n00:15:07.812 --> 00:15:12.065\nalso be able to execute that binary there.\n\n262\n00:15:12.065 --> 00:15:17.240\nNow, modify is another\none I even have you see\n\n263\n00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.250\nan additional check that was ticked there\nso with modify, and this is what Mike was\n\n264\n00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.910\nsaying, use the word change, not modify.\n&gt;&gt; It's tricky [LAUGH].\n\n265\n00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:30.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah because with modify, I am able to\n\n266\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:36.650\nread, write, execute, and\neven work with modify.\n\n267\n00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.320\nI guess that's about it.\n\n268\n00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.720\nAnd you're able all of the above.\n\n269\n00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.360\nIs there anything else you can think of?\n&gt;&gt; Deleting\n\n270\n00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.320\nfiles.\n&gt;&gt; Deleting.\n\n271\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.510\nThat has to be a big one there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n272\n00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:47.310\nBig difference between write\nthat can create new documents.\n\n273\n00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:50.780\nMake changes to existing documents.\n&gt;&gt; But you can't delete my sales spiff.\n\n274\n00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.663\n&gt;&gt; But I can't delete it, exactly.\n\n275\n00:15:51.663 --> 00:15:52.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n276\n00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.275\n&gt;&gt; It's crazy because with write you can\n\n277\n00:15:54.275 --> 00:15:55.654\nmake changes to your document.\n\n278\n00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:57.328\nSo I can open up a document.\n\n279\n00:15:57.328 --> 00:16:00.491\nAnd delete all the contents of\nthe document and save it, but\n\n280\n00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:03.660\nI can't delete the document itself,\nthe object.\n\n281\n00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.360\nWhereas, modified gives me\nthe permission to delete the object.\n\n282\n00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it gives you\n\n283\n00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.370\na lot of control there.\n\n284\n00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:12.280\nAs a matter of fact,\nit's almost at full control there.\n\n285\n00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:12.930\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n286\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.440\n&gt;&gt; And so, full control you do gain\n\n287\n00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:22.000\nthe ability to change permissions\non that object with full control or\n\n288\n00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.550\neven assume take ownership\nwith full control there.\n\n289\n00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:26.710\nSo that's the difference.\n\n290\n00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.150\nNow all of those are explicit\npermissions just like Mike said.\n\n291\n00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.620\nSo what we're doing\nright here is explicit.\n\n292\n00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.000\nSo yes, yes, that is correct.\n\n293\n00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.020\nNow, we've only been working in this\nfirst column, this allow column.\n\n294\n00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:46.000\nHowever, there is right behind my head\nhere, a secondary column that states deny.\n\n295\n00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.850\nSo, when we're comparing apples to apples\nhere, I want you to understand that\n\n296\n00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:57.120\nexplicit deny is going to\noverride an explicit allow.\n\n297\n00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.510\nThat's the rule of thumb there, all right?\n\n298\n00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.970\nAnd just remember that, because we\nget further down the line, I wanna\n\n299\n00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.450\nrecall that but in a difference when\nwe're looking at inherited permissions.\n\n300\n00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.300\nBecause there is kind of\na hierarchy of permissions here.\n\n301\n00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.360\nBut you just wanna be\ncareful with the denies,\n\n302\n00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:20.310\nespecially in this explicit deny because\nthat's gonna trump your explicit allow.\n\n303\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.630\nSo that's at the top of the food\nchain there, that deny.\n\n304\n00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.780\nAll right,\nlet me zoom out a little bit and\n\n305\n00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.790\nsee what else we're\nmissing from this screen.\n\n306\n00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.730\nLet's-\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n307\n00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.440\nCherokee, I see one that we\nhaven't talked about yet.\n\n308\n00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.620\nWhat is that special permissions\nthere on the bottom?\n\n309\n00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.970\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so let's go ahead and\n\n310\n00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:42.970\ntake a look at that one here,\nlet me zoom in a little bit.\n\n311\n00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.660\nWhat Mike is referring to,\nokay, so, is right here.\n\n312\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.240\nThis bottom section that's\na little bit grayed out, and\n\n313\n00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.450\nthat's referring to those\nspecial permissions.\n\n314\n00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.950\nSo let's take a look at those.\n\n315\n00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:57.710\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust hit OK right now for full control for\n\n316\n00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.770\nthat manager's group for\nour top secret folder.\n\n317\n00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:05.480\nBut it's just bringing me back one window,\nand within this particular window,\n\n318\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.360\ndown at the bottom, let me move this,\nokay, you guys can see that.\n\n319\n00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.460\nThere is an option to go ahead and\ntake a look at advanced permissions.\n\n320\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.340\nSo this will give us access\nto additional options here.\n\n321\n00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.490\nLet me see where is that?\n\n322\n00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:28.110\nIf I click on my managers and,\nshoot I've got to think about.\n\n323\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.370\nIt used to be right here on this page,\nbut there's an edit.\n\n324\n00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.090\nSo now you have one more step.\n\n325\n00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.810\nSo you go ahead and hit edit here.\n\n326\n00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:41.380\nAnd this is the page with the basic\npermissions that we just saw.\n\n327\n00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.560\nOne more step here.\n\n328\n00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.000\nIt's like buried on in there now.\n\n329\n00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.030\nLet me just zoom in so you guys can\nsee that Show advanced permissions.\n\n330\n00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.750\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nclick there, all right.\n\n331\n00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.440\nAnd that kinda just toggled back to show\nbasic permissions if you wanted to back on\n\n332\n00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.420\nout of there.\n\n333\n00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:05.760\nNow this is a little menu here of more\noptions, more granular options for you.\n\n334\n00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.070\nSo full control,\nthat's where we're currently living.\n\n335\n00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.910\nThat's where we had set those permissions\nfor this folder for that manager's group.\n\n336\n00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.690\nBut if you wanted to really go down and\n\n337\n00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:21.560\ndrill down through that then\nyou could pick and choose here.\n\n338\n00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:27.020\nI don't really have any good reason as\nto why you would want to use these.\n\n339\n00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:31.860\nTo be honest, I think it's more of\na headache, because by default,\n\n340\n00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.040\njust looking at that object, I wouldn't\nknow that Mike had went in here.\n\n341\n00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:41.150\nUnless he was diligent and\nclearly documented it and\n\n342\n00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.230\nstated that in his documentation.\n\n343\n00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:48.560\nMaybe I only allowed Cherokee to\nbe able to take ownership of this\n\n344\n00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.730\nparticular folder something like that but\njust at first glance I wouldn't know so\n\n345\n00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.640\nI try to steer away from these.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's not too often I mean you can\n\n346\n00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.650\nkind of see what they do there what was\na single permission on the basics settings\n\n347\n00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:04.660\nlike read in the advance permissions\nbecomes four different permissions.\n\n348\n00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:09.260\nRead becomes read data, read attributes,\nread extended attributes and\n\n349\n00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.790\nread permissions.\n\n350\n00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.800\nWhen you assign read,\n\n351\n00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.520\nyou're really assigning all four of\nthose sub permissions, if you will.\n\n352\n00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.760\nHow often do you need to give somebody\nread data but not read attributes?\n\n353\n00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.070\nIt doesn't happen that often.\n\n354\n00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.600\nIt's good to know they're there for\nthe exam, but\n\n355\n00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.380\ntypically the standard permissions\nare more than enough to control access.\n\n356\n00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I mean,\n\n357\n00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.980\neven this option here, only apply these\npermissions to objects and/or containers\n\n358\n00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:37.510\nwithin this container\n&gt;&gt; Usually folders are a low enough level\n\n359\n00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:41.830\nwhere we can organize as a logical unit\nand say, okay, everything in this folder.\n\n360\n00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:47.050\nYou know we can also set permissions\non an individual file level.\n\n361\n00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.720\nBut just know that this option is here.\n\n362\n00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.570\nAnd that's what they would be talking\nabout if they had asked you about advanced\n\n363\n00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.380\npermissions or special permissions.\n\n364\n00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.750\nYou can see here they\ncolumn advanced on that\n\n365\n00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.690\nprevious screen they call them special.\n\n366\n00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:07.630\nSo either way same thing.\n&gt;&gt; That's how if you uncheck like one of\n\n367\n00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:12.090\nthose reads and then apply those changes.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n368\n00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.906\n&gt;&gt; And then go back out to the main,\n\n369\n00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:15.851\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n370\n00:21:15.851 --> 00:21:22.118\n&gt;&gt; Tackle the properties, the managers.\n\n371\n00:21:22.118 --> 00:21:23.370\nNow, you should be able\nto see that special.\n\n372\n00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.260\n&gt;&gt; All the little.\n\n373\n00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.890\n&gt;&gt; Because they can't put a checkmark next\n\n374\n00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.690\nto read anymore because you\ndon't have read, right.\n\n375\n00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.490\nYou took away one of those\nfour sub-permissions.\n\n376\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.160\nSo now it's just,\n&gt;&gt; It's incomplete,\n\n377\n00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:32.835\nMike.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n378\n00:21:32.835 --> 00:21:33.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But.\n\n379\n00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:34.970\n&gt;&gt; And it doesn't tell you what\n\n380\n00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:38.290\nthe special permissions are, it just\nsays there are special permissions.\n\n381\n00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:38.900\n&gt;&gt; And that's what I'm saying-\n\n382\n00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.470\n&gt;&gt; Then you have to go here.\n\n383\n00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.160\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't know what Mike had assigned\n\n384\n00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.330\nunless I went and\ndrilled down through there.\n\n385\n00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.870\nBut also,\nnote that this is gray right here.\n\n386\n00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:53.050\nSo this is a clue that I'm not\nable to change the permissions\n\n387\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:57.050\nright here within this window for\nthat particular special permission.\n\n388\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.970\nI have to go to that Advanced tab.\n\n389\n00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.640\nSo gray, just understanding\nthe difference between gray and\n\n390\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.800\nblack, hey I can't edit the black, and\ngray I need to do something additional.\n\n391\n00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.580\nWhen we're looking at our\ninherited permissions there.\n\n392\n00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.220\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n393\n00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.610\n&gt;&gt; All right so\n\n394\n00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.590\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ncancel out of that, but\n\n395\n00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:19.680\nspeaking about inherited permissions\nlet's take a look at those.\n\n396\n00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.190\nI have a diagram for\n\n397\n00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:25.010\nus to take a little peak at.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n398\n00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.420\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n399\n00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.880\nSo this.\n&gt;&gt; I love visuals.\n\n400\n00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.290\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I am definetely a visual\n\n401\n00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:33.052\nlearner so hopefully this kind of\nhelps explain that trickle down or\n\n402\n00:22:33.052 --> 00:22:37.470\npropagation type effect that\nwe see with inheritence.\n\n403\n00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.120\nSo they were just working with explicit\n\n404\n00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.660\npermissions meaning I was assigning\nthem we were doing that together right?\n\n405\n00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:48.680\nBut what if I had assigned\nthose permissions to\n\n406\n00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.610\nthat top secret folder and\nthen started creating sub folders, right?\n\n407\n00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:57.880\nSo all those subordinate\nobjects would be inheriting\n\n408\n00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.690\npermissions from that parent object.\n\n409\n00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.700\nSo here that parent would\nbe our show notes folder.\n\n410\n00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:09.730\nAnd if I did not go in and\nmodify the permissions for\n\n411\n00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.180\nthese individual child objects\nthey would go ahead and\n\n412\n00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.710\ninherit the permissions for\nthat parent if that makes sense.\n\n413\n00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:24.210\nAnd there's something else right\nhere I wanted to just bring this to\n\n414\n00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:29.130\nlight as well,\nwe were working with a manager's group.\n\n415\n00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:34.430\nSo from an Active Directory standpoint\nI can go ahead and create users, and\n\n416\n00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:41.510\nhave a more modular assignment\nof my network resources.\n\n417\n00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:45.105\nSo in this example, I have a robot.\n\n418\n00:23:45.105 --> 00:23:46.970\nMr. Robot by the way.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n419\n00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.485\n&gt;&gt; And I have two groups.\n\n420\n00:23:48.485 --> 00:23:51.027\nI have a techs group and a mangers groups.\n\n421\n00:23:51.027 --> 00:23:55.034\nSo these were two different security\ngroups I may have in Active Directory.\n\n422\n00:23:55.034 --> 00:24:01.180\nAnd if Mr. Robot was assigned,\nhe was a member of the tech group.\n\n423\n00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:05.910\nAnd the tech group aced that access\ncontrol entry that we were just working\n\n424\n00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:12.895\nwith in the GUI had only been\nassigned read only permissions.\n\n425\n00:24:12.895 --> 00:24:17.415\nBut Mr Robot was also a member\nof the Manager's Group and\n\n426\n00:24:17.415 --> 00:24:20.305\nManager's Group were given full control.\n\n427\n00:24:20.305 --> 00:24:24.685\nYou can see how these permissions\nare cumulative meaning they overlap,\n\n428\n00:24:24.685 --> 00:24:26.575\nthey build on top of each other.\n\n429\n00:24:26.575 --> 00:24:31.880\nSo Mr. Robot, in this situation,\nwould have full control\n\n430\n00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:37.100\nover the object in question for\nthat particular one.\n\n431\n00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.010\nBut let's take a look at that, and\n\n432\n00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:43.520\nI know I might be getting a little ahead\nof ourselves here, but bear with me.\n\n433\n00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.140\nWe're gonna be covering shared permissions\nand I just kinda wanna throw another\n\n434\n00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:52.710\nsimilar scenario at you for\noverlapping type of permissions there.\n\n435\n00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:58.090\nSo let's say over on my left hand side,\n\n436\n00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:01.210\nthese were my NTFS permissions.\n\n437\n00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:06.367\nAnd then over here, It's Ctrl+V.\n\n438\n00:25:06.367 --> 00:25:07.650\nI didn't copy that.\n\n439\n00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.529\nI have my share permissions all right?\n\n440\n00:25:17.782 --> 00:25:21.070\nI guess I'll go ahead and\nwrite it so we know.\n\n441\n00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.420\nSo NTFS permissions and share permission.\n\n442\n00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.947\nAnd, we'll get rid of our groups.\n\n443\n00:25:25.947 --> 00:25:27.880\nGroups are out of the equation.\n\n444\n00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:33.910\nIf I assign a particular permission,\nlet's just stick with this,\n\n445\n00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:36.820\nfull control for my share permission.\n\n446\n00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:41.580\nAnd I also have an NTF\npermission that is read only.\n\n447\n00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:45.870\nWhen we combined those two,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n448\n00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:51.329\nBecause Mr Robot would\nnot have full control\n\n449\n00:25:51.329 --> 00:25:57.384\nif we ever get in a debate\nwith Share versus NTFS.\n\n450\n00:25:57.384 --> 00:26:02.719\nThen that's going to go ahead and\nRule went out to the most restrictive,\n\n451\n00:26:02.719 --> 00:26:05.615\nso it's a little bit different there.\n\n452\n00:26:05.615 --> 00:26:11.760\nAnd let me just see send to back and let's\nsee if we can change this to read only.\n\n453\n00:26:12.762 --> 00:26:18.640\nSo I know we haven't covered\nshare permissions yet,\n\n454\n00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:22.580\nbut just to give you an understanding and\nyou guys can come back and\n\n455\n00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.890\nlook at this and be like that's\nwhat she was talking about there.\n\n456\n00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:28.805\nSo you understand the differences,\nthe way sometimes permission overlap.\n\n457\n00:26:28.805 --> 00:26:31.795\nAnd as a matter of fact,\nMicrosoft does recommend just\n\n458\n00:26:33.635 --> 00:26:36.065\nsticking with NTFS permissions.\n\n459\n00:26:36.065 --> 00:26:40.095\nThey work, they've been around for a long\ntime, so that's what we'll look at there.\n\n460\n00:26:40.095 --> 00:26:40.915\n&gt;&gt; That's been a tough one for\n\n461\n00:26:40.915 --> 00:26:43.390\nme just being in this for a little while.\n\n462\n00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:47.020\nNot using my share permissions, and\njust basically everyone full control,\n\n463\n00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.790\nbut that is the recommendation.\n&gt;&gt; It is a recommendation, yep.\n\n464\n00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.710\nLet's take a look at our TopSecret folder.\n\n465\n00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.490\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate a new folder,\n\n466\n00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.820\nlet's say this is called\nour inside folder.\n\n467\n00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:08.130\nAnd then, inside the inside folder,\nwe can create something like text.\n\n468\n00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:14.090\nSo, we'll go ahead and create a text\ndocument, and we'll call this Inside Text.\n\n469\n00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.880\nNow, let's take a look at the permissions,\nthe properties,\n\n470\n00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.820\nassociated with this\nparticular Text Document.\n\n471\n00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.710\nAnd we'll go down to our managers as well.\n\n472\n00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:30.760\nLook, I did end up saving\nthose special permissions\n\n473\n00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.450\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n474\n00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:32.830\n&gt;&gt; I didn't want to but we did.\n\n475\n00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.080\n&gt;&gt; Ruined your whole demo.\n\n476\n00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.599\n&gt;&gt; I know Mike, dang it.\n\n477\n00:27:35.599 --> 00:27:40.185\nAll right, it's okay, what I really wanted\nto show you here was essentially that\n\n478\n00:27:40.185 --> 00:27:43.851\nthese grey check boxes,\nthis is what we've been talking about.\n\n479\n00:27:43.851 --> 00:27:48.930\nSo we did not assign explicit\npermissions to this text file,\n\n480\n00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:54.820\nthis object, but they have been\ninherited from their parent object.\n\n481\n00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.470\nSo, in this case,\n\n482\n00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:02.210\nthe object that was receiving those\nexplicit still was that top secret folder.\n\n483\n00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:04.630\nSo what can I do about that?\n\n484\n00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:13.497\nWell, let's back up one level here,\nAnd we'll look at the inside folder.\n\n485\n00:28:13.497 --> 00:28:17.085\nAll right, same thing, we're gonna go\ninto Properties and check those out.\n\n486\n00:28:17.085 --> 00:28:23.345\nShould be the same because it's part\nof that sub tree for that propagation.\n\n487\n00:28:23.345 --> 00:28:28.025\nWe're gonna stick with our manager's\naccess control entry there and\n\n488\n00:28:28.025 --> 00:28:29.740\ntake a look at that.\n\n489\n00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:35.000\nAgain, you can see that this is the same,\nwe're gonna go ahead and hit Edit.\n\n490\n00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.740\nAnd then, oops, not for this one.\n\n491\n00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.810\nWe'll go into our Advanced.\n\n492\n00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:45.950\nWe do have to take a look at that\nwhenever we want to break inheritance.\n\n493\n00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:49.090\nAnd that's what we have\nthe option to do here, Mike.\n\n494\n00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:54.110\nWe have to break inheritance in order\nto be able to start working with and\n\n495\n00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:59.000\nchanging those permissions if we want\nto utilize explicit permissions on\n\n496\n00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.530\nthis case it would be the inside folder.\n\n497\n00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:05.450\nSo let's zoom in a little bit.\n\n498\n00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.045\nI do want you to pay attention\nto this check box down here,\n\n499\n00:29:08.045 --> 00:29:09.335\ncould we go full screen for a moment.\n\n500\n00:29:09.335 --> 00:29:13.595\nIt says Replace all child\nobject permission entries\n\n501\n00:29:13.595 --> 00:29:17.175\nwith inheritable permission\nentries from this object.\n\n502\n00:29:17.175 --> 00:29:22.025\nSo, essentially instead of just modifying\nthe permissions associated with this\n\n503\n00:29:22.025 --> 00:29:25.600\ncontainer, this inside folder.\n\n504\n00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:30.560\nWhat we would be affecting\nwould be like the inside\n\n505\n00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.030\ntext document here,\nif I were to go ahead and check this.\n\n506\n00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:38.500\nHowever, leave it uncheck for now,\nbut just know everything you do with\n\n507\n00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:45.280\ninheritance, can potentially, adversely\naffect others in your organizations.\n\n508\n00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.840\nSo, you need to be extremely cognizant of\nthere's not really a whoops button with\n\n509\n00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.725\npermissions, so just be aware of that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No just phone calls from\n\n510\n00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:54.380\nthe users.\n\n511\n00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.160\nWhy can't I access this darn thing?\n&gt;&gt; Mike, what are you doing?\n\n512\n00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.170\nCherokee, what are you doing?\n\n513\n00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:03.440\nYeah, you know it's kind of interesting,\nif you look at this column right here.\n\n514\n00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.000\nAnd when you go into that advance tab we\ncan get some good information from this\n\n515\n00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.600\nsection.\n\n516\n00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.650\nFor instance, this column will show\nme where those explicit permissions\n\n517\n00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:17.310\nare actually transpiring or where I\nam inheriting those permissions from.\n\n518\n00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.580\nLet's go ahead and disable inheritance for\nthis particular group there.\n\n519\n00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.820\nNow a couple options that\nI have available to me.\n\n520\n00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:32.540\nI can go ahead and convert, change those\ninherited permissions into explicit, so\n\n521\n00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.370\nI can modify them.\n\n522\n00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:37.590\nSecond option would be a clean slate,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n523\n00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.860\nremove all inherited\npermissions from this object.\n\n524\n00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.290\nSo, if you have that little check box\nticked, the one that we had just looked\n\n525\n00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:48.840\nat, everything, all the permissions\nwould be wiped out from that,\n\n526\n00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.860\nyou know previous, any kind of subordinate\nobjects if I can spit my words out.\n\n527\n00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.779\nBut yeah, you know that's pretty severe\nwhen you think about it in the grand\n\n528\n00:30:56.779 --> 00:30:57.963\nschemes of things.\n&gt;&gt; It is,\n\n529\n00:30:57.963 --> 00:31:01.364\none of the things that I've run into,\nI've done it myself,\n\n530\n00:31:01.364 --> 00:31:05.762\nthat's easy to forget is when you\nchoose to remove all permissions.\n\n531\n00:31:05.762 --> 00:31:09.272\nIt's removing all permissions,\nthat includes system, administrators,\n\n532\n00:31:09.272 --> 00:31:11.810\nit's easy to break things\nwhen you start removing those\n\n533\n00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:12.662\ngroups.\n&gt;&gt;

Good call Mike.\n\n540\n00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.290\n&gt;&gt; But there are times when you need to\n\n541\n00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:32.088\nremove them all, maybe.\n\n542\n00:31:32.088 --> 00:31:33.917\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n543\n00:31:33.917 --> 00:31:35.530\nbetter to be safe than sorry, right?\n\n544\n00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.940\nA couple of other things\nbefore we wrap up here,\n\n545\n00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:42.800\nlet's take a look at this\nlittle section right here.\n\n546\n00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.923\nSpeaking about having that full\ncontrol and being able to.\n\n547\n00:31:45.923 --> 00:31:50.723\nCurrently I'm the owner because I created\nthis folder but if I had given full\n\n548\n00:31:50.723 --> 00:31:55.611\ncontrol permissions to Mike, he would\nalso have the ability to come in here.\n\n549\n00:31:55.611 --> 00:32:00.532\nAnd select this and then he would\nbe able to go ahead and oops,\n\n550\n00:32:00.532 --> 00:32:04.696\nI didn't,\nlet me just hit Discard changes there.\n\n551\n00:32:04.696 --> 00:32:06.275\nOops, hold on.\n\n552\n00:32:08.929 --> 00:32:13.868\nThis is another good thing I'm not sure\nwho I'm logged in as on this computer.\n\n553\n00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:21.392\nLet me go ahead in and login as\nadministrator here and asking me for that.\n\n554\n00:32:21.392 --> 00:32:26.464\nAll right, so that Mike,\nif you were trying to be malicious and\n\n555\n00:32:26.464 --> 00:32:32.897\ngetting into things that he shouldn't be,\nI to go into Active Directory here.\n\n556\n00:32:32.897 --> 00:32:35.127\nMike is an Active Directory object.\n\n557\n00:32:35.127 --> 00:32:40.770\nI could go in and say, okay, let's go\nahead and assign, check for Mike, add him,\n\n558\n00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:46.271\nand then notice now, Mike is the owner\nhere, so that's what we're looking at.\n\n559\n00:32:46.271 --> 00:32:49.760\nAgain, pay attention to the check boxes,\ntiny but\n\n560\n00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.834\nsevere.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n561\n00:32:50.834 --> 00:32:51.473\n&gt;&gt; Looking at that.\n\n562\n00:32:51.473 --> 00:32:55.660\nAuditing, when we were talking\nabout those acronyms and\n\n563\n00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:59.333\nterms at the beginning of the show,\nwe said SACL.\n\n564\n00:32:59.333 --> 00:33:03.494\nSo SACL for our ability to go ahead and\n\n565\n00:33:03.494 --> 00:33:07.262\nallow the system to Add, right?\n\n566\n00:33:07.262 --> 00:33:10.787\nDifferent types of logging features or\ncapabilities so\n\n567\n00:33:10.787 --> 00:33:13.712\nthat I could monitor if\nMike were to go ahead and\n\n568\n00:33:13.712 --> 00:33:17.693\naccess a particular object within\nmy network or system there.\n\n569\n00:33:17.693 --> 00:33:20.167\nBut we'll hit Cancel for now.\n\n570\n00:33:20.167 --> 00:33:25.977\nThis one's a good tab to know,\nbecause I have the ability to go ahead,\n\n571\n00:33:25.977 --> 00:33:32.392\nand really good for those help desk,\nsorry I don't mean to zoom in like that.\n\n572\n00:33:32.392 --> 00:33:36.270\nBut good for those help desk\ncalls when you're trying to\n\n573\n00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:41.066\nsee if someone is complaining about\nnot having access to a resource.\n\n574\n00:33:41.066 --> 00:33:47.997\nThis screen doesn't tell you what group\nthat that individual member is a part of.\n\n575\n00:33:47.997 --> 00:33:51.021\nBut you can go ahead and select, so\n\n576\n00:33:51.021 --> 00:33:54.974\nI could and we'll pick on Mike again.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n577\n00:33:54.974 --> 00:33:56.446\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think I don't even know\n\n578\n00:33:56.446 --> 00:33:58.016\nhow many, we'll just say Mike, okay?\n\n579\n00:33:58.016 --> 00:34:01.580\nWell, he is the owner, we know that,\nbut we'll use him as an example.\n\n580\n00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:06.327\nI can also select a group,\nas well as a device down here,\n\n581\n00:34:06.327 --> 00:34:11.077\nto look at the permissions for\nthis particular object.\n\n582\n00:34:11.077 --> 00:34:13.831\nAnd so keep that in mind,\nlike we were talking about before,\n\n583\n00:34:13.831 --> 00:34:16.545\nthose security principles can\nalso be groups and devices.\n\n584\n00:34:16.545 --> 00:34:21.494\nIf you knew their group membership,\nyou could go ahead and\n\n585\n00:34:21.494 --> 00:34:25.637\nadd it, but we'll just go ahead and\nsay OK here.\n\n586\n00:34:25.637 --> 00:34:27.761\nOops, I didn't even look at that.\n\n587\n00:34:27.761 --> 00:34:29.827\nHold on, give me one more second.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n588\n00:34:29.827 --> 00:34:30.535\n&gt;&gt; Let me get back into\n\n589\n00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:33.896\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n590\n00:34:33.896 --> 00:34:35.864\nthis can be really handy if\nshe gets that set up again.\n\n591\n00:34:35.864 --> 00:34:38.864\nBecause when you're\ntroubleshooting those permissions,\n\n592\n00:34:38.864 --> 00:34:41.752\nyou need to try to see what\npermission does this user have.\n\n593\n00:34:41.752 --> 00:34:45.468\nAnd without this I'd have to look in\nActive Directory, I'd have to determine\n\n594\n00:34:45.468 --> 00:34:48.870\nwhat groups the user belongs to,\nit belongs to five different groups.\n\n595\n00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.738\nI've got to add up all\nof those permissions.\n\n596\n00:34:50.738 --> 00:34:55.190\nRemember that our NTFS permissions\nare cumulative, you've got to consider any\n\n597\n00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.862\ndenies and all of that fun stuff.\n&gt;&gt; My brain hurts just thinking about all\n\n598\n00:34:58.862 --> 00:34:59.909\nof that Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n599\n00:34:59.909 --> 00:35:02.269\nwatch how easy Cherokee is gonna make\nit to figure out what positions.\n\n600\n00:35:02.269 --> 00:35:03.270\n&gt;&gt; If I click the right button,\n\n601\n00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:04.680\nthat's the key, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n602\n00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.768\nit's crucial.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n603\n00:35:05.768 --> 00:35:09.234\nit's actually just view effective\naccess that'll would go ahead and\n\n604\n00:35:09.234 --> 00:35:10.535\ndo the work for you there.\n\n605\n00:35:10.535 --> 00:35:13.926\nIf I zoom out and scroll down,\nwe can see what we're looking at.\n\n606\n00:35:13.926 --> 00:35:19.197\nAnd so we kind of cheated, we knew\nthat Mike had full control of this.\n\n607\n00:35:19.197 --> 00:35:24.333\nBut the green check is going to\nindicate that that type of permission\n\n608\n00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:29.392\nis applicable to his current status\nwith this particular object.\n\n609\n00:35:29.392 --> 00:35:33.835\nAnd also the little double\nhead there is indicating\n\n610\n00:35:33.835 --> 00:35:37.878\nthat he is receiving\nthat access from a group.\n\n611\n00:35:37.878 --> 00:35:40.003\nAnd again, it doesn't tell you what group,\njust from a group.\n\n612\n00:35:40.003 --> 00:35:45.270\nInstead of a single-headed person,\nwhere he was individually getting that\n\n613\n00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:50.463\npermission, and also if he were denied\naccess for that type of permission.\n\n614\n00:35:50.463 --> 00:35:52.727\nIt would just be a red check there.\n\n615\n00:35:54.632 --> 00:35:56.200\nYeah, so I think that's about it.\n\n616\n00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.427\nI know that it's a lot when we're\nlooking at our NTFS permissions.\n\n617\n00:35:59.427 --> 00:36:02.191\nBut again, it's important to understand,\n\n618\n00:36:02.191 --> 00:36:06.861\nbecause this is a pretty big part of a\nSys Admins or even just at the help desk.\n\n619\n00:36:06.861 --> 00:36:08.022\nYou're getting those calls.\n\n620\n00:36:08.022 --> 00:36:10.461\nAnd you wanna go through\nthat process of elimination.\n\n621\n00:36:10.461 --> 00:36:12.882\nAnd make sure it's not a software issue or\n\n622\n00:36:12.882 --> 00:36:16.340\npermission issue before you jump\nto a the Internet is down or\n\n623\n00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.145\nour network is broken type thing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n624\n00:36:19.145 --> 00:36:20.330\n&gt;&gt; So just keep that in mind.\n\n625\n00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:21.623\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\n\n626\n00:36:21.623 --> 00:36:24.475\ngreat look there at working\nwith NTFS permissions.\n\n627\n00:36:24.475 --> 00:36:27.339\nTalking about explicit and inherited and\n\n628\n00:36:27.339 --> 00:36:31.603\nhow we can manipulate those\ncontrol access to our resources.\n\n629\n00:36:31.603 --> 00:36:33.042\nSo we appreciate that.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n630\n00:36:33.042 --> 00:36:34.123\n&gt;&gt; I hope everybody out there enjoyed\n\n631\n00:36:34.123 --> 00:36:34.761\nwatching this one.\n\n632\n00:36:34.761 --> 00:36:37.710\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n633\n00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:38.696\n&gt;&gt;

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:17.010\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.435\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10, preparing for\n\n8\n00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:23.088\nthat 70-690 exam.\n\n9\n00:00:23.088 --> 00:00:26.930\nIn this episode, we're actually gonna\nbe looking at file and folder sharing.\n\n10\n00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.550\nAnd here to show us the way is none\nother than Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.030\nWelcome, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me, Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.697\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great and I'm excited,\n\n13\n00:00:32.697 --> 00:00:34.943\nwe get to learn how to share things\nwith our friends and co-workers.\n\n14\n00:00:34.943 --> 00:00:36.566\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right.\n\n15\n00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.129\nSharing is caring, Mike.\n\n16\n00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.554\nWe learned that in kindergarten hopefully,\n\n17\n00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:41.275\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully.\n\n18\n00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:43.320\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully.\n\n19\n00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.070\nThat is correct,\n\n20\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.970\nwe are gonna continue taking a look\nat different types of permissions.\n\n21\n00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.730\nIn the last show, we did speak upon NTFS\npermissions that were gonna be exclusive\n\n22\n00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.550\nto NTFS file systems.\n\n23\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.690\nIn this show, I wanna go ahead and\nbuild on that, and\n\n24\n00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.010\nwe'll take a look at share permissions.\n\n25\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.630\nAnd if we can take a look at my screen,\n\n26\n00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.370\nI think that may help kind of\njust visualize this concept here.\n\n27\n00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.020\nSo here I have a file server, and\n\n28\n00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.775\nI have some documents, some central\naccess for end users to go ahead and,\n\n29\n00:01:18.775 --> 00:01:23.860\nwell, access network resources,\nsuch as this TeamDocs folder.\n\n30\n00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.700\nSo who are some people that\nmight wanna access that?\n\n31\n00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.420\nWell, here we have Mike and\nI also have Cherokee.\n\n32\n00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.745\n&gt;&gt; A much thinner version of Mike.\n\n33\n00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:31.781\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n34\n00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:36.120\nthese are super detailed\nportraits as well here, so.\n\n35\n00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.120\nSo maybe Mike is on his laptop and\nhe is going across the wire or wireless,\n\n36\n00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.930\nbut he's going across the network to go\nahead and access this TeamDocs folder.\n\n37\n00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.740\nSo what happens?\n\n38\n00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.380\nIn the last show we looked at those\nNTFS permissions and we were assigning\n\n39\n00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.280\npermissions to Mike, so we gave him\nfull control over a few things.\n\n40\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.260\nI don't even remember.\n\n41\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.860\nBut in this situation, NTFS permissions\n\n42\n00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.700\nwould apply to that resource\nthat Mike was trying to access.\n\n43\n00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.780\nSo NTFS permissions have been\nset on this TeamDocs folder and\n\n44\n00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.280\nit really should already define how\nMike should have access, right?\n\n45\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.800\nWell, what about for Cherokee?\n\n46\n00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.610\nSame thing applies here, and\n\n47\n00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.921\nI am talking about myself in third person.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n48\n00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:24.088\n&gt;&gt; I don't want to do that.\n\n49\n00:02:24.088 --> 00:02:29.223\nBut [LAUGH] here I am, and\nI also have NTFS permissions\n\n50\n00:02:29.223 --> 00:02:34.359\nthat apply to the Access Control List,\nor the DACL,\n\n51\n00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.700\nhere for this particular TeamDocs folder.\n\n52\n00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.620\nNow we are introducing something\ncalled share permissions.\n\n53\n00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.260\nShare permissions are going\nto be applicable only when\n\n54\n00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.870\nthat resource is accessed via the network,\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.240\nSo NTFS permissions\nare always going to exist.\n\n56\n00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.540\nShare permissions only exist when that\nresource is accessed over the network.\n\n57\n00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.464\nSo if Mike or I were to go ahead and\nlog in to that file server directly,\n\n58\n00:03:07.464 --> 00:03:12.370\nthen those share permissions\nwould be nonexistent, and\n\n59\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.378\nonly those NTFS permissions\nwould be dictating the access\n\n60\n00:03:17.378 --> 00:03:22.386\nto a particular resource that\nwas stored on FileSrv01,\n\n61\n00:03:22.386 --> 00:03:26.401\nif that makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; So NTFS permissions are always checked,\n\n62\n00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:28.870\nno matter how you access the resource.\n\n63\n00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.349\nShare permissions are only checked\nwhen you access it as a share.\n\n64\n00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.320\nA UNC path, across a mapped drive.\n&gt;&gt; Mapped drive, exactly.\n\n65\n00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.380\n&gt;&gt; Going across the network.\n\n66\n00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n67\n00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.820\nAnd what if maybe we have two\ndifferent sets of permissions?\n\n68\n00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.930\nAnd we kind of alluded to\nthis in that last show, or\n\n69\n00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.040\nthe show where we were\nlooking at NTFS permissions.\n\n70\n00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.890\nWhat if my NTFS permissions\nare laid back and\n\n71\n00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.500\nmy share permissions\nare pretty restrictive?\n\n72\n00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.740\nSo I can do a lot with my NTFS,\nbut not so much with my share.\n\n73\n00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.920\nSo maybe I have read only for\nmy share permissions, but\n\n74\n00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.840\nmy NTFS permissions are full control.\n\n75\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.670\nWell, looking at that, there's a conflict\nthere, right, so what happens?\n\n76\n00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.340\nWell, when you look at those two,\nthink about the most restrictive, and\n\n77\n00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.330\nin this particular situation, well, we\nwould only be able to go ahead and read.\n\n78\n00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.070\nBecause we do have that, that's the lowest\npermission there, so that's the most\n\n79\n00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.480\nrestrictive and that's gonna win\nout in that particular situation.\n\n80\n00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.070\nNow, there's also another concept I\nwanted to just kind of mention it,\n\n81\n00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.040\nwe're not gonna spend a ton of time on it,\n\n82\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.110\njust be familiar with this term it’s\ncalled, Access Based Enumeration.\n\n83\n00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.180\nAnd that's what I have here on the screen.\n\n84\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.962\nSo while we were looking at that\nideology of that shared folder,\n\n85\n00:04:50.962 --> 00:04:56.111\nlet's say here we have,\nMike has his own shared folder.\n\n86\n00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:02.133\nThat's a child object to a TeamShare and\nI have my own folder.\n\n87\n00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:06.919\nBut in reality, do I really need\nto see Mike's document if there,\n\n88\n00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.759\nI don't access and work in them?\n\n89\n00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.180\nIf we think about that principle of least\nprivilege, I need to perform my job,\n\n90\n00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.580\nMike needs to perform his, right?\n\n91\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.380\nSo access based enumeration is\ngong to limit the files and\n\n92\n00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.200\nfolders, the resources that a user\ncan use based upon their permissions.\n\n93\n00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.760\nSo when the contents of TeamShare,\n\n94\n00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.840\nwhen the system is starting to enumerate\nor list out all of these objects,\n\n95\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.000\nit's checking up against that access\ncontrol list, that ACL, to say,\n\n96\n00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.910\nokay, if it's Cherokee accessing this\nTeamShare, again in [LAUGH] third person,\n\n97\n00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.370\nwhat should she be able to see?\n\n98\n00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.440\nAnd so all of those components, when\nwe're enumerating those or the system is\n\n99\n00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.340\nenumerating, it will only render the ones,\nmaybe if there are 50 components in\n\n100\n00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.450\nthis TeamShare, I had access to five of\nthem, I would only see those five objects.\n\n101\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.750\nAnd that's what access-based enumeration\nis, something enabled on the server side.\n\n102\n00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.430\nI want you to be familiar with it.\n\n103\n00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.900\nThat's only gonna be an option\nwith our share permissions.\n\n104\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.362\nWe're not talking NTFS here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a great feature,\n\n105\n00:06:15.362 --> 00:06:16.595\nI think it came out in 2008.\n\n106\n00:06:16.595 --> 00:06:20.839\nAnd it really simplifies things for our\nusers, and it makes it a little bit more\n\n107\n00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.340\nsecure because if I go into a folder and\nthere's several documents in there, as you\n\n108\n00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.803\nsaid, I'm only gonna see the documents\nthat I have at least read permission for.\n\n109\n00:06:29.803 --> 00:06:33.460\nI have to have some kinda permission,\nNTFS permission, over the resource.\n\n110\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.120\nAnd the idea is, if I don't have\nany permissions over a document,\n\n111\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.960\nwhy even show the document in a list?\n\n112\n00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.032\nBecause it's temptation, it makes me wanna\nclick on it, or try to get access to it,\n\n113\n00:06:42.032 --> 00:06:43.893\nor ask questions,\nhow come I don't have access and\n\n114\n00:06:43.893 --> 00:06:46.488\nyou do?\n&gt;&gt; it's like challenge accepted, yeah, I'm\n\n115\n00:06:46.488 --> 00:06:49.610\ngonna try to break into this or something.\n&gt;&gt; In this way, it's like, hey,\n\n116\n00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.090\ndon't even show it to them if they\ndon't have any permissions over it And\n\n117\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.130\nit turns out to be a pretty good system.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n118\n00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.470\nit's definitely not any kind of encryption\nor security feature in that aspect, but\n\n119\n00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:06.990\nit definitely does add to the overall\nsecurity of your environment.\n\n120\n00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.740\nThe only thing I will say\nis in some situations if\n\n121\n00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.780\nperformance is already an issue for you,\nthe computations associated with that\n\n122\n00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.700\nenumeration in comparison on\nthe permissions may slow down,\n\n123\n00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.690\nespecially if you have a lot of\nobjects that have to be checked for\n\n124\n00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.490\none particular folder per se.\n\n125\n00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.836\nSo you just wanna think\nabout that as well.\n\n126\n00:07:30.836 --> 00:07:32.840\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ncreate a folder.\n\n127\n00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.190\nSo let's just label this as maybe,\n\n128\n00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.817\nwe'll say corp docs, for\nour corporate documents there.\n\n129\n00:07:42.937 --> 00:07:46.171\nAnd if I right-click on top of it,\nI can go ahead and\n\n130\n00:07:46.171 --> 00:07:48.816\nselect Share With from this Action Menu.\n\n131\n00:07:48.816 --> 00:07:52.098\nAnd now, we're not sharing currently,\nso I'm gonna go ahead and ignore that.\n\n132\n00:07:52.098 --> 00:07:57.161\nI'm going to select Specific people here,\nbut before I do, I wanna hop on over to\n\n133\n00:07:57.161 --> 00:08:02.280\nanother machine because this particular\nmachine is already joined to a domain.\n\n134\n00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.000\nAnd I kinda wanna give you a sense\nof what that would look like for\n\n135\n00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.070\na machine that wasn't joined to a domain.\n\n136\n00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:11.930\nSo let's just see here, if I go ahead and\ndo that same action, maybe\n\n137\n00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:18.277\non this computer's C drive, on the root\nhere and we'll create let's say,\n\n138\n00:08:18.277 --> 00:08:23.140\nCoDocs2, all right,\n\n139\n00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:29.320\nsame function but\nhere I wanna point something out.\n\n140\n00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.480\nIt doesn't say share,\nit actually says give access to.\n\n141\n00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.790\nSo just a slight little difference there\nthat they do want you to be aware of and\n\n142\n00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.170\nI do have a couple of other options here.\n\n143\n00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:44.320\nI have a whole group of view and\nthen I also have the option to\n\n144\n00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.660\ngive access to a home group with not\nonly the view but also edit as well.\n\n145\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.530\nAnd then this is the one option that\nwe had from the other computer.\n\n146\n00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:58.250\nBut I just wanted to show you\nslight different verbiage and\n\n147\n00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:05.630\nways we can access it, looking at domain\nverses work group status, all right.\n\n148\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.250\nSo going back to the other machine,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n149\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.910\ntake a look at how we would go ahead and\nshare with a specific person.\n\n150\n00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.270\nSo when I click on that particular\noption I have a wizard pop up and\n\n151\n00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:25.090\nhere I wanna go ahead and I'm logged\nin as myself as you can see that.\n\n152\n00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:30.350\nCurrently I'm the owner and I wanna go\nahead and share this folder with Mike.\n\n153\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.870\nSo we'll go ahead and\nFind Mike, we'll hit add and\n\n154\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.650\ntake a look at the options\navailable to us here.\n\n155\n00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:44.650\nSo currently, by default, it's just giving\nMike the option to go ahead and read.\n\n156\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:49.265\nSo if I use this arrow and\ndrop down here, I can also use\n\n157\n00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:53.930\nRead/Write, as well and then I have\nthe option to go ahead and remove.\n\n158\n00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:00.100\nI'm gonna go ahead and just leave it\nat read for now and we'll hit Share.\n\n159\n00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.760\nNow I need to authenticate, because\nI'm not logged in as an admin here.\n\n160\n00:10:10.736 --> 00:10:12.130\nI can spell that correctly and all right.\n\n161\n00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.490\nI see the UNC path and\nthis is going to be explaining,\n\n162\n00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.260\nor the name of, this local machine.\n\n163\n00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.286\nSo \\\\CLIENT01, this is our folder,\n\n164\n00:10:27.286 --> 00:10:30.767\nso it's \\CorpDocs there.\n\n165\n00:10:30.767 --> 00:10:36.875\nNow If Mike all ready knew the location\nand I said hey and he knew the name of\n\n166\n00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:40.970\nmy machine and he knew exactly where I put\nthat folder, then he would be good to go.\n\n167\n00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:45.499\nAnd he could just type that into his run\nline or in file explorer and go ahead and\n\n168\n00:10:45.499 --> 00:10:47.460\naccess that document or folder.\n\n169\n00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.580\nHowever, if you didn't know where it was,\nI do have the ability to go ahead and\n\n170\n00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.620\nemail a link and also to copy and\n\n171\n00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:01.480\npaste that link into another\nprogram maybe notepad or something.\n\n172\n00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.780\nEmail makes sense, but\njust know you do have those options there.\n\n173\n00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.620\nAlright, now did we add any\nNTFS permissions to that share?\n\n174\n00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.147\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n175\n00:11:12.147 --> 00:11:12.963\n&gt;&gt; No, okay,\n\n176\n00:11:12.963 --> 00:11:15.998\nI just wanna make sure [LAUGH] no,\nwe did not.\n\n177\n00:11:15.998 --> 00:11:19.860\nSo in a previous show, Mike,\nwe spoke about NTFS permissions, right?\n\n178\n00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.830\nSo when we go through this\nprocess well what happens?\n\n179\n00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.730\nSo the operating system is going\nto choose what happens there.\n\n180\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.300\nSo if I right-click on this same folder\nthat we were just working with and\n\n181\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.748\nselect properties.\n\n182\n00:11:31.748 --> 00:11:36.200\nI just wanna go back to that security\ntab so we can see the behaviour there,\n\n183\n00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.140\nbecause we did talk about how that\nrelationship works with our NTFS and\n\n184\n00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.070\nour share permissions together.\n\n185\n00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.310\nSo if I go ahead and select Mike, because\nwe're comparing apples to apples here.\n\n186\n00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.700\nWe were just looking\nthe share permissions,\n\n187\n00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.550\nwe had given Mike only read for\nthat particular folder.\n\n188\n00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:00.218\nBut let's zoom in here,\nlooking at Read &amp; execute,\n\n189\n00:12:00.218 --> 00:12:05.129\nList folder contents and\nRead is what NTFS permissions were\n\n190\n00:12:05.129 --> 00:12:09.760\ngenerated by default, so\njust kind of be aware of that.\n\n191\n00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.500\nAnd that's the other thing, Microsoft\nreally recommends choosing one or\n\n192\n00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.479\nthe other there when you're\nlooking at this permissions.\n\n193\n00:12:16.479 --> 00:12:17.755\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty cool though that,\n\n194\n00:12:17.755 --> 00:12:18.650\nthat wizard would do that.\n\n195\n00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:24.160\nCuz as a typical end user, I might not\nunderstand that, I wanna share this out,\n\n196\n00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.850\nbut I also have to assign NTFS permissions\nto make sure they have access,\n\n197\n00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.070\ncuz remember, those are always checked.\n\n198\n00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.280\nYour end user probably doesn't\nreally know how or what to do there.\n\n199\n00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.300\nIn this simple sharing wizard,\nWindows says, all right, I see that you've\n\n200\n00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:43.090\ntried to share this out and you've given a\ncertain person or group these permissions.\n\n201\n00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.030\nWe'll go ahead an assign the NTFS\npermissions in the background for you\n\n202\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.838\n&gt;&gt; you don't have to think about it.\n\n203\n00:12:46.838 --> 00:12:47.581\n&gt;&gt; that are appropriate and\n\n204\n00:12:47.581 --> 00:12:48.860\nyeah we don't even have to worry about it.\n\n205\n00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.830\nI can just call up my coworker and\nsay, hey I shared this out and\n\n206\n00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.700\nmade this available, you should be able\nto access it, they can look at me and\n\n207\n00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.354\nbe like, how did you do that,\nare you magic, no, Its the wizard.\n\n208\n00:12:57.354 --> 00:12:59.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Magic Mike for\n\n209\n00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.910\nyou there\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n210\n00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.600\n&gt;&gt; Another really easy way though\n\n211\n00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.460\nis if you just right click on it and\nlet's go ahead and\n\n212\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.995\ncreate a new folder here,\nwe're gonna have so\n\n213\n00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:10.140\nmany different crazy test folders.\n&gt;&gt; Four.\n\n214\n00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.120\n&gt;&gt; I know right?\n\n215\n00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.750\nSo CorpDocs, what were we, 3,\n\n216\n00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.810\nwe don't wanna get that confused with\nthe other one, we were working with there.\n\n217\n00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:21.750\nSo, instead of just right-clicking and\nselecting to share from this action menu,\n\n218\n00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.510\nyou can also go under properties and\n\n219\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:29.230\nthen, there's that sharing tab that, we've\nseen this before, you guys might have,\n\n220\n00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.820\nif you watched the other show\nby interface permissions, but\n\n221\n00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.970\nwe also have the option to go ahead and\nshare their as well.\n\n222\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.210\nIf go ahead and select this,\nclickable button, well,\n\n223\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.720\nlooks pretty similar to what we just saw,\nright?\n\n224\n00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.780\nSo, nothing too crazy there, same thing,\n\n225\n00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.930\nhowever, I do also have the option\nto go into advanced sharing,\n\n226\n00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:58.890\nso let's take a look at that.\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, I know\n\n227\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:03.330\nyou should be getting a UAC dialog every\ntime you create these shares, is that\n\n228\n00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.961\na permission required to create shares?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you do have to have\n\n229\n00:14:06.961 --> 00:14:11.484\nadministrative credentials because if you\nthink about this you could potentially be\n\n230\n00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:15.650\ndealing with sensitive information or\nsomething, so just keep that in mind.\n\n231\n00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:19.142\nI do have the option to go ahead and\nshare this folder out now,\n\n232\n00:14:19.142 --> 00:14:21.070\nlet me zoom in a little bit for us.\n\n233\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:30.330\nNow, the folder name was CorpDocs3,\nbut what if I wanted to go ahead and\n\n234\n00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.900\nshare this with, I don't know,\nmaybe my Florida people.\n\n235\n00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.110\nAnd they were lazy and\n\n236\n00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:41.060\nthey didn't like typing long UNC\npaths to access their documents.\n\n237\n00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.260\nWell, I could go ahead and use some\nkind of abbreviation, nickname, or\n\n238\n00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.240\nsomething shortened.\n\n239\n00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.760\nSomething easy to understand for\nmy end users there, so that's an option.\n\n240\n00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.680\nI could also set the number\nof simultaneous users, it's\n\n241\n00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:01.920\nnot a licensing issue per se,\nbut maybe you only have X amount\n\n242\n00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.320\nof people in your office and you wanna\nmake sure that you don't have unauthorized\n\n243\n00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.220\npeople logged in looking at this.\n&gt;&gt; Performance if I share something\n\n244\n00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.300\nout from my laptop and\nit's really popular all my co\n\n245\n00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.940\nworkers really wanna look at this\ndocument and I've got 30, 40,\n\n246\n00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:21.950\n50 people connecting to my laptop trying\nto access that share at the same time.\n\n247\n00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.021\nMy network bandwidth is gonna get used up.\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n248\n00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:25.146\n&gt;&gt; And potentially,\n\n249\n00:15:25.146 --> 00:15:27.050\nmy computer could become slow.\n\n250\n00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.260\nSo, this is just a way to kinda\nlimit how many people are hitting it\n\n251\n00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.687\nat the same time.\n&gt;&gt; I like it, Mike,\n\n252\n00:15:32.687 --> 00:15:33.832\nall right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n253\n00:15:33.832 --> 00:15:35.321\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n254\n00:15:35.321 --> 00:15:37.080\nhit Cancel for right now.\n\n255\n00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.420\nI do wanna show you, yet again another\nway to go ahead and create a share.\n\n256\n00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.940\nSo, for right now we'll just go ahead and\nI'm going to type in,\n\n257\n00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:51.717\ncomputer management, which will bring up\na little bit of a different view here for\n\n258\n00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:57.017\nus, we can get some additional\ninformation, Just give it a second there.\n\n259\n00:15:57.017 --> 00:16:01.553\nSo under my Computer Management\nsnap-in console here, my MMC,\n\n260\n00:16:01.553 --> 00:16:07.000\non the left-hand side, I do have my\nShared Folders options over on that side.\n\n261\n00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.110\nSo if I select on Shares,\nhere in this center,\n\n262\n00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:16.290\nI can see the Shares that are currently\non this particular system.\n\n263\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:20.970\nSo I have a couple demo ones,\nI have a volume that is shared out.\n\n264\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.550\nYou can also share printers.\n\n265\n00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.710\nSo we'll take a look at\nthat in some later shows.\n\n266\n00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:29.626\nBut you can also create shares\nfrom right here as well.\n\n267\n00:16:29.626 --> 00:16:34.700\nAnd right-click and\nyou can say New Share, or\n\n268\n00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.290\nyou could even select New and then Share.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n269\n00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.850\n&gt;&gt; So either way.\n\n270\n00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.510\n&gt;&gt; Does that count as two methods or one?\n\n271\n00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.620\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n272\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.488\nwhat do you think?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n273\n00:16:44.488 --> 00:16:45.802\n&gt;&gt; Just giving you different\n\n274\n00:16:45.802 --> 00:16:46.640\noptions there.\n\n275\n00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.830\nI think that's about it for\nthe GUI for now.\n\n276\n00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:55.330\nThey have might more ways in the future,\nI don't know, but\n\n277\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.349\njust knowing you have those options there.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n278\n00:16:58.349 --> 00:16:59.360\n&gt;&gt; PowerShell,\n\n279\n00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.890\nthat's the way of the future here.\n\n280\n00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.950\nSo let's see,\ndo we have PowerShell pulled up?\n\n281\n00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.170\nI thought I did, but it's okay if not.\n\n282\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.383\nAnd again, instead of getting that UAC,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n283\n00:17:09.383 --> 00:17:12.860\njust run as the administrator now and\ntype those credentials in.\n\n284\n00:17:16.936 --> 00:17:19.890\nI said instead of, but\nwe are still gonna get that.\n\n285\n00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.060\nJust make sure you\nare running as administrator.\n\n286\n00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.502\nNow, we do have SMB.\n\n287\n00:17:25.502 --> 00:17:29.786\nSo remember Server Message Block is the\nunderpinning technology that will allow us\n\n288\n00:17:29.786 --> 00:17:32.910\nto go ahead and utilize and\nshare across our network.\n\n289\n00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:37.872\nSo if we wanted to go ahead and\ndo a Get-Help,\n\n290\n00:17:37.872 --> 00:17:43.230\nhence maybe if I did SMB, and\nutilize my asterisks here.\n\n291\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:51.920\nI could go ahead and scrub the Help\nsection for cmdlets associated with SMB.\n\n292\n00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.560\nThere are quite a bit.\n\n293\n00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:58.510\nI'm just gonna show you guys the basics\nhere, but you can get pretty in depth\n\n294\n00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.670\nwith the things that the configurations\nassociated with your shares.\n\n295\n00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.683\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nclear my screen for now.\n\n296\n00:18:05.683 --> 00:18:08.340\nI just wanted to show you all\nof the different possibilities.\n\n297\n00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.030\n&gt;&gt; That's quite a few.\n\n298\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.830\n&gt;&gt; I know, all right, so\n\n299\n00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:15.690\nwhat we're gonna go ahead and\ndo is create a new share.\n\n300\n00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:20.800\nNow if at first you don't have a folder,\nwe already have some folders.\n\n301\n00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.200\nAnd I could go head and share them out.\n\n302\n00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.080\nBut since we're here,\n\n303\n00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.720\nI thought let's go head and create actual\nfolder while we're in PowerShell as well.\n\n304\n00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.730\nSo we'll say New-Item and\nwe'll specify the path and\n\n305\n00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.500\nwe've been working in our C drive here.\n\n306\n00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.840\nAnd [COUGH] okay, I will always do that.\n\n307\n00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.893\nI try to wait for my Tab to go through,\nand I get impatient and type it out.\n\n308\n00:18:42.893 --> 00:18:47.811\nAll right, so I'm gonna say -Path C:\\ and\n\n309\n00:18:47.811 --> 00:18:53.304\njeez, CorpDocs4, I think we're at.\n&gt;&gt; How about Reports?\n\n310\n00:18:53.304 --> 00:18:54.600\n&gt;&gt; Reports, I like it, Mike.\n\n311\n00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.460\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's just give it a second\n\n312\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.544\nhere to let the system think about it.\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to find it,\n\n313\n00:19:01.544 --> 00:19:02.215\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right.\n\n314\n00:19:04.086 --> 00:19:07.450\nAll right, so Reports is gonna\nbe the name of that folder.\n\n315\n00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.770\nAnd we need to specify the -ItemType.\n\n316\n00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:13.740\nSo we'll go ahead and\nsay that this is a container\n\n317\n00:19:18.718 --> 00:19:23.563\nAll right, and just to show you\nguys that it is in fact there,\n\n318\n00:19:23.563 --> 00:19:29.120\nthis is that Reports folder that\nMike had suggested that we create.\n\n319\n00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.430\nSo we'll go ahead and\ngo back into PowerShell here and\n\n320\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:36.750\nactually create a share associated\nwith that Reports folder.\n\n321\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:41.150\nSo now,\nthe syntax is going to be New-SmbShare.\n\n322\n00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.100\nWe'll go ahead and\nTab through on that one.\n\n323\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.409\nAnd we still need to specify the path.\n\n324\n00:19:46.409 --> 00:19:47.905\nSo it knows exactly, oops.\n\n325\n00:19:47.905 --> 00:19:51.778\nSpace -Path, and again.\n\n326\n00:19:53.214 --> 00:19:55.799\nGoodness, C:\\.\n\n327\n00:19:55.799 --> 00:20:02.154\nIt's one of those days, Mike, I tell you.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh,\n\n328\n00:20:02.154 --> 00:20:04.827\nkeyboard malfunction that made them.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's like a, yeah,\n\n329\n00:20:04.827 --> 00:20:09.090\nbrain-to-finger error,\nthat's what's happening here.\n\n330\n00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.898\nSo this is going to be our Reports folder.\n\n331\n00:20:12.898 --> 00:20:18.980\nAll right, and for that,\nI think that was it for us and be share.\n\n332\n00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.293\nNow like I said, oops, and\nI am missing the name here.\n\n333\n00:20:23.293 --> 00:20:28.742\nI was gonna say I'm keeping the minimum\nfor our required parameters,\n\n334\n00:20:28.742 --> 00:20:32.340\nbut then I forgot one required parameter.\n\n335\n00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.880\nAnd that's gonna be the name.\n\n336\n00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.260\nYou could keep it the same if you\nwanted to just call it reports.\n\n337\n00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.350\nBut like in that previous\nshare we created,\n\n338\n00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.500\nwe abbreviated with FL for Florida.\n\n339\n00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.916\nSo here, I could do that also.\n\n340\n00:20:45.916 --> 00:20:51.270\nWe don't wanna create the same\nabbreviation, but we'll just say maybe\n\n341\n00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:57.690\nReports, or Rep for short if we\nwanted to be really lazy there.\n\n342\n00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:02.780\nNow if I wanted to see the different\nshares on this system,\n\n343\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:09.862\nI could go ahead and type get-Smb, Oops,\n\n344\n00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:16.924\nI think it's Get-SmbShare but\nit could just be share.\n\n345\n00:21:16.924 --> 00:21:20.221\nOkay, for some reason I was\nbeing impatient again and\n\n346\n00:21:20.221 --> 00:21:22.066\ndidn't want to tab through.\n\n347\n00:21:22.066 --> 00:21:26.160\nNow, these are gonna be the different\nshares that we've created.\n\n348\n00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.100\nSo this should be familiar\nto you with that CorpDocs.\n\n349\n00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:35.510\nThis is the one we had just created there,\nthe Reports share.\n\n350\n00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:40.403\nAnd I think the last thing that I wanted\nto show you here would be the option to go\n\n351\n00:21:40.403 --> 00:21:42.680\nahead and delete or remove a share.\n\n352\n00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.023\nJust so you're familiar\nwith the most common syntax\n\n353\n00:21:47.023 --> 00:21:49.720\nfunctions here in PowerShell.\n\n354\n00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.940\nSo we'll go ahead and say, actually let me\nclear my screens, so we get some space.\n\n355\n00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.188\nAnd we'll go ahead and say remove, oops.\n\n356\n00:22:02.307 --> 00:22:05.347\nRemove-SmbShare.\n\n357\n00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:12.160\nAnd I do need to specify the name, and\nso I'll say name and you know what?\n\n358\n00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.710\nSince we gave it a nickname,\nwe can actually utilize that nickname and\n\n359\n00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:18.540\nwe'll just say Rep.\n\n360\n00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.710\nAnd we do need to specify if we don't\nwanna get that confirmation there.\n\n361\n00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:31.900\nSo we'll just say Confirm:$False\nto go ahead and push that through.\n\n362\n00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.870\nAnd if we were to, again,\njust go back and do Get-SmbShare,\n\n363\n00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:43.275\nwe can see that that Reports share\nis in fact gone, missing from there.\n\n364\n00:22:44.285 --> 00:22:47.335\nAnd I think that's just about it for\nthe basics of shares.\n\n365\n00:22:47.335 --> 00:22:48.515\n&gt;&gt; Did it remove the folder or\n\n366\n00:22:48.515 --> 00:22:50.065\njust the share?\n&gt;&gt; Just the share.\n\n367\n00:22:50.065 --> 00:22:52.565\nSo if we go ahead and minimize that,\n\n368\n00:22:52.565 --> 00:22:56.635\nwe can still see that our Reports\nfolder is still in existence.\n\n369\n00:22:56.635 --> 00:22:59.405\nSo we wouldn't have lost any data there.\n&gt;&gt; We just didn't want it\n\n370\n00:22:59.405 --> 00:23:02.175\navailable to the network anymore so\nwe can just remove that share.\n\n371\n00:23:02.175 --> 00:23:03.850\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n\n372\n00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:04.490\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\n\n373\n00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:08.040\nI know you've got a little more to go when\nit comes to sharing, but great start so\n\n374\n00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.140\nfar.\n\n375\n00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.480\nUnfortunately, we're out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n376\n00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.690\nSo you have to come back and\nwatch part two to catch the rest.\n\n377\n00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.930\nBut for now, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n378\n00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:17.650\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n379\n00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:25.450\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n380\n00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:25.960\n[MUSIC]\n\n381\n00:23:25.960 -->

00:00:08.039\n[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.511\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.980\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.010\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.630\nToday we're installing and figuring\nWindows 10 preparing for that 70-698 exam.\n\n7\n00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.640\nIn this episode, we're continuing on\ntalking about configuring file and\n\n8\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.910\nfolder access.\n\n9\n00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.090\nAnd back in the studios is none\nother than Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.930\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.680\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.590\nYeah, that's right, we are back in studios\nto take a look at yet some more sharing.\n\n13\n00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.080\nI know we've spent quite a lot\nof time in that last episode.\n\n14\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.800\nIf you haven't seen that,\ndefinitely check that out.\n\n15\n00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.280\nBut I wanted to also\n\n16\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.410\nmention one other way that we could\nshare here in the command line.\n\n17\n00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.780\nAnd then, we're gonna take a look at some\nother technologies that Microsoft uses, or\n\n18\n00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.500\ndifferent ways that we can share files and\nfolders and give access.\n\n19\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.520\nSo let's take a look at my screen.\n\n20\n00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.730\nThe first one, like I said,\nit's super simple.\n\n21\n00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.800\nWe're just gonna go ahead and I have\nan administrative command prompt here.\n\n22\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.190\nI'm gonna type in shrpubw.exe to go\nahead and launch your sharing wizard.\n\n23\n00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.050\nNow, this will ask you for\nsome of those basic\n\n24\n00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.060\ndetails that you need to know whenever\nyou're sharing, such as the location.\n\n25\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.560\nAnd nothing major here, so\npretty straightforward.\n\n26\n00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.020\nWe're gonna go ahead and browse to\nthe folder that we do want to share.\n\n27\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.120\nAnd I think I've created one called Sales.\n\n28\n00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.380\nSo maybe if I wanna go ahead and\n\n29\n00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.560\nshare out some sales documents then\nwe could go ahead and do that here.\n\n30\n00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.570\nWe'll hit OK.\nAnd just Next on through this.\n\n31\n00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.880\nSo like I said, pretty straightforward.\n\n32\n00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.640\nAnd you might wanna provide a description\nand a production environment.\n\n33\n00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.330\nI'm gonna skip that for now.\n\n34\n00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.330\nAlso, remember,\n\n35\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.920\nwe did talk about different ways that\nyou could change that share name?\n\n36\n00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.410\nSo if your actual folder name were\nsomething a little more complicated,\n\n37\n00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.240\nyou might want to make that more\nuser-centric or user-friendly as well.\n\n38\n00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.020\nYeah, looking at the permissions here,\n\n39\n00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.460\nwe have the ability to go ahead and\nset that accordingly.\n\n40\n00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.656\nBut we'll just keep it for\nread only access just for this demo.\n\n41\n00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:15.680\nWe're not really gonna be\nputting anything in there.\n\n42\n00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.193\nJust wanted to go ahead and\nshow you that as well.\n\n43\n00:02:19.193 --> 00:02:23.273\nAll right, close out of the command\nprompt because the next\n\n44\n00:02:23.273 --> 00:02:27.924\nthing I want to show you is something\nthat's actually integrated,\n\n45\n00:02:27.924 --> 00:02:32.290\nbuilt into our directory\nstructure here within Windows 10.\n\n46\n00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.060\nSo let's drill down to our route here.\n\n47\n00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.860\nFor me, it's gonna be on my C:,\ndrive and under the users folder.\n\n48\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.140\nRight, so this is where those\nprofiles are stored for\n\n49\n00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.780\nindividuals, users who log\nonto this physical machine.\n\n50\n00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.350\nNotice this public folder.\n\n51\n00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.090\nThis is not something that I've created.\n\n52\n00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.330\nThe operating system puts this here as\na means of sharing files or subfolders.\n\n53\n00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.650\nThey create a subfolder structure,\nas you can see here already.\n\n54\n00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.270\nDocuments, downloads,\nmusic, pictures, videos.\n\n55\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.580\nSo this is going to be one way\nwhere I could go ahead and\n\n56\n00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.610\nshare information to other users\nwho log on to this machine locally.\n\n57\n00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.250\nAll right, so we could go ahead, and\nmaybe we'll just create one for now.\n\n58\n00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.190\nWe'll create a text document there.\n\n59\n00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.730\nAnd we'll just label it WIN10\nbecause I'm on a Windows 10 machine.\n\n60\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.150\nThis machine, we're going to take\na look at this in another way.\n\n61\n00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.320\nWhere other machines can access this\nfolder as well, and it doesn't necessarily\n\n62\n00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.300\nhave to be a Windows 10, and\nI want to keep them straight for now.\n\n63\n00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.900\nBut just know, specifically,\n\n64\n00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.460\nthis file now that we've created in\nthis public folder, under our public\n\n65\n00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.390\nDocuments folder, is not accessible to\nothers that log on to this local machine.\n\n66\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.360\nSo if I were to go ahead and log out as\nthis user, Mike comes over here, logs and\n\n67\n00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.510\nask himself with his own credentials, and\n\n68\n00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.490\ndrills down to the same location, he would\nstill be able to access that folder, too.\n\n69\n00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.090\n&gt;&gt; That's a really cool way to\nshare files on a shared PC where\n\n70\n00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.040\nmore than one person uses that, you just\ndrop them in that public folder system.\n\n71\n00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.900\nAnd you don't have to\nconfigure permissions,\n\n72\n00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.990\nrun a sharing wizard, anything.\n\n73\n00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.980\nIt's just available to anybody\nthat logs on to that machine.\n\n74\n00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n75\n00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.500\nIt's all ready for me.\n\n76\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.510\nIt's there so people,\nsuper easy way to go ahead and share.\n\n77\n00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.437\nHowever, if Microsoft were to\nask you is this turned on or\n\n78\n00:04:34.437 --> 00:04:39.376\nenabled by default,\npublic folders, you would say no.\n\n79\n00:04:39.376 --> 00:04:41.400\nAnd you're like well, why,\nthat doesn't make sense.\n\n80\n00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.480\nBut in their defense, it's not being\nutilized to its full extent here.\n\n81\n00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.558\nSo if we go into Control Panel,\n\n82\n00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.560\nFrom Control Panel, we're gonna\ndrill down to Network and Iinternet.\n\n83\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.392\nOnce we get in there, we'll continue to\ngo into our Network and Sharing center.\n\n84\n00:05:01.392 --> 00:05:03.650\nDouble-click that.\n\n85\n00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.800\nAnd even further, on our left-hand side,\n\n86\n00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.100\nwe have the ability to change\nadvanced sharing settings.\n\n87\n00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.123\nSo that's where we ultimately wanna be.\n\n88\n00:05:14.928 --> 00:05:20.540\nNow, I'm currently set to be on a public\nnetwork in this lab environment.\n\n89\n00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.510\nYou might want to keep that in mind\nwhenever you're setting up sharing of\n\n90\n00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.560\nfolders.\n\n91\n00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.180\nIf you are in a legitimate public\nnetwork such as an internet cafe,\n\n92\n00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.120\ndo they still have those?\n\n93\n00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.785\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n94\n00:05:31.785 --> 00:05:32.875\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n95\n00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:35.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Coffee shop, airport,\n\n96\n00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.560\nwhatever you get the point, yeah.\n\n97\n00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.550\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; Typically we don't want to share\n\n98\n00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.760\nthings with complete strangers on\na public network like that, but\n\n99\n00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.580\nin this lab environment,\nwe're using that public network.\n\n100\n00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.810\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n101\n00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.060\nAll right, so now, I told you guys\nit was down pretty far in here.\n\n102\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.600\nIt is all the way at the bottom.\n\n103\n00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.320\nAs a matter of fact, if you see this\nportion here, it says All Networks.\n\n104\n00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.430\nTo the right of that,\nthere's a drop-down arrow.\n\n105\n00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.850\nThat's where we really wanna go.\n\n106\n00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.340\nSo let's go ahead and expand that out.\n\n107\n00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.400\nSo this is the portion right here,\nwhere it says\n\n108\n00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.240\nthat it is turned off or\nnot enabled by default.\n\n109\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.090\nSo what we wanna do to allow users on\nmy network to access this particular\n\n110\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.040\ndocument that we've created would be to\ngo ahead and say hey, turn on sharing so\n\n111\n00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.410\nanyone with network access can read and\nwrite files in the public folders.\n\n112\n00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.310\nSo that's what we want to do here.\n\n113\n00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.100\nYou do want to make sure\nthat you go ahead and\n\n114\n00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.600\nsave your changes down here at\nthe bottom right-hand corner.\n\n115\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.550\nSo we'll hit Save.\n\n116\n00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.320\nLet's minimize this machine and\nsimulate going over to a,\n\n117\n00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.290\nlet's see, a Windows 8 machine.\n\n118\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:47.570\nNot Windows 7.\n\n119\n00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.200\nI'm in practice labs, guys.\n\n120\n00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.760\nIf you wanted to,\nthis is my Windows 8 machine.\n\n121\n00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.130\nIf you wanted to follow along and\ndo this lab,\n\n122\n00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.030\nthe only thing I did to modify\nthis preexisting lab here,\n\n123\n00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.030\nwas to remove the computers,\nthese two computers, off the domain.\n\n124\n00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.051\nSo in the lab environment by\ndefault they're set up under their\n\n125\n00:07:08.051 --> 00:07:09.195\nPractice Labs domain.\n\n126\n00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:13.433\nBut I wanted to show you, so\nit would be kind of pointless in\n\n127\n00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:18.032\nmy opinion to have this sharing\ncapability inside of a domain.\n\n128\n00:07:18.032 --> 00:07:23.402\nBecause if you're already using a domain\nand you're using Active Directory,\n\n129\n00:07:23.402 --> 00:07:28.372\nand that's a lot more powerful,\na lot more features, a lot more security\n\n130\n00:07:28.372 --> 00:07:33.280\noptions that you have available to\nyou than something simple like this.\n\n131\n00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.610\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n132\n00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is still my Windows 10\nmachine, I thought we were getting there.\n\n133\n00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.180\nLet me see if I have it pulled up.\n\n134\n00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.510\nThere it is.\n\n135\n00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:47.067\nOkay, so inside, again,\nwe are going to be going to\n\n136\n00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:52.141\nthe same place here under\nControl Panel to make sure that we\n\n137\n00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:57.340\nhave the same settings to have\nour public folders enabled.\n\n138\n00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:03.000\nSo under, again, Network and Internet,\nwe're gonna go under Network and\n\n139\n00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.459\nSharing Center And here, advanced sharing.\n\n140\n00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:08.280\nAnd now we'll go ahead and turn that on.\n\n141\n00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.440\nAt the very bottom here.\n\n142\n00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.410\nAgain, don't forget to go ahead and\nsave those changes.\n\n143\n00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.880\nAnd let's pull up our file explorer.\n\n144\n00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:30.070\nOn our C drive, we'll go ahead and\ndrop a new file, excuse me.\n\n145\n00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:36.379\nSo under Public, Public Documents,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n146\n00:08:36.379 --> 00:08:41.587\ncreate a Win 8.1.0, or\n8.0.1, I should say,\n\n147\n00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:46.050\nI don't remember what\nthey named this machine.\n\n148\n00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.730\nWas it one zero?\n\n149\n00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.110\nI think so.\n\n150\n00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.826\nWe'll find out.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n151\n00:08:50.826 --> 00:08:53.070\n&gt;&gt; Yup, all right.\n\n152\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:58.670\nOkay, so I have two separate documents and\nwe'll just go ahead and\n\n153\n00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:03.090\nin our explore navigation bar.\n\n154\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.440\nWe'll go ahead and type our UNC path.\n\n155\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.020\nWe wanna use a similar syntax.\n\n156\n00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.360\nAlternatively, you could use the run line\nhere and it'll get you to the same place.\n\n157\n00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.070\nBut what we wanna do is type\nthe name of the machine.\n\n158\n00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.713\nSo if I knew the name of Mike's machine\nand I wanted to go ahead and access a file\n\n159\n00:09:19.713 --> 00:09:24.500\nthat he had shared and we were both\nworking and collaborating on that.\n\n160\n00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.300\nI would go ahead and type in back slash\nback slash, the name of Mike's computer,\n\n161\n00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.766\nwhich in this situation let's just\nsay his computer was PLABWIN10,\n\n162\n00:09:33.766 --> 00:09:36.805\nall right and\nwe'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n163\n00:09:36.805 --> 00:09:39.665\nEntered.\nSo that'll essentially bring us to Mike's\n\n164\n00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:43.325\ncomputer that shares that information\nthat he's sharing with us.\n\n165\n00:09:43.325 --> 00:09:46.975\nAnd, as a matter of fact, you guys\ncan already see this sales folder,\n\n166\n00:09:46.975 --> 00:09:47.880\nthat's that first share.\n\n167\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.040\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That we created with that wizard.\n\n168\n00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:49.905\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n169\n00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:51.535\n&gt;&gt; At the beginning of the show.\n\n170\n00:09:51.535 --> 00:09:54.395\nBut where I want you to\nturn your attention will be\n\n171\n00:09:54.395 --> 00:09:55.745\nto this user's folder and\n\n172\n00:09:55.745 --> 00:10:00.020\nthis is the one that we've been talking\nabout with our public folders here.\n\n173\n00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:05.470\nSo we'll go down to that public folder,\ninside of our public documents and\n\n174\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.550\nso here on our Windows 8 machine, we're\nactually seeing that document from our\n\n175\n00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.660\nWindows 10 machine where it was\ngenerated or created there.\n\n176\n00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.390\n&gt;&gt; Nice, so now I can easily share\nfiles with my coworkers on the network,\n\n177\n00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.000\nI just drop them in there and\ndon't have to worry setting permissions or\n\n178\n00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.480\nsharing or anything like that.\n\n179\n00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.192\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's another easy way\nto go ahead and share some files.\n\n180\n00:10:25.192 --> 00:10:27.526\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, so what's next Cherokee.\n\n181\n00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:31.335\n&gt;&gt; So i think we'll go ahead and take a\nlook at home groups because that's another\n\n182\n00:10:31.335 --> 00:10:33.310\neasy way that we can share information.\n\n183\n00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:40.125\nHowever, you might wanna be sharing this,\nwell, like it says, in a home environment.\n\n184\n00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:43.120\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Computers that are part of a domain\n\n185\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.790\ncannot generate or start a home group.\n\n186\n00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.280\nSo you have to have someone initiate that.\n\n187\n00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.410\nSo, someone on your network\nhas to create a home group.\n\n188\n00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.530\nAnd then other computers\nwithin your a home or\n\n189\n00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:00.940\nyour local are network there can\ngo ahead and join your homegroup.\n\n190\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.770\nAnd then it's a very easy\nway where we can pick and\n\n191\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:08.370\nchoose what files we wanna go ahead and\nshare to that homegroup.\n\n192\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.330\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n193\n00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n194\n00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.439\nLet me just minimize here for\nmy Windows 8 machine,\n\n195\n00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:16.850\nbring back up that Windows 10 machine.\n\n196\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:22.830\nAnd we'll go ahead and work with that.\n\n197\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.590\nSo, I'm just gonna go ahead and do a.\n\n198\n00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.680\nActually, I'll show you where\nto go in control panel.\n\n199\n00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.970\nAnd, again you can also\nuse a search there,\n\n200\n00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.930\nbut it's going to be under your\nnetwork and Internet section here.\n\n201\n00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:41.930\nAnd this is the icon it's kind\nof like maybe this [LAUGH] and\n\n202\n00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.990\nthis is crazy but\nI'm just kind of guessing.\n\n203\n00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.430\nMaybe this green bubble is like the\ncomputer that starts the home group and\n\n204\n00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:51.140\nthe little blue bubbles are the computers\nthat join the home group.\n\n205\n00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.455\n&gt;&gt; You see that.\n\n206\n00:11:52.455 --> 00:11:54.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\nwe'll just set it up, how about that?\n\n207\n00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.800\nAll right, so go ahead and click there.\n\n208\n00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:03.930\nAnd, I get this notification, if you\nrecall, we've already touched on this,\n\n209\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:09.810\nabout hey, look, we're working on a public\nnetwork here in this lab environment.\n\n210\n00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:13.060\nWhen I'm setting up my home group,\nthe operating system recognizes that and\n\n211\n00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.850\nit says, we're not gonna be able to do\nthat here, so what you need to do first\n\n212\n00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.910\nto create and join a home group is change\nyour networks location to private.\n\n213\n00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.580\nSo, it's really nice that they do have\nthis option here for us to go ahead and\n\n214\n00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.100\nchange that network location.\n\n215\n00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.120\nYou get this fly out option here,\nright there.\n\n216\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.790\nWhen you see [INAUDIBLE] asks if\nyou wanna go ahead and change that.\n\n217\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.010\nAnd we can hit Yes, but for\n\n218\n00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:43.250\nwhatever reason if you don't click\non it in just the right way.\n\n219\n00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.840\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You might miss your little fly out of\n\n220\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.370\nopportunity there.\n\n221\n00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:51.850\nSo, alternatively, you could go into\nyour settings here in Windows 10.\n\n222\n00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:56.210\nOkay, give it a second.\n\n223\n00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.860\nWhat's happening,\nwhat we're seeing is some latency.\n\n224\n00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.570\nI actually have disconnected and you see\nthat here where it's saying connected\n\n225\n00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:07.130\nbecause I'm using the provided practice\nlabs that you have access to as well.\n\n226\n00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.118\nBut these labs are actually\nbased out of London, so\n\n227\n00:13:10.118 --> 00:13:14.510\nthere is a bit of network latency when\nI'm changing that network setting.\n\n228\n00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.040\nBut that's alright.\n\n229\n00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.220\nSo you could also go\nunder your settings here.\n\n230\n00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.360\nLet me try this again.\n\n231\n00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.740\nSettings, all right.\n\n232\n00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:32.070\nAnd under Network and Internet, you do\nhave the ability to change that as well.\n\n233\n00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.710\nSo, I think, let's see,\nEthernet is where I wanna go.\n\n234\n00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:40.970\nAnd then change, for this particular one,\nthis is my network, Network 5.\n\n235\n00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.950\nAnd there this is what you wanna change.\n\n236\n00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:48.600\nSo if you miss that fly out, you can turn\nthis on or off, I'm gonna leave it on so\n\n237\n00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.600\nwe don't see that disconnect again\nas that network change is made.\n\n238\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.870\nBut I just wanted to let you know\nthat that's where you would go.\n\n239\n00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.032\nAll right now that we\nare on a private network we\n\n240\n00:14:01.032 --> 00:14:05.620\ncan proceed with setting\nthis home group up.\n\n241\n00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.458\nSo it's pretty self explanatory,\npretty straight forward here,\n\n242\n00:14:09.458 --> 00:14:13.310\nit was really designed for home users,\nso it's not too difficult.\n\n243\n00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:17.660\nAnd we'll begin this wizard and\ngo ahead and launch up just letting us\n\n244\n00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:22.560\nknow exactly what I've already told\nyou about how we can share our files.\n\n245\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.340\nAlso, printers with\nother computers as well.\n\n246\n00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.970\nAnd this is a cool little feature,\n\n247\n00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.610\nalso you can stream media\nto devices on your network.\n\n248\n00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:36.090\nSo, if you have smart TV's or\nany kind of smart device,\n\n249\n00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:37.020\nmaybe a projector, or something.\n\n250\n00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.030\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Of that nature.\n\n251\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.050\nThen you could also\nstream your media there.\n\n252\n00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.460\nWe'll go ahead and hit Next.\n\n253\n00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.130\nNow, this is going to\nbe the default setting.\n\n254\n00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:52.570\nI haven't changed anything as of yet,\nor I don't even know if we will, but\n\n255\n00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:57.440\nit makes sense because we,\nI don't know how much it makes sense.\n\n256\n00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.240\nI know we've talked about this before Mike\nand you said look, at home I don't want my\n\n257\n00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.760\nkids accessing some kind of\nimportant financial documents.\n\n258\n00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.220\nBut hey, maybe they wanna watch all\nthose movies that I've purchased for\n\n259\n00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.130\nthat, right?\n\n260\n00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:15.270\nSo you can pick and choose exactly\nif you want to share or not share.\n\n261\n00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.420\nJust be aware of that\nwhenever you're dropping and\n\n262\n00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.740\norganizing your files\non your systems there.\n\n263\n00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.350\nWe'll keep the default for now.\n\n264\n00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.460\nSo it's pretty easy,\npretty straightforward, like I said.\n\n265\n00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.390\nThis is that autogenerated password.\n\n266\n00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:36.032\nYou can print the password and\nstorage for safe keeping,\n\n267\n00:15:36.032 --> 00:15:39.910\nalternatively you could\nchange the password.\n\n268\n00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.360\nSo let's go ahead and do that right here.\n\n269\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.730\nTo make it all easier for\nus to remember we'll hit change password\n\n270\n00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:51.576\nand, Actually we'll use a regular zero or.\n\n271\n00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:55.881\n[LAUGH] 123 this is not a good hygiene for\n\n272\n00:15:55.881 --> 00:16:01.300\na password but\nI'm just making it easy for the show.\n\n273\n00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.292\nWe'll hit next.\n\n274\n00:16:02.292 --> 00:16:06.611\nAnd if it's something that I'm\nsharing with my kids, hopefully,\n\n275\n00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:08.450\nno one will have access to.\n\n276\n00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.263\nAs a matter of fact, see Microsoft's\nnot super worried about the security\n\n277\n00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.805\nhere otherwise,\nthey would have put asterisks or\n\n278\n00:16:14.805 --> 00:16:19.043\nsome other kind of hidden password here,\nbecause if someone is already on your home\n\n279\n00:16:19.043 --> 00:16:22.577\nnetwork you probably have other\nthings to worry about at that point.\n\n280\n00:16:22.577 --> 00:16:24.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true, [LAUGH].\n\n281\n00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.582\n&gt;&gt; Still it's not a good practice\nto use that kind of password.\n\n282\n00:16:28.582 --> 00:16:31.663\nOkay, so we know our password, hopefully.\n\n283\n00:16:31.663 --> 00:16:35.550\nAnd that's all you really need to know\nto actually join that home group from\n\n284\n00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.870\nanother system.\n\n285\n00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.970\nSo let's minimize our windows ten machine,\nand\n\n286\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:43.002\nagain I still have that windows\neight one pulled up here somewhere.\n\n287\n00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:45.605\nIt's probably actually,\nsitting right there.\n\n288\n00:16:47.297 --> 00:16:52.520\nSo I could go ahead and pull\nControl Panel, enact this in the same way.\n\n289\n00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:57.920\nOr I could even just do a search for\nhome group, all right.\n\n290\n00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.850\nSo here I have my home group settings and\nlet me see.\n\n291\n00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.878\nThis is probably not\nexactly where I need to be.\n\n292\n00:17:06.878 --> 00:17:09.560\nGotta love our Windows 8 machine.\n\n293\n00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.367\n&gt;&gt; It's been awhile since [INAUDIBLE].\n\n294\n00:17:10.367 --> 00:17:12.007\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm like come on.\n\n295\n00:17:12.007 --> 00:17:12.927\n&gt;&gt; Haven't seen those.\n\n296\n00:17:12.927 --> 00:17:18.590\n&gt;&gt; Let me go to my comfortable control\npanel here and we'll just go the same way.\n\n297\n00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.080\nYou could do a search, but\n\n298\n00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.160\nI think you would need to also see that\nlittle, those little marbles, or whatever.\n\n299\n00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.810\nThe nodes that they were trying to\nindicate there, that would be a safer bet,\n\n300\n00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.630\nall right.\n\n301\n00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:36.130\nAnd this is where we want to go to\nthat home group and same thing here.\n\n302\n00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.280\nThis computer was set to a public.\n\n303\n00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.100\nSo we'll need to change that location.\n\n304\n00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.610\nSo we'll hit Yes.\n\n305\n00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.840\nAnd it's just asking me\nif we want other PCs and\n\n306\n00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.880\ndevices to be able to share files here.\n\n307\n00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.800\nSo we're gonna hit yes.\n\n308\n00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.944\n&gt;&gt; Wait for our network to come back.\n\n309\n00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:54.591\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll have to do that whole\nprocess of reconnecting there as well.\n\n310\n00:17:54.591 --> 00:17:55.727\nThis will just take a second.\n\n311\n00:17:55.727 --> 00:17:56.744\nYou know any good jokes, Mike?\n\n312\n00:17:56.744 --> 00:17:59.963\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No not really.\n\n313\n00:17:59.963 --> 00:18:01.673\n&gt;&gt; That's a no.\n\n314\n00:18:01.673 --> 00:18:03.195\n&gt;&gt; None that are appropriate here.\n\n315\n00:18:03.195 --> 00:18:05.222\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n316\n00:18:05.222 --> 00:18:10.790\nAll right, yeah, just give that a second\nand then really, Mike, that should be it.\n\n317\n00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:17.385\nWhatever we had shared or allowed\nthat sharing, then that would be it.\n\n318\n00:18:17.385 --> 00:18:20.444\nAll right, my button here is still grayed\nout, so something's telling me that\n\n319\n00:18:20.444 --> 00:18:22.879\nthe operating system [COUGH] is\nstill thinking about it, yeah.\n\n320\n00:18:22.879 --> 00:18:24.975\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] setting it up back there.\n\n321\n00:18:24.975 --> 00:18:25.560\nTakes a minute or two.\n\n322\n00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.007\n&gt;&gt; So we'll give it a second.\n\n323\n00:18:27.007 --> 00:18:28.466\nIt's all right, it's all good.\n\n324\n00:18:28.466 --> 00:18:29.286\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n325\n00:18:29.286 --> 00:18:29.832\n&gt;&gt; How are things going?\n\n326\n00:18:29.832 --> 00:18:31.382\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this is definitely,\n\n327\n00:18:31.382 --> 00:18:34.630\nit's a cool way to, again,\nshare on a local area network.\n\n328\n00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:39.010\nReally designed, as you said, for\nhome users that might not understand\n\n329\n00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.970\nNTFS permissions, share permissions,\nand setting all that up.\n\n330\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.450\nBut it's a little more secure\nthan just public folders,\n\n331\n00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.780\nbecause I have to have that password.\n\n332\n00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:52.142\nSo somebody that comes over, or is sitting\nout in the street, in that creepy van or\n\n333\n00:18:52.142 --> 00:18:54.050\nsomething, can't just connect.\n\n334\n00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.660\nWhereas public folders are wide open,\nright?\n\n335\n00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.730\nAnybody that has access to the network\ncan see your public folder.\n\n336\n00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:03.200\nHome group, you have to have\nthe password to be able to join\n\n337\n00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.910\nthat home group before\nyou can access anything.\n\n338\n00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.480\nSo a little bit more secure.\n\n339\n00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.691\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure and you know what?\n\n340\n00:19:08.691 --> 00:19:14.420\nAs a matter of fact, in the 18 or\nthree built for Windows 10.\n\n341\n00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.180\nThis option is not available.\n\n342\n00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.280\nSo it is-\n&gt;&gt; That's the sad part about it.\n\n343\n00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n344\n00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.590\nIt's currently still on\nthe objective list, so\n\n345\n00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.520\nthat's why we are covering it here.\n\n346\n00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.798\nBut I did just want you\nto be aware of that.\n\n347\n00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:31.228\nIf you're trying to set this up and\nyou can't find it, then try to log into\n\n348\n00:19:31.228 --> 00:19:35.168\npractice labs and see if they have\nan older copy to play around in.\n\n349\n00:19:35.168 --> 00:19:38.456\nBut eventually I think they're\nmoving away from this.\n\n350\n00:19:38.456 --> 00:19:42.150\n&gt;&gt; Azure One Drive,\nall of our Cloud solutions,\n\n351\n00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:46.232\nreally make technologies\nlike this unnecessary.\n\n352\n00:19:46.232 --> 00:19:51.070\nThey want you to start using Cloud based\nservices and it's easy enough to share.\n\n353\n00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.930\nAny device that' never hacked or\nInternet access so.\n\n354\n00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, so\nwhat's happening now?\n\n355\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.900\nLet's just give it a second.\n\n356\n00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.065\nI know we've been giving it some\ntime here, but I just backed up.\n\n357\n00:20:02.065 --> 00:20:04.680\nAnd this is important just\nto kind of point out.\n\n358\n00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.520\nIt says searching for\nhome groups on the network.\n\n359\n00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.390\nBecause if the operating\nsystem does detect that\n\n360\n00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:14.318\nthere is already a home group that\nhas been created on the network.\n\n361\n00:20:14.318 --> 00:20:17.639\nIt won't allow you to create or\ngenerate one and\n\n362\n00:20:17.639 --> 00:20:21.135\nit will allow you to go ahead and\njoin a home group.\n\n363\n00:20:21.135 --> 00:20:24.170\nBut it looks like we're\nhaving problems joining here.\n\n364\n00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.247\nLet me see.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe in this lab environment,\n\n365\n00:20:29.247 --> 00:20:30.534\nmaybe a re-boot?\n\n366\n00:20:30.534 --> 00:20:31.896\nYou know how re-boots fix everything.\n\n367\n00:20:31.896 --> 00:20:35.010\nBut we switched that profile,\nand there's lab environment, and\n\n368\n00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.522\nit might have goofed something\nup in the background.\n\n369\n00:20:37.522 --> 00:20:40.390\n&gt;&gt; Let's do that, let me just go ahead and\npause, a TV timeout.\n\n370\n00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.867\nWe'll do a re-boot,\nsince we're getting to the end,\n\n371\n00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.934\nthere's something else\nI wanna show you too.\n\n372\n00:20:44.934 --> 00:20:47.484\nOkay, so a little reboot,\nit fixes everything, right?\n\n373\n00:20:47.484 --> 00:20:48.907\n&gt;&gt; Nice, nice, I like it.\n\n374\n00:20:48.907 --> 00:20:53.774\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We can go ahead now and\nit detect that home group exists,\n\n375\n00:20:53.774 --> 00:20:56.140\nwe can hit join now.\n\n376\n00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.100\nAnd a pretty basic Wizard\nwill just next on through.\n\n377\n00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:03.720\nNow, on this screen, the system is asking\nus, okay, so you're joining this home\n\n378\n00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.450\ngroup, but what do you want to share\nas the person connecting to it.\n\n379\n00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.230\nSo I could leave the default and\nshare the same or I could pick and\n\n380\n00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.190\nchoose or share nothing, right?\n\n381\n00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.870\nWe'll just hit next, for now.\n\n382\n00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:18.950\nThis is where that super-secret\npassword comes into play.\n\n383\n00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.910\nAnd we'll hit next, and hopefully,\n\n384\n00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.600\neverything'll be good to go here, and\nwe should be joined to our home group.\n\n385\n00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.840\nAnd it says,\nyou have joined the home group, and now,\n\n386\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.615\nwe have that access to go ahead and share\nfiles of information yet another way.\n\n387\n00:21:34.615 --> 00:21:39.125\nBut what if we wanted to share something\na little bit different maybe like\n\n388\n00:21:39.125 --> 00:21:40.280\nprinters, right.\n\n389\n00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.525\nWe do have the ability to go ahead and\ngo share those.\n\n390\n00:21:42.525 --> 00:21:45.143\nSo lets take a look at that real quick.\n\n391\n00:21:45.143 --> 00:21:50.951\nI'm gonna go up to, so a couple\ndifferent ways you can go through your\n\n392\n00:21:50.951 --> 00:21:56.174\ntypical control panel option,\nalso, under your settings.\n\n393\n00:21:56.174 --> 00:22:00.766\nIt really just kind of redirects\n\n394\n00:22:00.766 --> 00:22:05.024\nyou back to the older UI here.\n\n395\n00:22:05.024 --> 00:22:08.898\nSo if you go navigate\nthrough the settings option,\n\n396\n00:22:08.898 --> 00:22:14.496\nwe'll hit add a printer or scanner and\nit'll take us back to the older UI.\n\n397\n00:22:14.496 --> 00:22:18.918\nBut first of all what's happening is\nthe system is checking for any printers or\n\n398\n00:22:18.918 --> 00:22:20.800\nscanners that are on my network.\n\n399\n00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.470\nWe'll just need to give it a second so\nthat we can manually add one,\n\n400\n00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:29.500\nbecause we really don't have any\nreal printers online network.\n\n401\n00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.177\nWe're gonna fudge it a bit here.\n\n402\n00:22:31.177 --> 00:22:32.120\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n403\n00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:40.839\n&gt;&gt; Yep [LAUGH] I am so glad we never\nhave awkward silences on our shows.\n\n404\n00:22:40.839 --> 00:22:42.239\n&gt;&gt; I know, it is great.\n\n405\n00:22:42.239 --> 00:22:43.107\nLook, there we go.\n\n406\n00:22:43.107 --> 00:22:46.201\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so now, I can say the printer\nthat I want wasn't listed.\n\n407\n00:22:46.201 --> 00:22:53.098\nWe'll go ahead and\nlaunch our Add a Printer wizard here, so.\n\n408\n00:22:53.098 --> 00:22:56.460\nI'm gonna go ahead and just add a local\nprinter with our manual settings.\n\n409\n00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.220\nWe'll hit next.\n\n410\n00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.030\nThis isn't a printer show.\n\n411\n00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.490\nThat will be separate.\n\n412\n00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.810\nWe're just gonna create\nour basic port there and\n\n413\n00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.800\nI'm gonna stick with the default here.\n\n414\n00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.580\nBrother, I have Brother devices.\n\n415\n00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:08.160\nI love them.\n\n416\n00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.210\nEven a Brother sewing machine,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n417\n00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:15.724\nI know I can't break this one\nbrother that I had forever.\n\n418\n00:23:15.724 --> 00:23:16.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n419\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.186\neven in production environments,\nI've used them and they're so easy to fix.\n\n420\n00:23:20.186 --> 00:23:22.342\nI mean, this is not a show about that,\nso I'll stop talking about it.\n\n421\n00:23:22.342 --> 00:23:23.647\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyways,\n\n422\n00:23:23.647 --> 00:23:27.090\nthis is where I would go ahead and\nchange that.\n\n423\n00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.670\nSuper helpful for end users,\n\n424\n00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.000\nbecause they don't want to\nknow all that about Brothers.\n\n425\n00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.790\nThey could care less to be honest.\n\n426\n00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.830\nSo maybe you'll say something like,\nmarketing printer,\n\n427\n00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.140\nbecause that's how they're going\nto wanna think of that, like,\n\n428\n00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.090\nthat's the marketing printer because it's\nin the marketing room on the second floor.\n\n429\n00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.805\nOr whatever, because really, that's\na bummer when you think you're gonna print\n\n430\n00:23:46.805 --> 00:23:48.452\nsomething, and\nit's not even in the right tray.\n\n431\n00:23:48.452 --> 00:23:49.436\n&gt;&gt; There's a printer right next to me.\n\n432\n00:23:49.436 --> 00:23:50.361\nYeah.\n\n433\n00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:51.910\n&gt;&gt; Done that before.\n\n434\n00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:55.874\n&gt;&gt; And actually,\nMicrosoft is aware of this heartache so\n\n435\n00:23:55.874 --> 00:24:01.131\nthey've even created locations, so\nyou can say something like hey this\n\n436\n00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:06.644\nis on the second floor to help people\nout there And also, if this was attached\n\n437\n00:24:06.644 --> 00:24:12.158\nto someone's computer in the marketing\ndepartment, maybe it was really,\n\n438\n00:24:12.158 --> 00:24:16.590\nMike was in marketing, and\nit was attached to his computer.\n\n439\n00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.685\nAnd he was responsible for\nthe budgeting of the marketing department.\n\n440\n00:24:20.685 --> 00:24:24.025\nI might want to put a comment like,\nMarks charges for\n\n441\n00:24:24.025 --> 00:24:27.525\ncolor, [LAUGH] Mike, I called you Mark.\n\n442\n00:24:27.525 --> 00:24:30.575\nI'm sorry.\nI was thinking marketing, but either way.\n\n443\n00:24:30.575 --> 00:24:35.000\nAll right, let me fix this I,\njust cuz, mentally I have to.\n\n444\n00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.660\nWe'll go ahead and hit next.\n\n445\n00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.880\nSo these are all just\nthings that you would do.\n\n446\n00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.240\nWe're not gonna print a test page,\nthere is no printer to really test.\n\n447\n00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:52.470\nBut, now that this actual\nprinter was shared out,\n\n448\n00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:56.870\nwe can go ahead and look for our printers\nhere and just pull up that page for\n\n449\n00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.930\nour print, print management, no.\n\n450\n00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:01.450\nOkay.\n\n451\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.810\nLet me just see if it shows it.\n\n452\n00:25:05.823 --> 00:25:07.370\nDevices and printers.\n\n453\n00:25:10.242 --> 00:25:12.220\nAll right.\n\n454\n00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:17.910\nScrolling down to our printers, this is\nthe one we just created and you can see\n\n455\n00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:22.780\nhere that we have our little two people,\nlet me zoom in so\n\n456\n00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:27.520\nyou guys can see that, to show that\nwe can go ahead and connect that way.\n\n457\n00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.910\nSo now that this printer is available for\nothers on your network to go ahead and\n\n458\n00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:37.320\nprint to it,\nsometimes you might not see it right away.\n\n459\n00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.860\nAgain just if you go to like file print.\n\n460\n00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.070\nLook at those other options there.\n\n461\n00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:46.410\nAnd also remember keep that network and\nsharing turned on for\n\n462\n00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.405\nany other computer that's\ntrying to connect to it.\n\n463\n00:25:49.405 --> 00:25:56.105\nAnd if you were to go into the different\nsettings here for this particular, under.\n\n464\n00:25:56.105 --> 00:25:58.525\nNow something,\nI know this isn't a printing show, again.\n\n465\n00:25:58.525 --> 00:26:00.405\nI just wanted to show you how\nyou could share that out.\n\n466\n00:26:00.405 --> 00:26:05.460\nBut when you go to the right-click on top\nof the printer, you have a Properties\n\n467\n00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.980\nsection that will just give you\ninformation associated with the printer.\n\n468\n00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.720\nBut then you also have\na Printer Properties, and\n\n469\n00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.400\nthat's really where you'd wanna go to\nget the bulk of those configurations in.\n\n470\n00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.240\nBecause you do have preferences or\noptions, such as spooling and so forth,\n\n471\n00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.730\nlike where do I want that processing to\nhappen on Mike's computer in marketing?\n\n472\n00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.800\nAre we gonna bog his computer down,\nor should each individual\n\n473\n00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.120\nperson be responsible for\nthat spooling before they print to him?\n\n474\n00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.230\nJust things like that,\n\n475\n00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:37.660\nbut ultimately the sharing is what I\nreally wanted to show you guys there.\n\n476\n00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.830\nAnd of course you do have that\nSharing tab here to change that.\n\n477\n00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:46.410\nSo if I did wanna go ahead and\nChange, excuse me render,\n\n478\n00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.900\nnot spooling, but\nwhere that job was gonna be rendering.\n\n479\n00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.320\nSo who's memory would you\nbe utilizing basically?\n\n480\n00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.990\nSo that's where you would go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n481\n00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.760\nJust know that that's another thing\nthat we can share here in our OS.\n\n482\n00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.870\nAnd I think you know that's about it,\njust keep in mind any kind of\n\n483\n00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:08.770\ntroubleshooting techniques that we've\nlooked at throughout these, Sharing shows.\n\n484\n00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.880\nObviously, one big thing though\nis you're not going to be able to\n\n485\n00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.430\nshare if you don't have\nnetwork connectivity.\n\n486\n00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.100\nSo that's where you'll\nreally want to check.\n\n487\n00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:24.070\nSay look I know I set this up right,\nbut don't underestimate just\n\n488\n00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.590\nyour basic pings to make sure that you can\nstill communicate with those computers.\n\n489\n00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.890\nOtherwise you're not going to\nbe able to share information.\n\n490\n00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.432\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n491\n00:27:31.432 --> 00:27:35.137\nGreat look there at many different ways\nthat we have to share resources within\n\n492\n00:27:35.137 --> 00:27:35.881\nWindows 10.\n\n493\n00:27:35.881 --> 00:27:38.090\nSo we appreciate that,\nand those demonstrations.\n\n494\n00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:39.970\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching these.\n\n495\n00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.050\nSigning off, for ITProtv.\n\n496\n00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.790\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n497\n00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:43.460\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n498\n00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:49.750\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n499\n00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.324\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:15.040\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.940\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.160\nToday, we're installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10, preparing for\n\n9\n00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.550\nthat 70-698 exam.\n\n10\n00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.460\nAnd this episode,\n\n11\n00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.640\nwe're going to take a look at configuring\nOneDrive, and files on demand.\n\n12\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.040\nAnd here to show us the way,\nis none other than Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n13\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.850\nWelcome, Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n15\n00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.510\nI feel like we have been talking about\ndifferent ways we can share forever.\n\n16\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.970\nBut we finally reached, I would say, we're\ntowards the end of our sharing evolution.\n\n17\n00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.860\nBecause, OneDrive, and really,\ncloud storage is so popular, and\n\n18\n00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.800\nthat's the way things are really headed.\n\n19\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.930\nSo just keep that in mind and\nat the moment of this recording,\n\n20\n00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.070\nthere might be some things that changed,\nbut I'll let you know how it is for now.\n\n21\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.325\nAnd the term Files on Demand, that's\nwhat we see with OneDrive, so it's not\n\n22\n00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:06.165\na separate thing at this point in time,\nbut that's how the objective calls it out.\n\n23\n00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:07.869\nSo let's take a look.\n\n24\n00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:08.419\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n25\n00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:13.670\n&gt;&gt; Here on my screen I have just\nthe OneDrive page pulled up.\n\n26\n00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.760\nAnd if you wanted to really learn\nmore about different plans and\n\n27\n00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.880\npricing, feel free to do so.\n\n28\n00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.890\nBut for this show and this demo, I've\njust created a free Microsoft account, so\n\n29\n00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.980\nby default, when you do that you'll\nget 5 gigs of storage, like I said,\n\n30\n00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.330\nat the time of this recording, for free.\n\n31\n00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.790\nIf you have an Office 365 subscription,\n\n32\n00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.740\neach user gets, by default 1 terabyte\nof storage at this time as well.\n\n33\n00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.750\nSo we're just working with 5 gigs,\n\n34\n00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.700\nbut we're not doing anything\nreally major for this show.\n\n35\n00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.399\nAll right, so what we're gonna do is,\n\n36\n00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.105\nlet's just sign in via\nthe web here in a browser and\n\n37\n00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:59.150\nthe account that I have is\ngoing to be itprodemotest,\n\n38\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.657\nand that's, what is that, @outlook.com.\n\n39\n00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:09.717\nI had this weird thing\nhappening yesterday,\n\n40\n00:02:09.717 --> 00:02:14.100\nI go to type it, and when I got to\nthis word demo, it deleted the line.\n\n41\n00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.710\nAnd I'm like, what, and\nI know you had said in Azure,\n\n42\n00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.470\nyou can't create certain accounts\nwith the word demo in it, and\n\n43\n00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.722\nI'm like, wonder if they're going\nto take that away also, we'll see.\n\n44\n00:02:24.722 --> 00:02:28.752\nOkay, itprotvdemotest, missed one,\npart of that there, I had\n\n45\n00:02:28.752 --> 00:02:33.679\nto find something unique, and you know\nhow hard that can be these days, right?\n\n46\n00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:37.212\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What are we holding on for, right?\n\n82\n00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.300\nOkay, we're here in our accounts section,\nyou can see Wilma,\n\n83\n00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.110\nshe's a local admin\nlogged in locally here.\n\n84\n00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.630\nWhat we wanna do is actually\nclick on this link right here, so\n\n85\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.940\nnow we're gonna sign in with\na Microsoft account instead.\n\n86\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.336\nSo what we just signed into\nbefore was the browser, so\n\n87\n00:05:09.336 --> 00:05:15.030\nwith OneDrive I don't have to be married\nor bound to a physical local computer.\n\n88\n00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.870\nMaybe I want to Leave\na workstation on my desk, right?\n\n89\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.010\nBut when I'm at home, I have a laptop.\n\n90\n00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.870\nAnd an easy way,\nwithout creating a VPN, or\n\n91\n00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.020\nanything like that, is to go ahead,\nand save those files in the Cloud.\n\n92\n00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.002\nAnd you might be thinking, Well,\nVPNs are secure, and safe, and yes,\n\n93\n00:05:34.002 --> 00:05:39.821\nMicrosoft is responsible for the security\nof your documents in your Cloud storage.\n\n94\n00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:43.653\nAnd that's going to be, you know, that\ndata at rest, when they're protecting it\n\n95\n00:05:43.653 --> 00:05:47.100\nthere, so, I know that's always,\nkind of one thing people ask about is,\n\n96\n00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.310\nwhen you're storing things in the cloud,\nwell, what is the Cloud?\n\n97\n00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.830\nWhere is it and\nhow does that responsibility work?\n\n98\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.950\nWhich are all great questions, you know,\n\n99\n00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.870\nyou just have to think about your privacy,\nand how that relates to you.\n\n100\n00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:08.801\nWe're gonna go ahead and now associate\nour itprotvdemotest, is that what it was?\n\n101\n00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:13.260\nYes [LAUGH] itprotvdemotest,\nso we're gonna\n\n102\n00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.430\nassociate this account with\nour computer here now.\n\n103\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.481\nSo that was @outlook .com, all right,\ngood to go, we'll enter our password.\n\n104\n00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.550\n[COUGH] And now the system is asking for\nthe current Windows password.\n\n105\n00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.101\nThe password that I just entered was for\nthat Outlook account, so here we'll type\n\n106\n00:06:38.101 --> 00:06:43.502\nin the local password to go ahead and get\nOneDrive set up, just give it a second.\n\n107\n00:06:45.213 --> 00:06:50.634\nSo this is pretty cool,\nin the past, OneDrive in Windows10\n\n108\n00:06:50.634 --> 00:06:55.328\nwas a bolt on or add-on and\nyou would download that and\n\n109\n00:06:55.328 --> 00:07:01.270\nuse it as you know just like\na secondary or an addition to the OS.\n\n110\n00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.660\nHere in the current version that\nwe're showing you in Windows10,\n\n111\n00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.121\nit's integrated, it's just part of that\nwhat appears to be the directory, right?\n\n112\n00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:13.660\nSo right there within File Explorer.\n\n113\n00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:20.935\nYou could go ahead and\nutilize Windows Hello, creating a pin but\n\n114\n00:07:20.935 --> 00:07:24.765\nwe're just gonna cancel out of that for\nright now, it's not required.\n\n115\n00:07:24.765 --> 00:07:27.335\nBut it has asked me,\ndid you mean to cancel that pin?\n\n116\n00:07:27.335 --> 00:07:30.705\nI'm like, yeah, we did,\nwe'll set it up later, wink, wink, right?\n\n117\n00:07:30.705 --> 00:07:33.838\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, I just had John Doe associated with\n\n118\n00:07:33.838 --> 00:07:39.039\nthat online account, so you can see\nnow Wilma, they don't have that but\n\n119\n00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:44.341\nif you had your legitimate information\nit should still be the same there.\n\n120\n00:07:44.341 --> 00:07:48.558\nSo let's just close out of here and\nI want to show you what I was talking\n\n121\n00:07:48.558 --> 00:07:52.395\nabout having that integration\nhere with our OneDrive files.\n\n122\n00:07:52.395 --> 00:07:58.230\nI'm getting a little click happy,\nall right, so here in file explorer\n\n123\n00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:04.750\nI have my, let me see, where is that,\nright here, let me zoom in.\n\n124\n00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.600\nIf you're half as blind as I am,\nthis will help you.\n\n125\n00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.920\nOneDrive, it's like part of the UI here,\n\n126\n00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.830\nI don't have to launch an application or\nanything separate.\n\n127\n00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:20.910\nSo I'm just going to go ahead and\nnavigate, and I have never\n\n128\n00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:25.280\nadded anything to this particular\nsection of the UI before.\n\n129\n00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.030\nSo where this information is coming\nfrom is, well, the cloud and\n\n130\n00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:36.550\nyou can see that here with our little\ncloud symbol there, that's what that is.\n\n131\n00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:40.250\nAnd let me zoom in a different way,\ninstead of using the Windows zoom,\n\n132\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.954\nI believe I have Zoom It installed,\nmaybe not on this machine.\n\n133\n00:08:43.954 --> 00:08:48.030\nI'll just try to give us some\nspace because this column here,\n\n134\n00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:53.120\nthe status is very telling,\nyou can see a lot of information just\n\n135\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.020\nby looking at the symbols associated\nwith that particular file.\n\n136\n00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:03.550\nSo of course you have to have an internet\nconnection in order to download and\n\n137\n00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.590\npull, because if you think about\nthe cloud and how that's working,\n\n138\n00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:10.880\nyour information is stored on computers\nthat reside in a Microsoft server farm,\n\n139\n00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.210\ndata farm, elsewhere.\n\n140\n00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.901\nSo you need to have that internet\nconnectivity to go ahead and\n\n141\n00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:17.720\npull those files down.\n\n142\n00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.570\nWhen you see this icon of the empty\ncloud it means that those documents\n\n143\n00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.450\ncurrently reside or live in the cloud,\nthey are not stored on your local machine.\n\n144\n00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:32.695\nWhich, you know could be good or\nbad depending on,\n\n145\n00:09:32.695 --> 00:09:37.353\nI would say it's bad to not\nknow the state of your files.\n\n146\n00:09:37.353 --> 00:09:42.287\nBecause you don't want to assume you have\nthem, not have internet connection and\n\n147\n00:09:42.287 --> 00:09:45.950\nbe dead in the water losing\nproductivity in that situation.\n\n148\n00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.600\nSo as long as you're aware,\nit could be a really great thing,\n\n149\n00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.300\nsaving up actual storage disk space.\n\n150\n00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was the big thing when\nthey made this change with OneDrive was,\n\n151\n00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.390\ninitially it would synchronize your entire\nOneDrive down to your local machine\n\n152\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.010\nwhichever one you logged into and\nassociate it.\n\n153\n00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.590\nAnd that could potentially eat up a lot of\nspace, you've got a lot of space available\n\n154\n00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.760\nas you're saying earlier but they're in\none drive, gigabytes, terabytes of space.\n\n155\n00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.840\nSo you might not want that, so now they\nkinda leave it up to you, I think, right?\n\n156\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.310\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you know, and if we think\nabout this, Windows 10 being cross\n\n157\n00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:24.020\nplatform with multiple devices,\nsome of these devices have on-board RAM\n\n158\n00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.500\nor storage, I should say,\nwhere you can't easily upgrade.\n\n159\n00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:34.190\nSo here with PCs, I can add an additional\nhard drive or whatever, but something\n\n160\n00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.080\nlike a tablet, or something with a small\nenclosure, it is something to think about.\n\n161\n00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.380\nBecause you have that flexibility to be\nable to access your files with mobile\n\n162\n00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.810\ndevices, but you don't wanna\nstore them on that device, right?\n\n163\n00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.690\nSo what if I actually wanted\nto view this document?\n\n164\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.490\nWell a couple different ways\nwe could go about doing that.\n\n165\n00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:58.500\nNumber one, if I right click on top of it,\nselect view or wait, not view, hold on.\n\n166\n00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:05.420\nView online with the cloud here,\nthis is going to bring up that same\n\n167\n00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.890\nformat that we saw when we clicked\non this file from the browser.\n\n168\n00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.970\nI'm just gonna let Edge do\nthe heavy lifting here, and\n\n169\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.615\nthis is essentially the same view\nthat we had previously whenever I had\n\n170\n00:11:17.615 --> 00:11:23.430\ndouble-clicked that and launched that\nto show you that there was text there.\n\n171\n00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.950\nIt's just taking a minute,\nI say this, but patience,\n\n172\n00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.830\nnot my strong suit,\nif you guys haven't figured that out.\n\n173\n00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.670\nBut anyways, you can view it online, so\n\n174\n00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.410\nthat's what I really\nwanted to show you there.\n\n175\n00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:42.750\nNotice how that status didn't change,\nbecause we're just viewing it online.\n\n176\n00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:47.130\nIf I double-click on the document,\nthis is what I want you to see.\n\n177\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.230\nI want you to pay attention to the status,\nso, yes,\n\n178\n00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:56.850\nit pulled up here but\nalso look at the icon that we have now.\n\n179\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:01.420\nThis is going to be a green\ncircle with a little green check,\n\n180\n00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.430\nI know it's hard to see, but\n\n181\n00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.669\nwhat we have done is we've dowloaded\nthat file and launched it here locally.\n\n182\n00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:15.840\nSo, let me just close out of that, that-\n&gt;&gt; Now that document is\n\n183\n00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.110\navailable even if I'm not\nconnected to the internet.\n\n184\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:23.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, no, this is what we need to do\n[LAUGH] that's what I'm about to show you.\n\n185\n00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:23.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n186\n00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.040\n&gt;&gt; That's why I'm saying,\nthis whole status bar can get a little,\n\n187\n00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.900\ncould get you in trouble if\nyou don't pay attention there.\n\n188\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:35.030\nSo actually let's go to, let me see,\nI might be able to see something here.\n\n189\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.290\nWell, this isn't a great example for\n\n190\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:45.110\nthe size on disk to show if it's\npulling it and storing it on that disk.\n\n191\n00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.700\nBecause it's such a small text file, but\n\n192\n00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:51.130\nif you had a large file you'd be able to\nsee like differences as to how that data,\n\n193\n00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.490\nthat binary, if it was in fact\njust being stored on the disk, or\n\n194\n00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.700\nif it was just pointer information\nto point it to the cloud there.\n\n195\n00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:04.990\nBut what you can do,\nif you do anticipate any kind of\n\n196\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.300\nsabbatical or long term time when you're\nnot gonna have that internet connectivity,\n\n197\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.465\nmaybe you're going on vacation\nto a remote, that sounds great.\n\n198\n00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:17.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyways, what you could do is\n\n199\n00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:21.750\nselect this option,\nalways keep on this device, so\n\n200\n00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.460\nthat you would have it available even\nif you didn't have connectivity there.\n\n201\n00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.500\nSo let's go ahead and select that.\n\n202\n00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:33.180\nNow, you can see that status,\nthat green circle has been filled in.\n\n203\n00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.820\nSo, slight, like I said,\n\n204\n00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.960\nit could get you into trouble if\nyou're not familiar, it's not hard,\n\n205\n00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.600\nit's just knowing So, I would definitely\nsuggest going in and playing with that.\n\n206\n00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:49.720\nAlso, let's say you didn't expect\nto have connectivity loss.\n\n207\n00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.690\nWhen I launch this file,\nyou could see quickly,\n\n208\n00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.550\nlike two blue arrows that\ncame up there for that icon.\n\n209\n00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:02.650\nIf I were to go ahead and\nadded this file, so this is,\n\n210\n00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:07.980\nwe'll just say text, but we'll say also\nthis changed text, maybe we make a change.\n\n211\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:12.620\nI'm going to simulate\nan internet failure here, so\n\n212\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.830\nwhat we're just gonna do\nis disconnect our adapter.\n\n213\n00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.709\nAll right, so\nlet's go to our ethernet here.\n\n214\n00:14:25.159 --> 00:14:28.248\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nturn that off, let me go back,\n\n215\n00:14:28.248 --> 00:14:30.525\nI think I can right click and be faster.\n\n216\n00:14:33.356 --> 00:14:35.038\nI'm gonna go the old school\nway to make it faster.\n\n217\n00:14:35.038 --> 00:14:36.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.131\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, instead of- All right, so\n\n219\n00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:43.325\nwhat I'm gonna do here,\nlet's go to our change adapter settings,\n\n220\n00:14:43.325 --> 00:14:46.360\njust right click and then select disable.\n\n221\n00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.950\nSo I am not gonna be able to\ncommunicate with the cloud,\n\n222\n00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.470\nwith OneDrive to get that file.\n\n223\n00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.771\nSo let me just minimize everything\nwe've got going on here.\n\n224\n00:14:57.964 --> 00:14:59.611\nClose a few.\n\n225\n00:14:59.611 --> 00:15:03.801\nAnd if I try to save this file, so,\nmaybe I've been working at home,\n\n226\n00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:06.260\nunaware that this change has happened,\n\n227\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.630\nso that's why we don't want you to\nlose any work or anything like that.\n\n228\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:15.289\nSo I go, file, save or save as, and\nwe're just gonna save it here in OneDrive,\n\n229\n00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:18.210\nwe'll keep everything the same.\n\n230\n00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:22.627\nAll right, yes,\nnotice this icon, that's what I\n\n231\n00:15:22.627 --> 00:15:27.580\nreally wanted to show you guys\nhere was this sync status.\n\n232\n00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:32.150\nSo this document is kind of cued up or\n\n233\n00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:36.060\nready to go out to the cloud as soon\nas that connectivity is available.\n\n234\n00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.500\nSo currently,\nif I were to go on some other device and\n\n235\n00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.400\nlog into my OneDrive,\nI would get that older version.\n\n236\n00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.530\nSo you do have to just kinda be\ncareful about versioning because that\n\n237\n00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.970\nmultiple potential access there\nat different varying times,\n\n238\n00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.050\nI just wanted you to be aware of that.\n\n239\n00:15:55.050 --> 00:16:01.160\nLet's go ahead and\nreturn our internet connectivity,\n\n240\n00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:07.272\nwe'll just re-enable our adapter,\ngive it a second.\n\n241\n00:16:10.408 --> 00:16:13.980\nSo, as soon as that adapter comes online,\n\n242\n00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.560\nyou'll see that syncing,\ngo ahead and happen there.\n\n243\n00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.458\nNow, what if we decide that hey,\nI've saved these files to my computer,\n\n244\n00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:27.882\nI've worked with them, and\nyou guys can see I just changed there,\n\n245\n00:16:27.882 --> 00:16:32.590\nI've worked with them, and\nI don't need them on my device anymore.\n\n246\n00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:37.274\nHow can we put them back in the cloud for\npermanent storage or storage, right?\n\n247\n00:16:37.274 --> 00:16:41.057\n[CROSSTALK] Free up some space, and\nthat's exactly what its called here,\n\n248\n00:16:41.057 --> 00:16:42.164\nis freeing up space.\n\n249\n00:16:42.164 --> 00:16:46.980\nSo what were going to do is right click\non that and select free up space.\n\n250\n00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:47.480\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n251\n00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:53.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, what it does, and\nI think I had document two selected when\n\n252\n00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:57.650\nit technically wasn't like saved onto the\ndisk there, but that's what's happening.\n\n253\n00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.510\nFor whichever one that you select, so\nthe documents that you select, and\n\n254\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:05.630\nthen select Free Up Space,\nit'll send it on back to the cloud there.\n\n255\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.850\nSo that's one way you could\nmanage those files, and\n\n256\n00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:13.530\nreally have them available to you at all\ntimes you have that internet connection.\n\n257\n00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.291\nHopefully, that's, you know, as long\nas Microsoft isn't down, but that's,\n\n258\n00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:20.963\nthey spend a lot of money and resources\ninto maintaining their infrastructure.\n\n259\n00:17:20.963 --> 00:17:25.629\nSo that's why it's pretty popular,\nI think this is the way things\n\n260\n00:17:25.629 --> 00:17:31.190\nare going to be going, looking at\nthe ways we can share and access files.\n\n261\n00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.700\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, great look there.\n\n262\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.500\nWorking with OneDrive,\ncloud storage and setting up or\n\n263\n00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.910\ntaking advantage of a new feature of\nOneDrive, good old files on demand.\n\n264\n00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.800\nSo we appreciate that and\nthose demonstrations, Cherokee.\n\n265\n00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.190\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n266\n00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.770\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n267\n00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.460\n&gt;&gt;

Backwards, barefoot.\n\n21\n00:00:45.197 --> 00:00:45.927\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've heard that one.\n\n22\n00:00:45.927 --> 00:00:49.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't have a Microsoft Store.\n\n23\n00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.453\n&gt;&gt; So where'd you get your apps?\n\n24\n00:00:52.453 --> 00:00:53.450\n&gt;&gt; Big box stores.\n\n25\n00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.162\n[LAUGH] Like you got in your car, and you\ndrove there, and you bought a little box,\n\n26\n00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:02.593\nand it was weird, cuz you'd buy a box,\nand it had the little, tiny CD in it,\n\n27\n00:01:02.593 --> 00:01:04.703\nand you'd jiggle it around [LAUGH].\n\n28\n00:01:04.703 --> 00:01:05.320\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n29\n00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.515\n&gt;&gt; That's a true story.\n\n30\n00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:10.020\nBut now, we have the Microsoft Store.\n\n31\n00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.354\nOther vendors have their own stores as\nwell, but since this is a Microsoft show,\n\n32\n00:01:15.354 --> 00:01:20.532\nthat's what we'll be looking at here,\nand because there are variations with\n\n33\n00:01:20.532 --> 00:01:26.197\nthat old school CD-in-a-box kind of app,\nwe used to actually call them programs.\n\n34\n00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:26.995\nI don't know if, yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:28.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n36\n00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.936\n&gt;&gt; And the binary is different from\nthe way that it's installed and\n\n37\n00:01:32.936 --> 00:01:37.900\nhow the operating system handles\nit versus how Microsoft is trying\n\n38\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.300\nto bring everyone together and\nmake everyone happy.\n\n39\n00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.154\nSo, they have the universal\ndriver platform for\n\n40\n00:01:46.154 --> 00:01:51.042\ntheir universal apps, and so,\nto be able to be used across all\n\n41\n00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:55.554\nthose devices we actually\nhave the Microsoft Store, and\n\n42\n00:01:55.554 --> 00:02:00.912\nit's cool because you can go ahead and\nget an app for your computer,\n\n43\n00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:05.332\nyour tablet, your mobile device,\nphone, whatever.\n\n44\n00:02:05.332 --> 00:02:07.590\nSo that's what we're\ngonna look at first here.\n\n45\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.890\nSo let's just talk about that.\n\n46\n00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.640\nKnowing that there is a difference\nin two styles of apps, so\n\n47\n00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.990\nwe will look at that as well.\n\n48\n00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.830\nSo if we take a look at my screen here,\nI have the Window Store icon, or logo.\n\n49\n00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.250\nIt's pretty small.\n\n50\n00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.020\nI'll zoom in for you.\n\n51\n00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.814\nI say that.\n\n52\n00:02:25.814 --> 00:02:29.017\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe not, on my taskbar there.\n\n53\n00:02:29.017 --> 00:02:32.552\nIt's basically just a shopping bag\nwith the Windows logo on top of it.\n\n54\n00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:38.407\nSo we'll go ahead and launch that,\nand here is the Windows Store.\n\n55\n00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:40.220\nSo you guys might've seen it before.\n\n56\n00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.830\nWe've got some live tiles\ndisplaying adverts of games or\n\n57\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.830\nsomething recent that may be out,\nsome type of app there.\n\n58\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.916\nAll sorts of games.\n\n59\n00:02:52.916 --> 00:02:57.070\nYou have the ability to go ahead and\nlog-in here.\n\n60\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.010\nSo currently I don't have a user logged\nin, I just got the little plus arrow for\n\n61\n00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.370\nyou to go ahead and\nsign-in, so we'll do that.\n\n62\n00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.839\nI just have to think about\n&gt;&gt; Which one of the myriad of accounts\n\n63\n00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:12.732\nyou're gonna use to-\n&gt;&gt; Who I'm gonna sign in as, but\n\n64\n00:03:12.732 --> 00:03:13.720\nyou know what?\n\n65\n00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.065\nI didn't try with the work or\nschool accounts here, so\n\n66\n00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:22.620\nmaybe that's why it was\ngiving me trouble earlier.\n\n67\n00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.627\nLet's do it.\n&gt;&gt; Let's try it and see.\n\n68\n00:03:23.627 --> 00:03:24.244\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's see.\n\n69\n00:03:24.244 --> 00:03:25.162\n&gt;&gt; Live on the edge Cherokee.\n\n70\n00:03:25.162 --> 00:03:25.797\nThat's what I always say.\n\n71\n00:03:25.797 --> 00:03:29.766\n&gt;&gt; And what I'm saying is I tried to\nsign-in with an account that I had created\n\n72\n00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:33.231\nearlier, or that Mike had created and\nwas allowing me to use, but\n\n73\n00:03:33.231 --> 00:03:35.310\nit wasn't allowing me to log-in, but\n\n74\n00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.531\nI might have just been putting it in the\nwrong place, because it seems a little,\n\n75\n00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:43.380\nwhen you think about a Microsoft account,\nwhat do you think of, right?\n\n76\n00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.360\nSo, we're thinking Outlook, Live, but\nsometimes it's kind of weird when you're\n\n77\n00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.207\ngetting into the Office 365 and\nAzure realm.\n\n78\n00:03:51.207 --> 00:03:53.361\nSo, we'll see how that-\n&gt;&gt; We got a hybrid there.\n\n79\n00:03:53.361 --> 00:03:55.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nwe'll see how that plays out here.\n\n80\n00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.419\nSo who do I want to sign in as,\nhow about Adam?\n\n81\n00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:00.802\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, put down Adam.\n\n82\n00:04:00.802 --> 00:04:05.522\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Adam@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n83\n00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.013\nAll right,\nlet's see if Adam can log in here.\n\n84\n00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:16.322\n&gt;&gt; Drum roll please.\n\n85\n00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:17.210\n&gt;&gt; Well,-\n&gt;&gt; You get\n\n86\n00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.173\nto the password screen-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n87\n00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Which is a good indicator.\n\n88\n00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.161\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so okay,\nthat's probably just my fault then,\n\n89\n00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:25.342\nbecause I didn't click on the work or\nschool portion there.\n\n90\n00:04:25.342 --> 00:04:28.884\nSo this is a work email account, so\nyou wanna pay attention to where you're\n\n91\n00:04:28.884 --> 00:04:32.756\nlogging in if you do get that error, and-\n&gt;&gt; That is a good point to make though,\n\n92\n00:04:32.756 --> 00:04:36.583\ncuz when you go there and you go to\nsign-in, it's tempting to just click\n\n93\n00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:40.535\nsign-in, and if your account has been\ngiven to you by your work or school,\n\n94\n00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:45.177\nyou think it's a Microsoft account, but if\nit doesn't end in Outlook, or Hotmail, or\n\n95\n00:04:45.177 --> 00:04:49.676\nLive, or any of their older extensions\nit's not technically a Microsoft account.\n\n96\n00:04:49.676 --> 00:04:50.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\njust knowing the difference there.\n\n97\n00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.565\nSo just kind of pay attention to that.\n\n98\n00:04:53.565 --> 00:04:57.994\nAll right, so here it's just asking,\nhey do you want to go ahead and\n\n99\n00:04:57.994 --> 00:04:59.570\nadd this account here?\n\n100\n00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.849\nSo it says we can remember Adam.\n\n101\n00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.485\nSo we'll just go ahead and hit Yes.\n\n102\n00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:07.729\nActually-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say.\n\n103\n00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.374\nSorry about that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's be safe with that.\n\n104\n00:05:09.374 --> 00:05:12.642\nSo we're gonna say skip for now,\nwe don't want them to remember Adam,\n\n105\n00:05:12.642 --> 00:05:14.760\nespecially on this virtual machine here.\n\n106\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.522\n&gt;&gt; So you guys in the real world could\ndefinitely take advantage of that and\n\n107\n00:05:17.522 --> 00:05:19.500\nit makes a little bit easier\nto get to the store, but\n\n108\n00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.309\nwhen you're doing demonstrations and\nusing 15 different accounts,\n\n109\n00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:23.987\nyou don't want it to remember one, yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:23.987 --> 00:05:25.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, okay so\n\n111\n00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.340\nlet's take a look at some different\napps that we do have available.\n\n112\n00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.770\nNow you do need to have a Microsoft\naccount in order to go ahead and\n\n113\n00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.470\npurchase and\ndownload these different apps.\n\n114\n00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.975\nSome of them are free,\nthose are the fun ones.\n\n115\n00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:43.140\n[LAUGH] I didn't wanna\nspend a lot of money here.\n\n116\n00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.053\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I was trying to just see,\n\n117\n00:05:46.053 --> 00:05:49.599\nit's super easy to go ahead and\ndownload an app.\n\n118\n00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:50.614\nI'm trying to find one.\n\n119\n00:05:50.614 --> 00:05:53.990\nI had seen one earlier that,\nI don't know if you guys know, but\n\n120\n00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.814\nI really do like online shopping, and\nit was this one called Honey, and\n\n121\n00:05:57.814 --> 00:06:01.620\nit was free, and basically finds\ncoupons for you, but that's okay.\n\n122\n00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.350\nWe're just gonna grab\n[LAUGH] some other one.\n\n123\n00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.030\nHm.\n\n124\n00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.851\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n125\n00:06:06.851 --> 00:06:09.504\nAll these, really I just can't decided.\n\n126\n00:06:09.504 --> 00:06:10.350\n&gt;&gt; Do a work-related one.\n\n127\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.043\nLet's do, go up into search and\ndo like a markdown editor or something.\n\n128\n00:06:14.043 --> 00:06:14.804\nAdam would want one of those.\n\n129\n00:06:14.804 --> 00:06:15.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n130\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.217\nThat sounds like Adam.\n\n131\n00:06:18.217 --> 00:06:18.760\nOkay, let's see.\n\n132\n00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.812\n&gt;&gt; That way we can-\n&gt;&gt; Markdown, Markdown 10, we'll get that.\n\n133\n00:06:22.812 --> 00:06:23.335\n&gt;&gt; Nice, perfect.\n\n134\n00:06:23.335 --> 00:06:26.334\n&gt;&gt; It even looks like it's designed for\nWindows 10 here.\n\n135\n00:06:26.334 --> 00:06:27.666\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n136\n00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:28.250\n&gt;&gt; That's great, I love it.\n\n137\n00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, so cool, so\n\n138\n00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.450\nyou just go ahead and click on the button\nto go ahead and get that installed.\n\n139\n00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.169\nSo, what we're installing now,\n\n140\n00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:41.360\nsigning in with Microsoft end\nuse on any compatible device.\n\n141\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.330\nSo, you know what?\n\n142\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.927\nLet's go ahead and hit Sign-in.\n\n143\n00:06:43.927 --> 00:06:45.608\nSo that brings up a good point.\n\n144\n00:06:45.608 --> 00:06:50.855\nWith Windows 8.1 the operating\nsystem would automatically\n\n145\n00:06:50.855 --> 00:06:56.894\nsync the applications to up to,\nI think ten devices if you used the same,\n\n146\n00:06:56.894 --> 00:07:03.230\nso if Adam were to log-in on his tablet,\nwith this log on it would go ahead and\n\n147\n00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.790\ninstall that application\non that device as well.\n\n148\n00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.603\nSo here, let's see,\nwhat they want us to do?\n\n149\n00:07:10.603 --> 00:07:12.480\nGo ahead and put his info in again.\n\n150\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.826\nSo we'll say Adam@itprotv,\n\n151\n00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:20.173\nthat was, demo.com.\n\n152\n00:07:23.422 --> 00:07:25.663\n&gt;&gt; This time it looks like\nit's specifically asking for\n\n153\n00:07:25.663 --> 00:07:26.620\na Microsoft account.\n\n154\n00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.023\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n\n155\n00:07:29.023 --> 00:07:33.578\n&gt;&gt; And that's another good point, cuz when\nyou're using your Microsoft account you\n\n156\n00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.984\nget so\nmuch storage space up there in Azure,\n\n157\n00:07:35.984 --> 00:07:39.495\nand it can use that space to help\nyou sync things across devices,\n\n158\n00:07:39.495 --> 00:07:44.047\nbut if you logged in with a work or school\naccount, they'll let you sign in the store\n\n159\n00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:47.005\nand get apps, but\nyou can't sync it across devices.\n\n160\n00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:51.699\n&gt;&gt; Well that brings up a good point there,\nMike, because specifically on\n\n161\n00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:56.474\nthe objectives for this exam,\nMicrosoft does call out Windows Store for\n\n162\n00:07:56.474 --> 00:08:01.484\nBusiness and Windows Store for Education,\nand I can't really demo that for\n\n163\n00:08:01.484 --> 00:08:06.280\nyou, but basically It's another\nway to access the Windows Store.\n\n164\n00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:13.770\nHowever with implemented restrictions from\na managed or administrative perspective.\n\n165\n00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.690\nOkay, so it's actually installing here\nas we're kind of just chit chatting.\n\n166\n00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.200\nSo Markdown 10 just got installed and\nwe could go ahead and\n\n167\n00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.360\nrun that if we wanted to, so yeah.\n\n168\n00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.150\nJust kind of interesting,\nand definitely go ahead and\n\n169\n00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.950\nplay with that there cuz I've\nbeen playing around as well.\n\n170\n00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.872\nAnd you know.\n\n171\n00:08:30.872 --> 00:08:33.790\n&gt;&gt; This is relatively new, it used to be\nyou had to have a Microsoft account to\n\n172\n00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.985\ndownload anything from the Store.\n\n173\n00:08:35.985 --> 00:08:39.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this one was free, so\n\n174\n00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.480\nmaybe that's why it allowed us\nto go ahead and install that.\n\n175\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.670\nBut definitely not for those paid ones.\n\n176\n00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.290\nYou're not gonna be able\nto get away with that,\n\n177\n00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.518\nbecause that's how your payment\nis linked to that account.\n\n178\n00:08:49.518 --> 00:08:53.320\nAll right, I'm just trying to think here.\n\n179\n00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:00.100\nLet's take a look at different\ntype of apps real quick.\n\n180\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.030\nLet's think about that.\n\n181\n00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.520\nSo Adam, we just used his log on,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n182\n00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.492\nuse him again but thinking about\nit from a different perspective.\n\n183\n00:09:07.492 --> 00:09:12.172\nI'm gonna go ahead and\npull up a web browser, and just log into\n\n184\n00:09:12.172 --> 00:09:20.660\nportal.office.com to go ahead and\nlog into his Office portal there.\n\n185\n00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.693\nAnd I've already logged in here,\nAdam@ITProTVdemo.com, and\n\n186\n00:09:24.693 --> 00:09:27.436\nwe'll go ahead and\nput his password in here.\n\n187\n00:09:31.046 --> 00:09:36.085\nNow depending on what\ntype of applications or\n\n188\n00:09:36.085 --> 00:09:42.053\nlack thereof Adam has access\nto inside of his portal,\n\n189\n00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:46.710\nis contingent upon licensing on the end.\n\n190\n00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.740\nBasically what the administrator\nis allowing Adam to access.\n\n191\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.830\nSo on local machines,\nI could go ahead and download and\n\n192\n00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.870\ninstall machines locally, or even go out\nto that big box store and install them.\n\n193\n00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.500\nHowever, in a business environment,\n\n194\n00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.540\nmost likely you will have some type\nof restrictions on that machine, so\n\n195\n00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.970\nthat the end user couldn't randomly\nbe installing applications.\n\n196\n00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:14.810\nSo that's what we're kind of seeing\nhere from an administrative standpoint.\n\n197\n00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.960\nSo I'm logged in as Adam\ninto my portal here and\n\n198\n00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.034\nI can see that I don't have anything.\n\n199\n00:10:20.034 --> 00:10:23.660\nI don't have anything available\nright here at a glance.\n\n200\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.980\nI have the ability to go back into that\nstore where we just were if I wanted to.\n\n201\n00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.810\nAnd over here on the right hand side,\nif I were to drop down and say,\n\n202\n00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:32.970\nInstall Office apps.\n\n203\n00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.920\nLet's go ahead and\nclick on that and see what happens.\n\n204\n00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.400\nAll right, so we didn't get very far.\n\n205\n00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.090\nIt says please contact your admin.\n\n206\n00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:44.390\nIt looks like they haven't assigned a EUI\nlicense for the Office desktop apps.\n\n207\n00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:49.351\nAnd so we definitely need to make sure\nwe are paying for Microsoft's products,\n\n208\n00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:52.102\nso we wanna go ahead and\nget Adam setup here.\n\n209\n00:10:52.102 --> 00:10:55.360\nSo what I'm gonna do is just\nminimize Adam's session.\n\n210\n00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.960\nAnd let's go ahead and\nassign him those rights.\n\n211\n00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.570\nSo I'm logged in as an administrator, and\n\n212\n00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:08.800\nthe reason I'm likening it to\nthe older style is an end user would\n\n213\n00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.310\nhave to call you up from the help desk and\nsay hey Mike, when you get a second,\n\n214\n00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.520\nwill you come over to my desk and\nget this app installed forme?\n\n215\n00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.880\nAnd you know, Mike may or\nmay not show up and [LAUGH]\n\n216\n00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.880\n&gt;&gt; Depends if they have any Mountain Dew.\n\n217\n00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or what was another\ncommon thing that people do?\n\n218\n00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.165\nThey would just give the administrative\npassword so they didn't have to get up.\n\n219\n00:11:28.165 --> 00:11:31.539\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, true stories.\n\n220\n00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:35.070\nSo utilizing, I think Microsoft took\nall that into consideration, and\n\n221\n00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.490\nthis is really just kind of streamlined\nto make the process a little more easier.\n\n222\n00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.850\nAnd the information is\nstored in the cloud, so\n\n223\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.420\nof course they would\nkind of lean that way.\n\n224\n00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.180\nNow I've logged in as an admin, so\nI'm gonna go under active users.\n\n225\n00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.370\nAdam is already created.\n\n226\n00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.950\nWe've logged in as him,\nso we know he exists.\n\n227\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.210\nBut we do want to go ahead and\ngive him subscription so\n\n228\n00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.110\nhe can actually get those apps.\n\n229\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:01.220\nSo under product licenses,\nlet me zoom it a little bit there.\n\n230\n00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.330\nProduct licenses,\n\n231\n00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.940\nyou can see on the second horizontal bar\nit says \"no products have been assigned\".\n\n232\n00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.539\nSo go ahead and hit edit and\nget Adam squared away.\n\n233\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.300\nLooking at the licenses that\nI do have available to me, so\n\n234\n00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.970\ndepending on how many licenses\nyour organization had\n\n235\n00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.010\npurchased is what would show up\nhere in this particular column.\n\n236\n00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.570\nSo for right now, we'll go ahead and\n\n237\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.340\nuse this toggle switch to\nassign him Office 365.\n\n238\n00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.550\nAnd let me zoom out so we can go ahead and\nget that all saved in here.\n\n239\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.800\nWe'll hit save and then close.\n\n240\n00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.110\nNow, because this is cloud based\ntechnology, you have to think about your\n\n241\n00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:46.050\ninternet connectivity, and really how\nfast these settings can be changed.\n\n242\n00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:50.130\nNow, I may or may not have to go ahead and\nlogout as Adam.\n\n243\n00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:57.690\nI'm thinking yes, but let's go ahead and\njust test it and see what happens here.\n\n244\n00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.230\nOkay, maybe back but.\n\n245\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.990\n&gt;&gt; Possibly.\n\n246\n00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.910\n&gt;&gt; Possibly, I'm just kind of seeing\nnow like hmm, what can we do here?\n\n247\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.050\nAll right, so what we're gonna\ndo is just log out as Adam.\n\n248\n00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.660\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit sign out,\nand wait for it to officially sign out.\n\n249\n00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.510\nI'm just gonna close the browser and\nthen relaunch to see how that goes.\n\n250\n00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.390\nAnd as a matter of fact, look,\nthey mention it right here.\n\n251\n00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.690\nThey're like hey, why don't you go ahead\nand close out all your browser windows?\n\n252\n00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.130\nIt sounds like a plan, Microsoft.\n\n253\n00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.330\nAll right.\n\n254\n00:13:26.414 --> 00:13:28.239\nAnd then we'll go ahead and relaunch.\n\n255\n00:13:43.818 --> 00:13:45.560\n&gt;&gt; See you guys, look at that.\n\n256\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.430\n&gt;&gt; Look it's already there, he doesn't\neven have to go anywhere really special.\n\n257\n00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:54.500\nSo now Adam has been given\nthe ability to go ahead and\n\n258\n00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.880\ndownload One Drive, Word,\nExcel, Powerpoint, One Note.\n\n259\n00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.770\nAnd he would go back over to this option\nhere from this drop down to go ahead and\n\n260\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.230\nget them installed.\n\n261\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:09.270\nYou have the ability to go ahead and\nchoose other\n\n262\n00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:14.750\ninstall options here if you wanted to\ngo ahead and install a 64 bit version,\n\n263\n00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.580\nbecause by default they're going to\ngo ahead and give you that 32 bit.\n\n264\n00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.070\nThey actually do recommend that,\n\n265\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.580\nthere's not a lot of advantages\nto go ahead and get that 64 bit.\n\n266\n00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.890\nMaybe back in the day, you probably\nwould have wanted to if you were running\n\n267\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.532\na 64 bit system, but\nit's not gonna hurt your system.\n\n268\n00:14:29.532 --> 00:14:32.490\nAll right, so you would go in here and\njust go ahead and\n\n269\n00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.412\nchange that if you did in fact did\nwant to, but for the most part,\n\n270\n00:14:36.412 --> 00:14:41.780\n32 bit should be pretty satisfying for\nthe average user there.\n\n271\n00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.170\nWe're not gonna go ahead and\ninstall that for now.\n\n272\n00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:47.370\nI mean, nothing crazy would happen,\n\n273\n00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.340\nyou would just have the actual\napplications on your local machine.\n\n274\n00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:55.220\nSo what that would mean is I\nwould be able to go ahead and\n\n275\n00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.890\nlaunch this application without\nan internet connection here.\n\n276\n00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.940\nAnd, I'm trying to think, how many,\n\n277\n00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.786\nI think it's up to five devices\nyou can have these installed on.\n\n278\n00:15:04.786 --> 00:15:09.854\nSo if Adam wanted to go to his tablet,\nhis workstation at home,\n\n279\n00:15:09.854 --> 00:15:14.760\nlike maybe his home office, and his\nwork laptop here, that would be three of\n\n280\n00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.670\nthose five licenses that were allowed,\nso just keeping that in mind as well.\n\n281\n00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:24.030\nYou do have the ability to go ahead and\nhave multiples, which is pretty cool.\n\n282\n00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.735\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very handy.\n\n283\n00:15:24.735 --> 00:15:27.430\nCuz we know most people\nhave more than one device,\n\n284\n00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:31.620\nand I want to have Excel on one of my\nmachines and then not on my other, so\n\n285\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.600\nit's very nice that Microsoft\ngives each user five installs.\n\n286\n00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.850\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty cool.\n\n287\n00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.915\nEspecially if you have children and.\n\n288\n00:15:37.915 --> 00:15:38.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n289\n00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They have devices too.\n\n290\n00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:45.600\nOkay, let's see here, I'm trying to think,\nwhat else did I want to show you?\n\n291\n00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.040\nNot in here,\nlet's go back into the store for a minute.\n\n292\n00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.237\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nminimize this, and pull up the store.\n\n293\n00:15:52.237 --> 00:15:56.854\nJust to take a look at some of those\nsettings, let me go back to the home here\n\n294\n00:15:56.854 --> 00:16:01.699\nand then Just so you are all familiar\nwith the different options that we have.\n\n295\n00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:06.614\nSo this is where we were to go ahead and\nadd that account, but right over to\n\n296\n00:16:06.614 --> 00:16:11.532\nthe right you see our eclipses icon,\nor the three little buttons there,\n\n297\n00:16:11.532 --> 00:16:16.150\nand if you go ahead and open that up\nyou have a couple of options here.\n\n298\n00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:20.300\nSo you have your Downloads and\nupdates, Settings, My Library,\n\n299\n00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.475\nif you have codes you can go ahead and\nredeem them.\n\n300\n00:16:23.475 --> 00:16:28.275\nSo some pretty cool options available to\nus, but for now I want to go ahead and\n\n301\n00:16:28.275 --> 00:16:30.075\ntake a look at the settings so\n\n302\n00:16:30.075 --> 00:16:34.670\nwe can just kind of poke around in\nthere to see what we have going on.\n\n303\n00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:40.530\nNow, by default your operating\nsystem is gonna check if you leave\n\n304\n00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:44.920\nthis enabled here for all your Microsoft\nStore, it will check everyday, so\n\n305\n00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.260\nif you want to go ahead and uncheck this,\nthen you'd have to manually configure that\n\n306\n00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:55.260\nalso to go ahead and call out and get\nupdates on those individual apps there.\n\n307\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.150\nAlso Live Tiles, if you wanted to save any\nkind of computing power on your actual\n\n308\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.757\nmachine, and I'm trying to\nthink if there's anything else.\n\n309\n00:17:03.757 --> 00:17:08.603\nYeah, and you definitely wanna keep this\noff if you have kids too, [LAUGH] for\n\n310\n00:17:08.603 --> 00:17:11.072\nyour purchase sign-in, right?\n\n311\n00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.465\nAnd this is pretty cool.\n\n312\n00:17:12.465 --> 00:17:14.220\nSo manage your devices.\n\n313\n00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.440\nSo like we were talking about, maybe Adam\nwants to go to different devices and\n\n314\n00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.400\ncheck them out.\n\n315\n00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:25.947\nWhat if he decides that he does not want\nto go ahead and, hold on, let me see here.\n\n316\n00:17:25.947 --> 00:17:30.665\n[COUGH] It's just gonna go ahead and\npull that up.\n\n317\n00:17:30.665 --> 00:17:34.265\nOkay, so I don't have anything,\n\n318\n00:17:34.265 --> 00:17:39.375\nwhen we had logged in as Adan it wasn't\nwith the Outlook account, or Live account.\n\n319\n00:17:40.755 --> 00:17:43.655\nIf I were logged in with an Outlook or\nLive account at the time of\n\n320\n00:17:43.655 --> 00:17:47.765\nthis recording, that's the two\ndomains that they use for that, or\n\n321\n00:17:47.765 --> 00:17:53.050\nthe two types of accounts, I should say,\nit would go ahead and show the devices\n\n322\n00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:57.868\nthat have previously been using that\nparticular account there with those apps.\n\n323\n00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:59.002\nAll right.\n\n324\n00:18:02.695 --> 00:18:06.188\nSo let me show you guys here,\nDownloads and\n\n325\n00:18:06.188 --> 00:18:11.852\nupdates, Now, for each individual app, so\n\n326\n00:18:11.852 --> 00:18:17.183\nif I wanted to allow one app to behave\na little bit differently than the other,\n\n327\n00:18:17.183 --> 00:18:22.678\nlike this one that we had just installed,\nyou can go down at a level to go ahead and\n\n328\n00:18:22.678 --> 00:18:28.338\nmanipulate that a little bit more as well,\nthe ability to go ahead and launch it and\n\n329\n00:18:28.338 --> 00:18:33.340\nso forth, but what if you wanted that\napp to go ahead and run all the time,\n\n330\n00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:39.350\nmaybe at startup or something like that,\nor the transverse, opposite of that?\n\n331\n00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.679\nWhat if you had an application,\nimagine this, like it would never happen,\n\n332\n00:18:42.679 --> 00:18:45.644\nan application that would just launch\nup every time you started your\n\n333\n00:18:45.644 --> 00:18:46.543\ncomputer, right?\n\n334\n00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:48.788\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, so [LAUGH]-\n\n335\n00:18:48.788 --> 00:18:51.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] usually wanna stop those.\n\n336\n00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.240\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so that's what we're\ngonna take a look at here, Mike,\n\n337\n00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.120\nbecause I feel your pain.\n\n338\n00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.070\nWhat I'm gonna do is just, the Windows\nKey+I for just my settings option here,\n\n339\n00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:06.450\nand if I go under my Apps section,\nI can manage them here,\n\n340\n00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:10.360\nand of course, there are a lot\nof other things that I can do.\n\n341\n00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.580\nLike, I was poking around in\nthe Microsoft Store as well, and\n\n342\n00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.160\nyou do have a lot of other\nconfiguration options in your\n\n343\n00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:24.113\nsettings interface on a local machine,\nbut if you want to look at the behavior,\n\n344\n00:19:24.113 --> 00:19:28.170\nlike start-up behavior,\nyou do have this option here for startup.\n\n345\n00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:32.376\nNow, what we're looking at is the machines\nthat are currently enabled here for\n\n346\n00:19:32.376 --> 00:19:36.537\nthis startup, and you could go ahead and\nchange those if you wanted to as well.\n\n347\n00:19:36.537 --> 00:19:40.590\nOn this local machine though\nI don't have a lot going on.\n\n348\n00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.140\nThis is just a virtual machine, so\n\n349\n00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.850\non that local machine I haven't,\nI don't have a lot of apps going on.\n\n350\n00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:51.650\nNow, going back to back in the day,\nagain, an alternative we had\n\n351\n00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:56.520\nwhich provides a little more granular\noptions, in my opinion, I think if you\n\n352\n00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.432\ngo ahead and hit your Windows Run key,\nand then type in msconfig,\n\n353\n00:20:01.432 --> 00:20:07.430\nyou're gonna see more information\nabout your startup behavior there.\n\n354\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.290\nSo if you really wanted to ensure that\n\n355\n00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:16.245\na persistent application was not\ngonna be running during that\n\n356\n00:20:16.245 --> 00:20:21.140\nstartup process,\nthen you could go ahead and use MSconfig.\n\n357\n00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.567\nSo, if you look at this tab right here,\nunder the Startup tab, okay, so\n\n358\n00:20:25.567 --> 00:20:30.213\nsomewhere along the way, I think it\nwas Windows 8, they have a pop-out for\n\n359\n00:20:30.213 --> 00:20:31.542\ntask manager there.\n\n360\n00:20:33.679 --> 00:20:37.570\nAnd then you can take a look\nat your startup options.\n\n361\n00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.995\nSo it's kind of cool how in this\ncolumn right here they say,\n\n362\n00:20:40.995 --> 00:20:42.982\nwell what's the startup impact,\n\n363\n00:20:42.982 --> 00:20:47.575\nbecause certain applications are gonna\nrequire computing power to go ahead and\n\n364\n00:20:47.575 --> 00:20:52.232\nlaunch and spin up, which can not so\nmuch nowadays, but definitely in the past,\n\n365\n00:20:52.232 --> 00:20:55.780\nwould impact that overall,\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n366\n00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.538\n&gt;&gt; Time, yeah.\n\n367\n00:20:56.538 --> 00:20:58.393\nJust like, I don't wanna say boot time,\n\n368\n00:20:58.393 --> 00:21:00.891\nbecause that process is not\nactually during that boot.\n\n369\n00:21:00.891 --> 00:21:01.820\n&gt;&gt; It's the log-in time.\n\n370\n00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.158\n&gt;&gt; The log-in process, right.\n\n371\n00:21:03.158 --> 00:21:06.167\nSo that's something\nyou'd wanna be aware of.\n\n372\n00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:10.863\nAlso malware can sometimes hide in here,\nespecially if you don't you suspect\n\n373\n00:21:10.863 --> 00:21:13.923\nmalware this is probably\na good place to go ahead and\n\n374\n00:21:13.923 --> 00:21:18.637\ncheck just to make sure that it's not\nstarting from that initial onset there.\n\n375\n00:21:18.637 --> 00:21:22.900\nSo, also app history, things like that.\n\n376\n00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:27.790\nSo just be aware of yes, you do have\nthe really cool new settings UI to go\n\n377\n00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.310\nahead and manage your apps, but you also\nhave older tools at your disposal as well.\n\n378\n00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:38.990\nNow, what if you wanted to just prohibit\nusers from using a certain app,\n\n379\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:44.490\nin this particular objective an exam\nthey're not calling out AppBlocker\n\n380\n00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:48.540\nright now, so we're just like introducing\nto this idea, but AppBlocker is going to\n\n381\n00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:54.060\nbe a great way where you can actually\nprevent users from running certain apps,\n\n382\n00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:59.680\nor allowing them to run in\ncertain security capacities.\n\n383\n00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:05.360\nYou can also take advantage\nof GP Edit to go ahead and\n\n384\n00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.650\nblock access to run certain\napplications as well.\n\n385\n00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:11.944\nAs a matter of fact, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen.\n\n386\n00:22:20.317 --> 00:22:21.234\nAll right, give that a second.\n\n387\n00:22:21.234 --> 00:22:24.730\nWe'll go ahead and pull that up here.\n\n388\n00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.500\n&gt;&gt; And this is your local policy?\n\n389\n00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not actually taking\nadvantage of active directory here,\n\n390\n00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.470\nwhich would be the preferred method if\nyou were in a business environment.\n\n391\n00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.430\nI don't have that configured on this\nmachine, I don't think, but that's okay.\n\n392\n00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.826\nSo what we're gonna do is just\ntake a look at it I mean,\n\n393\n00:22:41.826 --> 00:22:45.372\nbecause in real life you can\nalso go ahead and set this for\n\n394\n00:22:45.372 --> 00:22:50.203\na local machine if you wanted to prevent\nthem, and what we're specifically\n\n395\n00:22:50.203 --> 00:22:54.378\nsetting is disabling the action\nof accessing the Windows Store.\n\n396\n00:22:54.378 --> 00:22:55.990\nSo if, for whatever reason,\n\n397\n00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.565\nmaybe your end [LAUGH] users were abusing\nthe Windows Store, something like that, or\n\n398\n00:23:00.565 --> 00:23:04.118\nmaybe that's just not in compliance\nwith your security policy.\n\n399\n00:23:04.118 --> 00:23:05.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, high security environment,\n\n400\n00:23:05.745 --> 00:23:08.135\nyou don't need unauthorized\napps being installed.\n\n401\n00:23:08.135 --> 00:23:10.427\nGosh knows what they're gonna\ndownload from the store,\n\n402\n00:23:10.427 --> 00:23:12.252\nprobably not even work-related, yeah so.\n\n403\n00:23:12.252 --> 00:23:13.382\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm so\n\n404\n00:23:13.382 --> 00:23:16.180\nglad you have confidence in-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n405\n00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.933\n&gt;&gt; But, true story.\n\n406\n00:23:17.933 --> 00:23:18.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n407\n00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:22.414\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what we're gonna take\na look at, and I got to, I am not,\n\n408\n00:23:22.414 --> 00:23:26.245\nI do not have a memory like Mike as\nfar as the exact [LAUGH] location, so\n\n409\n00:23:26.245 --> 00:23:27.476\nI have to drill down.\n\n410\n00:23:27.476 --> 00:23:31.217\nThis is going to be under\nour User Configuration and\n\n411\n00:23:31.217 --> 00:23:37.137\nthen from there we're gonna go ahead and,\ndoes look like I've even missed one.\n\n412\n00:23:37.137 --> 00:23:41.408\nI think it's under Administrative\nTemplates &gt; Windows Components,\n\n413\n00:23:41.408 --> 00:23:46.245\nwe'll go ahead and drill that down, and\nlet me just pull this out a little bit, so\n\n414\n00:23:46.245 --> 00:23:48.040\nwe can see what we're doing.\n\n415\n00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.500\nAs a matter of fact,\nI'll go fullscreen here.\n\n416\n00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.920\nAnd Windows Components &gt; Store folder.\n\n417\n00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.600\nI'll go ahead and find that.\n\n418\n00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.457\nRight here, that's our Store folder.\n\n419\n00:23:59.457 --> 00:24:05.130\nNow from in there you're gonna go ahead\nand open the turn off store applications.\n\n420\n00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:09.977\nSo right here, [SOUND] and\nthen you would go ahead and\n\n421\n00:24:09.977 --> 00:24:13.133\nedit that policy to enable it as,\n\n422\n00:24:13.133 --> 00:24:18.450\nwe're going to go ahead and\nenable it, and then hit OK.\n\n423\n00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:21.134\nEither Apply or OK,\nwhatever you are working with there.\n\n424\n00:24:21.134 --> 00:24:26.470\nBut, essentially, that would prevent\nthem from going to the Windows Store.\n\n425\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.370\nSo for whatever reason, if you\ndecided to do that, I think you know,\n\n426\n00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:34.050\nof course,\naside from actual registry hacks,\n\n427\n00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:38.180\nwhich are, you don't need to do\nthat if you're using your GP Edit,\n\n428\n00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.300\nor App Blocker, or something like\nthat to go ahead and prevent that.\n\n429\n00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:47.130\nBut just be familiar with the concept of\nyour Windows Store, Windows Store for\n\n430\n00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:52.650\nBusiness, Windows Store for Education,\nas well as your actual desktop apps.\n\n431\n00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:56.103\nI think that's the big take away\nhere is understanding the difference\n\n432\n00:24:56.103 --> 00:25:00.375\nbetween those two, and really how we could\ngo about accessing, and downloading, and\n\n433\n00:25:00.375 --> 00:25:03.149\ntaking advantage of that\nOffice 365 portal as well.\n\n434\n00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:04.948\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good, Cherokee.\n\n435\n00:25:04.948 --> 00:25:07.150\nAppreciate those great demonstrations.\n\n436\n00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.210\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n437\n00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.876\nSigning of for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n438\n00:25:11.876 --> 00:25:12.920\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n439\n00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.916\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n440\n00:25:13.916 --> 00:25:16.608\n[MUSIC]\n\n441\n00:25:16.608 --> 00:25:19.502\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\n\n442\n00:25:19.502 --> 00:25:24.507\nwatching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

California.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.685 --> 00:00:08.354\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:12.713\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:16.896\nwelcome to another exciting episode here\nat ITProTV, I'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:20.392\nToday we're installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10,\n\n7\n00:00:20.392 --> 00:00:22.876\npreparing for that 70-698 exam.\n\n8\n00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:26.006\nIn this episode, we're continuing\ntalking about configuring apps.\n\n9\n00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:29.010\nThis is part two, so if you missed\nthe first one, make sure you go back and\n\n10\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.862\ncheck that one out.\n\n11\n00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:31.805\nAnd here to continue on\nwith configuring apps,\n\n12\n00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:34.050\nin the studios is none other than Ms.\nCherokee Boose.\n\n13\n00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.369\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n14\n00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:37.672\nApps, more app stuff.\n\n15\n00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:39.551\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Lots to do with apps, right?\n\n16\n00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:40.297\n&gt;&gt; I know, but\n\n17\n00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:43.066\nthis is gonna be a little\nbit of a shift here.\n\n18\n00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:46.497\nIn the last show, like MIke said,\ncheck that out if you haven't, but\n\n19\n00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:48.548\nwe talked about different types of apps.\n\n20\n00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.925\nApplications versus apps\nwithin the App Store.\n\n21\n00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:56.019\nWe had our Windows Store for Business,\nWindows Store for Education, so\n\n22\n00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.641\nyou don't wanna miss that.\n\n23\n00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:00.285\nBut what if there's a situation,\nan instance,\n\n24\n00:01:00.285 --> 00:01:03.132\nwhere you might have an app\nthat you want installed?\n\n25\n00:01:03.132 --> 00:01:07.848\nMaybe it's a line of business\napplication that was created in-house.\n\n26\n00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:12.591\nAnd you don't wanna go ahead and have\nthat being housed inside that Windows.\n\n27\n00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:14.924\nAnd it's kind of a rigorous process.\n\n28\n00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:18.385\nI know we had to have,\neven with Apple, right?\n\n29\n00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:23.522\nSo they have to vet that app and\nmake sure that it's not\n\n30\n00:01:23.522 --> 00:01:28.431\nmalware and\nthat it's not violating their rules or\n\n31\n00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:32.708\npolicies in any way.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've seen that in the news a lot\n\n32\n00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:37.419\nlately with apps that are collecting data\nin the background, unbeknownst to you.\n\n33\n00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:38.831\nAnd plus it could be like you said,\n\n34\n00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:42.200\na line of business app that's really\nnot meant for public consumption.\n\n35\n00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.670\nThe general public wouldn't have\nanything to do with it, right?\n\n36\n00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.070\nIt has to be used in-house with\nour systems that access our data.\n\n37\n00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.030\nSo it doesn't make sense to put\nsomething like that in the store.\n\n38\n00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.210\nYet I still wanna be able to install\nit on our corporate laptops.\n\n39\n00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.210\n&gt;&gt; Right, so what do we do then?\n\n40\n00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.820\nWell, that's called side loading.\n\n41\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.890\nSo we can go ahead and bypass that\ntypical process if I want to just\n\n42\n00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.360\nkeep an application here\nwithin my environment bubble.\n\n43\n00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.970\nWe'll look at it in\na couple different ways.\n\n44\n00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.150\nWe'll look at it on a per-user basis as\nwell as a per device basis to go ahead and\n\n45\n00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.030\ninstall that application.\n\n46\n00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.928\nSo first let's go ahead and\ntake a look at our Windows settings just\n\n47\n00:02:23.928 --> 00:02:27.264\nto kind of see where\nthat UI setting would be.\n\n48\n00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:33.345\nTo go ahead and allow a user to actually\nrun an application that wasn't vetted or\n\n49\n00:02:33.345 --> 00:02:37.048\nobtained through that Microsoft store.\n\n50\n00:02:37.048 --> 00:02:39.300\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nhit the Windows key, I, or\n\n51\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.410\nyou could just launch it from that\nStart button at the bottom left corner.\n\n52\n00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.330\nSo under Settings, down in the bottom\nleft corner we have Update and Security.\n\n53\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.350\nWe'll go ahead and launch that.\n\n54\n00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.790\nTowards the bottom,\nthere's a blade that's labeled For\n\n55\n00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.210\nDevelopers in the left hand side.\n\n56\n00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.731\nWe'll go ahead and\npop that out, all right.\n\n57\n00:03:01.363 --> 00:03:06.093\nSo currently the radio button is selected\nto allow whoever is logged in on\n\n58\n00:03:06.093 --> 00:03:11.067\nthis computer, I can't remember if\nit's Fred or Wilma, one of those two.\n\n59\n00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:12.662\nBut we can go ahead and\n\n60\n00:03:12.662 --> 00:03:16.110\nobtain apps from the Microsoft store.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n61\n00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.143\nby default that's all you can do, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n62\n00:03:18.143 --> 00:03:19.716\n&gt;&gt; You can't get apps from anywhere else,\n\n63\n00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:21.433\nthey have to come from\nthe Microsoft store.\n\n64\n00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:22.086\n&gt;&gt; Unless,\n\n65\n00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:25.740\nyou change this little\nradio button right here.\n\n66\n00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:33.130\nThere's also another option here for\nmore advanced options for developer mode.\n\n67\n00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.610\nSo let's take a look at\nthe difference there.\n\n68\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.190\nSo when we even work with\nour side loaded apps.\n\n69\n00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.931\nAnd you'll see this little pop-up here,\nit says, installing and\n\n70\n00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:46.066\nrunning apps from outside the Microsoft\nStore could expose your device and\n\n71\n00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:49.036\npersonal data to security risks or\nharm your device.\n\n72\n00:03:49.036 --> 00:03:50.920\nLet me just zoom in a little bit so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n73\n00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.450\nAnd then it asks, look,\ndo you wanna turn this on?\n\n74\n00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.620\nJust giving you a heads up there.\n\n75\n00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.140\nSo we're gonna ahead and say yes.\n\n76\n00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.550\nBut just like Mike was saying, there is\na vulnerability associated with that, so\n\n77\n00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.850\nyou really have to know and\ntrust the source of that application.\n\n78\n00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.660\nIn this particular show, we'll be\nlooking at an app that Mike has and\n\n79\n00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.235\nI trust Mike, so far.\n\n80\n00:04:18.235 --> 00:04:23.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She trusts me.\n\n81\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.710\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to say yes for\n\n82\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.240\nthis moment in time.\n\n83\n00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.770\nSo developer mode is going to go ahead and\nlet you install any signed and\n\n84\n00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.340\ntrusted app and\nuse advanced development features.\n\n85\n00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.070\nSo that's a little bit outside\nthe scope for this exam, so\n\n86\n00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.230\nwe'll just be looking at\nsideloading those apps right now.\n\n87\n00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.320\nLet me just close out of here.\n\n88\n00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.720\nNow doing that on a per user basis, you\nknow, for here, for the demo that's fine.\n\n89\n00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.570\nBut what if you had a lot of users?\n\n90\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.530\nAnd you wanted to go ahead and\nbe more efficient with your time\n\n91\n00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.000\nyou could take a look at things like\ngroup policy within Active Directory.\n\n92\n00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.640\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nshow you that location or that path.\n\n93\n00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.140\nThat's going to be here with\nour GPedit.MSC, to go ahead and\n\n94\n00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:20.060\nlaunch up our local policy,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n95\n00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.394\nYou could also use a local\npolicy to go ahead and\n\n96\n00:05:24.394 --> 00:05:28.405\nset this for users or the entire computer.\n\n97\n00:05:28.405 --> 00:05:31.744\nFor this particular local machine as well.\n\n98\n00:05:31.744 --> 00:05:33.910\nOkay, so where's that gonna be located?\n\n99\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.695\nLet's see, Computer Configuration,\nso in this first note up here.\n\n100\n00:05:36.695 --> 00:05:38.675\nLet me zoom in so you guys can follow.\n\n101\n00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:41.700\nAnd I probably will need to\npull this out a little bit.\n\n102\n00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.485\nSo that's going to be policies and\nthen administrative templates.\n\n103\n00:05:46.485 --> 00:05:50.410\nOkay I don't see the,\nlocal computer policy, bump this out,\n\n104\n00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.770\nadministrative templates.\n\n105\n00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.938\nSo from in there we have Windows\ncomponents towards the bottom and\n\n106\n00:05:56.938 --> 00:06:00.285\nthen inside of that we have\nApp Package Deployment.\n\n107\n00:06:00.285 --> 00:06:03.130\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nzoom out a little bit.\n\n108\n00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.325\nSo we can take a look\nat these offerings or\n\n109\n00:06:05.325 --> 00:06:08.562\npolicies that we have available\nto go ahead and configure.\n\n110\n00:06:11.023 --> 00:06:13.703\nAllow deployment operations\nin special profiles.\n\n111\n00:06:13.703 --> 00:06:16.820\nAllow development of\nWindows Store apps and\n\n112\n00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.490\ninstalling them from an integrated device.\n\n113\n00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.880\nNow a couple of different options here.\n\n114\n00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.648\nSo you just wanna make sure,\nallow all trusted apps to install.\n\n115\n00:06:25.648 --> 00:06:29.370\nSo kind of looking at that developer\noption that we used and seen before.\n\n116\n00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.300\nAllow a Windows app to share\napplication data between users.\n\n117\n00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.200\nSo there was a communal type app and\n\n118\n00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.300\nit had some kind of binary or payload\nassociated with that you wanted to access.\n\n119\n00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.555\nSo just looking at those knowing\nit's another viable options for us.\n\n120\n00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:52.810\nBut we do have to allow the user\nto side load in order for\n\n121\n00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:59.670\nour other tools to be able to execute to\nget that app actually installed, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.540\nSo, the first thing that\nwe'll take a look at here\n\n123\n00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.550\nis going to be installing via PowerShell.\n\n124\n00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.960\nAnd, actually, let me just go ahead and\n\n125\n00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.040\npull up a browser so\nwe can take a look at some apps.\n\n126\n00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.610\nI have some notes there but\nlet me just go ahead and\n\n127\n00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.100\nlet's pull up Microsoft's page so\nyou can see the difference.\n\n128\n00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:31.370\nThat one's going to be Add-AppxPackage.\n\n129\n00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.210\nAlso you can use PowerShell,\nI used to go ahead and\n\n130\n00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.780\nlook at the associated commandlets for\nparticular module.\n\n131\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.620\nWe can also use help, get-help for\nthat particular module or\n\n132\n00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.050\ncommandlet whenever we get in there,\nso I'll do that.\n\n133\n00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.960\nBut, it is important to take\na look at the syntax for\n\n134\n00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.420\neach one of our PowerShell commandlets and\nthen as we continue with this demo.\n\n135\n00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:00.171\nYou'll notice that there's\na slight transposition\n\n136\n00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:05.087\nof the It's a little more fun for us.\n&gt;&gt; Keep you on your toes.\n\n137\n00:08:05.087 --> 00:08:06.109\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n138\n00:08:06.109 --> 00:08:09.320\nSo, the reason I really\nwanted to point this out.\n\n139\n00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.920\nSo the first one that we're gonna be\nlooking at here is going to be this\n\n140\n00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.780\nparticular command that we'll be\nworking with the Add-AppxPackage.\n\n141\n00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:22.616\nSo what we're gonna be doing is installing\nthis application on for one user.\n\n142\n00:08:22.616 --> 00:08:27.152\nYou also have the ability to go ahead and\nuse PowerShell,\n\n143\n00:08:27.152 --> 00:08:33.311\nin a more comprehensive manner, to go\nahead and install for all of the users.\n\n144\n00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:38.424\nSo let's pull up another page here, and\nthis one's actually gonna be that one\n\n145\n00:08:38.424 --> 00:08:43.544\nthat you guys might have seen before,\nit's Add-AppxProvisionedPackage.\n\n146\n00:08:49.076 --> 00:08:54.364\nSo just know that there are two different\nways to go about installing that\n\n147\n00:08:54.364 --> 00:09:00.390\non a per user basis and then, here in\nPowerShell also, for an all user basis.\n\n148\n00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.300\nWe're also gonna look at a different way\nhow to go ahead and get that installed for\n\n149\n00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:08.720\nall users in this demo, because you\ncan use another tool called DISM.\n\n150\n00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.210\nAnd you guys should already\nbe familiar with that.\n\n151\n00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.010\nWe've seen it quite a bit\nthroughout this series.\n\n152\n00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.280\nAnd again, you could install that on\na per user or for all users, as well.\n\n153\n00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.410\nBut we're just kinda picking and choosing.\n\n154\n00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.500\nYou've got some homework to do,\nso have fun.\n\n155\n00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.900\nAll right, enough talking about it, let's\nactually go ahead and get started here.\n\n156\n00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.710\nWhat computer was I on?\n\n157\n00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.148\nI don't remember.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n\n158\n00:09:30.148 --> 00:09:30.678\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n159\n00:09:30.678 --> 00:09:33.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n160\n00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.235\n&gt;&gt; I think it was this one with two users.\n\n161\n00:09:36.235 --> 00:09:38.720\nNope, let's go back to the other one.\n\n162\n00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.900\nYeah, we'll do the single-user first.\n\n163\n00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.160\nGotta get it straightened out here.\n\n164\n00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:51.310\nOkay, so we're on a computer and I’ve\npulled up an administrative PowerShell.\n\n165\n00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:55.510\nAnd the first thing I just wanna\nshow you is, let's check to see\n\n166\n00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:00.230\nwhat kind of modules\nare installed on this system.\n\n167\n00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.790\nSo, I don't have a lot installed here,\nthis is kind of an empty VM,\n\n168\n00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.710\nI haven't worked with it a lot for\nthis particular machine.\n\n169\n00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:10.970\nSo, what we can do is install or\nimport that module.\n\n170\n00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:16.440\nSo this is going to be import-module,\n\n171\n00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.930\nand then you need to specify the\nparticular module that you wanna import.\n\n172\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.890\nThis one's gonna be our appx module, so\n\n173\n00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.890\nwe'll go ahead and import that,\ndouble check that we actually did.\n\n174\n00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.720\nDon't mind my capital E there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n175\n00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.610\n&gt;&gt; And then we can see it's\n\n176\n00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.600\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n177\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.670\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, we\n\n178\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.420\nwere talking about this before this show,\nPowerShell's pretty cool.\n\n179\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.310\nWe don't have to do this, but it is kind\nof a good to know type thing, right?\n\n180\n00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:40.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely recommend it,\n\n181\n00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.080\nespecially if you're gonna try to\nscript or automate, you might have\n\n182\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.220\nrun that command at the beginning to\nmake sure the module's available.\n\n183\n00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:51.330\nBut PowerShell nowadays, if the module's\nin its list available options,\n\n184\n00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.810\nyou type a command,\nit'll find it and import it, but\n\n185\n00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.570\nit's not something you wanna depend on.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n186\n00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.391\n&gt;&gt; Best things to do [CROSSTALK]-\n\n187\n00:10:57.391 --> 00:10:57.905\n&gt;&gt; Just check it.\n\n188\n00:10:57.905 --> 00:11:01.490\nYeah, it took all of what,\n0.5 seconds there, so yeah.\n\n189\n00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.610\nAll right, I'm trying to think,\nthere is a couple of other get help\n\n190\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.020\ntype of things that I wanted\nto go ahead and show you.\n\n191\n00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.660\nSo let's take a look at, I did it again.\n\n192\n00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.210\nAll right, actually let me go ahead and\nclear my screen.\n\n193\n00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.880\nLet's go full screen to get\nourselves a little more space here.\n\n194\n00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:25.660\nSo the first one I wanna go ahead and\ntake a look at here is Get-help.\n\n195\n00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.361\nAnd this is going to be Add and\n\n196\n00:11:29.361 --> 00:11:34.612\nthen AppxPackage and I can tab through.\n\n197\n00:11:34.612 --> 00:11:37.665\nAnd I wanna go ahead and\n\n198\n00:11:37.665 --> 00:11:43.189\nuse an examples parameter, all right.\n\n199\n00:11:43.189 --> 00:11:44.439\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n200\n00:11:44.439 --> 00:11:46.150\n&gt;&gt; Infinite, infinite.\n\n201\n00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.620\nIt'll give you some help,\nright, just not all of it.\n\n202\n00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah okay, Mike's kinda,\n\n203\n00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:54.050\noops, vetoing me on my info no.\n\n204\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.980\nI wanted to show you, I think I might\nhave it actually on my other machine.\n\n205\n00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.680\nLet me just check that real quick.\n\n206\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.020\nThe only reason,\nyou guys can look this up online.\n\n207\n00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.860\nThe only reason I wanted to\nshow that was simply because\n\n208\n00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.420\nI think I had a nice little example.\n\n209\n00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.930\nWe're gonna be looking of examples anyway,\nbut let me just see if it's on here.\n\n210\n00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:22.760\nIf not, we'll move on.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n211\n00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.291\nthat was just.\n&gt;&gt; It's too slow.\n\n212\n00:12:24.291 --> 00:12:26.840\n&gt;&gt; With powershell you get limited help,\n\n213\n00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.180\nyou have to go and pull the help.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I hadn't done that for\n\n214\n00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.130\nthat particular machine, and\nit does take a little bit of time, so\n\n215\n00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.130\nMike's like, Cherokee, just don't.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n216\n00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm trying to be patient here with\n\n217\n00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:43.782\nmy tab because I'm getting ahead of myself\nor ahead of PowerShell I should say.\n\n218\n00:12:43.782 --> 00:12:44.585\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n219\n00:12:44.585 --> 00:12:48.894\nthat's easy to do sometimes on these\nmachine, but I know once it starts pulling\n\n220\n00:12:48.894 --> 00:12:52.580\nthose help files down, it can take\na little bit to get all that down.\n\n221\n00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we don't want to wait for that.\n\n222\n00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.290\nWhy would someone wanna wait?\n\n223\n00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.252\nLike right now.\n\n224\n00:12:57.252 --> 00:12:58.820\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n225\n00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.830\n&gt;&gt; Anyways.\n\n226\n00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.750\nAdd dash package and\nthen add our examples perimeter.\n\n227\n00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.255\nLet's see if it's on here.\n\n228\n00:13:07.255 --> 00:13:12.132\nBoy, this machine is kinda slow.\n&gt;&gt; Some hours on there.\n\n229\n00:13:12.132 --> 00:13:13.209\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n230\n00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:14.281\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n231\n00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.722\n&gt;&gt; All right, so it's searching,\n\n232\n00:13:17.722 --> 00:13:20.600\nlet's see if it'll find anything for\nus, hopefully.\n\n233\n00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.950\nIf it doesn't that's okay though.\n\n234\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.566\nBecause we're gonna do it anyways,\nwe cover that.\n\n235\n00:13:24.566 --> 00:13:28.590\nOkay, moving on.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n236\n00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.402\n&gt;&gt; We've spent enough time there.\n\n237\n00:13:30.402 --> 00:13:33.030\nAll right, so what we're gonna do\nis go ahead and clear the screen.\n\n238\n00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:40.690\nOkay, first of all, let me tell you\nabout that package that we have.\n\n239\n00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.590\nMinimize this, and there's actually one\nthing that we do need to do before we\n\n240\n00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:50.540\ncan be successful with our app\npackage installation here.\n\n241\n00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.390\nSo told you guys about an app\nthat Mike had shared with me.\n\n242\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.970\nI'm gonna share it with you.\n\n243\n00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:00.005\nIt's actually sitting here on my C drive,\ncalled Demo_App.\n\n244\n00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.530\nLet me zoom in.\n\n245\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:08.580\nSo inside,\nwe talk about these app packages and\n\n246\n00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:14.520\nwe have other shows too, taking a look at\ndifferent ways we can work with packages.\n\n247\n00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:19.220\nSo actually let me just zoom out and\n\n248\n00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.850\nwe'll add our file extensions here,\nfilename extensions.\n\n249\n00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:24.800\nPull this over so\n\n250\n00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.530\nwe can see a little more specifically\nwhat it is we're working with here.\n\n251\n00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.380\nThis is the actual appx bundle, so\n\n252\n00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:39.850\nthis'll be that app itself that we wanna\ngo ahead and pull when we're installing.\n\n253\n00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.644\nThis is the certificate for\nthis application, so\n\n254\n00:14:44.745 --> 00:14:50.345\nalthough this is an in-house application,\nit still needs a certificate.\n\n255\n00:14:50.345 --> 00:14:53.035\nSo even if it's a self-signed\ncertificate that's okay,\n\n256\n00:14:53.035 --> 00:14:55.505\nwe just have to take care of that and\nget that installed.\n\n257\n00:14:55.505 --> 00:14:57.700\nSo that's what we're gonna do first.\n\n258\n00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.330\nAlso we have a couple dependencies.\n\n259\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.510\nYour app may or may not have dependencies.\n\n260\n00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.751\nWe're gonna be working here in our 64-bit,\nand\n\n261\n00:15:06.751 --> 00:15:11.210\nwe have two that we need to take\ncare of with this install as well.\n\n262\n00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:17.670\nAll right, for now let's go ahead and\nget that cert installed.\n\n263\n00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:18.685\nSo, I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n264\n00:15:18.685 --> 00:15:21.880\ndouble-click which will\nlaunch my little wizard here.\n\n265\n00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:27.409\nTo make sure that I'm installing\nit in the proper location.\n\n266\n00:15:27.409 --> 00:15:30.290\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nhit install certificate.\n\n267\n00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:36.220\nNow when you come to this screen here,\nit gives you a couple different options.\n\n268\n00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.540\nFirst door location, either on the current\nuser, or on the local machine.\n\n269\n00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.730\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nchange that to local machine.\n\n270\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.040\nThat is what this app where\nthe location needs to go ahead and\n\n271\n00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.280\nreside on that local machine instead\nof just for one specific user here.\n\n272\n00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.414\nWe're going to hit next, and\nallow that with my UAC, and\n\n273\n00:15:54.414 --> 00:15:57.616\nthere are a couple different options here.\n\n274\n00:15:57.616 --> 00:15:58.283\nYou could,\n\n275\n00:15:58.283 --> 00:16:02.825\none choice is to automatically select to\nlet the operating system automatically\n\n276\n00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:07.518\nselect the certificate Certificate store\nbased on what type of certificate it is.\n\n277\n00:16:07.518 --> 00:16:12.074\nWe're gonna just make sure that it gets\ninto the location that we needed to be in,\n\n278\n00:16:12.074 --> 00:16:15.357\nwhich is going to be under that\ntrusted root right here, so\n\n279\n00:16:15.357 --> 00:16:17.999\nwe're just gonna pop that in.\n&gt;&gt; Good idea with\n\n280\n00:16:17.999 --> 00:16:18.800\nself-signed certificates.\n\n281\n00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.608\nSometimes the operating system looks at\nit and says, wait, issued to Michael,\n\n282\n00:16:22.608 --> 00:16:24.539\nissued by Michael.\n&gt;&gt; Hm, sounds fishy.\n\n283\n00:16:24.539 --> 00:16:25.365\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's\n\n284\n00:16:25.365 --> 00:16:27.858\ndefinitely not gonna put that in\nthe trusted root by default, yeah.\n\n285\n00:16:27.858 --> 00:16:29.915\nSo we kinda force it to or\nwe tell it, no, it's okay.\n\n286\n00:16:29.915 --> 00:16:30.725\nWe trust it.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n287\n00:16:30.725 --> 00:16:33.535\nthe operating system doesn't trust you but\nI should.\n\n288\n00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:34.631\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You do, yes, you should, yes.\n\n289\n00:16:34.631 --> 00:16:35.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n290\n00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.600\nwe're just gonna hit Finish for now.\n\n291\n00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.700\nSo now our certificate is installed.\n\n292\n00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.880\nYou can see that that\nimport was successful.\n\n293\n00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:49.085\nWe'll hit OK, and then OK,\nand we should be good to go.\n\n294\n00:16:49.085 --> 00:16:52.174\nWe'll just minimize this in\ncase some reason we need it.\n\n295\n00:16:52.174 --> 00:16:55.700\nLike it would be super hard to\njust launch a File Explorer again.\n\n296\n00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.308\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n297\n00:16:56.308 --> 00:16:57.001\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why I do that.\n\n298\n00:16:57.001 --> 00:16:58.046\n&gt;&gt; So far you've enabled side\n\n299\n00:16:58.046 --> 00:16:58.824\nloading.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n300\n00:16:58.824 --> 00:17:00.158\n&gt;&gt; And you've installed the certificate\n\n301\n00:17:00.158 --> 00:17:01.661\nthat was used to digitally\nsign the packet.\n\n302\n00:17:01.661 --> 00:17:02.289\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n303\n00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:04.829\nnow we can actually sideload.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n304\n00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.748\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, so what we need to do is\n\n305\n00:17:07.748 --> 00:17:13.101\nuse cmdlet here, add -app,\noops, yep, that's not right.\n\n306\n00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:19.343\n[LAUGH] -app, and\nyou don't have to use capitalization.\n\n307\n00:17:19.343 --> 00:17:22.656\nAnd as a matter of fact,\nI will Tab through,\n\n308\n00:17:22.656 --> 00:17:24.321\nlike Mike says.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n309\n00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:26.500\n&gt;&gt; For me, I just have always-\n\n310\n00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.900\n&gt;&gt; You're a much better typer than I am,\n\n311\n00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.710\nI think.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know about that.\n\n312\n00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.373\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna go add-AppxPackage.\n\n313\n00:17:32.373 --> 00:17:35.893\nNow here we can specify the path.\n\n314\n00:17:35.893 --> 00:17:38.279\nThe operating system is\na little bit smarter than me,\n\n315\n00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:41.101\nespecially with trusting people, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n316\n00:17:41.101 --> 00:17:42.634\n&gt;&gt; So it would know if I'm\n\n317\n00:17:42.634 --> 00:17:45.170\nspecifying an actual path here.\n\n318\n00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:49.480\nBut also, you could say dash\npath just to let it know.\n\n319\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.300\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n320\n00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.890\nWe're gonna say our path is,\nwell, you already know.\n\n321\n00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:54.810\nYou just saw where it was.\n\n322\n00:17:54.810 --> 00:18:00.703\nIt was under that C:// drive and, let me,\nI'm gonna go ahead and Tab through.\n\n323\n00:18:00.703 --> 00:18:02.703\nAll right, because I wasn't 100% sure.\n\n324\n00:18:02.703 --> 00:18:07.480\nAnd that's exactly why, like Mike, you'll\nhear him talking always about tabbing\n\n325\n00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.000\nthrough here inside of PowerShell\nbecause it provides correct information.\n\n326\n00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.150\n&gt;&gt; I make a lot of typos, and\n\n327\n00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.150\nyou hate to get to the end\nof a long command and\n\n328\n00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:19.013\nrealize you made a typo way back when.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what happens to me.\n\n329\n00:18:19.013 --> 00:18:24.670\n[LAUGH] So, yes, do as I say,\nnot as I do, how about that?\n\n330\n00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.858\nSo we have demo app going here,\n\n331\n00:18:26.858 --> 00:18:31.073\nthat's the folder where that\nactual app x bundle resides.\n\n332\n00:18:31.073 --> 00:18:36.706\nSo now if we go ahead, and let me see if\nI start typing this in, that was demo.\n\n333\n00:18:38.974 --> 00:18:41.450\nIt should be enough, let's see.\n\n334\n00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.564\nWe can Tab through the different files.\n\n335\n00:18:43.564 --> 00:18:46.014\nLike you might have that app manifest and\n\n336\n00:18:46.014 --> 00:18:50.480\nthe dependency folder was inside of\nthat app demo or demo app folder.\n\n337\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.950\nSo let's just make sure\nwe have the correct one.\n\n338\n00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.140\nAnd that's why I wanted to\nshare that file extension so\n\n339\n00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.010\nyou could just kind of look at that and\n\n340\n00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:03.530\nunderstand that that .appxbundle's\nthe one we needed to grab there.\n\n341\n00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.720\nBut that wasn't all for\nthis particular app.\n\n342\n00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.090\nRemember, we said there were two\ndependencies that we needed to go ahead\n\n343\n00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.100\nand install as well.\n\n344\n00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.610\nSo let's do that.\n\n345\n00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:18.170\nWhat we're gonna do is add a dependency\npath parameter to just let the system know\n\n346\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.730\nbecause it's not that smart, all right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n347\n00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:21.570\n&gt;&gt; So it doesn't know\n\n348\n00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:24.100\nthat this particular app\nhas two dependencies.\n\n349\n00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.860\nOtherwise you would get red\ntext just letting you know\n\n350\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.100\nthat it hadn't been successful there.\n\n351\n00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.992\nSo we need to also specify that path.\n\n352\n00:19:33.992 --> 00:19:39.511\nSo here we're gonna go ahead and say, C:\\,\n\n353\n00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:44.332\nwhoops, make sure our syntax is right.\n\n354\n00:19:44.332 --> 00:19:49.693\nAnd again, that's going to be\ninside of our demo app folder.\n\n355\n00:19:49.693 --> 00:19:54.124\nAnd this is going to be demo, wait,\n\n356\n00:19:54.124 --> 00:19:57.321\ndependencies.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n357\n00:19:57.321 --> 00:20:03.508\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep, All right,\n\n358\n00:20:03.508 --> 00:20:07.474\nand now, demo, and we can Tab through.\n\n359\n00:20:07.474 --> 00:20:10.405\nWas that how it started?\n&gt;&gt; I think x64.\n\n360\n00:20:10.405 --> 00:20:12.114\n&gt;&gt; That's right because we had those four\n\n361\n00:20:12.114 --> 00:20:15.610\ndifferent options, depending on what\ntype of system we were working with.\n\n362\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:20.280\nWhich that's cool because if you think\nabout working with different devices,\n\n363\n00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.830\nthat app does have some flexibility there.\n\n364\n00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:23.820\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n365\n00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.620\nYou do wanna grab the one appropriate for\n\n366\n00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.890\nyour system there.\n&gt;&gt; I think it's x64.\n\n367\n00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.712\n&gt;&gt; What would I do without you, Mike?\n\n368\n00:20:31.712 --> 00:20:32.516\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n369\n00:20:32.516 --> 00:20:35.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not have this app installed\n\n370\n00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.663\napparently.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n371\n00:20:36.663 --> 00:20:38.395\n&gt;&gt; All right, oops,\n\n372\n00:20:38.395 --> 00:20:41.325\nShift+Tab to bring that back.\n\n373\n00:20:41.325 --> 00:20:42.464\nI think that's one we need.\n\n374\n00:20:42.464 --> 00:20:47.491\nThe net.coreruntime was\none of those dependencies,\n\n375\n00:20:47.491 --> 00:20:53.290\nso let's use that one, and\nthe other location was in the same.\n\n376\n00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.145\nSo the first part here for our C:\\,\nand we'll go through that whole\n\n377\n00:20:57.145 --> 00:21:02.260\ndemoapp\\dependencies.\n\n378\n00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.390\nAnd there that's gonna be x64 here.\n\n379\n00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.730\nAnd then that's also going to be,\nI start typing Microsoft.\n\n380\n00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:12.960\nLet's Tab through.\n\n381\n00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:19.290\nThe second one is that .vcl\nlibrary debug fileware, so\n\n382\n00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:23.858\nthat's when we wanna go ahead, those two.\n&gt;&gt; Cool with that one parameter dependency\n\n383\n00:21:23.858 --> 00:21:26.840\npath, you can specify\nmulitple dependencies.\n\n384\n00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.925\nI'ts just a comma separated value list or\n\n385\n00:21:29.925 --> 00:21:32.240\narray.\n&gt;&gt; You can do that with so\n\n386\n00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.820\nmany things here inside of PowerShell.\n\n387\n00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:39.760\nSo that's really cool, just taking\nadvantage of the power of PowerShell.\n\n388\n00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.531\nOkay, deployment operation progress here.\n\n389\n00:21:45.531 --> 00:21:48.262\nLet's just go ahead and\nsee if we're successful.\n\n390\n00:21:48.262 --> 00:21:49.832\n&gt;&gt; May as well keep the fingers crossed,\n\n391\n00:21:49.832 --> 00:21:50.862\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Fingers crossed.\n\n392\n00:21:50.862 --> 00:21:52.204\nAre you only supoosed to do one or\n\n393\n00:21:52.204 --> 00:21:52.978\ndoes it-\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n394\n00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:54.730\nDoes one counteract the other?\n&gt;&gt; I think\n\n395\n00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.550\nit does.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n\n396\n00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.200\n&gt;&gt; That's the folklore.\n\n397\n00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.980\n&gt;&gt; But we know what's required, right?\n\n398\n00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.530\nWe've enabled sideloading,\nso that's all good.\n\n399\n00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.380\nWe trust the certificate that was used\nto sign the app, so we're good there.\n\n400\n00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.290\nAnd we told it where to find both of\nthe things that this app depends on, so\n\n401\n00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.730\nthat if the computer doesn't have it,\nit can install those.\n\n402\n00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.322\nSo we really should be good.\n&gt;&gt; Should.\n\n403\n00:22:14.322 --> 00:22:16.666\n&gt;&gt; Now it's down to who wrote the app and\n\n404\n00:22:16.666 --> 00:22:18.560\nwhether the app's any good.\n\n405\n00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.162\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE].\n\n406\n00:22:19.162 --> 00:22:20.178\nOops, we're in trouble.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n407\n00:22:20.178 --> 00:22:21.358\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n408\n00:22:21.358 --> 00:22:23.428\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you know what?\n\n409\n00:22:23.428 --> 00:22:25.382\nWe should probably test the app too,\nright?\n\n410\n00:22:25.382 --> 00:22:25.898\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n411\n00:22:25.898 --> 00:22:26.589\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n412\n00:22:26.589 --> 00:22:27.177\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n413\n00:22:27.177 --> 00:22:27.950\nmaybe not.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n414\n00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:31.710\n&gt;&gt; I am not a developer, so\n\n415\n00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:36.370\nI'm not claiming this app is worth a hoot.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n416\n00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:44.248\nlet's just go ahead and minimize that and\nlet's just take a gander here.\n\n417\n00:22:44.248 --> 00:22:50.593\nAll right, so let me see here, for\nour demo one, I can't remember.\n\n418\n00:22:50.593 --> 00:22:51.764\nThat's it?\n&gt;&gt; That's the one.\n\n419\n00:22:51.764 --> 00:22:54.244\n&gt;&gt; Okay, for the name of it there.\n\n420\n00:22:54.244 --> 00:22:56.222\nWe don't have a little logo.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't get too creative.\n\n421\n00:22:56.222 --> 00:22:57.167\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say.\n\n422\n00:22:57.167 --> 00:22:59.307\n[LAUGH] You should put your picture or\n\n423\n00:22:59.307 --> 00:23:02.493\nsomething there, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; It took me about three days just to\n\n424\n00:23:02.493 --> 00:23:04.044\nget the app to actually work, so\n\n425\n00:23:04.044 --> 00:23:05.750\nthat was as far as I went.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n426\n00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.610\nlet me turn my volume up because\nI think this is required.\n\n427\n00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.310\nThings are gonna get serious here.\n\n428\n00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:13.263\nOkay, all right, I like the colors.\n\n429\n00:23:13.263 --> 00:23:15.057\nYou've a good little color scheme there.\n\n430\n00:23:15.057 --> 00:23:16.743\nIt says, Click Me.\n\n431\n00:23:16.743 --> 00:23:19.549\nSeems like very Alice in Wonderland-ish.\n&gt;&gt; Let's see,\n\n432\n00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:22.425\nyou've installed my certificate and\nnow you're getting\n\n433\n00:23:22.425 --> 00:23:25.110\nready to click something.\n&gt;&gt; I did it\n\n434\n00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:27.310\nprematurely while you were talking.\n\n435\n00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:34.376\nAnd I can't hear it, but that's because\nI'm plugged into our studio system.\n\n436\n00:23:34.376 --> 00:23:36.347\nDang it, it's okay.\n\n437\n00:23:36.347 --> 00:23:39.769\nWhat did your app do, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; It basically said, what did it say?\n\n438\n00:23:39.769 --> 00:23:44.539\nITPRO.TV is bingeworthy, in a nice\ncomputer voice like Stephen Hawking kinda-\n\n439\n00:23:44.539 --> 00:23:46.226\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that works on your show,\n\n440\n00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:47.035\nnot mine.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n441\n00:23:47.035 --> 00:23:49.200\n&gt;&gt; Anyways, the app is there,\n\n442\n00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.470\nyou guys saw it.\n\n443\n00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:51.483\nNothing up my sleeve here.\n\n444\n00:23:51.483 --> 00:23:52.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n445\n00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:52.904\nthat's the important thing, right?\n\n446\n00:23:52.904 --> 00:23:54.123\nNot what the app does.\n\n447\n00:23:54.123 --> 00:23:56.758\nThat thatt's not what\nwe're here to teach you.\n\n448\n00:23:56.758 --> 00:24:00.313\nIt's more about how do I take a line of\nbusiness app that was written in house,\n\n449\n00:24:00.313 --> 00:24:04.059\nthat hasn't gone through the process and\nhas been uploaded to the store?\n\n450\n00:24:04.059 --> 00:24:05.361\nHow How do I distribute that to users?\n\n451\n00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:08.573\nIf you just have a single\nuser that needs that app,\n\n452\n00:24:08.573 --> 00:24:12.850\nPowerShell and Add-AppxProvisionedPackage\nis the way to go.\n\n453\n00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:15.174\nI'm sorry, Add-AppxPackage, not Provision.\n\n454\n00:24:15.174 --> 00:24:16.448\nAdd-AppxPackage.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n455\n00:24:16.448 --> 00:24:18.935\nbecause the provisioning option for\nall users.\n\n456\n00:24:18.935 --> 00:24:23.583\nSo what we just did there was just for\nFred, we just installed the app for\n\n457\n00:24:23.583 --> 00:24:24.950\nFred's profile.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n458\n00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:28.659\nif you're writing your own application\njust for yourself, or like we said,\n\n459\n00:24:28.659 --> 00:24:32.255\njust for an individual user like you're\ndoing a testing process as you're\n\n460\n00:24:32.255 --> 00:24:35.793\ngoing through and developing that app,\nthat's how you'd install it for\n\n461\n00:24:35.793 --> 00:24:38.332\nthat one-user profile.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so how would we go ahead\n\n462\n00:24:38.332 --> 00:24:42.062\nand install that for multiple users, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; I hope there's another PowerShell\n\n463\n00:24:42.062 --> 00:24:44.518\ncommand we can use.\n&gt;&gt; There is, but\n\n464\n00:24:44.518 --> 00:24:49.062\nlet's also resolve those\ntwo PowerShell pages.\n\n465\n00:24:49.062 --> 00:24:52.925\nSo I want you guys to go ahead and do one\nof those for homework with that, yeah,\n\n466\n00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:56.970\nmulti-user, because I wanna take the time\nto go ahead and look at an oldie but\n\n467\n00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.570\ngoodie here with DISM.\n\n468\n00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.370\nSo let's look at how to go ahead and\ninstall that.\n\n469\n00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.370\nI do have a PowerShell, actually,\nthis one's not administrative, and\n\n470\n00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.960\nI'll just show you, you do need to have\nan administrative level to go ahead and\n\n471\n00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.200\nlaunch DISM.\n\n472\n00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.940\nBut you can run DISM right within\nPowerShell if you're running in\n\n473\n00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.820\nan administrative command or\nadministrative PowerShell session.\n\n474\n00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.995\nIf you type in DISM without, then, okay,\n\n475\n00:25:21.995 --> 00:25:27.217\nsometimes it'll pop up with a UAC and\nthen put it in a separate window.\n\n476\n00:25:27.217 --> 00:25:30.840\nIt didn't do that here but\nit's let me know what the problem is.\n\n477\n00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:34.221\nAnd like I said, it's because I don't\nhave an administrative PowerShell session\n\n478\n00:25:34.221 --> 00:25:35.765\npulled up here, so let's go ahead and\n\n479\n00:25:35.765 --> 00:25:43.034\ndo that.\n&gt;&gt; It make sense,\n\n480\n00:25:43.034 --> 00:25:45.583\nwe need administrative\ncredentials cuz now, with DISM,\n\n481\n00:25:45.583 --> 00:25:49.223\nit might gonna affect the entire operating\nsystem, other users, whenever we need\n\n482\n00:25:49.223 --> 00:25:53.610\nthose administrative rights.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, serious stuff, Mike.\n\n483\n00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:54.539\nYeah, [LAUGH].\n\n484\n00:25:54.539 --> 00:25:59.931\nOkay, so what we're gonna do here,\nagain, we're gonna launch into DISM and\n\n485\n00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:03.772\nalthough the screen is still\nblue with our white text and\n\n486\n00:26:03.772 --> 00:26:07.856\nwe're in a PowerShell session,\nwe actually are in DISM and\n\n487\n00:26:07.856 --> 00:26:13.140\nyou'll be able to see that with our\nactual commands that we're using here.\n\n488\n00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.392\nSo let me just see.\n\n489\n00:26:14.392 --> 00:26:20.973\nAll right, so what we're actually gonna\nbe doing is typing in DISM/online.\n\n490\n00:26:20.973 --> 00:26:26.659\nIf you have worked with DISM in the past,\nwe've worked with offline images,\n\n491\n00:26:26.659 --> 00:26:30.518\nespecially in this show,\nyou can work with online.\n\n492\n00:26:30.518 --> 00:26:35.422\nOnline, meaning, I'm making changes\nto the computer that is currently\n\n493\n00:26:35.422 --> 00:26:40.326\nrunning here with the operating system,\noffline would be if I had an image\n\n494\n00:26:40.326 --> 00:26:44.597\nwith different whims and\nI were adding drivers or app packages,\n\n495\n00:26:44.597 --> 00:26:49.290\nthings like that, I could go ahead and\nwork with them offline as well.\n\n496\n00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.547\nSo we're gonna work with this\nparticular computer that we're on,\n\n497\n00:26:53.547 --> 00:26:57.813\ninstead of some other image or\n.ppkg files, something like that.\n\n498\n00:26:57.813 --> 00:27:02.090\nAll right, so here,\nwe're talking about that syntax,\n\n499\n00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:06.035\nthis is where you really\nneed to pay attention.\n\n500\n00:27:06.035 --> 00:27:09.425\nIt's going to be add-provisioning,\n\n501\n00:27:09.425 --> 00:27:14.355\nall right, I spelt that correctly,\nand no space there,\n\n502\n00:27:14.355 --> 00:27:19.235\nprovisioningappxpackage, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Is it provisioning or\n\n503\n00:27:19.235 --> 00:27:22.720\nprovisioned?\n&gt;&gt; Provisioned.\n\n504\n00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.460\nThank you, Mike.\n\n505\n00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.779\nAnd I'm totally, I'm like,\n\n506\n00:27:24.779 --> 00:27:25.703\npay attention here.\n\n507\n00:27:25.703 --> 00:27:26.631\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right when I mess up.\n\n508\n00:27:26.631 --> 00:27:28.420\n&gt;&gt; Easy to do this, commands are very\n\n509\n00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.920\nsimilar and it's easy to get.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so ed,\n\n510\n00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.130\naddprovisionedappxpackage, okay.\n\n511\n00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.160\nSo go ahead and type that.\n\n512\n00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:44.063\nThen, we're gonna go ahead and instead of\nusing the dash path perimeter, remember,\n\n513\n00:27:44.063 --> 00:27:47.354\nDISM uses forward slashes here,\nso we're gonna ahead and\n\n514\n00:27:47.354 --> 00:27:51.330\nspecify package path to go ahead and\npoint into that location.\n\n515\n00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.720\nThis is a different machine.\n\n516\n00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.470\nAs a matter of fact, we don't have this\ncertificate installed on this machine.\n\n517\n00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:03.150\nSo, let me just minimize this before\nwe get too far ahead of ourselves here.\n\n518\n00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:11.830\nAnd I think this one, this bundle here\nis sitting on my C drive, hopefully.\n\n519\n00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.500\nDemo App, and Mike's App.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n520\n00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.400\n&gt;&gt; And we'll go ahead and\n\n521\n00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.300\nget this cert installed real quick.\n\n522\n00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.942\nSame thing you guys, we already saw this,\nwe talked about that.\n\n523\n00:28:21.942 --> 00:28:23.800\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ninstall it here for\n\n524\n00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.945\nour local machine in that trusted route.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n525\n00:28:27.945 --> 00:28:32.023\nif this was an enterprise environment and\nyou needed to install this app across\n\n526\n00:28:32.023 --> 00:28:36.226\nmultiple devices, you could use group\npolicy to distribute this certificate to\n\n527\n00:28:36.226 --> 00:28:39.389\nall your client machines.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then you wouldn't have to do\n\n528\n00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:41.436\nthis every single time, like tricky it is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n529\n00:28:41.436 --> 00:28:42.337\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n530\n00:28:42.337 --> 00:28:45.856\nso we'll go ahead and\nhit Next here, Finish.\n\n531\n00:28:47.086 --> 00:28:47.833\nAll right, good to go.\n\n532\n00:28:53.779 --> 00:28:56.965\nSo for our path, the syntax is\na little bit different here than,\n\n533\n00:28:56.965 --> 00:28:59.915\ndifferent than what we saw\nwithin PowerShell, and again,\n\n534\n00:28:59.915 --> 00:29:02.460\nif you've been working with DISM,\nyou know that.\n\n535\n00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:08.280\nIn DISM, you can't use your tab,\nthat tab that Mike was so proud of and\n\n536\n00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.810\ntalking about here, but he did show me\na really cool trick, so thank you Mike,\n\n537\n00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:15.120\nI'm gonna go ahead and share that here.\n&gt;&gt; Can you scroll up just a hair?\n\n538\n00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.755\nIt's getting ready to run\nright behind you there.\n\n539\n00:29:17.755 --> 00:29:19.579\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hold on, let's see.\n\n540\n00:29:19.579 --> 00:29:22.960\nLet's put it towards the top there.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n541\n00:29:24.105 --> 00:29:26.728\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what we're gonna do is,\n\n542\n00:29:26.728 --> 00:29:30.850\nwe're gonna borrow some real\nestate from the space bar.\n\n543\n00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.648\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nhit that Space Bar.\n\n544\n00:29:32.648 --> 00:29:37.820\nThen we're gonna go ahead and\nuse our c: and start typing in that path,\n\n545\n00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.830\nso that was going to be\nin out Demo_App folder.\n\n546\n00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:47.320\nAnd then here, we can tab through,\nlike we saw within PowerShell.\n\n547\n00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.690\nWe do need to come back and\ntake care of this, I would say,\n\n548\n00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:54.800\nwhite space but it's blue space\nhere in PowerShell, or DISM.\n\n549\n00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.910\nWe're technically in DISM, so\n\n550\n00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:58.890\ndon't forget that just because we have\na blue background, but we'll come back and\n\n551\n00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:00.070\nget ride of that space.\n\n552\n00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:04.840\nBut for now, we'll take advantage\nof our tabbing luxury, and\n\n553\n00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.340\nI just gotta remember what folder and\neverything whereas,\n\n554\n00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.315\nwhere in Demo_App here,\n&gt;&gt; It should be right in that folder,\n\n555\n00:30:13.315 --> 00:30:14.170\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n556\n00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.190\nthat one was going to be the demo.\n\n557\n00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:19.810\nOkay, let's tab through here.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n558\n00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:22.530\n&gt;&gt; Down to, oops, Shift + Tab to go back,\n\n559\n00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:28.221\nagain, to make sure you're grabbing that\nAppxBundle there, so we're good to go.\n\n560\n00:30:28.221 --> 00:30:36.370\nSo with DISM, we also need to specify,\nagain, our dependencies there.\n\n561\n00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:37.930\nLet me go ahead and see.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n562\n00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:41.430\ndo we need to point it to the dependencies\nlike we did with the PowerShell command?\n\n563\n00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:42.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do, Mike.\n\n564\n00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.261\nBut let's go ahead and\ntake care of some housekeeping,\n\n565\n00:30:45.261 --> 00:30:47.530\nbecause I have a memory\nof a goldfish here.\n\n566\n00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:50.945\nI'm just gonna go back and\nlet's get rid of that space,\n\n567\n00:30:50.945 --> 00:30:53.500\nthat we were taking advantage of.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n568\n00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.420\n&gt;&gt; And then, we can go ahead and\n\n569\n00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.190\nadd our dependencies.\n\n570\n00:30:56.190 --> 00:31:00.130\nSo a little bit different,\nagain, this is a different tool.\n\n571\n00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:04.720\nSo here, we're gonna go ahead and say,\n\n572\n00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.908\n/DependencyPackagePath here, so\n\n573\n00:31:08.908 --> 00:31:13.240\nlet's make sure we get that correct.\n\n574\n00:31:18.495 --> 00:31:20.980\nAll right,\njust checking my spelling there.\n\n575\n00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.200\nThat's always a big one.\n\n576\n00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:27.067\nDependencyPackagePath, and\nnow, remember, the colon, c:.\n\n577\n00:31:27.067 --> 00:31:32.316\nAnd again, we could, I am going to go\nahead and take advantage of that again.\n\n578\n00:31:32.316 --> 00:31:38.148\nThat's just gonna be \\demo, and\nthen that should find the Demo_App,\n\n579\n00:31:38.148 --> 00:31:43.020\nand then again, this is our-\n&gt;&gt; Dependencies folder?\n\n580\n00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.061\n&gt;&gt; Dependencies,\n\n581\n00:31:44.061 --> 00:31:46.520\nwhy do I have a brain fart with that one?\n\n582\n00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:52.921\nIt's dependencies and then that x64 like\nwe had said the location is the same here.\n\n583\n00:31:52.921 --> 00:31:56.389\nAnd then, that one was, I think,\nMicrosoft, did we get that far?\n\n584\n00:31:56.389 --> 00:32:03.850\nYes, so the first one here, again,\nis that .NET Core runtime dependency.\n\n585\n00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.358\nWe need to add that other one.\n\n586\n00:32:05.358 --> 00:32:10.361\nWe're not gonna go ahead and use that\nComma, like we did in power shells,\n\n587\n00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:15.862\nso we're going to go ahead and do\nthe same syntax, /dependentcypackagePath.\n\n588\n00:32:19.378 --> 00:32:23.218\nAnd then, oops,\nremind me about that space before, okay.\n\n589\n00:32:23.218 --> 00:32:24.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n590\n00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.561\n&gt;&gt; Give it a colon there, right?\n\n591\n00:32:25.561 --> 00:32:26.827\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then c:\\-\n\n592\n00:32:26.827 --> 00:32:29.610\n&gt;&gt; And while she's doing that,\n\n593\n00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:32.176\nI'm not a very good typer.\n\n594\n00:32:32.176 --> 00:32:36.161\nWhen I have long paths like this,\nI really like to use my tab autofill,\n\n595\n00:32:36.161 --> 00:32:39.201\nbecause even in this,\nwhere I'm in command prompt,\n\n596\n00:32:39.201 --> 00:32:43.866\nWindows might not autofill the commands,\nbut it will autofill paths, but the way\n\n597\n00:32:43.866 --> 00:32:48.057\nthis command works is the parameters\nthere's no space between the c: and\n\n598\n00:32:48.057 --> 00:32:51.736\nthat : in front of it, so\nit doesn't see it as the Windows path.\n\n599\n00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:55.384\nSo, I put a little space in there that way\nI can use my tab autofill to get those\n\n600\n00:32:55.384 --> 00:32:59.317\nlong paths, but you have to remember to go\nback and take that space out, otherwise\n\n601\n00:32:59.317 --> 00:33:02.366\nit's going to break the command, so-\n&gt;&gt; It's a great little, yeah.\n\n602\n00:33:02.366 --> 00:33:03.154\n&gt;&gt; It takes more than half a dozen or\n\n603\n00:33:03.154 --> 00:33:05.175\nto know that I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, so, one finger or\n\n604\n00:33:05.175 --> 00:33:06.682\ntwo fingers?\n&gt;&gt; I say we go with one.\n\n605\n00:33:06.682 --> 00:33:11.509\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, ding [LAUGH] okay.\n\n606\n00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:12.966\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n\n607\n00:33:12.966 --> 00:33:14.605\n&gt;&gt; All right, what do we got here?\n\n608\n00:33:14.605 --> 00:33:16.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n\n609\n00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:19.510\n&gt;&gt; Parameter, the disenlog file.\n\n610\n00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:22.644\nOkay, parameter error 87.\n\n611\n00:33:22.644 --> 00:33:24.477\nWell, let me go ahead, and take-\n&gt;&gt; Did we take the space out\n\n612\n00:33:24.477 --> 00:33:25.040\nof both of them?\n\n613\n00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:25.910\nWe did.\n\n614\n00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:30.668\nWhat about the, we might need that\nskip license command as well?\n\n615\n00:33:30.668 --> 00:33:33.708\n&gt;&gt; Yep, good one, Mike.\n\n616\n00:33:33.708 --> 00:33:36.700\nSo, because-\n&gt;&gt; I didn't make a licensing file for this\n\n617\n00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.200\nlittle demo app or anything like that.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n618\n00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.750\nI'm wondering if I can add this towards\nthe end here, let's go ahead and see.\n\n619\n00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:48.651\nWe're gonna also add, it's just saying,\nhey, we don't need a license there so it's\n\n620\n00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:52.873\n/skip, and then actually just license.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe a syntax error in there.\n\n621\n00:33:52.873 --> 00:33:54.716\nCan we take a closer look at that command?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do that Mike because,\n\n622\n00:33:54.716 --> 00:33:55.490\nobviously something was\na little bit off there.\n\n623\n00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:59.562\nSo, if we just go back-\n&gt;&gt; It was looking good-\n\n624\n00:33:59.562 --> 00:34:03.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, online /add-provisioningxpackage,\n\n625\n00:34:03.305 --> 00:34:07.143\nthat's by the path, and\nmaybe a spelling error-\n\n626\n00:34:07.143 --> 00:34:09.843\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Yep, looks like package\n\n627\n00:34:09.843 --> 00:34:13.813\nmight have an extra g in there.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's go a head and\n\n628\n00:34:13.813 --> 00:34:15.671\nget rid of that, and let's see here.\n\n629\n00:34:15.671 --> 00:34:17.824\nOops.\n\n630\n00:34:17.824 --> 00:34:22.578\n[SOUND] [LAUGH] I'm going the long way\nabout this, but we'll get there guys.\n\n631\n00:34:22.578 --> 00:34:25.094\nWe're actually almost finished here.\n\n632\n00:34:25.094 --> 00:34:26.407\nNo fingers crossed this time.\n\n633\n00:34:26.407 --> 00:34:28.912\nI think that jinxed us, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n634\n00:34:28.912 --> 00:34:31.480\n&gt;&gt; We'll give it a second and\n\n635\n00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:36.504\nsee what the outcome is now, [LAUGH] okay.\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n636\n00:34:36.504 --> 00:34:38.503\nWe didn't turn on side\nloading on this machine.\n\n637\n00:34:38.503 --> 00:34:40.025\nWe did it on the first machine.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n638\n00:34:40.025 --> 00:34:41.323\n&gt;&gt; We installed the certificate, but\n\n639\n00:34:41.323 --> 00:34:43.418\nwe didn't turn on side loading.\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n\n640\n00:34:43.418 --> 00:34:46.175\n[LAUGH] That's okay.\n\n641\n00:34:46.175 --> 00:34:48.420\nLet's just minimize and\nturn this on real quick.\n\n642\n00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.780\nWe're gonna get this.\n\n643\n00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.050\nHow far over are we on this show, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; Just a few minutes.\n\n644\n00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:56.212\nDefinitely worth it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n645\n00:34:56.212 --> 00:34:56.886\n&gt;&gt; It's good stuff, right?\n\n646\n00:34:56.886 --> 00:34:57.566\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.\n\n647\n00:34:57.566 --> 00:35:03.882\nOkay, so here we are in our settings,\nwe're going to go into our, geez,\n\n648\n00:35:03.882 --> 00:35:08.302\nhold on, it wasn't system, it was our-\n&gt;&gt; Wasn't it in security?\n\n649\n00:35:08.302 --> 00:35:10.648\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's, I'm not fullscreen.\n\n650\n00:35:10.648 --> 00:35:12.020\nMike, I'm all flustered now.\n\n651\n00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.358\nI'm like what is going on here?\n\n652\n00:35:14.358 --> 00:35:16.373\nLet's just go ahead-\n&gt;&gt; PowerShell will do that to you.\n\n653\n00:35:16.373 --> 00:35:17.991\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n654\n00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:21.318\n&gt;&gt; All right so here, for developers we're\n\n655\n00:35:21.318 --> 00:35:27.116\ngoing to go ahead, and [SOUND] Wilma.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n656\n00:35:27.116 --> 00:35:28.996\n&gt;&gt; Just peachy.\n\n657\n00:35:28.996 --> 00:35:33.295\nSo, Wilma is our admin on this computer.\n\n658\n00:35:33.295 --> 00:35:39.675\nFred is not, so this is is the concept\nof the principle least privilege here.\n\n659\n00:35:39.675 --> 00:35:42.570\nIn action I'm blocking my end users.\n\n660\n00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.453\nI'm being really efficient\nas being an admin, but\n\n661\n00:35:45.453 --> 00:35:48.750\nnot as being a demonstrator here for\nthis particular one.\n\n662\n00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:55.388\nBut let's go ahead and just pause for now,\nbecause it's gonna take me a minute to\n\n663\n00:35:55.388 --> 00:35:58.663\ngo ahead and get that syntax\npulled up under Wilma's account.\n\n664\n00:35:58.663 --> 00:35:59.423\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n665\n00:35:59.423 --> 00:36:00.655\n&gt;&gt; But we'll come back and\n\n666\n00:36:00.655 --> 00:36:01.829\njust show it working.\n\n667\n00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:04.691\nAll right, so I don't know,\nfingers crossed, not crossed,\n\n668\n00:36:04.691 --> 00:36:06.640\nwe're gonna go ahead and do it, Mike.\n\n669\n00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:12.154\nReady, set, go we're back here on Wilma\nlogged in, and we're going to test and\n\n670\n00:36:12.154 --> 00:36:18.152\nsee if that app is good to go there.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n671\n00:36:18.152 --> 00:36:19.769\nwe forgot to enable it this time.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n672\n00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.301\nOkay, hold on one second.\n\n673\n00:36:23.301 --> 00:36:27.981\nThis is because, again, I forgot\nto go ahead under Wilma's profile,\n\n674\n00:36:27.981 --> 00:36:31.805\nwhich also brings up a good point here for\nthis UI setting.\n\n675\n00:36:31.805 --> 00:36:35.435\nThis is going to be dependent\non a per user basis.\n\n676\n00:36:35.435 --> 00:36:40.400\nLet's go ahead and get that load app\nsetting, yes, we are allowing that.\n\n677\n00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.310\nYou guys have seen this.\n\n678\n00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.980\nLet's go ahead and minimize that.\n\n679\n00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.530\nLet me pull this back up.\n\n680\n00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.724\nWe'll go ahead and rerun that.\n\n681\n00:36:48.724 --> 00:36:49.990\nNo fingers crossed this time.\n\n682\n00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.250\nApparently, that's what's wrong.\n\n683\n00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:53.971\nNot anything else.\n\n684\n00:36:57.028 --> 00:36:58.078\nGive it a second there.\n\n685\n00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.960\nSo, this is the longest.\n\n686\n00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.375\nI was gonna say, this is the longest,\n\n687\n00:37:05.375 --> 00:37:08.310\nthe furthest we've gotten.\n&gt;&gt; It's\n\n688\n00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:09.864\na good,-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n689\n00:37:09.864 --> 00:37:11.482\n&gt;&gt; Demonstration in the fact that there's\n\n690\n00:37:11.482 --> 00:37:14.679\na lot of little things that you gotta do\nto get this side loading to work, right?\n\n691\n00:37:14.679 --> 00:37:18.770\nYou've gotta make sure that sideload\nis turned on, it's a per profile basis.\n\n692\n00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:20.900\nYou gotta make sure that\ncertificate's installed.\n\n693\n00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:25.074\nYou have to have administrative rights\nto run these commands, so it's good.\n\n694\n00:37:25.074 --> 00:37:26.412\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, it's not hard.\n\n695\n00:37:26.412 --> 00:37:30.795\nIt's a lot of typing, and like you said,\nlittle tiny bits to this, but\n\n696\n00:37:30.795 --> 00:37:32.416\nthere's nothing major.\n\n697\n00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:33.740\nI mean, so you guys saw it.\n\n698\n00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.860\nIt's actually not that difficult.\n\n699\n00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.768\nDefinitely take advantage of looking at\nthose two links that I shared with you to\n\n700\n00:37:39.768 --> 00:37:43.678\nunderstand the different syntax between\nthe PowerShell options as well in just\n\n701\n00:37:43.678 --> 00:37:47.438\nlooking at what you can do there, but\nI think that's about it for this show.\n\n702\n00:37:47.438 --> 00:37:48.754\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee,\n\n703\n00:37:48.754 --> 00:37:52.562\nwell really good look at side\nloading apps using PowerShell.\n\n704\n00:37:52.562 --> 00:37:55.403\nWe looked at doing that for\nan individual user,\n\n705\n00:37:55.403 --> 00:37:59.500\nas well as using DISM to provision\nthat for all users on that system.\n\n706\n00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.590\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n707\n00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.467\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n708\n00:38:02.467 --> 00:38:05.520\nSigning off from ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n709\n00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.458\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n710\n00:38:06.458 --> 00:38:10.901\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n711\n00:38:10.901 -->

00:00:12.535\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n4\n00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:15.289\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.130\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.030\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n7\n00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.760\nIn this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at provisioning packages, and\n\n8\n00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.630\nhere to teach about that\nis none other than Ms,\n\n9\n00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.410\nCherokee Boose, welcome, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, hows it going,\n\n10\n00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.820\nMike?\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, so provisioning packages,\n\n11\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.780\nit's new, isn't it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is actually a major paradigm\n\n12\n00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.860\nshift in how we really deploy and\nconfigure our systems.\n\n13\n00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.300\nI won't make it exclusive to enterprise\nenvironments because maybe there is some\n\n14\n00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.500\nkind of fringe case.\n\n15\n00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.270\nIt's not exclusive, but that's probably\nwhat you're gonna be using it for.\n\n16\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.070\nBut there are also situations where there\nare really a lot of different options,\n\n17\n00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.870\nwe have available to us,\nthey even have specific kiosks settings,\n\n18\n00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.200\nso I think it's really geared\ntowards workplace, but\n\n19\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.180\nI've seen a lot of activity in\nthe development of this tool recently.\n\n20\n00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.116\nSo I wouldn't be surprised if its\ncontinual evolution here with this\n\n21\n00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:20.272\ntool as time goes by and maybe something\nthat we use and see all the time.\n\n22\n00:01:20.272 --> 00:01:23.066\nSo it's definitely something\nto keep your eye out for\n\n23\n00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:27.251\nhere talking about provision packages,\nand what is a package anyway, right?\n\n24\n00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:27.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.930\n&gt;&gt; So, so far we've looked at all sorts of\n\n26\n00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.490\nthings centered around Windows 10,\nhow to go ahead and get them installed.\n\n27\n00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.920\nWe've learned about images, right?\n\n28\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.230\nSo images contain information,\nthe binary, the OS, to work with it.\n\n29\n00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.301\nAnd back in the day, and not even in\nthe too far past, we're just kind\n\n30\n00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:53.086\nof seeing this change, that's what you\nwould work with as a base or template.\n\n31\n00:01:53.086 --> 00:01:57.892\nAnd then you could deploy out an image,\nmaybe a generalized image,\n\n32\n00:01:57.892 --> 00:02:02.375\nusing a tool like Sysprep or\nwhat's the SIM acronym stand for?\n\n33\n00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:03.639\n&gt;&gt; Windows System Image Manager.\n\n34\n00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:04.616\n&gt;&gt; System Image Manager.\n\n35\n00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:05.521\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n36\n00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:08.076\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you could go ahead and\n\n37\n00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:12.600\nuse those tools to push out\nlarge scale deployments and\n\n38\n00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.615\nthen even working inter-actively\nwith systems center or,\n\n39\n00:02:17.615 --> 00:02:20.486\nI'm trying to think, WDS, MDT.\n\n40\n00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:25.353\nThere are a lot of tools that are designed\nto be image-centric out there that\n\n41\n00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:27.190\nreally focus on that.\n\n42\n00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.290\nSo packages is a different\nperspective on this concept.\n\n43\n00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.120\nIt is not re-imaging,\n\n44\n00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.730\nit is not imaging, Microsoft wants\nyou to really understand that.\n\n45\n00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.710\nWhat we're going to be looking at in\nthis show is something called runtime\n\n46\n00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.400\nconfiguration settings.\n\n47\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.330\nSo, think about this.\n\n48\n00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.650\nYou order some devices for\nyour organization.\n\n49\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.480\nThey get sent to you in a real package,\nlike a box, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.545\nAnd they arrive into your office.\n\n51\n00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:58.490\nAnd you open them up, and you have your\nOOB, your out of the box experience there,\n\n52\n00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.504\nbut they're not to your\norganization's liking, or better yet,\n\n53\n00:03:02.504 --> 00:03:05.960\neven to that organization's\nsecurity policy, right?\n\n54\n00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.910\nSo how do we get these\ndevices provisioned quickly?\n\n55\n00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.820\nAnd I won't say, at this point it\nis not a continued management.\n\n56\n00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.460\nIt is not an MDM,\nmobile device management,\n\n57\n00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.010\nor something Intune,\nit is not in place of that.\n\n58\n00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.773\nYou will still need something to make sure\nthat that device remains in compliance,\n\n59\n00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:34.256\nbut to get things up and\nrunning this is great start for that.\n\n60\n00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:40.007\nIt's super quick, you can change\nconfigurations as the system is running so\n\n61\n00:03:40.007 --> 00:03:43.457\nit's pretty cool,\nat least some things, and\n\n62\n00:03:43.457 --> 00:03:49.402\nsome will require a restart to go ahead\nand revert back or install new packages.\n\n63\n00:03:49.402 --> 00:03:53.630\nBut let's talk about what we need\nto do to get to that point, right?\n\n64\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.347\nSo first of all, and\nlet's take a look at my screen real quick,\n\n65\n00:03:58.347 --> 00:04:01.997\nas a prerequisite,\nyou will need to download and\n\n66\n00:04:01.997 --> 00:04:06.800\ninstall the Windows ADK for\na deployment toolkit there.\n\n67\n00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.410\nThere are a few components we'll take\na look at that we do need to have in that\n\n68\n00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.900\ndeployment in that tool kit.\n\n69\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.050\nSo you might wanna download all of it,\n\n70\n00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:21.440\nor if you're low on space, I will\ncover exactly what is required there.\n\n71\n00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.310\nAnd it's also in the show notes,\nso you can pick and\n\n72\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.140\nchoose in those tick-boxes\nthere whenever you download it.\n\n73\n00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.870\nBecause when we take a look at our\nassessment and deployment kit that you can\n\n74\n00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.110\ndownload here at Microsoft,\nit's basically a culmination of tools.\n\n75\n00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.660\nAnd they're constantly working\non this deployment kit package.\n\n76\n00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.700\nOr I don't wanna say package to\nconfuse you with the terminology, but\n\n77\n00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.620\nthis-\n&gt;&gt; Suite.\n\n78\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.360\n&gt;&gt; Suite, yes suite of tools,\n\n79\n00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.540\nthis deployment kit, if you will.\n\n80\n00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.362\nSo they're working to download and\neven with this, what we were saying, did\n\n81\n00:04:54.362 --> 00:04:58.826\ndecide on 1804, 1803 for this last [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 1803, I think, we [INAUDIBLE]\n\n82\n00:04:58.826 --> 00:05:01.301\n&gt;&gt; Okay so, even with this 1803,\n\n83\n00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:06.660\nthis last update, we did see changes and\nadditions to our ADK kit, if that's\n\n84\n00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.172\nnot redundant, I don't know what is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n85\n00:05:10.172 --> 00:05:11.875\n&gt;&gt; But anyways, it's changing too,\n\n86\n00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:14.950\nso you probably already know this,\nI know you know this, Mike.\n\n87\n00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.610\nSo we're dealing with a lot\nof changes right now, so\n\n88\n00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.060\njust kinda be prepared for that.\n\n89\n00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.860\nYou might see something extra\nthat wasn't here before.\n\n90\n00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.140\n&gt;&gt; It does seem to make sense,\n\n91\n00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.450\nCherokee, as we move closer and closer,\nwe're already there, but we see more and\n\n92\n00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.770\nmore of the Windows 10 as a service.\n\n93\n00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.599\nImaging something, and\nthen having to keep that image up to date,\n\n94\n00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.220\nwith these major changes coming out every\nsix months, it's almost not worth it.\n\n95\n00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.674\nSo you see where it's almost more\nbeneficial, more efficient to just,\n\n96\n00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:44.835\nwhenever you get that new device,\nget the latest and greatest, and\n\n97\n00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:50.540\npull it down from wherever, and then use\nyour packages to configure that device.\n\n98\n00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and so\n\n99\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.110\nwe're gonna go ahead and\ntake a look at how to do that.\n\n100\n00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.900\nI don't wanna spend a ton of time, I just\nwanted to show you where to get this.\n\n101\n00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.750\nAnd let me go ahead and minimize this,\n\n102\n00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.650\nas a matter of fact, I will at\nleast go to through what we need.\n\n103\n00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.300\nI have the ADK installed\nhere on my desktop for\n\n104\n00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.820\nthis particular machine, so\nI'm just going to launch that.\n\n105\n00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.140\nIt's a simple wizard.\n\n106\n00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.828\nLet me pull up the part in my notes,\njust to make sure exactly.\n\n107\n00:06:17.828 --> 00:06:23.240\nOkay, there are four different elements of\nthe tool kit that we at least need here.\n\n108\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.410\nAnd let me zoom in so\nyou guys can see this.\n\n109\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.660\nSo, just installing ADK, it can be\nused for a number of different things.\n\n110\n00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.830\nBut for the specific application here, or\n\n111\n00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.450\nthe specific use here that we're talking\nabout, it's for provisioning packages.\n\n112\n00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.560\nThis is going to be that default location.\n\n113\n00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.950\nLet me zoom in so\nwe can take a look at the size.\n\n114\n00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.850\nBecause I think ultimately that may\nbe a deciding factor as to hey,\n\n115\n00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.220\nwhat do I wanna install and\nwhat don't I wanna install?\n\n116\n00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.000\nIf you're trying to set\nup a lab environment and\n\n117\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.310\nplay with the different tools available,\nI'll say grab them all if you can.\n\n118\n00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.755\nIt will be probably be about\nalmost 7 gigs worth of space.\n\n119\n00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:05.713\nSo I'm just giving you a heads up there so\n\n120\n00:07:05.713 --> 00:07:10.328\nthat you can be aware of that\nif you're storagely challenged.\n\n121\n00:07:10.328 --> 00:07:14.041\n[LAUGH] Anyways.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, Cherokee.\n\n122\n00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:17.820\nThere's really no point installing 10 gigs\nworth of tools if you only plan on using\n\n123\n00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.413\na couple of them.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n124\n00:07:19.413 --> 00:07:20.731\nSo we're gonna go ahead and take a look.\n\n125\n00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:23.320\nWe're gonna Next through\nthis first screen.\n\n126\n00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.502\nBut, let's see here,\nthey're gonna ask us a few things first.\n\n127\n00:07:26.502 --> 00:07:29.600\nWe have just some housekeeping\nto get out of the way.\n\n128\n00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.470\nULA, and they're asking here,\nlook, do we want to go ahead and\n\n129\n00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.500\nsend anonymous usage data to Microsoft for\nthe Windows 10 kits?\n\n130\n00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.500\nIt's probably a good idea, since they are\nworking with these and they might see what\n\n131\n00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.410\nsomeone's interested in just like overall\nstatistics, I'm going to say No for now.\n\n132\n00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.560\nI'm not contributing.\n\n133\n00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.472\nMy gosh.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n134\n00:07:48.472 --> 00:07:49.332\n&gt;&gt; All right, it's okay.\n\n135\n00:07:49.332 --> 00:07:50.593\nWe'll hit Next.\n\n136\n00:07:50.593 --> 00:07:55.600\n[LAUGH] This is the ULA,\nyou don't have much of a choice here.\n\n137\n00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.270\nFeel free to go ahead and Take a look\nat that, for now, we'll just accept.\n\n138\n00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.191\nAnd this is where I was really talking\nabout those four components that we need\n\n139\n00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:05.832\nto make sure we have at minimum.\n\n140\n00:08:07.316 --> 00:08:09.720\nLet's go ahead and take a look.\n\n141\n00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.410\nSo, this is the default.\n\n142\n00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:17.250\nI haven't changed anything as of yet,\nbut you also have the ability to add.\n\n143\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.800\nI think we've even looked\nin another episode\n\n144\n00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.360\nat the application compatibility tools.\n\n145\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.800\nSo having those extras there,\njust think about your storage.\n\n146\n00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.760\nLet me see if they show it on\nthis page if we change that.\n\n147\n00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.210\nOkay, so it doesn't.\n\n148\n00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.330\nIf we were to go ahead and\nadd everything but we won't for right now.\n\n149\n00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.878\n&gt;&gt; What do we end up with at 7 gigs?\n\n150\n00:08:37.878 --> 00:08:40.320\n&gt;&gt; It was at 6.8 to begin with.\n\n151\n00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.910\nAnd I was just kind of testing it.\n\n152\n00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:46.782\nOkay, so this Windows Assessment Toolkit,\nthat's big cuz that jumped up there.\n\n153\n00:08:46.782 --> 00:08:49.970\nOkay, [LAUGH] I won't play\nwhile we're on a show but\n\n154\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.020\nI'm just trying to check out the sizes.\n\n155\n00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.880\nLet's pay attention,\nwe'll leave it at the defaults there.\n\n156\n00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.460\nI think I might have one extra but\nthat's where we were to begin with.\n\n157\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.120\nThe four that we need are going\nto be deployment tools,\n\n158\n00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.990\nwhich is checked, we definitely need that.\n\n159\n00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.970\nWe also need the WinPE,\nwhich is also right underneath that.\n\n160\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.940\nAnd of course, let me zoom in so\nyou guys can take a look at this.\n\n161\n00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.750\nWhile we're here,\nI just want to clarify something.\n\n162\n00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:23.604\nIt is listed as, you'll hear\nconflicting terms for this actual tool.\n\n163\n00:09:23.604 --> 00:09:29.560\nIt was called Windows Imaging and\nConfiguration Designer.\n\n164\n00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:35.280\nThen people in Boston started calling\nit WICD because that was the acronym.\n\n165\n00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.900\nAnd that was trending cut on, actually\nit probably even referenced it as that.\n\n166\n00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:45.360\nAt the beginning of the show when we\nstarted the series, it has evolved.\n\n167\n00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.550\nNot every and it still is evolving,\nlike we've talked about.\n\n168\n00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.870\nSo there are some areas\nin the user interface,\n\n169\n00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:58.260\nwhere it is noted as Imaging and\nConfiguration Designer.\n\n170\n00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.849\nBut in some sections, they've dropped\nthe imaging, and you'll just see WCD or\n\n171\n00:10:02.849 --> 00:10:04.883\nWindows Configuration Designer.\n\n172\n00:10:04.883 --> 00:10:10.240\nSo, when it comes to the exam,\nI'm not 100% sure.\n\n173\n00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:16.020\nBut on Microsoft's objectives list,\nit's still listed out as W,\n\n174\n00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.590\nWindows Imaging and\nConfiguration Designer so\n\n175\n00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.880\njust wanted to throw that out\nthere to give some clarification.\n\n176\n00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.650\nThe last one that Windows\n8 that you need to have\n\n177\n00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.850\nalso installed is going to be the user\nstate migration tool, which we see,\n\n178\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.532\nis already selected here\nby default as well.\n\n179\n00:10:32.532 --> 00:10:36.110\nSo we'll go ahead and leave those\ndefaults and we'll hit Install.\n\n180\n00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.690\nSo this should just be\na quick installation.\n\n181\n00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.850\nAs a matter of fact,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n182\n00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.340\njust hit No, I already have it\ninstalled on another machine.\n\n183\n00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.140\nSo we can actually hop on over to that and\nwe don't have to wait for that process to\n\n184\n00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.723\ngo ahead and finish up for us.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\n\n185\n00:10:51.723 --> 00:10:55.599\nCherokee saving us from one more of those\nMicrosoft Wizards that we have to watch so\n\n186\n00:10:55.599 --> 00:10:56.990\noften.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n187\n00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:01.410\nsaving the world one wizard at\na time there, that was really bad.\n\n188\n00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.990\nAnyways, yeah,\nlet's take a look at my Start menu here.\n\n189\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.480\nIf we left click on that Windows icon,\nwe'll go ahead and bring that up.\n\n190\n00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.740\nNow, when you first get this installed,\nlet me scroll down so\n\n191\n00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.440\nyou can see this section here.\n\n192\n00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.570\nThere's a portion called Windows Kits, and\n\n193\n00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.950\nthat's what you'll see\nwith that ADK install.\n\n194\n00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.087\nAnd you can go ahead and\nexpand that out and\n\n195\n00:11:22.087 --> 00:11:26.070\ntake a look at all sorts of different\ntoolkits that they have available to us.\n\n196\n00:11:28.284 --> 00:11:33.764\nBy default, that is where my\nWindows Configuration Designer Kit was,\n\n197\n00:11:33.764 --> 00:11:35.020\nor this tool.\n\n198\n00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.510\nBut because I've been using it and\nworking with it often,\n\n199\n00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.670\nit kind of popped up to its own little\nsection there here in that list of apps.\n\n200\n00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.570\nSo we could go ahead and\nlaunch it that way.\n\n201\n00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:51.070\nAnd you know what, since I'm right here,\nand we're talking about, let me see,\n\n202\n00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:56.560\nI have on my other machine,\nmy desktop here, let me minimize this.\n\n203\n00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:02.320\nWe're talking about that install with\nthe EADK, and because that's like\n\n204\n00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.960\nthe way that that binary installs\non to this Windows 10 machine,\n\n205\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.460\nwhat if you're working on a mobile device,\nand wanna use,\n\n206\n00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.740\nthere's also another option basically\nis what I'm trying to say here.\n\n207\n00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.310\nSo let me go ahead and\npull up my Microsoft Store.\n\n208\n00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:20.820\nBecause there's also a Windows\nConfiguration Designer app available for\n\n209\n00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.740\nthose mobile devices.\n\n210\n00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.950\nTo be honest, I haven't played\nwith that one that much, so\n\n211\n00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.520\nI just wanted to throw it out there to\nlet you know that that is available.\n\n212\n00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.250\nBut if you look up with any\nof the documentation online,\n\n213\n00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.680\nlike how to use these tools and so\nforth, they're gonna recommend using\n\n214\n00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.990\nthat method that I showed you for the\ninstall, to get it set up on the system.\n\n215\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.983\nSo just wanted to let you know about that.\n\n216\n00:12:42.004 --> 00:12:44.847\nBut back over here on our machine,\nwe'll go ahead and launch the tool.\n\n217\n00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:51.871\nAnd notice the name,\nWindows Configuration Designer,\n\n218\n00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:57.250\nhow it was spelled out also the same in\nthe app store, the Windows Store App.\n\n219\n00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.740\nThis particular moment in time,\n\n220\n00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.450\nbut who knows they might have some\nother grand name release later on.\n\n221\n00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:09.540\nOkay, so what we can see here,\nthis is a very simplified user interface,\n\n222\n00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:15.610\nand we have provision desktop devices,\nprovision surface hub devices,\n\n223\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:20.580\nprovision kiosk devices, as well as\nprovisioning Windows mobile devices.\n\n224\n00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:27.676\nThe advanced provisioning is actually what\nit really just kind of used to look like.\n\n225\n00:13:27.676 --> 00:13:29.790\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n226\n00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:34.070\nBut this interface rally\nsteam lines that process so\n\n227\n00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.890\nit's pretty easy to go ahead and\nget this going.\n\n228\n00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:40.840\nHowever, this is just so\nmuch more powerful like so\n\n229\n00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.670\nmany more settings so\nwe'll take a look at both there.\n\n230\n00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:50.580\nI will say though, if you want that quick\nprovisioning, stick with that easy,\n\n231\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:56.000\nthis easy set up here, this little wizard\ntype driven menu that they provide,\n\n232\n00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.230\nonce you switch to the advance\nprovisioning, you can't go back.\n\n233\n00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.239\nYou can never go back,\nwhat movie was that from?\n\n234\n00:14:01.239 --> 00:14:04.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n235\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.980\n&gt;&gt; Anyways, I've\n\n236\n00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.589\nbeen working with some projects\nhere on the right ends.\n\n237\n00:14:07.589 --> 00:14:09.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Movie trivia is not my thing.\n\n238\n00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.678\n&gt;&gt; Mine either, Adam is like-\n\n239\n00:14:11.678 --> 00:14:12.440\n&gt;&gt; I want the science.\n\n240\n00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Adam hates it.\n\n241\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.540\n&gt;&gt; Does he?\n\n242\n00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.405\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, anyways,\n\n243\n00:14:18.405 --> 00:14:21.468\nhe's always got some movie\nreference that is way over my head.\n\n244\n00:14:21.468 --> 00:14:25.110\n[LAUGH] All right,\nthese are gonna be your recent projects.\n\n245\n00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.652\nI've been just playing around,\nlike I said,\n\n246\n00:14:26.652 --> 00:14:28.087\nwith a couple different projects in here.\n\n247\n00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.949\nLet's talk about that for a second.\n\n248\n00:14:33.475 --> 00:14:38.234\nWhen I start and initiate a wizard and\nI'm walking through the steps,\n\n249\n00:14:38.234 --> 00:14:40.550\nmaybe I'm not quite finished.\n\n250\n00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:45.130\nAnd maybe I have a question about,\nyou know what, Deb's\n\n251\n00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.780\nbeen working on this new in-house app,\nlet's go see if it's ready for deployment.\n\n252\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.020\nI know they've been testing it, are we\nready to push it out to users x, y, z?\n\n253\n00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:58.000\nI don't know, let's wait until our\nmanagers meeting or something like that.\n\n254\n00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.841\nYou can park these projects, but\n\n255\n00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:03.081\nI want you to think about that\nfrom a security standpoint.\n\n256\n00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:11.094\nProvisioning packages are packages,\nthe .ppkg file itself.\n\n257\n00:15:11.094 --> 00:15:15.254\nWhen we create this, you'll see we\nhave the ability to go ahead and\n\n258\n00:15:15.254 --> 00:15:17.300\nencrypt the actual file.\n\n259\n00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:22.080\nAnd we can use like, certificates or\npasswords to go ahead and\n\n260\n00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.650\nencrypt this file.\n\n261\n00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:28.240\nBut when a project is in the works, or\neven if it's finished and it's just\n\n262\n00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.780\nsitting there on your system, there by\ndefault is not any kind of encryption.\n\n263\n00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.350\nSo it potentially could be\na security vulnerability,\n\n264\n00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.570\nespecially if you have\nany vulnerable assets.\n\n265\n00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.800\nAnd when I say the term assets, you'll\nhear people use this term assets when\n\n266\n00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.750\nthey're talking about\nprovisioning packages.\n\n267\n00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.757\nBecause let's think about what's\ninside a provisioning package.\n\n268\n00:15:49.757 --> 00:15:54.350\nYou have your metadata, so this the data\nabout that provisioning package.\n\n269\n00:15:54.350 --> 00:16:00.305\nYou're gonna have your Shoot,\nI'm trying to think.\n\n270\n00:16:00.305 --> 00:16:04.854\nYour assets being the kind of\napplications that you're adding,\n\n271\n00:16:04.854 --> 00:16:06.931\ndrivers, things like that.\n\n272\n00:16:06.931 --> 00:16:11.138\nAnd then you also have potential\npayloads associated with assets,\n\n273\n00:16:11.138 --> 00:16:13.180\nif that makes sense.\n\n274\n00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.220\nSo that's what you kinda\nhave to think about,\n\n275\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.300\nis some of that information\ncould be sensitive there.\n\n276\n00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.440\nLet's take a look at the default location\nas a matter of fact, since I'm right here.\n\n277\n00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.430\nIf I pull up File Explorer,\n\n278\n00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:29.029\nI'll show you guys where these\nprojects are actually stored.\n\n279\n00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:32.190\nAll right, so here on my C drive,\nwe'll just drill down.\n\n280\n00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:36.830\nI'm logged in as Wilma, so\nwe'll go under Users, and\n\n281\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:42.660\nthen, current user here, whoever's\ncreating that particular package, Wilma.\n\n282\n00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.890\nAnd then, it's going to be\nunder Documents by default, and\n\n283\n00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:47.920\nlet me just zoom in so we can see that.\n\n284\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.340\nSo, Documents, and\nthen if I were to go ahead and\n\n285\n00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.870\npull this out,\nyou guys would be able to see.\n\n286\n00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.080\nAll right, Windows Imaging and\nConfiguration Designer folder right here.\n\n287\n00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.710\nThis is where those packages are gonna\nlive until you actually go in there and\n\n288\n00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.020\ndelete them out.\n\n289\n00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.866\nSo, let's go ahead and delete one of\nthese actually, while we're right here.\n\n290\n00:17:13.896 --> 00:17:18.260\nOkay, so we've deleted package 1,\nor project 1, excuse me.\n\n291\n00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.880\nAnd those are the default names.\n\n292\n00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.790\nI didn't choose to name them that.\n\n293\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.860\nSo I still see it kind of sitting here,\n\n294\n00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.800\nbut let's just try to relaunch that and\nsee if it'll go away.\n\n295\n00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.500\nIt should go away.\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't refresh\n\n296\n00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.265\nautomatically?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n297\n00:17:32.265 --> 00:17:34.690\nthat's what I was just kind of testing,\n[LAUGH] right here.\n\n298\n00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.831\nKinda love it when we're just-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n299\n00:17:38.889 --> 00:17:40.670\n&gt;&gt; Pushing ourselves to the limits here.\n\n300\n00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:41.583\nOkay, so you can see-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n301\n00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:43.750\nit's gone.\n&gt;&gt; Project 2 is the only one that I\n\n302\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.190\nhave there.\n\n303\n00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.625\nAll right, so\ndefinitely keep that in mind.\n\n304\n00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:54.910\nDelete those folders,\nthose files associated with this projects,\n\n305\n00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:59.690\nand if you do have sensitive information\nassociated with your assets,\n\n306\n00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.210\nthen you'll want to go ahead and\ntake advantage of that encryption.\n\n307\n00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:06.050\nYou can also use policy,\n\n308\n00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:11.110\neither group policy or local, to go ahead\nand require digital signing for a package.\n\n309\n00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:16.090\nSo that's pretty cool too,\nbecause then you can't\n\n310\n00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:21.170\ninstall any kind, and\napply any kind of rogue packages\n\n311\n00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:26.270\nbecause it's still a newer technology now,\nbut just think about it, Mike.\n\n312\n00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:31.628\nWe could have these malware packages\nstart popping up, and who's to say?\n\n313\n00:18:31.628 --> 00:18:35.393\nEnd users might just go ahead and\nclick that thinking it was issued by IT,\n\n314\n00:18:35.393 --> 00:18:38.743\nwhen in fact, it's just someone\ntaking advantage of a system.\n\n315\n00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:39.743\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah,\n\n316\n00:18:39.743 --> 00:18:43.135\nsomebody modifying those packages\nthat I'm deploying out to my systems\n\n317\n00:18:43.135 --> 00:18:45.740\ncould be a huge security risk.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\n\n318\n00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.220\nthat's why we wanna go ahead and\njust think about\n\n319\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:52.070\nthe security options that are available\nto us here with our packages.\n\n320\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:57.560\nSo let's go ahead and launch the basic,\nI mean, I'm just calling it basic,\n\n321\n00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:02.520\nI don't know what it's called, but\nthis is just the default wizard here.\n\n322\n00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.043\nSo, see how it wants to go ahead and\nlabel it Project_1?\n\n323\n00:19:06.043 --> 00:19:10.320\nSo we could just call this one\nmaybe DemoProject or something.\n\n324\n00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.320\nAnd they used underscore.\n\n325\n00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.230\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nsay this, just as a best practice,\n\n326\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:22.050\nit's good to not use spaces in things,\nespecially if you're gonna be scripting or\n\n327\n00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:28.310\nworking with PowerShell in the future,\nfor naming and all that good stuff.\n\n328\n00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.530\nSo you just wanna keep that in mind.\n\n329\n00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:34.190\nSo this is that default location.\n\n330\n00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.290\nIf you had an alternative location,\nmaybe you have some kind of shared storage\n\n331\n00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.730\nwhere you guys put all of your current\nactive projects or something like that.\n\n332\n00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.510\nThat would be a great idea\nto take advantage of.\n\n333\n00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:49.900\nDescriptions also, super important,\ntake advantage of that.\n\n334\n00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:54.930\nYou'll see, when we go to Export,\nthe package there is a special\n\n335\n00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.600\nscreen just to add additional details.\n\n336\n00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:03.140\nBecause when we're working\nin an environment you\n\n337\n00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.200\nmay have several different packages.\n\n338\n00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.370\nAs a matter of fact you'll\nsee here in a moment\n\n339\n00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.820\nwhere we can even build on packages.\n\n340\n00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:17.740\nI know we talk about this all\nthe time with the documentation, and\n\n341\n00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:22.000\npaying close attention to details, but\nyou really wanna make sure you're paying\n\n342\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.260\nattention to that here,\nespecially with different iterations.\n\n343\n00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.080\nSo if you're working on a project\nthat has multiple versions,\n\n344\n00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.860\nyou'll even see that there's a section\n\n345\n00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.060\ndefined to specify your versioning there.\n&gt;&gt; Very\n\n346\n00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.630\ncool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n347\n00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.140\nlet's take a look at this portion here.\n\n348\n00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.630\nFor the device name, it says to go ahead\nand enter a unique 15-character name for\n\n349\n00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:43.140\nthe device.\n\n350\n00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.040\nThey're strict about that.\n\n351\n00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.680\nIt needs to follow these\nnaming conventions.\n\n352\n00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.881\nBelieve me I've tried it, broke it.\n\n353\n00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:54.680\n[LAUGH] So, they give us help for\ngenerating unique names, so\n\n354\n00:20:54.680 --> 00:21:01.096\nif you had a hardware-specific serial\nnumber, they suggest maybe using that.\n\n355\n00:21:01.096 --> 00:21:06.328\nOr if you use this syntax here,\nyou could go ahead and generate a random\n\n356\n00:21:06.328 --> 00:21:12.410\namount of characters to go ahead and\nmake that particular machine unique.\n\n357\n00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:16.570\nI'm kind of curious to see,\nso you can deploy this in\n\n358\n00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:22.790\nlarge-scale capacities, so I wonder,\n\n359\n00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:27.680\nI don't know if this will take care of\nmultiple machine names for you there.\n\n360\n00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.220\nSo I'm kind of curious\nto see if that feature\n\n361\n00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.250\nis available at this moment in time.\n\n362\n00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.870\nI don't see why it wouldn't be,\nmoving forward, but\n\n363\n00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:37.510\nmaybe they're still relying on\nother deployment options for that.\n\n364\n00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.595\nWe're going to go ahead and we'll just,\n\n365\n00:21:42.547 --> 00:21:47.436\nMaybe say I'm typing here, demo.\n\n366\n00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:55.395\nOkay, we're not gonna put\na product key in here now, but\n\n367\n00:21:55.395 --> 00:21:59.300\nobviously you'll understand why we\nwould want to do that, for licensing.\n\n368\n00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.900\nAlso we have the ability to configure\nthis device for shared use, but\n\n369\n00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.320\nwe're just gonna keep it at no for now.\n\n370\n00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.680\nAnd I really think this\nis a cool option here.\n\n371\n00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:17.690\nRemove pre-installed software, so\nlet's think about that for a second.\n\n372\n00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.790\nWith your BYOD, bring your own device, or\n\n373\n00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:25.940\nnow you hear this term CYOD, choose\nyour own device, you may want to take\n\n374\n00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.996\nadvantage of the hardware that\nyou already have lying around.\n\n375\n00:22:28.996 --> 00:22:33.090\nBut instead of re-imaging it and\n\n376\n00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:37.530\nwiping that out, or installing it with\na clean install or something like that,\n\n377\n00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:42.690\nhow about let's just take\nthe software off of that?\n\n378\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.860\nSo you do have that option.\n\n379\n00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.950\nWe're gonna leave it as no.\n&gt;&gt; And just, I'm sorry, I just\n\n380\n00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.500\ncan't read the rest of that line there.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sure.\n\n381\n00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.550\n&gt;&gt; What does that say?\n\n382\n00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.220\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike, it's actually really\n\n383\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.450\nimportant to point that out,\nbecause if you think about different\n\n384\n00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.620\nbusiness models we may have out there or\nthese acronyms that I'm throwing around.\n\n385\n00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.110\nAnd they might not really\nresonate with you until\n\n386\n00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.670\nyou use them in your environment.\n\n387\n00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:08.620\nLike BYOD, Bring Your Own Device,\nso what does that mean?\n\n388\n00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.140\nIf we think about that, where the end\nuser may have an extra tablet at home,\n\n389\n00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.120\nan extra Surface, something like that.\n\n390\n00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.980\nThey bring it in and\nthen the company says okay, I'll allow you\n\n391\n00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:26.440\nto run our applications and access our\nnetwork resources with this device.\n\n392\n00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:32.620\nSo if it's the user's device they may\nhave pre-existing personal data on there.\n\n393\n00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.420\nIn other environments that\nmight not be an option.\n\n394\n00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:41.340\nWe'll take a look at a few other\nthings we can do, some options that\n\n395\n00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.040\nare available to us with the more advanced\noptions, but just be aware of that.\n\n396\n00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.897\nSo you're not just wiping someone's data,\nthat wouldn't be a fun conversation to\n\n397\n00:23:48.897 --> 00:23:51.590\nhave with someone.\n&gt;&gt; No, no you'd hate to have that one,\n\n398\n00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.500\nwouldn't you?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, not a good time.\n\n399\n00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.680\nOkay so, that's the first option and\n\n400\n00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.900\nwhat were gonna be doing here is\nreally going down through the paces.\n\n401\n00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.420\nI'm looking at the clock.\n\n402\n00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.040\nI don't know if we have\ntime to complete this.\n\n403\n00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.740\nAt least we know where we're going and\n\n404\n00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.250\nthen I think we'll come\nback with a part 2.\n\n405\n00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.960\nWe'll look at this in completion and\n\n406\n00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.310\nthen also take a look at\nthose advanced settings\n\n407\n00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.570\njust to see the differences there.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome,\n\n408\n00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.050\nsounds like a great plan, Cherokee.\n\n409\n00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.770\nGood demonstration so far as we\nlearn about provisioning packages.\n\n410\n00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.910\nSo we appreciate that, hope everybody\nout there enjoyed watching this one.\n\n411\n00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:30.010\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n412\n00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:30.750\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n413\n00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.495\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n414\n00:24:33.495 --> 00:24:39.173\n[MUSIC]\n\n415\n00:24:39.173 -->

00:00:11.496\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.496 --> 00:00:14.849\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.716\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick Today we\nare installing and configuring Windows 10.\n\n6\n00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:22.379\nIn this episode we're continuing\non with provision packages.\n\n7\n00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:24.942\nThis is a part two so\nmake sure you go back and check part one.\n\n8\n00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:28.420\nBack in the studio is non other then Ms,\nCherokee Boose, welcome back Cherokee.\n\n9\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.230\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me Mike,\nI'm so glad that I was able to\n\n10\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.542\ncome back in studios because we actually\nleft off in the middle of a demo.\n\n11\n00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:37.996\nAnd we just got started, so\nI definitely wanna finish up with that.\n\n12\n00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:41.377\nAnd we'll also take a look at\nanother way we can go ahead and\n\n13\n00:00:41.377 --> 00:00:46.351\ncreate a provisioning package also here\ninside of our configuration designer tool.\n\n14\n00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:49.786\nWindows configuration designer tool,\nI guess it's implied but\n\n15\n00:00:49.786 --> 00:00:51.230\nI shouldn't assume here.\n\n16\n00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.857\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n17\n00:00:51.857 --> 00:00:53.098\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look at my screen.\n\n18\n00:00:53.098 --> 00:00:55.796\nWe had already started,\nwe had launched the tool.\n\n19\n00:00:55.796 --> 00:01:00.418\nWe talked about in the last so we can\ngo ahead and get that ADK tool kit or\n\n20\n00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:05.548\nour tool kit, I'm sorry, I'm thinking\nabout what we did in the last show.\n\n21\n00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:09.830\nWe got that installed, we launch\nour ICD and we left on the screen.\n\n22\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.135\nSo the first thing that we had\nto do is choose a device name,\n\n23\n00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:17.056\nwe skip product key and we also talk\nabout this last two bullets here.\n\n24\n00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:21.646\nSo let's go ahead and\npick up on the second segment and\n\n25\n00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:23.899\nit's to Set Up a Network.\n\n26\n00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.661\nSo in the last show if you were called and\nsaid okay, you got listed here to their\n\n27\n00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:31.038\nnaming conventions other wise you'll\nbreak it, believe me I tried.\n\n28\n00:01:31.038 --> 00:01:34.345\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Same thing here with your network SSID.\n\n29\n00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:38.323\nMaybe they have changed it or\nwill change it when you try this but\n\n30\n00:01:38.323 --> 00:01:43.448\nI know I was just trying to be smart,\nI'll put in 1,2,3 for my network SSID.\n\n31\n00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:47.474\nAnd the package creator\nhere was not working.\n\n32\n00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:51.305\nAnd an error out to not allow\nme to go ahead and do that.\n\n33\n00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:56.555\nSo what we're gonna do now is\nwe're gonna just leave that blank,\n\n34\n00:01:56.555 --> 00:02:00.000\nwe're gonna not connect to WIFI network.\n\n35\n00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.710\nAnd it's kind of interesting,\nthis setting,\n\n36\n00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.360\nI don't know if it will always\nbe here listening to some of\n\n37\n00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.033\nthe developers talk about this particular\ntool if you're using an MDM tool.\n\n38\n00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:23.658\nOr if any kind of online enrollment\noptions, maybe intern or\n\n39\n00:02:23.658 --> 00:02:28.194\nsomething that requires\na network connection.\n\n40\n00:02:28.194 --> 00:02:32.602\nYou could find yourself\nin an isolated loop,\n\n41\n00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:37.475\nif you're not able to\nconnect to a network there.\n\n42\n00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:43.012\nSo, once this package is created before\nyou get connected and then enrolled there.\n\n43\n00:02:43.012 --> 00:02:45.804\nSo there are certain\nfringe configurations.\n\n44\n00:02:45.804 --> 00:02:48.137\nSo I don't know if this setting\nwill always be here, but for\n\n45\n00:02:48.137 --> 00:02:49.827\nnow we're gonna go ahead and leave it off.\n\n46\n00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:53.617\nBut if you wanted the device to\nautomatically connect to a network,\n\n47\n00:02:53.617 --> 00:02:55.953\nyou would just need to provide that SSID.\n\n48\n00:02:55.953 --> 00:03:00.434\nAnd then if you had a password here and\nthey only give you the option here,\n\n49\n00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:04.789\nyou have open so you wouldn't need\nto go ahead and provide a password.\n\n50\n00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:09.339\nAlternatively you could use WPA2\npersonal to set that up there.\n\n51\n00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.526\nOr like I said at this point\nin time you can go ahead and\n\n52\n00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:15.576\ntoggle that off like we're gonna do,\nall right.\n\n53\n00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:17.510\nSo we can go down that column there or\n\n54\n00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.032\njust hit next in the bottom right-hand\ncorner, there's a bottom behind my head.\n\n55\n00:03:22.032 --> 00:03:24.028\nIf we could just look at that for\none second.\n\n56\n00:03:24.028 --> 00:03:27.830\nYep, so right here just knowing there\nare couple of different ways to proceed,\n\n57\n00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.261\nwe'll go ahead and hit Next.\n\n58\n00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:33.926\nNow this is kind of interesting\nhere as well the screen.\n\n59\n00:03:33.926 --> 00:03:37.929\nSo we're basically able to go ahead and\nmanage school.\n\n60\n00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:41.776\nIt says organization/school accounts,\ncouple different options,\n\n61\n00:03:41.776 --> 00:03:44.540\nyou can go ahead and\nenroll into Active Directory.\n\n62\n00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.505\nSo this would be like an On-Prem\nActive Directory that wasn't being\n\n63\n00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:51.055\nmanaged in-house.\n\n64\n00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:55.932\nYou also have the ability to go ahead and\nuse Azure-based Active Directory as well.\n\n65\n00:03:55.932 --> 00:03:58.058\nSo just keeping that in mind,\n\n66\n00:03:58.058 --> 00:04:01.812\nthis is a newer preferred\nway to go ahead and do that.\n\n67\n00:04:01.812 --> 00:04:05.466\nFor now I'm just gonna go ahead and\nselect Local admin,\n\n68\n00:04:05.466 --> 00:04:08.588\nyou do need to provide a username and\npassword.\n\n69\n00:04:08.588 --> 00:04:13.170\nSo for us, yeah let me just move that\nover, who do we wanna go ahead and\n\n70\n00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.603\ncreate here, Mike?\n\n71\n00:04:14.603 --> 00:04:15.506\n&gt;&gt; Mike.\n\n72\n00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:16.319\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n73\n00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.176\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why I always put a capital\n\n74\n00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.185\nI for your name too.\n\n75\n00:04:20.185 --> 00:04:25.292\nOkay, we're gonna give you that super\nsecret password that you always use.\n\n76\n00:04:25.292 --> 00:04:27.506\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH].\n\n77\n00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:29.835\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n78\n00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:30.829\nwe're gonna go ahead and hit Next.\n\n79\n00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:35.801\nNow, this is a cool part here and\nhopefully I remember to put\n\n80\n00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:40.881\nall my little gears and\nmoving pieces together for this one.\n\n81\n00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:44.963\nBecause we can add, and\nthis is really one of the main really cool\n\n82\n00:04:44.963 --> 00:04:49.724\nfeatures of creating these provisioning\nkits is, hey, what if I have some\n\n83\n00:04:49.724 --> 00:04:54.053\ncustom applications that I need to\ngo ahead and deploy out quickly?\n\n84\n00:04:54.053 --> 00:04:55.767\nSo we can go ahead and do that here.\n\n85\n00:04:55.767 --> 00:04:59.385\nSo we'll go ahead and\nselect add an application.\n\n86\n00:04:59.385 --> 00:05:04.110\nSo let's just say, this was an\napplication, I did it again, look at that.\n\n87\n00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.833\nOkay, maybe this was an application\nthat Mike had written, so\n\n88\n00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:09.812\nI'll call this one Mike's App.\n\n89\n00:05:09.812 --> 00:05:13.036\nAnd in all irony it actually is\nan application that Mike has written.\n\n90\n00:05:13.036 --> 00:05:18.481\nSo, let's go to this installer path,\nand I actually have that,\n\n91\n00:05:18.481 --> 00:05:23.140\nshould be on my desktop here,\nwe're about to find out.\n\n92\n00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.574\nOkay, so yeah, this is that demo app\nthat Mike had shared with me here for\n\n93\n00:05:27.574 --> 00:05:28.308\nthis demo.\n\n94\n00:05:28.308 --> 00:05:30.988\nSo what we're gonna do is,\nyou might need to go ahead and\n\n95\n00:05:30.988 --> 00:05:34.599\nshow that file extension there to\nensure you're grabbing the right file.\n\n96\n00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.290\nYou'll need to get that appx extension, so\n\n97\n00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.996\nthis is that actual app,\nwe'll go ahead and grab that.\n\n98\n00:05:42.996 --> 00:05:47.440\nNow, Mike,\ndoes your app have any dependencies?\n\n99\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.755\n&gt;&gt; It does have a couple\nof dependencies actually.\n\n100\n00:05:49.755 --> 00:05:54.027\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does, so we need to\nkind of think about that as well.\n\n101\n00:05:54.027 --> 00:05:57.480\nYou do have the ability to kind\nof go ahead and add a license but\n\n102\n00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.940\nlet's go ahead and add our dependencies.\n\n103\n00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.950\nBecause I definitely know that Mike's app\nhas two dependencies that we will need to\n\n104\n00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.590\ngrab there.\n\n105\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.646\nAs a matter of fact, you guys can see\nright here, I have a dependencies folder.\n\n106\n00:06:09.646 --> 00:06:15.693\nSo, I'll go ahead and click that and\nwe'll go here with our x64,\n\n107\n00:06:15.693 --> 00:06:19.948\nwe'll grab this first was\nit that run time app?\n\n108\n00:06:19.948 --> 00:06:22.838\nAnd, let me zoom out so you can see that,\n\n109\n00:06:22.838 --> 00:06:27.264\nit's got a number 1 next to it,\nlet me scroll down so you can.\n\n110\n00:06:27.264 --> 00:06:29.314\nSo this is that first dependency.\n\n111\n00:06:29.314 --> 00:06:31.717\nSo Mike,\nyou said you had two dependencies.\n\n112\n00:06:31.717 --> 00:06:34.194\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We'll need to make sure they're both\n\n113\n00:06:34.194 --> 00:06:38.456\nthere so that when an end user launches\nthis package, applies this package.\n\n114\n00:06:38.456 --> 00:06:41.889\nThey'll be able to go ahead and use that\napp running right out of the gates so\n\n115\n00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.306\nthey won't need to go ahead and\n\n116\n00:06:43.306 --> 00:06:47.138\ntroubleshoot from the get-go cause that\nwould seem so kind of intuitive, right?\n\n117\n00:06:47.138 --> 00:06:52.185\nSo let's go ahead and\nadd that other dependency there and\n\n118\n00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:56.824\nthis is going to be that\nVC library type dependency.\n\n119\n00:06:56.824 --> 00:06:58.184\nWe will go ahead and hit Okay.\n\n120\n00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:01.387\nSo now you see those two\ndependencies there, and\n\n121\n00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:03.588\nwe should be good to go with that.\n\n122\n00:07:03.588 --> 00:07:07.906\nNow, that's not all, right,\nwhen it comes to your app, Mike?\n\n123\n00:07:07.906 --> 00:07:08.413\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n124\n00:07:08.413 --> 00:07:10.599\n&gt;&gt; There was some other really\nkey component, wasn't there?\n\n125\n00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:11.111\n&gt;&gt; There was.\n\n126\n00:07:11.111 --> 00:07:12.679\n&gt;&gt; What was that key component?\n\n127\n00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:16.256\n&gt;&gt; I believe I had to digitally sign\nthat app in order to sideload it in our\n\n128\n00:07:16.256 --> 00:07:17.006\nother demos.\n\n129\n00:07:17.006 --> 00:07:20.072\n&gt;&gt; So that's really important\nbecause if your organization,\n\n130\n00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:21.820\nthey don't like something here.\n\n131\n00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.759\nLet me go back real quick.\n\n132\n00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:29.019\nIf your organization doesn't allow\nunsigned applications to be ran,\n\n133\n00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:33.193\nyou will need a certification or\ncertificate or\n\n134\n00:07:33.193 --> 00:07:37.805\nsome other means of verifying\nthat particular app.\n\n135\n00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:41.096\nSo we do have the option to go ahead and\nadd certificates as well.\n\n136\n00:07:41.096 --> 00:07:45.228\nAnd were not just limited to certificates\nassociated with a application\n\n137\n00:07:45.228 --> 00:07:46.386\nwe are installing.\n\n138\n00:07:46.386 --> 00:07:50.145\nWe can add whatever certificated\nyou want here, so it's pretty cool.\n\n139\n00:07:50.145 --> 00:07:52.293\n&gt;&gt; Nice, which is probably something\nyour organization would do.\n\n140\n00:07:52.293 --> 00:07:55.595\nThey would deploy out your company\ncertificates that your developers use when\n\n141\n00:07:55.595 --> 00:07:57.154\nthey're creating these packages.\n\n142\n00:07:57.154 --> 00:08:00.589\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I don't know what happened here\nMike, so we're gonna have to go ahead and\n\n143\n00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:01.307\ntry this again.\n\n144\n00:08:01.307 --> 00:08:03.716\nLet's say.\n\n145\n00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.278\nMike's App.\n\n146\n00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:10.970\nYou know what, let's do\nan underscore just to be safe here.\n\n147\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.950\nAnd we'll point back to\nthat installer path.\n\n148\n00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:18.240\nWhich that little yellow symbol that\nyou guys saw on that left hand column,\n\n149\n00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.240\nthat's an indicator, hey,\nsomething's wrong or maybe incomplete.\n\n150\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.450\nSo let's just go ahead and\ndrop that back in here and\n\n151\n00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.060\nsee if it'll give us\nthe green light there.\n\n152\n00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.460\nSo I see what it was, this red portion\nright here says, Package family name,\n\n153\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.460\nyou have to go ahead and put that in.\n\n154\n00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.185\nSo we'll just say-\n&gt;&gt; Rodrick.\n\n155\n00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.505\n&gt;&gt; Okay, your surname.\n\n156\n00:08:40.505 --> 00:08:42.805\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what it\nmeans by a family name.\n\n157\n00:08:42.805 --> 00:08:44.567\n&gt;&gt; Well all the dependencies, so\n\n158\n00:08:44.567 --> 00:08:49.425\nI think just a good way to go ahead and\norganize all of your app components.\n\n159\n00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:51.306\nSo maybe just like an umbrella term,\n\n160\n00:08:51.306 --> 00:08:54.625\nI don't know what you'd wanna just-\n&gt;&gt; Demo again.\n\n161\n00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:55.455\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, demo.\n\n162\n00:08:55.455 --> 00:08:57.402\n&gt;&gt; Demo the family\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n163\n00:08:57.402 --> 00:08:58.637\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Family,\n\n164\n00:08:58.637 --> 00:09:00.730\nokay, that works for me.\n\n165\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:01.920\n&gt;&gt; So this isn't something you would,\n\n166\n00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.630\nthis is just something you\ncan create at this point?\n\n167\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI mean it doesn't have to be anything.\n\n168\n00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.472\n&gt;&gt; Yet.\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna say not legitimate, yep,\n\n169\n00:09:09.472 --> 00:09:10.883\ngo ahead.\n\n170\n00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:15.840\nDid it not, yeah, did it not add\nthose back in when it killed it?\n\n171\n00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.500\nLet's see.\n\n172\n00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.300\nLet me go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n173\n00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.647\nLet's go to Edit and check,\nbecause let's make sure.\n\n174\n00:09:21.647 --> 00:09:24.553\n[CROSSTALK] Nope, it didn't, it did take\nout out dependencies, good call Mike.\n\n175\n00:09:24.553 --> 00:09:26.302\nLet's go ahead and\nput those in here again.\n\n176\n00:09:26.302 --> 00:09:27.887\n&gt;&gt; Add those back.\n\n177\n00:09:27.887 --> 00:09:30.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz we don't wanna\nend users yelling at us here.\n\n178\n00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.455\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n179\n00:09:31.455 --> 00:09:32.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n180\n00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.967\n&gt;&gt; All right, whoops, not that 86,\n\n181\n00:09:33.967 --> 00:09:37.660\nwe'll go with the 64 bit version and\njust add both of these back in.\n\n182\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.855\nGet us to right back where we were.\n\n183\n00:09:39.855 --> 00:09:41.520\nDon't you love working backwards?\n\n184\n00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.750\nAll right, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Second time's a charm.\n\n185\n00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.760\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n186\n00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.710\nWe'll go ahead and add it this time.\n\n187\n00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.360\nAll right, so we're good to go there.\n\n188\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.040\nBut let's talk about certificates, that's\nwhere we are really getting into, right.\n\n189\n00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:00.480\nSo if you do have an app that requires\na certificate, you wanna include that.\n\n190\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.710\nAlso you could go ahead and add other\ncertificates for other things as well.\n\n191\n00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.780\nSo we do need to specify\nthe certificate name, so\n\n192\n00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:15.040\nwe'll say Mike App Cert just to\nkind of give it some context there.\n\n193\n00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.710\nWe also need to specify\nthe location of that cert.\n\n194\n00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.800\nWhere did I put that?\n\n195\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:26.450\nThat was on my desktop inside of\nthe DemoApp folder, I'm pretty sure.\n\n196\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.769\nAnd then, yes, inside, right here.\n\n197\n00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:35.860\nSo the .cer, it might be a different\nfile extension that you're using,\n\n198\n00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.750\nbut that's the certification that\nwe need for this particular app.\n\n199\n00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.170\nWe'll make sure that that gets added.\n\n200\n00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:47.800\nAll right, we'll hit Add, and\nagain same interface style there.\n\n201\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:54.220\nSo that's really it, really easy\nwith this particular set up here.\n\n202\n00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.820\nI mean it guided us through,\nnothing tricky.\n\n203\n00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.430\nBut what have we really accomplished?\n\n204\n00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.354\nI mean we added an app,\nwe had the ability to add that network,\n\n205\n00:11:05.354 --> 00:11:08.920\na couple other, but\nnothing super customizable.\n\n206\n00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.780\nI do have one other option here,\nwe spoke about this before.\n\n207\n00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.570\nIf we could go full screen for one second.\n\n208\n00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.750\nThis is the ability to go ahead and\nprotect your package.\n\n209\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:23.230\nIf we wanted to password protect or\nrequire a certificate to go ahead and\n\n210\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:27.330\ndecrypt this package,\nthen we would go ahead and use this.\n\n211\n00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.810\nSo definitely take advantage\nof that if you do have\n\n212\n00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:36.150\nsensitive asset information included\ninto this app, or package, should say.\n\n213\n00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:40.410\nBut we're just gonna go ahead and leave it\nhere like this for now, we'll go ahead and\n\n214\n00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:40.992\nhit Create.\n\n215\n00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:44.760\nNotice how it says your\npackage is now being built and\n\n216\n00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.740\nyou're ready to go ahead and\ncreate the package.\n\n217\n00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:52.700\nLet me just go ahead and\ngo to our start page here, and\n\n218\n00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.660\nyou can see that it is there.\n\n219\n00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.340\nI also have the ability to close out\n\n220\n00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.750\nthis particular tile here to\nclose that package or project.\n\n221\n00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.195\nJust trying to use the verbiage here\nbecause they do have different terms for\n\n222\n00:12:06.195 --> 00:12:08.700\ndifferent states that that project is in.\n\n223\n00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.940\nBut we've already created that package.\n\n224\n00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.590\nSo if we were to follow Microsoft's\nbest practice at this point in time,\n\n225\n00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.640\nwell remember we would need to go\nback in to that user's folder, under\n\n226\n00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:24.540\nour Windows imaging and configuration\nfolder to delete out that file.\n\n227\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.710\nBecause if we were to password protect,\n\n228\n00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:31.180\nthen we would at least just have that\none secure .ppkg file now instead of\n\n229\n00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:36.520\nhaving to worry about all of our little\nstray remnants or something like that.\n\n230\n00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.870\nOkay, now let's go ahead and,\nyou know what,\n\n231\n00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:46.310\nlet me just, I'm trying to think\nif it'll give us this message.\n\n232\n00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.440\nI don't think it will, but I'll tell you.\n\n233\n00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.820\nLet's say I wanted to start and\nI had started demo project.\n\n234\n00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.870\nAnd I was halfway through and then I\nwanted to pause and come to finish that.\n\n235\n00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.957\nBut maybe when I came back to finish that\nI realized there were some more advanced\n\n236\n00:13:00.957 --> 00:13:03.400\nconfigurations I wanted\nto take advantage of.\n\n237\n00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.864\nIf I tried to switch to\nadvanced provisioning,\n\n238\n00:13:06.864 --> 00:13:10.498\nit's already open I just\ndidn't switch over to it.\n\n239\n00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:13.608\nYeah, so it already,\nwe're too far along in the process now.\n\n240\n00:13:13.608 --> 00:13:18.170\nBut you have the ability to ahead and\nswitch to advanced provisioning.\n\n241\n00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.840\nIf you do that mid project\nbefore your package is created,\n\n242\n00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.560\nyou're not gonna be able to go\nback to this basic interface here.\n\n243\n00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.520\nSo just keep that in mind, I mean,\nit's not the end of the world, but\n\n244\n00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:35.230\nbecause now we're gonna start from\nscratch an advanced provisioning package,\n\n245\n00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.770\nI don't think it'll give us that message.\n\n246\n00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:37.500\nYeah, it doesn't.\n\n247\n00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.420\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n248\n00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:42.020\nSo once you switch you're not gonna\nbe able to switch back to that.\n\n249\n00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.894\nOkay, so this one could be,\nwe'll just call our ProjectDemo_2.\n\n250\n00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.690\nAnd default location is fine,\nwe'll hit Next.\n\n251\n00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:02.610\nOkay, this is the fun part.\n\n252\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:08.910\nAnd I really like, I think this is just so\nmuch better than that basic Wizard.\n\n253\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:13.900\nIf I have an environment and\nI wanna really streamline my\n\n254\n00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.920\nprovisioning packages and\nmake the most out of this process.\n\n255\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:24.317\nI can take and\ntier out commonalities within different\n\n256\n00:14:24.317 --> 00:14:29.270\nparts of my organization and\nkinda tier it up.\n\n257\n00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.544\nSo let me just say,\n\n258\n00:14:30.544 --> 00:14:35.336\nlet's say I know everyone in my\norganization has to use application A.\n\n259\n00:14:35.336 --> 00:14:41.080\nIt's a line of business app,\nif you're here you're using it.\n\n260\n00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.430\nOkay that's easy enough.\n\n261\n00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.360\nSo I can go ahead and create\na provisioning package with application A.\n\n262\n00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:52.140\nHowever, marketing is the only\ndepartment that uses application B.\n\n263\n00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:57.620\nSo then you can take that preexisting\nprovisioning package with A,\n\n264\n00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.420\nand put it here.\n\n265\n00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.990\nSo you know Mike marketing is\ngonna be using app A and app B, so\n\n266\n00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.480\nthen when you create that new provisioning\npackage you have less work to do.\n\n267\n00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.870\nI know it seems silly if you're doing\nit on a very small one off situation.\n\n268\n00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.818\nBut if you think about this\nin a larger environment,\n\n269\n00:15:15.818 --> 00:15:18.160\nit actually makes a lot of sense.\n\n270\n00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.680\nSo you would have a really granular small\nprovision packages, quick installs.\n\n271\n00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.568\nAnd as a matter of fact, Mike, when we\nlook at how we can apply our provisioning\n\n272\n00:15:28.568 --> 00:15:33.030\npackages, there's this one really\ncool feature and it's using NFC.\n\n273\n00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.659\nSo near phone communication is\na short range wireless communication,\n\n274\n00:15:36.659 --> 00:15:39.150\nif you're not familiar\nwith this term already.\n\n275\n00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.960\nA lot of computers have it nowadays.\n\n276\n00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.174\nAnd even, you can get these little tags,\nshoot, I used to get them for\n\n277\n00:15:47.174 --> 00:15:49.400\nmy cell phone because it's so easy.\n\n278\n00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.305\nYou can configure these tags in a certain\nway so that if you take your cell phone\n\n279\n00:15:54.305 --> 00:15:59.135\nand maybe have it tagged by your bed post,\non your night stand or something,\n\n280\n00:15:59.135 --> 00:16:03.990\nto go into sleep mode and all these\ndifferent little settings that you have.\n\n281\n00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.687\nSlide it past there,\nNFC changes the settings on that device\n\n282\n00:16:08.687 --> 00:16:13.420\nuntil you swipe it again and\nthen you can use it that way.\n\n283\n00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.410\nSame thing for\nif you're driving in the car and\n\n284\n00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.320\nhave one hanging from\nyour rearview mirror.\n\n285\n00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.569\nYou can swipe that NFC tag and\nlaunch GPS or disable incoming calls,\n\n286\n00:16:22.569 --> 00:16:26.910\nwhatever you wanna do,\nhowever you set up that device.\n\n287\n00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.052\nThat can actually be done with this,\nwhich is so\n\n288\n00:16:29.052 --> 00:16:31.690\ncool if you think about\nthe potential there.\n\n289\n00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:38.300\nIf we have an NFC tag set up and\na communal, what am I thinking?\n\n290\n00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.380\n&gt;&gt; A conference room or?\n\n291\n00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.180\n&gt;&gt; Conference room, exactly.\n\n292\n00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.500\nAnd so you want devices to follow up\n\n293\n00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:49.610\nparticular security policy while you're\nin this geographical realm or range.\n\n294\n00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:54.400\nThen they simply swipe their\ndevice onto the NFC tag,\n\n295\n00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.070\nthey're good to go so-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love this feature cuz at one,\n\n296\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.410\nyou don't have to start\nfrom the beginning.\n\n297\n00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.250\nAnd a lot of the times in our demos,\n\n298\n00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.170\nwe're going small because\nwe get time constraints.\n\n299\n00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.870\nBut if you think about it,\naverage use of my company is not one app,\n\n300\n00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:09.190\nit's 20 apps-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n301\n00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:10.823\n&gt;&gt; That I have to make\navailable in the image.\n\n302\n00:17:10.823 --> 00:17:14.270\nAnd then for marketing,\nthere is an additional 10 apps.\n\n303\n00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.970\nSo the fact that I'll\nhave to start over and\n\n304\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.973\nadd 20 apps again to a new package or\nproject.\n\n305\n00:17:19.973 --> 00:17:23.518\nAnd then the managers,\nthey need an additional three apps.\n\n306\n00:17:23.518 --> 00:17:26.104\nSo now you're talking about\n20 apps that everybody uses,\n\n307\n00:17:26.104 --> 00:17:29.130\n10 apps that marketing uses plus\nthe 3 that the managers use.\n\n308\n00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:33.310\nSo this will save you a lot of time being\nable to, as you say, tier these packages.\n\n309\n00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure, we don't have\nto have one to start out here.\n\n310\n00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.360\nBut you can go ahead and\ntake advantage of that.\n\n311\n00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:45.055\nNow, this Is that interface that you\nmight already be familiar with if you've\n\n312\n00:17:45.055 --> 00:17:49.675\ntinkered with Windows Imaging and\nConfiguration Designer in the past.\n\n313\n00:17:49.675 --> 00:17:51.865\nAnd that's when they use that full name.\n\n314\n00:17:51.865 --> 00:17:53.315\nBecause you can see up at the top here,\n\n315\n00:17:53.315 --> 00:17:56.667\nthey just call it\nWindows Configuration Designer here.\n\n316\n00:17:56.667 --> 00:18:00.837\nSo if you played around before,\nyou may be looking for\n\n317\n00:18:00.837 --> 00:18:03.537\noptions that you previously\nhad that you don't have.\n\n318\n00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:08.194\nSo just be aware of that,\nsome changes are happening here.\n\n319\n00:18:08.194 --> 00:18:14.309\nWhat I wanna show you are something, some\nsettings here called runtime settings.\n\n320\n00:18:14.309 --> 00:18:17.342\nSo runtime settings, we can go ahead and\n\n321\n00:18:17.342 --> 00:18:20.743\nallow these changes to\nhappen on our system.\n\n322\n00:18:20.743 --> 00:18:25.914\nAnd the way, I think about it Mike,\nokay, I get the OEM device and\n\n323\n00:18:25.914 --> 00:18:30.348\nit's configured with my OOBE,\nOut Of Box Experience.\n\n324\n00:18:30.348 --> 00:18:33.523\nBut I wanna go ahead and configure it for\nmy department or my company or\n\n325\n00:18:33.523 --> 00:18:34.411\nmy organization.\n\n326\n00:18:35.771 --> 00:18:39.151\nSo I can go through each one of these,\ncreate this package,\n\n327\n00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:43.770\napply the package to that device and\nhave that device ready, right?\n\n328\n00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:46.813\nSo that's what we've been\ntalking about this whole time.\n\n329\n00:18:46.813 --> 00:18:48.831\nWhat advantages do I have?\n\n330\n00:18:48.831 --> 00:18:50.250\nWhat kind of settings do I have?\n\n331\n00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.680\nWell, this is a pretty good list.\n\n332\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:59.550\nI can envision this list\ngrowing as time goes on.\n\n333\n00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.780\nBut each one of these little\nsections even builds out,\n\n334\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.680\nI think the longest one\nmay be policies here.\n\n335\n00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.120\nBut let's just start at the top and\nkinda, we won't go through all of these.\n\n336\n00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.060\nBut it's cool because you can\nset up your Azure account.\n\n337\n00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.580\nWe did see that before previously.\n\n338\n00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.570\nIf I wanted to go ahead and\nreally focus in on Browser settings,\n\n339\n00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.970\nCertificates, different connections.\n\n340\n00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.010\nMaybe I'm roaming or something like that.\n\n341\n00:19:26.175 --> 00:19:27.820\nEditionUpgrades, Folders,\n\n342\n00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.590\nHotSpots, Policies is what I\nreally wanted to show you here.\n\n343\n00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:37.500\nBecause there are so\nmany additional, yeah, so\n\n344\n00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.450\nit's like hey, well, let me try\nto zoom out so you can see those.\n\n345\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.440\nAnd then each one of these expand out.\n\n346\n00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.540\nSo let's go with browser.\n\n347\n00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.516\nAnd I mean you can see all\nthese different policies.\n\n348\n00:19:50.516 --> 00:19:53.362\nIt kind of reminds me,\nit has a group policy feel, or\n\n349\n00:19:53.362 --> 00:19:55.065\nsome kind of gpedit feel to it.\n\n350\n00:19:55.065 --> 00:19:55.565\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n351\n00:19:57.235 --> 00:19:58.561\n&gt;&gt; Let's-\n&gt;&gt; Can you zoom into that part?\n\n352\n00:19:58.561 --> 00:19:59.499\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me zoom in.\n\n353\n00:19:59.499 --> 00:20:00.393\n&gt;&gt; Let me see what's\nunderneath the browser there.\n\n354\n00:20:00.393 --> 00:20:03.026\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm trying to see\nsomething that we can do quickly.\n\n355\n00:20:08.737 --> 00:20:14.600\nI know there was a homepage one that\nprevent live tile data collection.\n\n356\n00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.390\nOkay, we'll just randomly\nclick one of these.\n\n357\n00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.650\nThere is just a lot of different options.\n\n358\n00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:23.080\nNow if you're not sure out of every\nsingle one of these means, well,\n\n359\n00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.877\nthey actually have a pretty\nhelpful center pane here that\n\n360\n00:20:26.877 --> 00:20:31.640\nprovides a description of what\nthese individual settings,\n\n361\n00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.440\nthese policies, will allow or disallow and\nhow you should configure them.\n\n362\n00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.360\nSo by default, appear at the top.\n\n363\n00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.080\nWe can see that it's not configured.\n\n364\n00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.836\nSo let's just do what this one says here.\n\n365\n00:20:41.836 --> 00:20:45.734\nSo PreventLifeTileDataCollection, so\n\n366\n00:20:45.734 --> 00:20:50.690\nbasically if Microsoft's collecting\nany data associated with metadata\n\n367\n00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:55.410\nfrom your ieonline.microsoft.com\nservice to provide a better experience.\n\n368\n00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.890\nIf you wanted to opt out of that,\nthen this is where you will go ahead and\n\n369\n00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.260\nset that up.\n\n370\n00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:04.234\nSo what you would do is change\nthis from not configured to this\n\n371\n00:21:04.234 --> 00:21:08.690\none's [LAUGH]\nof course,\n\n372\n00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.370\nI had to pick one that's really long.\n\n373\n00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.700\nA lot of them will just say enabled or\ndisabled.\n\n374\n00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.938\nSo you'd have to just take\nthe time to make sure.\n\n375\n00:21:15.938 --> 00:21:17.657\nSo this one, providing a fuller and\n\n376\n00:21:17.657 --> 00:21:21.568\nmore complete experience basically to\nallow them to collect your data, right?\n\n377\n00:21:21.568 --> 00:21:22.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if we didn't want them to,\n\n378\n00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.285\nthen we're gonna get\nthat minimal experience.\n\n379\n00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:27.700\nSo we're gonna go for that.\n\n380\n00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.080\nBut anyways, just so you could see,\nI wanted to kinda get something that would\n\n381\n00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.490\nshow you if we were to complete this, but\nI don't know if we'll have time to finish.\n\n382\n00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.490\nBut I will show you how\nto set this up anyways.\n\n383\n00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:42.520\nBut just knowing, I mean,\nthe camera connectivity is security and\n\n384\n00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.620\nthat is just within our policy section.\n\n385\n00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.040\nI could go for a while if you're\ntalking about these things.\n\n386\n00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.990\nI'm trying to think,\nis there anything else that I think is so\n\n387\n00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.490\ncool in here that I'm missing out on?\n\n388\n00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.983\nI feel like after the show, I'm gonna\nlike, yeah, I forgot about this one thing.\n\n389\n00:21:58.623 --> 00:21:59.840\nI think we'll be okay.\n\n390\n00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I can sleep at night now, yeah.\n\n391\n00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n392\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:07.700\njust going through there, making sure\nyou have all your different settings.\n\n393\n00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:13.690\nAs you can see, a lot more granular with\n\n394\n00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:18.380\nthat than something that I would have\nwith just that basic walkthrough.\n\n395\n00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.610\nOn the right hand side,\nyou can see the Selected Customizations.\n\n396\n00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.170\nYou can go under your File to go ahead and\nSave it.\n\n397\n00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.210\nLike I said,\nif you were in the middle of this project,\n\n398\n00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.230\nyou wanted to add to it or whatever.\n\n399\n00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:36.120\nSame default location as well,\nnow exporting.\n\n400\n00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.220\nThis is something that we\nreally need to think about.\n\n401\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.090\nOkay, I've created this wonderful,\ngreat provisioning package.\n\n402\n00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:45.080\nHow do I get it to the end user, right?\n\n403\n00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.250\nIt is so easy.\n\n404\n00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.950\nSo it's just like a file,\nhow do you get files to people, Mike?\n\n405\n00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.974\n&gt;&gt; File share, thumb drive-\n&gt;&gt; Email,\n\n406\n00:22:52.974 --> 00:22:53.840\nI mean-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, email.\n\n407\n00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.453\n&gt;&gt; So many different ways,\nyou treat it as that and so\n\n408\n00:22:57.453 --> 00:23:00.129\nthere are a couple, I know, right?\n\n409\n00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:01.992\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's so, and we even said NFC,\n\n410\n00:23:01.992 --> 00:23:02.990\nI mean-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n411\n00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.930\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n\n412\n00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:07.530\nNow, granted, NFC is only gonna be\navailable for mobile devices, but\n\n413\n00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.470\nstill that's pretty cool in my book.\n\n414\n00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.790\nAnd who knows what other\nnewer technologies we'll\n\n415\n00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.610\nadd to this particular feature.\n\n416\n00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.620\nThis is important here.\n\n417\n00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.560\nI do wanna talk about this screen for\n\n418\n00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:24.135\na minute because Microsoft\nis a great company.\n\n419\n00:23:24.135 --> 00:23:28.400\n[LAUGH]\nSometimes\n\n420\n00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.690\nthe answers aren't always glaring.\n\n421\n00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:34.074\nIf you've been studying for\ntime, you already know that.\n\n422\n00:23:34.074 --> 00:23:34.878\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n423\n00:23:34.878 --> 00:23:38.787\nI'll try to provide some\nclarification here.\n\n424\n00:23:38.787 --> 00:23:43.260\nLet's say Mike created a package.\n\n425\n00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.710\nI created a package and\nwe both think our packages are great.\n\n426\n00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:52.330\nWe don't know if someone else from the IT\nDepartment doesn't know whose package to\n\n427\n00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.990\nuse or whose package is more important.\n\n428\n00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.770\nWell, that's what this\nparticular page does for us.\n\n429\n00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:03.420\nWhat it does is it sets a package\nprecedence, if that make sense.\n\n430\n00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:08.790\nSo number one, we have the title of\nthe name, which is a descriptor.\n\n431\n00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:14.011\nHowever, I mentioned this previously,\nto be really descript here, we had\n\n432\n00:24:14.011 --> 00:24:19.328\nthe ability to go ahead and add a major\nand minor formatted versioning field.\n\n433\n00:24:19.328 --> 00:24:25.164\nSo you wanna take advantage of that\nif you're revising a package, okay?\n\n434\n00:24:25.164 --> 00:24:30.765\nSo that your end users or even IT staff,\nknow okay well, this is the older version,\n\n435\n00:24:30.765 --> 00:24:36.551\nI don't want this because we're not using\nthat app or driver, or whatever anymore.\n\n436\n00:24:36.551 --> 00:24:39.895\nBut, that doesn't really help\nwith the conflicting part, right?\n\n437\n00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:44.727\nSo Microsoft under this first field here,\n\n438\n00:24:44.727 --> 00:24:48.493\nthey have some owners listed up.\n\n439\n00:24:48.493 --> 00:24:50.669\nThey're kind of backwards.\n\n440\n00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:54.846\nSo you would think, Microsoft,\ntop dog at the top here but\n\n441\n00:24:54.846 --> 00:24:58.095\nthey're actually at\nthe bottom of the list.\n\n442\n00:24:58.095 --> 00:25:00.531\nSo let's start at the bottom.\n\n443\n00:25:00.531 --> 00:25:05.256\nMicrosoft has this ideology that they\nwant to respect IT admins decisions\n\n444\n00:25:05.256 --> 00:25:09.371\nthat they should know their networks and\ntheir systems, more so\n\n445\n00:25:09.371 --> 00:25:13.429\nthan anyone else, which,\nthat's a fair statement, right?\n\n446\n00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:19.148\nYeah, so they're not trying to push\ntheir default configuration on you,\n\n447\n00:25:19.148 --> 00:25:22.433\nthey want you to have a higher precedence.\n\n448\n00:25:22.433 --> 00:25:25.094\nSo IT Admin is going to have\nthat higher precedence.\n\n449\n00:25:25.094 --> 00:25:28.922\nSo this is actually number one or\nhowever you wanna mentally,\n\n450\n00:25:28.922 --> 00:25:30.918\nthey're at the top of the list.\n\n451\n00:25:30.918 --> 00:25:33.400\nAt least that's how,\nmentally, I think of it.\n\n452\n00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.893\n[LAUGH] But we're going up this list here.\n\n453\n00:25:35.893 --> 00:25:39.934\nMobile operator, System integrator,\nOEM, Silicon vendor and\n\n454\n00:25:39.934 --> 00:25:41.849\nthen Microsoft at the bottom.\n\n455\n00:25:41.849 --> 00:25:47.630\nSo they're defaults, they will allow this\norder to go ahead if you are presented,\n\n456\n00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.605\nif a system is presented with\ntwo conflicting packages.\n\n457\n00:25:51.605 --> 00:25:55.336\nNow, with that being said,\n\n458\n00:25:55.336 --> 00:26:00.005\nwhat if I get two IT admin packages?\n\n459\n00:26:00.005 --> 00:26:02.224\nHow do I choose out of those two, right?\n\n460\n00:26:02.224 --> 00:26:07.174\nSo, over here on the right hand side we\nalso have another section where I can\n\n461\n00:26:07.174 --> 00:26:09.075\ngo ahead and rank by number.\n\n462\n00:26:09.075 --> 00:26:12.326\n0 is the default, so\nI'll go ahead and look if 0 is there,\n\n463\n00:26:12.326 --> 00:26:14.027\nthen that's what it will use.\n\n464\n00:26:14.027 --> 00:26:18.170\nHowever, if 0 is non-existent, gosh,\n\n465\n00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.991\nI gotta make sure I'm seeing this right.\n\n466\n00:26:21.991 --> 00:26:26.989\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hold on, give me two seconds to really\n\n467\n00:26:26.989 --> 00:26:30.044\nlook in my brain for that.\n\n468\n00:26:30.044 --> 00:26:33.706\n&gt;&gt; Is it backwards, the lower\nthe number the higher the priority?\n\n469\n00:26:33.706 --> 00:26:37.280\n&gt;&gt; I think, so I think it's 1 is\nthe higher priority cuz I remember like,\n\n470\n00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.582\nthis is the information that's not readily\navailable but it's in ascending order?\n\n471\n00:26:44.533 --> 00:26:46.137\nI have to double check on that-\n&gt;&gt; The 1, then 2, and 3, yup.\n\n472\n00:26:46.137 --> 00:26:50.241\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I think so, but\nI might have to double check on that.\n\n473\n00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:54.553\nJust be aware of it, if you ever do\nencounter that you want to see how those\n\n474\n00:26:54.553 --> 00:26:58.467\nconflicting packages may be\nworking against each other there.\n\n475\n00:26:58.467 --> 00:27:00.062\nMan, I can't believe I\ncan't remember that.\n\n476\n00:27:00.062 --> 00:27:00.727\nAnyways.\n\n477\n00:27:00.727 --> 00:27:06.322\n[LAUGH] So you definitely\nwanna just be aware of that.\n\n478\n00:27:06.322 --> 00:27:07.779\nWe'll hit Next now, really doesn't matter.\n\n479\n00:27:07.779 --> 00:27:13.397\nThis is that same option that\nwe had before, to encrypt.\n\n480\n00:27:13.397 --> 00:27:16.731\nHowever, we also have the ability\nhere to sign the package, and\n\n481\n00:27:16.731 --> 00:27:18.657\nwe could point to that certificate.\n\n482\n00:27:18.657 --> 00:27:23.690\nSo if I had a policy, maybe I was using\ngroup policy within an Active Directory\n\n483\n00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:27.886\nenvironment, saying that I only\nallow signed packages to run.\n\n484\n00:27:27.886 --> 00:27:32.040\nThen this would ensure that that end\nuser could in fact deploy the proper,\n\n485\n00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.330\nthe legitimate packages on my network.\n\n486\n00:27:37.582 --> 00:27:41.195\nIf you leave it blank, no encryption,\njust like we saw before also.\n\n487\n00:27:41.195 --> 00:27:43.251\nThis is again gonna be\nthat default location.\n\n488\n00:27:43.251 --> 00:27:47.104\nLike I had said,\nsee it's that same pathway it saw before.\n\n489\n00:27:47.104 --> 00:27:50.425\nYou can change that, we'll hit Next.\n\n490\n00:27:50.425 --> 00:27:55.513\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nstart after you hit this Build button.\n\n491\n00:27:55.513 --> 00:27:59.922\nIt does give you an opportunity to\ngo back to make any changes if you\n\n492\n00:27:59.922 --> 00:28:03.381\nwanted to there, but\nwe can go ahead and hit Build.\n\n493\n00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:07.825\nAll right, so now we actually have\nour provisioning package, okay?\n\n494\n00:28:07.825 --> 00:28:14.144\nAnd you can see the project folder,\nand then the actual output location.\n\n495\n00:28:14.144 --> 00:28:17.157\nSo, let's go into our, that location.\n\n496\n00:28:17.157 --> 00:28:21.072\nWe'll just hit Finish here,\nbut let's minimize and\n\n497\n00:28:21.072 --> 00:28:26.911\nwe'll just take a look in File Explorer\nto see what that looks like, all right.\n\n498\n00:28:26.911 --> 00:28:31.390\nSo, let me just go down to our C drive.\n\n499\n00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:39.286\nSo we can start drilling through,\nmaybe you would on your machines, users,\n\n500\n00:28:39.286 --> 00:28:44.746\ndocuments, Windows Imaging and\nConfiguration Designer.\n\n501\n00:28:44.746 --> 00:28:48.336\nAnd then inside of our\ndemo project number two,\n\n502\n00:28:48.336 --> 00:28:51.405\nthat's the one we are working on there.\n\n503\n00:28:51.405 --> 00:28:53.458\nGo ahead and launch that.\n\n504\n00:28:53.458 --> 00:28:57.726\nNow, I have expanded out, we could see\nthat file extension because that is\n\n505\n00:28:57.726 --> 00:29:00.520\ngonna help clue you in\naside from the icon there.\n\n506\n00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.442\nThis is the dot ppkg files, so\nthis is the actual package.\n\n507\n00:29:04.442 --> 00:29:11.049\nAnd you would go ahead and treat it as\nthat file that you wanted to share out.\n\n508\n00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:12.923\nLooking at this, I do see something else.\n\n509\n00:29:12.923 --> 00:29:17.495\nI knew I was forgetting\nsomething in the configurations.\n\n510\n00:29:17.495 --> 00:29:20.274\nThat xml reminded me.\n\n511\n00:29:20.274 --> 00:29:26.298\nSo if I really wanted to get detailed\nwith my customizations there,\n\n512\n00:29:26.298 --> 00:29:31.914\nI could go into, as a matter of fact,\nwe've already built it.\n\n513\n00:29:31.914 --> 00:29:33.997\nWell, I'm trying to think\nhow I could show you that.\n\n514\n00:29:33.997 --> 00:29:37.656\nIf you go back into ICD tool and\nthat drop-down or\n\n515\n00:29:37.656 --> 00:29:41.951\nthat Build off section we're\nlooking at with policies.\n\n516\n00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:45.160\nIf you go into for\ninstance the start up menu and\n\n517\n00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.016\nyou wanted to have a customized start\nup experience for your end user,\n\n518\n00:29:50.016 --> 00:29:54.979\nyou would need to have an XML file\ncreated to tell it exactly how to look.\n\n519\n00:29:54.979 --> 00:30:00.513\nSo just note though that you can get\nto that level of detail with this tool.\n\n520\n00:30:00.513 --> 00:30:04.839\nSo, pretty impressive stuff right there.\n\n521\n00:30:04.839 --> 00:30:06.996\nThinking about the time here.\n\n522\n00:30:06.996 --> 00:30:12.968\n[LAUGH] I don't know if we have enough\nto talk about actually applying it.\n\n523\n00:30:12.968 --> 00:30:16.572\nI think it might be better and\nsave that for a part three.\n\n524\n00:30:16.572 --> 00:30:19.060\nI didn't think we'll get this far but,\nyou know what?\n\n525\n00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:23.274\nThere are different ways we can go\nahead and deploy, apply these packages.\n\n526\n00:30:23.274 --> 00:30:26.995\nAnd they're really cool actually so\nyou don't wanna miss that.\n\n527\n00:30:26.995 --> 00:30:30.648\n&gt;&gt; All right, another one of those\nfamous cliffhangers from Cherokee Boose,\n\n528\n00:30:30.648 --> 00:30:31.683\nwe appreciate that.\n\n529\n00:30:31.683 --> 00:30:33.392\nGreat demonstrations if I can say that.\n\n530\n00:30:33.392 --> 00:30:36.904\nSo far we've got to see the,\nunderstand what packages were about,\n\n531\n00:30:36.904 --> 00:30:38.270\nprovisioning packages.\n\n532\n00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:41.266\nWe'll get to see the process of\nbuilding that package Part three,\n\n533\n00:30:41.266 --> 00:30:44.381\nwe'll get to deploy that package out,\nso make sure you join us then.\n\n534\n00:30:44.381 --> 00:30:47.419\nBut for now, signing off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n535\n00:30:47.419 --> 00:30:48.520\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n536\n00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.529\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n537\n00:30:49.529 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:08.231\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:12.291\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:15.509\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.800\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.960\nToday, we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n9\n00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.811\nSpecifically, in this episode,\nwe're provisioning packages.\n\n10\n00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:25.983\nThis is a part three, so make sure you go\nback and check out the first two parts.\n\n11\n00:00:25.983 --> 00:00:29.145\nBut continuing on with our packaging\nprovisioning is none other than Ms.\n\n12\n00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:29.920\nCherokee Boose.\n\n13\n00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.530\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.030\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me Mike, how are you?\n\n15\n00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.350\n&gt;&gt; I am excited to see our next\nphase of package provisioning.\n\n16\n00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.955\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe have actually gone quite a bit into it.\n\n17\n00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:40.554\nWe've looked at how to create them.\n\n18\n00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:43.840\nBut now we need to go ahead and\napply them, right?\n\n19\n00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.899\nIt's not good to create them if we're\njust gonna have them sitting somewhere in\n\n20\n00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.120\nholding, so to speak.\n\n21\n00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.415\nSo let's go ahead,\n\n22\n00:00:50.415 --> 00:00:54.761\nand there were a couple other things\nthat I did wanna take a look at and\n\n23\n00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:59.891\nshow you that we didn't quite get to in\nthat first or second show, I should say.\n\n24\n00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:00.746\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n25\n00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:02.000\n&gt;&gt; So let's just go ahead and\ntake a look at those.\n\n26\n00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.615\nI'm gonna go ahead and log in here.\n\n27\n00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:08.906\nSo what we're gonna be doing\nis creating a new package.\n\n28\n00:01:08.906 --> 00:01:12.845\nAnd this setting that\nI wanna show you guys,\n\n29\n00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:19.351\nI might have mentioned it in the other\nshow, but it's very hard to miss.\n\n30\n00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:24.510\nAnd I think it's kind of odd\nthat it's not highlighted.\n\n31\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.890\nIt's kind of like a hidden gem.\n\n32\n00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.675\nI think it's a really cool feature.\n\n33\n00:01:27.675 --> 00:01:30.764\nSo that's why I wanted to spend some\ntime talking about that in the show.\n\n34\n00:01:30.764 --> 00:01:32.639\nIt's called Clean PC.\n\n35\n00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:36.236\nAnd what it is,\nis a configuration service provider.\n\n36\n00:01:36.236 --> 00:01:41.280\nWell, it is one of the settings\nmodeled after a configuration service\n\n37\n00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.078\nprovider that we see within our\nWindows Configuration Designer.\n\n38\n00:01:46.078 --> 00:01:48.931\nSo let's go ahead and launch that tool up.\n\n39\n00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:50.499\nSo if you guys remember,\n\n40\n00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:56.090\nthat was installed from our ADK toolkit\nthat we had grabbed and downloaded.\n\n41\n00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.600\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nscroll down here and try to find that.\n\n42\n00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.190\n&gt;&gt; This was the tool with many names?\n\n43\n00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.340\nThe Windows Image and\nDesign Configuration.\n\n44\n00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.127\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it used to have that imaging\npart, and then they took that away.\n\n45\n00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:14.040\nSo now it's just WCD, instead of WICD.\n\n46\n00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.680\nAnd a lot of people\nnicknamed it wicked there.\n\n47\n00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.560\nSo you might still hear people say it,\n\n48\n00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.050\nbecause it just kinda has\na little ring to it, Mike.\n\n49\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.720\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n50\n00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, and see, it even has\nthe I still there in the Start menu, but\n\n51\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.431\nlike we had seen before in\ndifferent places, it doesn't.\n\n52\n00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:32.214\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n53\n00:02:32.214 --> 00:02:34.020\njust giving that a second there.\n\n54\n00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.351\nI should've worn my glasses.\n\n55\n00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:36.090\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n\n56\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.144\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz I was like, I couldn't\nsee it and I remember in the last show,\n\n57\n00:02:40.144 --> 00:02:42.659\nI think my vision's getting worse, Mike.\n\n58\n00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:43.964\nI might need a checkup.\n\n59\n00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:45.848\n&gt;&gt; You got accessability\noptions in Windows 10.\n\n60\n00:02:45.848 --> 00:02:46.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll have to-\n\n61\n00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.279\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I'm definelty\n\n62\n00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:49.644\ngonna take advantage of that.\n\n63\n00:02:49.644 --> 00:02:53.620\nOkay, so it looks like I already\nhave an instance of that running.\n\n64\n00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.016\nI don't see that, so let me go ahead and\ncheck that out here in Task Manager.\n\n65\n00:02:59.016 --> 00:03:00.373\nThere it is, right there.\n\n66\n00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:03.360\nAs soon as I launched Task Manager,\nI do see it pop up there.\n\n67\n00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.970\nAll right, that's fine, we're good to go.\n\n68\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.570\nSo what we're gonna do also something that\nI wanted to kinda just show you as well in\n\n69\n00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.590\nthat last show was switching\nmid-provisioning to go ahead and\n\n70\n00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.150\nswitch to that advanced\nconfiguration designer also.\n\n71\n00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.202\nSo we'll just start here with our\ndefault start page, that more basic UI,\n\n72\n00:03:25.202 --> 00:03:29.147\nso we'll go ahead and\nclick on that to go ahead and launch.\n\n73\n00:03:29.147 --> 00:03:33.596\nLet's create a name for this that's really\ntailored to what it is I wanna show you.\n\n74\n00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:37.236\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ncall this one Clean PC.\n\n75\n00:03:37.236 --> 00:03:42.095\nAnd then, of course, we would, in real\nlife, for production wanna go ahead and\n\n76\n00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:44.570\ntake time to give a description.\n\n77\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.010\nAnd [LAUGH] I'll describe to\nyou what Clean PC really does.\n\n78\n00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.720\nI know I said it was cool, but\nI don't think if I've mentioned that.\n\n79\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.007\nSo what Clean PC does is take a device and\nkind of scrub it and\n\n80\n00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:59.920\nsanitize it, if you will,\nto get it ready for your organization.\n\n81\n00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.667\nSo let's say, Mike, I hired you and you're\na salesperson, maybe commission based.\n\n82\n00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:08.803\nAnd I was just a new startup company and\nI didn't have a lot of money for\n\n83\n00:04:08.803 --> 00:04:10.439\nequipment, something like that.\n\n84\n00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.330\nAnd you're like, that's okay,\nI have tons of electronic devices.\n\n85\n00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.300\nI'm like, great, well, bring one in and\nyou can use it for work.\n\n86\n00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.060\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n87\n00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.195\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n88\n00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:19.993\n&gt;&gt; But all that stuff I've got on my PC,\n\n89\n00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:22.423\nis that appropriate for work, or is it-\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n90\n00:04:22.423 --> 00:04:23.143\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n91\n00:04:23.143 --> 00:04:23.680\n&gt;&gt; Do you know?\n\n92\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.558\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who's gonna determine that?\n\n93\n00:04:25.558 --> 00:04:29.550\nSo, hey, we've already came up with\na list of things within our organization,\n\n94\n00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.880\napplications, maybe websites for our\nhomepage, that are appropriate for work.\n\n95\n00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.190\nWe've already defined that, so\nhow about I just clean your device and\n\n96\n00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.790\nconfigure it with all of\nthe approved content?\n\n97\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.990\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a lot of work.\n\n98\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.785\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, doesn't it?\n\n99\n00:04:43.785 --> 00:04:48.135\nAnd I've had to do this before,\nI'm sure you have, too, right?\n\n100\n00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:50.790\n[LAUGH] It happens.\n\n101\n00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.338\nSo that's why I wanted to spend\nsome time to really show this.\n\n102\n00:04:53.338 --> 00:04:58.615\nBecause think about, if we had some\ntool to go ahead and do this all for\n\n103\n00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:03.085\nus or\nwhat if I had more than just one user?\n\n104\n00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:05.815\nSo more than just Mike,\nI hired five new employees.\n\n105\n00:05:05.815 --> 00:05:10.984\nInstead of going through each\niteration there, each process,\n\n106\n00:05:10.984 --> 00:05:16.152\nthis process five times,\nI could set up a configuration once and\n\n107\n00:05:16.152 --> 00:05:19.901\nthen quickly deploy it\nto those five devices.\n\n108\n00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:20.501\n&gt;&gt; Nice, I like that idea.\n\n109\n00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:22.800\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, it's actually really cool.\n\n110\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.479\nAnd when we're talking about\nprovisioning packages,\n\n111\n00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.628\nthe different ways that you can\napply provisioning packages,\n\n112\n00:05:30.628 --> 00:05:34.550\nit's just another thing that\nblows my mind, it is so cool.\n\n113\n00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.583\nSo we have our normal means of\ndistribution that we hinted at in that, or\n\n114\n00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:40.274\nmentioned in that last show.\n\n115\n00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:44.688\nThings like, hey, we can send a URL,\nwe can send the file.\n\n116\n00:05:44.688 --> 00:05:49.135\nThe .ppkg file, we can send it\nas an attachment in an email,\n\n117\n00:05:49.135 --> 00:05:51.066\non a share, on a network.\n\n118\n00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:54.733\nYou can have it embedded\ninside of an image.\n\n119\n00:05:54.733 --> 00:05:59.970\nYou can use removable media, USB,\nand regular means that we've seen\n\n120\n00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.205\nit in the past but on newer technology\nthat I think is really cool that we\n\n121\n00:06:05.205 --> 00:06:10.907\nhave with this particular configuration\nis utilizing, leveraging NFC.\n\n122\n00:06:10.907 --> 00:06:14.550\nSo near-field communication for\nthese packages,\n\n123\n00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.942\nif you configure an NFC device or even\nchip, you could also apply it that way.\n\n124\n00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:21.225\nSo I'm like that's so cool.\n\n125\n00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:22.323\n&gt;&gt; It is pretty neat.\n\n126\n00:06:22.323 --> 00:06:26.972\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna actually be applying\nwith PowerShell in this show here.\n\n127\n00:06:26.972 --> 00:06:30.415\nJust wanna make sure that all bases are\ncovered, especially for that exam because\n\n128\n00:06:30.415 --> 00:06:35.160\ndouble-clicking on the package, the file,\nI think you guys know how to do that.\n\n129\n00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.470\nWe don't need to spend time doing that.\n\n130\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.080\nGo ahead and\nhit Finish just to name it there.\n\n131\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.410\nGosh, I've been talking this whole\ntime and we just got a name.\n\n132\n00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.903\nThis might need an extra part, Mike.\n\n133\n00:06:47.903 --> 00:06:53.128\nOkay, speaking of names, we do need\nto think about a name for the PC.\n\n134\n00:06:53.128 --> 00:06:56.924\nSo let's say this PC that Mike\nbrought in had, I don't know,\n\n135\n00:06:56.924 --> 00:07:01.022\nyou guys like to use Star Wars names for\nyour devices, don't you?\n\n136\n00:07:01.022 --> 00:07:02.431\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I do, yeah,\n\n137\n00:07:02.431 --> 00:07:03.877\nmy laptop's name is Dagobah.\n\n138\n00:07:03.877 --> 00:07:04.516\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n139\n00:07:04.516 --> 00:07:06.749\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So maybe if he had Chewie for\n\n140\n00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:11.648\nthe name of his machine, I'm like okay,\nwell, that's not work appropriate.\n\n141\n00:07:11.648 --> 00:07:15.360\nI need to pick something like,\nhe's in Gainesville, FL,\n\n142\n00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.911\nso I'll put like GNV dash, and\nthen that normal convention of numbers.\n\n143\n00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:23.400\nOkay, so I go ahead and choose that.\n\n144\n00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.180\nWell, let's take a look at my screen here,\nand I'll just go with new name for now.\n\n145\n00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.280\nAnd remember, we already talked\nabout what this portion does for us.\n\n146\n00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.744\nAnd that's gonna be creating\na random number there just to\n\n147\n00:07:37.744 --> 00:07:40.015\nmake sure that that device is unique.\n\n148\n00:07:40.015 --> 00:07:45.418\nIf I had used the GNV dash number number\nnaming convention on my network already,\n\n149\n00:07:45.418 --> 00:07:49.635\nI didn't wanna override or\nhave a conflict of computer names.\n\n150\n00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:53.723\nSo okay, now I think we're gonna\nleave the other things as is, but\n\n151\n00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:57.884\nwhat I wanted to go ahead and\ndo here Is switched to Advanced Editor,\n\n152\n00:07:57.884 --> 00:08:02.702\nbecause I wanted to show you just that\nquick little message that does pop up when\n\n153\n00:08:02.702 --> 00:08:05.920\nyou decide to go ahead and\nswitch to Advance Editor.\n\n154\n00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.268\nI don't know if I have to go to\nthe next blade here and then click it.\n\n155\n00:08:09.268 --> 00:08:13.290\nLet's see, okay,\nthis is what I wanted to show you.\n\n156\n00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.700\nIt says you can view and configure all\npossible settings in the advanced editor.\n\n157\n00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.850\nBut once you switch, you can't open\nthis project in the simple editor again.\n\n158\n00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.750\nSo I did tell you about that,\nbut I just wanted to remind you.\n\n159\n00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.740\nAnd yeah, that's fine.\n\n160\n00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.759\nCuz we're gonna learn how to do both.\n\n161\n00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:34.733\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I remembered,\n\n162\n00:08:34.733 --> 00:08:38.931\nit was All Dogs Go To Heaven, that's where\nthat saying, you can never come back.\n\n163\n00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:40.492\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n164\n00:08:40.492 --> 00:08:43.201\n&gt;&gt; You guys think I'm crazy now,\nbut you just have no clue.\n\n165\n00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:45.718\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n166\n00:08:45.718 --> 00:08:47.500\nnow we've changed the name.\n\n167\n00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.869\nSo it's not gonna be something\nlike Yoda or Chewie, or\n\n168\n00:08:50.869 --> 00:08:53.920\nDaka, but it's gonna be work-related.\n\n169\n00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.040\nSo what other things can we do?\n\n170\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.850\nYou've seen this before,\nthese are going to be my configuration\n\n171\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:05.450\nservice provider like inspired\nI should say setting here,\n\n172\n00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.240\nbecause that's really\nwhere the idea comes from.\n\n173\n00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.690\nAnd this is that option I was\nspeaking about, right here.\n\n174\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.140\nLet me zoom in so\nyou guys can see that, CleanPC.\n\n175\n00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.490\nSo I want to go ahead and\nexpand this out and\n\n176\n00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.660\ntake a look at the different\noptions that I do have.\n\n177\n00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.220\nTwo different options here, and I will\njust zoom out, because in the center pane\n\n178\n00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.340\nwhen you click on one, we'll look at them\nindividually, you can see the specifics.\n\n179\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.152\nAnd I can pull this up, so\nwe can really get a good view.\n\n180\n00:09:37.886 --> 00:09:42.853\nJust linking to that Microsoft Docs\npage here to kinda give you\n\n181\n00:09:42.853 --> 00:09:46.970\nan idea about what this\nparticular CSP does for us.\n\n182\n00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.890\nThe clean PC CSP, right?\n\n183\n00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:55.030\nSo I can go ahead and\nby default they're set to not configured.\n\n184\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.909\nThis one is easy, I think in the last\nshow, there was like a really long option\n\n185\n00:09:58.909 --> 00:10:01.791\nthere that we have to read through,\nbut look at this one.\n\n186\n00:10:01.791 --> 00:10:04.820\nYou can either enable it,\nit or just not configure it.\n\n187\n00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.370\nSo super easy there.\n\n188\n00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.900\nWe are gonna actually enable this,\nbecause,\n\n189\n00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.932\nlook at this title,\nClean PC Retaining User Data.\n\n190\n00:10:15.932 --> 00:10:20.049\nSo what if Mike had some\nimportant family photos or\n\n191\n00:10:20.049 --> 00:10:24.861\nsomething on that computer that\nhe wanted to use for work?\n\n192\n00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:29.140\nHe didn't mention them to me, so I didn't\nknow if he wanted me to delete them.\n\n193\n00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.677\nI'm not gonna assume that at all, because\nI don't want Mike to be upset with me,\n\n194\n00:10:33.677 --> 00:10:34.493\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n195\n00:10:34.493 --> 00:10:36.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n196\n00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.050\nretain that user data.\n\n197\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.990\nI also have another option right\nhere to clean the PC without\n\n198\n00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.280\nretaining the user data.\n\n199\n00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.730\nYou would just wanna make sure that\nthey were aware of that as well.\n\n200\n00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.820\nSo we're gonna go ahead and keep this\nsetting as part of our provisioning\n\n201\n00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:58.210\npackage here, but I also wanna go ahead\nand just add maybe one other thing.\n\n202\n00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:02.580\nSo while we're here, I'll try to see\nif I have anything else I want to show.\n\n203\n00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.370\nThat'll be good for right now,\n\n204\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.640\nI really wanted to spend some\ntime with this clean PC option.\n\n205\n00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:12.340\nBut let's also go ahead and add a couple\nof users to this particular system.\n\n206\n00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.855\nSo maybe that device that Mike's\nbringing in also has to be shared,\n\n207\n00:11:15.855 --> 00:11:19.383\nbecause I'm a super cheap employer,\nand, [LAUGH], I don't know.\n\n208\n00:11:19.383 --> 00:11:22.641\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe you could have had\na help desk account that you use, or\n\n209\n00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:23.840\nsomething like that.\n\n210\n00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.590\n&gt;&gt; There you go, yeah.\n\n211\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.837\nThanks for helping me out there.\n\n212\n00:11:25.837 --> 00:11:30.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and do that.\n\n213\n00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.690\nSo I do have a couple options here.\n\n214\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.590\nI don't want a computer account,\nI actually want a user.\n\n215\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.040\nMake sure I'm clicking\nin the right spot here.\n\n216\n00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:44.230\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'll add Pebbles as a user here.\n\n217\n00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.940\nThis isn't technically\nlike computer help desk.\n\n218\n00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.070\nAnything formal like that.\n\n219\n00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.648\nI'm going against my whole ideology here,\nbut that's okay.\n\n220\n00:11:51.648 --> 00:11:53.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We'll go ahead and add her.\n\n221\n00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.809\nNow notice on the left-hand side,\nover here,\n\n222\n00:11:56.809 --> 00:11:59.310\nthere's like a red exclamation point.\n\n223\n00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.420\nSo that's gonna be a clue to go ahead and\n\n224\n00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.900\nclick on that,\nbecause there's some kind of action.\n\n225\n00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.710\nAnd also, over in the right-hand pane,\n\n226\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.730\nif I bring this back, you can see there's\nsome kind of issue going on there.\n\n227\n00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:15.660\nIt's not really an issue,\nit's just assistance to remind us.\n\n228\n00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.640\nYou know what, you need to go ahead and\nyou can add a home directory or\n\n229\n00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.730\nspecify a user group if you wanted to.\n\n230\n00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.760\nWe're not going to set that for\nright now, but we could.\n\n231\n00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.800\nAt minimum, putting in a password here.\n\n232\n00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.770\nSo even if it is something like\n\n233\n00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.800\njust a generic default password\nwhere that user changes.\n\n234\n00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:44.490\nNotice how when I typed that it didn't\nuse cypher text, it's in plain text here.\n\n235\n00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.374\nBut it's kind of interesting\nwhen you look at the XML files,\n\n236\n00:12:48.374 --> 00:12:52.643\nbecause we're essentially creating\nXML configuration files and\n\n237\n00:12:52.643 --> 00:12:57.290\nwe're creating this package,\nit will put just the word, Password, so\n\n238\n00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.515\nit's not divulging that\ninformation in any way.\n\n239\n00:13:00.515 --> 00:13:05.511\nBut if you recall in that previous show I\ndid say, look, you do have the ability to\n\n240\n00:13:05.511 --> 00:13:10.140\nencrypt this package and then delete\nthe project as soon as you're done.\n\n241\n00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.380\nJust for other, you might be accidentally\ndisclosing other types of information.\n\n242\n00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.570\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n\n243\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.560\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe'll go ahead and add Pebbles.\n\n244\n00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.360\nIf we click on users again,\nwe can add one more person.\n\n245\n00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.250\nActually, let me go back and\n\n246\n00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:34.120\nclick on Pebbles and,\nlet's put her as an administrator.\n\n247\n00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.290\nWait, did I click on her?\n\n248\n00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.400\nYes, okay, so right here, just wanted\nto make sure I was actually doing\n\n249\n00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.520\nwhat I said I was doing,\nso we'll go back to Users.\n\n250\n00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:51.570\nIt's weird, a lot of interfaces have\na Save button or something, too.\n\n251\n00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.838\nYou don't see that here.\n\n252\n00:13:52.838 --> 00:13:56.020\nBe aware of that.\n\n253\n00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:56.910\n&gt;&gt; It makes me nervous.\n\n254\n00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.300\n&gt;&gt; It does make me nervous, too.\n\n255\n00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.922\nI remember when they first\nintroduced an autosave into the OS,\n\n256\n00:14:03.922 --> 00:14:07.682\nand I just was like,\nI don't know about this.\n\n257\n00:14:07.682 --> 00:14:08.699\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we're so\n\n258\n00:14:08.699 --> 00:14:11.891\nused to having to click Apply before\nwe go to the next tab because\n\n259\n00:14:11.891 --> 00:14:13.350\nour changes will go away.\n\n260\n00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And not so much anymore.\n\n261\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.436\n&gt;&gt; Right, all right.\n\n262\n00:14:17.436 --> 00:14:19.730\nSo Barney, I think that I'm just\ngonna go ahead and leave him.\n\n263\n00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.630\nI'm not going to add him\nas an administrator, but\n\n264\n00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.500\nwe should be good to go.\n\n265\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.900\nNow, I could go ahead and\nsave this package.\n\n266\n00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.530\nI could use this little\nexport if I wanted to save it\n\n267\n00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.070\nto come back to work on it later.\n\n268\n00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.450\nBut right now let's go ahead and\nbuild this provisioning package.\n\n269\n00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.030\nOops.\nWhat does it say here for Barney?\n\n270\n00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.370\nLooks like we do have some\nissue with Barney here.\n\n271\n00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.870\nI did not give him a password.\n\n272\n00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.465\nSo we'll also need to\ngive him a password too.\n\n273\n00:14:47.465 --> 00:14:49.960\nBut I just said that, didn't I?\n\n274\n00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.010\nAll right, so\nnow we can go ahead and export.\n\n275\n00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.990\nAnd remember our rankings here, right?\n\n276\n00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:04.090\nSo IT admin gives the highest\nprecedence and then maybe we also want\n\n277\n00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:09.150\nto give the highest precedence over here\nfor if there was any secondary conflict.\n\n278\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.480\nWe'll go ahead and hit Next and\nwe won't encrypt this particular one,\n\n279\n00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.972\nand let's go ahead and build this package.\n\n280\n00:15:16.972 --> 00:15:19.574\nAll right, so\nthat didn't take very long, all done.\n\n281\n00:15:19.574 --> 00:15:25.594\nAs a matter of fact, there is going to\nbe a portion that does take a long time,\n\n282\n00:15:25.594 --> 00:15:30.206\nbecause we've implemented our\nactual clean PC CSP here,\n\n283\n00:15:30.206 --> 00:15:35.180\nit's going to reset that computer,\nso it does take a while.\n\n284\n00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.236\nJust be aware of that.\n\n285\n00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.150\nWe'll do a TV timeout for you.\n\n286\n00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.299\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n287\n00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:44.439\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n288\n00:15:44.439 --> 00:15:48.021\nclose out of here, because,\nreally my work is done.\n\n289\n00:15:48.021 --> 00:15:52.384\nI do have that file, that package\nfile that I've double clicked here.\n\n290\n00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:56.460\nBut that's going to be sitting,\nremember that default location I\n\n291\n00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:01.261\nhaven't modified that as of yet, that's\ngoing to be under our C drive users,\n\n292\n00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:05.189\nI think my current logged on users And\nthen under documents, and\n\n293\n00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:08.490\nthen Windows imaging and\nconfiguration files here.\n\n294\n00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.350\nAnd this is that actual folder\ncontaining those packages.\n\n295\n00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.290\nSo if I wanted to just, I don't know.\n\n296\n00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.310\n&gt;&gt; So you're gonna copy that and\nput that in a network share somewhere.\n\n297\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYeah, because like we said,\n\n298\n00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.540\nthere are a lot of ways\nthat we could go ahead and\n\n299\n00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.610\nget this information to that end user.\n\n300\n00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.280\nSo, let me see,\n\n301\n00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.730\nhere I have a shared folder that\nI could go ahead and drop it in.\n\n302\n00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.740\nNow, my other, okay, so\nI do have this copy here so that's fine.\n\n303\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:41.370\nI already had another\nsimilar configuration there.\n\n304\n00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.820\nSo you could go ahead, drag and\ndrop it in there, we're good to go, right?\n\n305\n00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.430\nDistribution will be at your discretion,\nthat's all.\n\n306\n00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:55.180\nSo now, let's go ahead and since I\nalready had that package there sitting\n\n307\n00:16:55.180 --> 00:17:00.420\nin my Shared folder, let's go to the other\ncomputer that has that share access.\n\n308\n00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:05.180\nAnd so this will be, we're simulating now\nthat machine that, this is a new machine,\n\n309\n00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.800\nso this is like that machine that might\nrun into us that we need to go ahead and\n\n310\n00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.590\nprovision.\n\n311\n00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:13.010\nRemember, we're not\nre-imaging this machine or\n\n312\n00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.410\nprovisioning this machine with\nour provisioning package.\n\n313\n00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:23.110\nSo, we can go ahead and\nget that particular file off the VM share.\n\n314\n00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.750\nAnd I think as I was like\nsetting up this demo,\n\n315\n00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.280\nI already placed it here on my C drive.\n\n316\n00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.350\nLet me just check.\n\n317\n00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:32.370\nYeah, we've got that there on my C drive,\nso we're good to go.\n\n318\n00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:38.300\nAnd like I said,\nI could go ahead in here and\n\n319\n00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:43.050\nactually click on, double click,\nto run and execute that.\n\n320\n00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.380\nThis is that XML configuration\nfile that I was telling you about.\n\n321\n00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.100\nThis one might just be a little bit\ndifferent there because I changed\n\n322\n00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.020\nsomething but I think for\nthe most part it's the same.\n\n323\n00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.885\nYou guys, what I wanted to show\nyou here is some of the settings.\n\n324\n00:17:59.885 --> 00:18:00.400\nRight?\n\n325\n00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.630\nSo here we have Barney.\n\n326\n00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:03.510\nI was wrong.\n\n327\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.660\nIt does have that password here\nin plain text for the XML file.\n\n328\n00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.440\nThat is really good to know.\n\n329\n00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.600\nI must have just seen this part here for\npassword, but\n\n330\n00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.600\nyeah it definitely has\nthat in clear text there.\n\n331\n00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.650\n&gt;&gt; Another great reason to make sure\nwe protect those project files.\n\n332\n00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:20.920\n&gt;&gt; For sure, definitely.\n\n333\n00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.040\nYup.\nYeah, and then you can just see here,\n\n334\n00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.470\nthis is that one setting that I really\nwanted us to take a look at here.\n\n335\n00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:32.280\nClean PC, retaining user data so\njust knowing, you know?\n\n336\n00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:37.100\nThis is that, I guess,\nthe subsistence to your package there,\n\n337\n00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.855\nthe instruction set behind all of it.\n\n338\n00:18:38.855 --> 00:18:41.648\nOops, too clicky.\n\n339\n00:18:41.648 --> 00:18:43.370\nAll right.\n\n340\n00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.630\nActually, I wanted to show\nyou the start menu anyways.\n\n341\n00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.780\nThis computer makes.\n\n342\n00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.220\nComputer has all sorts of games and\nstuff on here.\n\n343\n00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.950\n&gt;&gt; You know,\nwe've gotta do something during lunch.\n\n344\n00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:02.228\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, and as nice of it was\nfor Mike to bring this computer in to me,\n\n345\n00:19:02.228 --> 00:19:04.230\nI still want him to be productive.\n\n346\n00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.880\nI'm paying him.\n\n347\n00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.890\nEven though it might be on commission,\nI still have to think about that.\n\n348\n00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.230\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, and\nespecially when you start to think, okay,\n\n349\n00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.410\nnow I'm gonna put corporate\ndata on this machine and\n\n350\n00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.415\nhave I vetted all those different\napps that Mike has installed?\n\n351\n00:19:16.415 --> 00:19:18.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How many of them have security flaws?\n\n352\n00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.830\nIs he keeping those up to date?\n\n353\n00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.710\nAnd we might, as our company policy,\nwe don't allow things like that.\n\n354\n00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:23.430\nYou need to clean up.\n\n355\n00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.185\n&gt;&gt; That is very true.\n\n356\n00:19:24.185 --> 00:19:26.210\nYeah.\nSo we don't want to take any risks there.\n\n357\n00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:30.290\nSo, what we're gonna do to go ahead and\napply this particular package,\n\n358\n00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.940\nis launch a Powershell.\n\n359\n00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.720\nI think I have it pinned\nhere at the bottome.\n\n360\n00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.660\nYep, and it's an administrative prompt\nwhich is great because that's what we need\n\n361\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.660\nLet me go full screen here.\n\n362\n00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:45.750\nBecause, just remember that PC package\nis sitting there on our C drive.\n\n363\n00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.860\nSo the first commandlet that I wanna\njust show you was just Get-Help\n\n364\n00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:56.320\nassociated with our Add-Package,\nlet me type through here.\n\n365\n00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:03.650\nThey'll let me, I can be patient,\njust to show you there's not a ton of\n\n366\n00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:08.180\nhelp here and even if you go out, as\na matter of fact I do think I have a link.\n\n367\n00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.126\nLet me bring that up,\nwe can take a look at that real quick.\n\n368\n00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:20.642\nYeah, so this is going to be a list\nhere and I've also put this link along\n\n369\n00:20:20.642 --> 00:20:26.950\nwith other great resource references in\nthe show notes for you guys to study with.\n\n370\n00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:30.010\nBut if you wanna take a look at these,\nthere are gonna be your commandlets\n\n371\n00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:35.170\nthat are associated with\nwhat it is we're doing here.\n\n372\n00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.420\nWe'll be looking and\nusing this Add-ProvisioningPackage\n\n373\n00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.910\napp to go ahead and\napply that provisioning package.\n\n374\n00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.420\nJust know,\nyou do have other options like removing.\n\n375\n00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.930\nYou have the ability to go ahead and\nuse install certificates.\n\n376\n00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.420\nSo get provisioning package,\nwe'll take a look at that one as well.\n\n377\n00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.480\nAlso export provisioning package, so\n\n378\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:59.210\nif I wanted to use this commandlet on\nthat first computer where I had generated\n\n379\n00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:03.240\nthat particular provisioning package,\nwe can do that as well.\n\n380\n00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:07.700\nNow, and also in my demo I have\ntwo machines going here but.\n\n381\n00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.760\nYou don't always have to, if for\nsome reason you wanted to go ahead and\n\n382\n00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.460\ncreate a provisioning package and\nthen run it on the same system,\n\n383\n00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.530\nyou could do that as well.\n\n384\n00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:18.920\nI'm just showing some variation here.\n\n385\n00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.780\nBecause normally, you probably wouldn't\nbe provisioning it on the computer\n\n386\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.629\nwith your actual work tools.\n\n387\n00:21:28.427 --> 00:21:29.750\nWhoops, I grabbed the wrong VM.\n\n388\n00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:30.800\nLet me get that other one.\n\n389\n00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.220\nThis was the one I wanted to show you.\n\n390\n00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.510\nAlright, so it didn't come through,\nI'm just going to go ahead [LAUGH] and\n\n391\n00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.880\ntype this one and maybe have it-\n&gt;&gt; Is\n\n392\n00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.660\nit a provisioning package or just package?\n\n393\n00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.470\n&gt;&gt; Let me check, it might be provisioning,\nthat's probably why.\n\n394\n00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:46.250\nIt is add provisioning package,\nthat is it.\n\n395\n00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:49.730\n&gt;&gt; We're in that tap auto field,\nhelps us out.\n\n396\n00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.355\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know Mike, you're telling me.\n\n397\n00:21:52.355 --> 00:21:56.570\n[LAUGH] Alright, so\nadd provisioning package.\n\n398\n00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.200\nWe'll go ahead and run that real quick.\n\n399\n00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.630\nSo this is kind of like just examples\nof what I was showing you on that\n\n400\n00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.430\nURL page there.\n\n401\n00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.110\nJust wanted to get that up.\n\n402\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:12.380\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nuse the add-provisioning package.\n\n403\n00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.090\nCommandlet here.\n\n404\n00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.920\nGo ahead and clear this out.\n\n405\n00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.710\nSo we do need to specify where\nthat package resides here.\n\n406\n00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.500\nSo we go ahead and just note that.\n\n407\n00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.199\nSo this is going to be\nadd provisioning package.\n\n408\n00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:33.604\nAnd I am gonna tab through this because\nI wanted to show you this particular\n\n409\n00:22:33.604 --> 00:22:35.280\ncommandlet as well.\n\n410\n00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.060\nThis is not the commandlet we need.\n\n411\n00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.300\n&gt;&gt; Easy to get those confused.\n\n412\n00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.960\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so sometimes especially if\nyou're on a deadline or something and\n\n413\n00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.066\nyou're trying to get this user deployed or\nprovisioned quickly,\n\n414\n00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:48.720\nI could see that being an error,\n\n415\n00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.670\nI could also see that being a test\nquestion because they are so similar.\n\n416\n00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:57.667\nSo just kind of make sure you\nare choosing the correct syntax here, so\n\n417\n00:22:57.667 --> 00:23:01.380\nthis is Add-ProvisioningPackage.\n\n418\n00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.610\nAll right, now let's go ahead and\nuse our package path.\n\n419\n00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.546\nGo ahead and tab through here if it will.\n\n420\n00:23:11.506 --> 00:23:12.860\nGive it a second.\n\n421\n00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.920\nI've gone too crazy with my typing,\nit appears.\n\n422\n00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.405\nBut we need to specify, not just\nlike you could, we're just gonna say\n\n423\n00:23:20.405 --> 00:23:24.180\n-PackagePath here to let it know\nwhere it lives on that C drive.\n\n424\n00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.200\nAll right, here was my extra K.\n\n425\n00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.780\nWe don't need that.\n\n426\n00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.590\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nlet it know that was in our clean PC.\n\n427\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:37.610\nNow, the name of that folder,\nthat was auto-generated.\n\n428\n00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.980\nI didn't choose the name\nof that folder that has.\n\n429\n00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.720\nIt contains all of the provision\npackaging information.\n\n430\n00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.140\nYou might also create\nan additional file for manifest for\n\n431\n00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.840\nextra meta data if you wanted to.\n\n432\n00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.260\nAnd it has, like you saw that XML file.\n\n433\n00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.670\nSo any kind of associations there.\n\n434\n00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:00.080\nAll right but we want to actually go all\nthe way down to the name of the package.\n\n435\n00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.331\nSo we'll go ahead and\njust make sure we do that here as well.\n\n436\n00:24:05.331 --> 00:24:06.619\nIf it will let me.\n&gt;&gt; As it thinks about it.\n\n437\n00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:09.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, goodness.\n\n438\n00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.550\nOkay, and again not that one,\nwe want to get the .ppkg.\n\n439\n00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.740\nSuper important,\notherwise it's not going to work.\n\n440\n00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.340\nSo, we'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n441\n00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:21.560\nNow, we should see a notification\nhere in one second, and\n\n442\n00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.010\nthis is exactly what I wanted to see.\n\n443\n00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:28.540\nSo, we're getting notified, hey,\nis this package from a source you trust?\n\n444\n00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.600\nI have to make this decision here.\n\n445\n00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.600\nI didn't sign this particular package,\nso it's kind of hesitant here.\n\n446\n00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.500\nBut also, let me try to zoom in.\n\n447\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.690\nLook at what I've been given.\n\n448\n00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:46.350\nI've been given information as to what to\nexpect during this package application.\n\n449\n00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:49.560\nSo it's telling me, number one, hey,\nthis device is going to reboot.\n\n450\n00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.250\nAnd we're gonna be changing\nsome device customizations,\n\n451\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.440\nchanges to the device name, policies.\n\n452\n00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.260\nSo, depending on how that packet was\nconfigured, this list may be longer or\n\n453\n00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.520\nshorter, and it's just tailored to that.\n\n454\n00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.180\nAll right, so we gonna go ahead and\nhit yes, add it.\n\n455\n00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.250\nNow, this is the part that I\nsaid can take quite some time.\n\n456\n00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:14.097\nSo what we'll go ahead and\ndo is we'll go ahead and,\n\n457\n00:25:14.097 --> 00:25:16.830\nI just want to make sure\nit's kickstarting here.\n\n458\n00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.830\nWe'll do a TV time out, but\nI just wanna tell you what to expect,\n\n459\n00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:27.540\nbecause it will take little while,\ndepending on your time.\n\n460\n00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.900\nMaybe for me, for this particular package,\nit took about 30 minutes to go ahead and\n\n461\n00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.248\nscrub that, so it took a while.\n\n462\n00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:40.830\nWhen the system comes back online and\nit reboots, you won't see all of your\n\n463\n00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:46.100\nchanges, at least I didn't see all of my\nchanges in effect that very first reboot.\n\n464\n00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:51.560\nI only had my original user,\nFred, and I had to actually\n\n465\n00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.650\nperform one more reboot for Pebbles and\nBarney to get brought into this system.\n\n466\n00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.980\nSo I just want to give you that heads-up\nin case you do encounter that as well.\n\n467\n00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.690\nBut, like I said, this is going to\ntake a while, so let's go ahead and\n\n468\n00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.840\ndo a TV time-out, and\nwe'll see how it goes.\n\n469\n00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.200\nSo we're back from our TV timeout,\neverything went great.\n\n470\n00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.830\nWell, so far,\nwe still need to check that out.\n\n471\n00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:17.570\n[LAUGH] But I say that because things\naren't the way they were before.\n\n472\n00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.430\nI can see something's happened,\nsomething's changed.\n\n473\n00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.930\nDown here,\nI have some additional user icons.\n\n474\n00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.410\nI have Barney and Pebbles added there.\n\n475\n00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:29.295\nLet's go ahead and log in, and\nalso, note Fred still exists.\n\n476\n00:26:29.295 --> 00:26:31.170\nSo, we didn't delete or wipe him out.\n\n477\n00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:34.050\nThat was the original\nuser that had logged on.\n\n478\n00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.100\nSo, it's a good sign.\n\n479\n00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.630\n&gt;&gt; It is, Fred is happy so far.\n\n480\n00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:41.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I will point something out.\n\n481\n00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:45.710\nSo, when you're using this\nparticular configuration service\n\n482\n00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:49.790\nprovider setting here,\nyou'll need to think about this.\n\n483\n00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.770\nSee how it's taking me a little minute\nhere to go ahead and get Fred logged in,\n\n484\n00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:57.270\nbecause it's almost like it's\nthe first time he's logging in.\n\n485\n00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.760\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n486\n00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:03.150\n&gt;&gt; It might just take a little bit\nlonger than normal, but, ultimately,\n\n487\n00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.310\nwhat we want to check\nhere are a few things.\n\n488\n00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:12.717\nSo the main thing that we wanted to get\nrid of were those unapproved applications,\n\n489\n00:27:12.717 --> 00:27:13.325\nright?\n\n490\n00:27:13.325 --> 00:27:14.393\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So real quick,\n\n491\n00:27:14.393 --> 00:27:17.430\nwe'll go to the start menu here,\njust to check,\n\n492\n00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:22.336\nat a first glance, and you know,\nI don't see those crazy, what'd you have?\n\n493\n00:27:22.336 --> 00:27:26.042\n&gt;&gt; I thought it looked like there were\na couple of cartoony-looking apps and\n\n494\n00:27:26.042 --> 00:27:27.070\nthings over there.\n\n495\n00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a chef game, I think a slot\nmachine game that we had going on, so\n\n496\n00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:30.940\nthose aren't there.\n\n497\n00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:35.478\nSo yeah, Mike, you can't do that anymore,\nthat's all right, that's what we wanted.\n\n498\n00:27:35.478 --> 00:27:38.047\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And what\n\n499\n00:27:38.047 --> 00:27:39.470\n&gt;&gt; If I remove the apps what about my\n\n500\n00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.540\ndocuments, that it didn't take those away?\n\n501\n00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.508\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I kind of jumped the gun here\nwith the demo and I didn't show you guys\n\n502\n00:27:45.508 --> 00:27:50.150\nexactly what, I just had created a couple\nof different things on this computer.\n\n503\n00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:55.330\nNumber one, my computer name was Bedrock,\ngoing with a theme here.\n\n504\n00:27:55.330 --> 00:28:00.700\nNumber two,\nI had created in my documents a file.\n\n505\n00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:05.300\n&gt;&gt; And I had a picture of my cat, that's-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually yeah, let's\n\n506\n00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.960\ntake a look at the picture, and we'll\nsee if the picture of the cat's there.\n\n507\n00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.420\nThe picture of the cat is still there, so\n\n508\n00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.420\nwe did see that pop up on\nthe start menu from that last one.\n\n509\n00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.570\nIt did exist, so this is the one.\n\n510\n00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:16.500\nSo at least, we didn't lose that.\n\n511\n00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.540\nI mean, what would you have\ndone without your cat photo?\n\n512\n00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.440\nBut let's hop on over to\nthe documents folder,\n\n513\n00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.170\nbecause there's something that I'd\nlike to share with you there as well.\n\n514\n00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:30.290\nSo, the system puts a couple little\n\n515\n00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:34.190\nresidual elements from\nthat previous state here.\n\n516\n00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:39.140\nAnd so one of these clues that the system\nhas been provisioned with a package here\n\n517\n00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.300\nis this folder.\n\n518\n00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.680\nThis is system generated,\nit's called Fresh Start, and\n\n519\n00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.820\nwhat this is it's gonna be\nan XML file of removed apps.\n\n520\n00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:53.700\nWhen we're talking about uppercase A,\nwhen you see that in the operating system,\n\n521\n00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.310\nMicrosoft refers to that as applications.\n\n522\n00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:00.850\nLowercase A as Windows store apps.\n\n523\n00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.170\nAnd I was kind of thrown off\nthe first time I looked at this,\n\n524\n00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.245\nbecause you know what Mike,\nI expected to see all those\n\n525\n00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:10.195\nWindows Store apps that you had\nthere in the removed apps section.\n\n526\n00:29:10.195 --> 00:29:11.530\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I was surprised.\n\n527\n00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:12.850\nLet's go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n528\n00:29:16.018 --> 00:29:22.123\nSo the apps that have actually been\nremoved are going to be just some,\n\n529\n00:29:22.123 --> 00:29:26.980\nreally like, you know,\nbehind the scenes type apps.\n\n530\n00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:32.270\nYou've got, the most notably, OneDrive,\nI think, would be like the most,\n\n531\n00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:36.060\nright down here, the most common that you\nguys would probably be familiar with.\n\n532\n00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.820\nI also use some VMware tools for\n\n533\n00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.790\nmy virtual machines that I did have\ninstalled just for this demo purpose.\n\n534\n00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:47.080\nAnd just a couple of others, and this\nisn't the only place that they note that,\n\n535\n00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.140\nlet me close out of here.\n\n536\n00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.020\nYou'll also notice, on the desktop,\n\n537\n00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:56.690\nthere was a URL link as well,\njust a different format.\n\n538\n00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.990\nA little more readable,\nuser friendly format here.\n\n539\n00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.829\nSo this is the exact same information\nthat we just saw in that XML link,\n\n540\n00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:06.960\nto give you a clue.\n\n541\n00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.070\nBut again, these are those applications.\n\n542\n00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.870\nIt doesn't list out.\n\n543\n00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:12.100\n&gt;&gt; Without my appx's.\n\n544\n00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.150\n&gt;&gt; Those, yeah,\nthat slot machine app and everything, so\n\n545\n00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.120\nyou might want to keep that in mind.\n\n546\n00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:22.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe we can use a PowerShell\ncommand like Get-AppxPackages to list or,\n\n547\n00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.720\nwhat is it, get provisioned AppX packages.\n\n548\n00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.050\nCan you list all your currently\nprovisioned packages?\n\n549\n00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.780\nMaybe you'll do that before\nyou run this process so\n\n550\n00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.130\nyou've got a list of everything\nyou're getting ready to move.\n\n551\n00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great idea.\n\n552\n00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.850\nThen you'll have your documentation there,\njust in case there was.\n\n553\n00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:41.600\nIt's always good to cover yourself in\nthose situations, maybe that user's like,\n\n554\n00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.520\nyou removed this super-important, be like,\nwell I don't know this is the list I have.\n\n555\n00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.770\nSo that you can just be upfront and\nhonest with all of that.\n\n556\n00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:50.923\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it might have been an app that\nFred paid for, and now it's gone so\n\n557\n00:30:50.923 --> 00:30:52.832\nwe want to make sure\nthat he gets that back.\n\n558\n00:30:52.832 --> 00:30:55.230\n&gt;&gt; Reimburse him or\nsomething, I don't know.\n\n559\n00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:58.402\n[LAUGH] I love how we just come up with\nthese weird random scenarios but hey,\n\n560\n00:30:58.402 --> 00:31:00.870\nyou've been there,\nyou know weird stuff happens, so.\n\n561\n00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.530\nAlright, we're going to go ahead and\nclose out of here.\n\n562\n00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:05.150\nWhat else do we want to look at.\n\n563\n00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.170\nLet's look at our\n&gt;&gt; Our computer name.\n\n564\n00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay let's do that.\n\n565\n00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.080\nWe will go ahead and\ntake a look at our computer name.\n\n566\n00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.240\nI know we needed to also\nlook at our users as well,\n\n567\n00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.450\nbecause we did see Barney and\nPebbles listed there, but\n\n568\n00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:24.960\nwe did not verify that they had\nthe proper groups assigned to them.\n\n569\n00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.750\nWell, we didn't assign a group to Barney,\nbut we will get there.\n\n570\n00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:31.790\nNow, this computer originally\nwas named Bedrock, and\n\n571\n00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:37.105\nit is now named NewName because I was so\noriginal and clever with that.\n\n572\n00:31:37.105 --> 00:31:41.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And this was that random\n\n573\n00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:46.400\nnumber that we requested to be\ngenerated with that random string.\n\n574\n00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:51.560\nAnd that would simply be just so\nwe weren't, like we were talking about\n\n575\n00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:56.378\nbefore, having naming conflicts\nwithin our environment there.\n\n576\n00:31:56.378 --> 00:32:00.788\nAlso, this workgroup,\nthis computer was part of\n\n577\n00:32:00.788 --> 00:32:04.990\na workgroup prior to\nthe package application.\n\n578\n00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:05.818\nBut remember,\n\n579\n00:32:05.818 --> 00:32:09.650\nwe did have the ability to even set\nspecific workgroups if we wanted to.\n\n580\n00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:14.440\nAll right, what else do we wanna take\na look at here in Control Panel?\n\n581\n00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.990\nThe users, yeah.\n\n582\n00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:18.550\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n583\n00:32:25.309 --> 00:32:29.457\n&gt;&gt; So we're expecting to see a couple\nmore users that we created during\n\n584\n00:32:29.457 --> 00:32:31.630\nthe provision package creation.\n\n585\n00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:32.300\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n\n586\n00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:38.130\nAnd remember we created local users but\nyou could also have Azure users as well.\n\n587\n00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:42.470\nWe had a couple options there to also tie\ninto our domain environments as well.\n\n588\n00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.890\nOkay, so we didn't specify Barney,\nso he doesn't have any group there.\n\n589\n00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:49.800\nBut Pebbles is, in fact, an Administrator.\n\n590\n00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.266\nSo everything, so far,\nseems to work the way we want it to.\n\n591\n00:32:53.266 --> 00:32:56.440\nI'm trying to think,\nis there anything else?\n\n592\n00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.560\nDid we look in the documents?\n\n593\n00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.110\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n594\n00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.510\nI think you showed us\nthe Fresh Start file, but\n\n595\n00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.430\nyou didn't talk about that other document.\n\n596\n00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:06.900\nWas there prior to the clean PC package.\n\n597\n00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I had to create again super\ncreative here with my naming.\n\n598\n00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.570\nMy user data I just called it UserData,\nright?\n\n599\n00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:18.800\nSo that would be simulating\nany kind of files here\n\n600\n00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.320\njust in that regular My Documents\nfolder that the user would have had.\n\n601\n00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.430\nSo that user data here,\nin fact, was retained and\n\n602\n00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:26.690\nthat's what we were really going for and\n\n603\n00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:30.110\nthat was one of the two options that\nwe did have available to us there.\n\n604\n00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.673\nOops, wrong way.\n\n605\n00:33:32.673 --> 00:33:37.150\nI'm trying to think if there was\nanything else, I don't think so.\n\n606\n00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.860\nWhat if something didn't go\naccording to plan, right?\n\n607\n00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:43.760\nThat could happen.\n\n608\n00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:49.400\nMicrosoft recommends to, for\nmobile devices, to go ahead and\n\n609\n00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:56.180\nuse your Field Medic tool to be able to\ncheck logs to see exactly what may have\n\n610\n00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:02.990\nfailed during that application, the\napplication of that provisioning package.\n\n611\n00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:07.440\nNow for your desktops they recommend\nusing Windows Performance Recorder or\n\n612\n00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.900\nyour Windows Performance Editor\nthere as well, to help troubleshoot.\n\n613\n00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:18.040\nI knew that this application, it would\ntake a while for me to apply this package.\n\n614\n00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.690\nI keep saying application, but\nI don't want to confuse you in that way.\n\n615\n00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:26.350\nBut the process of applying this\npackage would take a little while.\n\n616\n00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:31.347\nIf you ever got in a situation where\nthe process was taking longer than\n\n617\n00:34:31.347 --> 00:34:36.188\nyou had anticipated, Microsoft\nsays you can hit this Escape key.\n\n618\n00:34:36.188 --> 00:34:39.505\nYou might want to test that out,\nbut just give yourself time.\n\n619\n00:34:39.505 --> 00:34:42.587\nKnow that with this CleanPC CSP option,\nfor\n\n620\n00:34:42.587 --> 00:34:48.285\nme it took about 30 minutes, so\njust to give you a heads up, there.\n\n621\n00:34:48.285 --> 00:34:49.438\nYeah.\n\n622\n00:34:49.438 --> 00:34:53.514\nOne other thing I did forget to mention,\nfor those mobile devices,\n\n623\n00:34:53.514 --> 00:34:55.975\ntalking about that Field Medic.\n\n624\n00:34:55.975 --> 00:34:58.180\nThat's only available on mobile devices.\n\n625\n00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.120\nOne other thing that is available only on\n\n626\n00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.280\nmobile devices is strictly because\nit's tied to that hardware.\n\n627\n00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.055\nIf you had a mobile\ndevice that had a touch\n\n628\n00:35:08.055 --> 00:35:12.319\nbutton kind of like your home button on\nyour dare we say iPhone or something.\n\n629\n00:35:12.319 --> 00:35:13.634\n&gt;&gt; Those other phones.\n\n630\n00:35:13.634 --> 00:35:18.525\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH] but if you had a Windows\nhome button you could go ahead and\n\n631\n00:35:18.525 --> 00:35:23.152\ntap that five times to initiate\nthe process of applying a package there.\n\n632\n00:35:23.152 --> 00:35:26.712\nSo that's a cool, easy way that you could,\n\n633\n00:35:26.712 --> 00:35:31.909\nif you had a nonexistent IT staff or\nremote office or something,\n\n634\n00:35:31.909 --> 00:35:36.835\nand you had just maybe mailed\nthem the devices or something.\n\n635\n00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:39.798\nYou could kind of walk them through it\nin an easy way to get those devices\n\n636\n00:35:39.798 --> 00:35:41.090\nprovisioned.\n\n637\n00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:43.700\nBut I think that's about it, Mike.\n\n638\n00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.920\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell pretty in-depth look, Cherokee,\n\n639\n00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.390\nat working with provisioning packages.\n\n640\n00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:49.770\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n641\n00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.890\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n642\n00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:54.370\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n643\n00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:56.000\nAnd I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n644\n00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.914\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n645\n00:36:00.914 --> 00:36:03.863\n[MUSIC]\n\n646\n00:36:03.863 --> 00:36:06.610\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n4\n00:00:10.765 --> 00:00:14.920\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.930\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.050\nToday we are installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n7\n00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.880\nIn this episode, we're going to be taking\na look at configuring remote management.\n\n8\n00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.270\nHere to help us with that is\nnone other than Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.225\nWelcome Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thanks for having me Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:28.225 --> 00:00:30.230\nWe've got a lot to cover\nin the next few shows.\n\n11\n00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.350\nI know I'm not gonna be able\nto get this done in one show.\n\n12\n00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.010\nAnd even before the show, you and I was\ndiscovering new things along the way so\n\n13\n00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.830\nthere's a lot to share with everyone.\n&gt;&gt; There are a lot of options when it\n\n14\n00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.790\ncomes to remote management and it's\nsomething that we do in an IT department\n\n15\n00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.380\nevery day because we're\ntypically not near the devices\n\n16\n00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.480\nneed to manage.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n17\n00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.280\nI mean sometimes it's just\ngeographically possible or\n\n18\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.970\nyou have servers in the servers rooms, so\nbeing able to utilize technologies that\n\n19\n00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.390\nwill allow us to work right\nfrom our work stations and\n\n20\n00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.070\nhelp people along the way is what we'll\nbe looking at in the next set of shows.\n\n21\n00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.590\nLike I did say, there are a handful or so\n\n22\n00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.240\nof different tools that I want to tell\nyou about for this particular exam.\n\n23\n00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.770\nSo the one that we'll really be focusing\non in this show is Remote Desktop.\n\n24\n00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.190\nWe'll also take a look at remote assist,\n\n25\n00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.710\nquick assist, PowerShell,\nand even some MM-Cs.\n\n26\n00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.020\nBut for now, we can go head and\ntake a look at my screen, and\n\n27\n00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.070\njust kind of talk about things that\nare associated with Remote Desktop.\n\n28\n00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.360\nSo by default, let's go ahead actually,\nand I'm just gonna do a search here.\n\n29\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.128\nOops, I can't even talk.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n30\n00:01:45.128 --> 00:01:46.720\n&gt;&gt; So, all right.\n\n31\n00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.930\nNow this is just the way to connect to it.\n\n32\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.460\nSo that's what we don't want,\nfirst of all.\n\n33\n00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.770\nThere are a few different\nways where I can set or\n\n34\n00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.350\nallow people to connect\nto my computer first.\n\n35\n00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.010\nSo, let's just take a look at that,\nfirst, and\n\n36\n00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.130\nwe'll talk about the default behaviors.\n\n37\n00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.910\nSo, the first thing we\ncan take a look at is,\n\n38\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.950\nunder the newer interface here under our,\nno, wrong section.\n\n39\n00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.735\nNot update and security,\nit's under system,\n\n40\n00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:14.610\nthat's where you're gonna find that.\n\n41\n00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.960\nAnd it's going to be towards the bottom,\nso you'll need to scroll down.\n\n42\n00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.830\nAnd let me zoom in so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n43\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.620\nI love when this works half the time.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.910\n&gt;&gt; And not the other half.\n\n45\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.850\nAnyways, it just says remote desktop, and\n\n46\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.460\nthat's what I wanted you\nto make sure you saw.\n\n47\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.460\nIt's right at the very bottom.\n\n48\n00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.350\nSometimes when you open this window,\nit's not going to be at full scale.\n\n49\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.240\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n50\n00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.050\nIt's not lost.\n\n51\n00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.840\nAll right, so go ahead and\nclick on Remote Desktop.\n\n52\n00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.970\nNow currently Remote Desktop\nis enabled here.\n\n53\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.890\nSo I've allowed that.\n\n54\n00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.140\nTo go ahead then be enabled.\n\n55\n00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.090\nBy default, so\n\n56\n00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.930\nI'm turning it off right now,\nthis is what you would see by default.\n\n57\n00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.860\nSo it's not enabled by default, so\n\n58\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.698\nremote assist is enabled by\ndefault on Windows 10, so\n\n59\n00:03:03.698 --> 00:03:09.250\nclient-side operating systems, not server\noperating systems for remote assist.\n\n60\n00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.680\nHowever, Remote Desktop\nis going to be disabled.\n\n61\n00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.380\nRemote assist is a subset\nof Remote Desktop\n\n62\n00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.440\nthat we will spend time looking at.\n\n63\n00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.600\nIt's a little more of a chaperoned-type\nway to access someone's system.\n\n64\n00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.940\nBut this is what it would look\nlike if you hadn't came in and\n\n65\n00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.930\nmessed with anything just\nfrom your settings there.\n\n66\n00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.820\nIt's pretty basic looking\nat it from this screen.\n\n67\n00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.740\nBut there really is more to it than that.\n\n68\n00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.690\nSo if I were to go ahead and\n\n69\n00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.460\nenable it the only thing that I do\nhave the option to click on right now\n\n70\n00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.630\nwould be to go ahead and add users\nthat can remotely access this PC.\n\n71\n00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.390\nBecause I am allowing someone\nto come into my system and\n\n72\n00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.240\nI'm opening up a communication or a port\nfor them and allowing that to happen,\n\n73\n00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.680\nthey're just warning me here\nbecause I need to be aware of that.\n\n74\n00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.380\nIt could potentially be\na security vulnerability.\n\n75\n00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.520\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n76\n00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.840\nI'm not don't use Remote Desktop,\n\n77\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.340\nthat would be like me saying\ndon't use the Internet.\n\n78\n00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.530\nYou know there's risks, but\nhow does that outweigh?\n\n79\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.360\nNow sometimes you may be in\nan environment where your firewall is\n\n80\n00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.620\nblocking those ports that\nare associated with that.\n\n81\n00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.870\nYou may need to go ahead and manually\ntroubleshoot that, or turn them on.\n\n82\n00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.400\nAt least contact or make sure you're\nnot going against a group policy that's\n\n83\n00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.330\nenforcing those firewall settings.\n\n84\n00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.810\nBut for the most part, when you hit this\ntoggle switch, it'll go ahead and change\n\n85\n00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.390\nthose settings automatically for you.\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you create that exception on\n\n86\n00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.650\nport 3389, which is the default port for\n\n87\n00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.370\nRemote Desktop, unless you've chosen to\ndo a different port which you'll have to\n\n88\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.960\ngo manually create a rule to allow that.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, all right so\n\n89\n00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.890\nlet's take a look here again.\n\n90\n00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.990\nThese options here are grayed-out.\n\n91\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.240\nI just want they're referencing power\nsettings because Mike if I were trying to\n\n92\n00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.680\nremote into your computer, or if I were\ntrying to remote into your computer if it\n\n93\n00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.250\nwas powered off or sleeping, then\ngenerally speaking, I wouldn't be able to\n\n94\n00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.070\naccess that unless I was using wake-on-LAN\ntechnology or something like that.\n\n95\n00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.250\nBut for the most part,\nyou need to think about,\n\n96\n00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.340\nby default, that device needs to be on.\n\n97\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.900\nSo just keep that in mind also.\n\n98\n00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.590\nAll right, let's see.\n\n99\n00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.100\nWhat other cool things?\n\n100\n00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.670\nYou can drill down to advanced settings.\n\n101\n00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:34.320\nWe're gonna look at the older\ncontrol panel applet associated with\n\n102\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.060\nRemote Desktop settings as well, so you\ncan kind of compare and contrast the two.\n\n103\n00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.430\nI would know them both for the exam,\nbecause they both still currently exist,\n\n104\n00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.820\nso zoom in here a little bit so\nyou guys can see this.\n\n105\n00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.620\nAlthough this is a nonchalant setting\nit's actually pretty important because\n\n106\n00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.490\nwhat they're allowing here with\nthis box checked is the ability to\n\n107\n00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.620\nrequire computers to use\nNetwork Level Authentication to connect,\n\n108\n00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.210\nwhich is recommended.\n\n109\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.900\nSo to kind of maintain some of that\nsecurity that we were speaking of,\n\n110\n00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.540\nthen I would recommend to go ahead and\nleave this checked as well.\n\n111\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.200\nThey give little hyperlinks\nto go ahead and explain and\n\n112\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.320\nsupport that argument as well.\n\n113\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.480\nAnd then here is that port number\nthat Mike was referencing there,\n\n114\n00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.148\nto help troubleshooting with any kind\nof firewall issues you may have.\n\n115\n00:06:27.148 --> 00:06:33.880\nAll right, I think that's some\npretty basic settings here.\n\n116\n00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.690\nWe do have this enabled.\n\n117\n00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.550\nLet me just kind of make this a little\nbit smaller or keep it to the side.\n\n118\n00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.870\nWe'll take a look at our\ncontrol panel settings.\n\n119\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.343\nAnd again that's gonna be under system but\nhere they call it System and Security,\n\n120\n00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:51.700\nthey don't break it out like that.\n\n121\n00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.090\nAnd under the System category,\nlet me zoom in slightly,\n\n122\n00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.640\nyou guys can see next to the UAC shield\nthat we have allow remote access.\n\n123\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.810\nSo that's gonna take us to\nthe same settings page,\n\n124\n00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.508\nnot the same design but\nthe same concept, if you will.\n\n125\n00:07:08.508 --> 00:07:11.940\nAll right, it is a little bit smaller so\nI'll need to zoom in for that.\n\n126\n00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.330\nSo, let me see here,\n\n127\n00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.750\nthis is not, this is just referencing\nthe allow remote assist right here.\n\n128\n00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.960\nWe'll get to that a little bit later.\n\n129\n00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.550\nNow, I do have the ability to go ahead and\nturn this off.\n\n130\n00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.550\nRemember I said by default, these are the\nkind of things I would be aware of for\n\n131\n00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.840\nthe exam, those default settings,\nif you know what I mean.\n\n132\n00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.500\nSo this is enabled by default.\n\n133\n00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.040\nOn server-side default,\nit's just grayed out.\n\n134\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.248\nYou couldn't even check that\nbox if you wanted to, and\n\n135\n00:07:42.248 --> 00:07:45.320\nthat's the default behavior of\nserver-side OSs, just keep that in mind.\n\n136\n00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.208\nNow, looking for\nyour Remote Desktop options here, so\n\n137\n00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:54.940\ncurrently we've already set\nthat on the other side.\n\n138\n00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.510\nAllow remote connections to this computer.\n\n139\n00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.160\nThat's the radio button\nthat's enabled here.\n\n140\n00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.613\nNow, if I were to go ahead and change\nthat, we could zoom out in a second,\n\n141\n00:08:03.613 --> 00:08:08.390\nbut while I'm zoomed in, I want to note\nsomething in gray portion down here.\n\n142\n00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.330\nWe'll compare the two in a moment,\nbut look at this.\n\n143\n00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.353\nThis is that exact same, as a matter\nof fact, let me make it in black.\n\n144\n00:08:17.412 --> 00:08:20.340\nOkay, this is also a good\nthing to point out.\n\n145\n00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.318\nAgain, reminding you of those sleep or\nhibernate options.\n\n146\n00:08:23.318 --> 00:08:26.100\nYou might wanna go in and modify those\n\n147\n00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.882\nif you relied on remoting into\nthis machine like a server.\n\n148\n00:08:30.882 --> 00:08:36.520\nSo hopefully you're already setting your\nservers to not be going in to sleep mode.\n\n149\n00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.170\nThat's generally the gist of it.\n\n150\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.710\nBut I wanted you to see this.\n\n151\n00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.340\nAllow connections only from computers\nrunning Remote Desktop with\n\n152\n00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.180\nNetwork Level Authentication.\n\n153\n00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.626\nSo just be aware that you\nhave similar settings-\n\n154\n00:08:50.626 --> 00:08:51.690\n&gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter which way I go.\n\n155\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.950\nIf I go through the newer UI or\nthrough this,\n\n156\n00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.565\nI'm still just enabling Remote Desktop.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so like if I change it,\n\n157\n00:08:58.565 --> 00:09:02.056\nyou should be able to see\nthis toggle like don't allow.\n\n158\n00:09:02.056 --> 00:09:02.639\n&gt;&gt; Apply it?\n\n159\n00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:03.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's see and\n\n160\n00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.288\nthen over on the right hand side, yes.\n\n161\n00:09:05.288 --> 00:09:06.840\nSee how it changes there.\n\n162\n00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.648\nSo just kind of keep that in mind.\n\n163\n00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:12.320\nThey control the same thing, but yeah.\n\n164\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.070\nSo that's for listening on port 3389.\n\n165\n00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:20.661\nSo think about that bidirectional\ncommunication that happening when we're\n\n166\n00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:21.230\nremoting.\n\n167\n00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.420\nWe can be the one remoting in or\nthe one receiving.\n\n168\n00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.090\nSo think about it that way.\n\n169\n00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.550\nSo here I'm blocking those\nincoming connections.\n\n170\n00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:37.384\nBut what if we wanna go ahead and\nwe want to connect to a system?\n\n171\n00:09:37.384 --> 00:09:42.000\nSo the quickest way that I like to\nuse to go ahead and launch that up,\n\n172\n00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.490\nyou could do a search for\nremote desktop RDP there.\n\n173\n00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.310\nOr you could go ahead and use your\nWindows Run, and let me zoom in so\n\n174\n00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.984\nyou guys can see this.\n\n175\n00:09:51.984 --> 00:09:58.190\nIt's mstsc, so Microsoft Services\nTerminal Services Client.\n\n176\n00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.050\nThat's gonna be some older\nterminology from back in\n\n177\n00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.050\nthose terminal services days, Mike.\n\n178\n00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:04.990\nYou'll hit OK.\n\n179\n00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.680\nWe'll zoom out.\n\n180\n00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.980\nThis is the window that will\nenable you to go ahead and\n\n181\n00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.000\nestablish a connection\nwith a remote system.\n\n182\n00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.466\nSo, here, I have an option\nto put in a computer name.\n\n183\n00:10:22.466 --> 00:10:26.496\nI could also go ahead and\nput in an IP address if I wanted to.\n\n184\n00:10:26.496 --> 00:10:30.464\nSo for\nnow I'm currently logged into client02, so\n\n185\n00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:35.130\nif I wanted to go ahead and\nconnect to client01.\n\n186\n00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.360\nAs a matter of fact,\nlet me verify to make sure that it\n\n187\n00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.860\nis, in fact-\n\n188\n00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.835\n&gt;&gt; Awake?\n&gt;&gt; Awake.\n\n189\n00:10:39.835 --> 00:10:40.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n190\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.690\n&gt;&gt; So, it is, because remember,\n\n191\n00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.600\nwe just said we wouldn't be able\nto connect to it if it wasn't.\n\n192\n00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.820\nSo we should be good to go there.\n\n193\n00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:52.660\nNow, you can also connect\nvia IP address if\n\n194\n00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.650\nyou wanted to or if you suspect\nyou're having DNS issues or whatever.\n\n195\n00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.359\nJust giving you that option there.\n\n196\n00:11:02.359 --> 00:11:07.204\nLet me go out to Show Options because\nthere are some extra options that we\n\n197\n00:11:07.204 --> 00:11:09.660\nhave available to us.\n\n198\n00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.910\nYou could go ahead and\nlog on as a specific individual.\n\n199\n00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.800\nYou also have the ability to\nallow me to save credentials.\n\n200\n00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.260\nI don't recommend using this in\na production environment, and\n\n201\n00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.760\nI'm pretty sure Mike does-\n&gt;&gt; I hate that.\n\n202\n00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.582\nI wish they'd take it away.\n\n203\n00:11:23.582 --> 00:11:27.319\n[LAUGH] But, I didn't design it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, we're gonna get to\n\n204\n00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:31.480\nthis bottom box after we kind of just\nrun through all these tabs here.\n\n205\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.840\nDisplay, so what they're referencing for\n\n206\n00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.802\nthis particular setting is going to be\nchoosing the size of your remote desktop.\n\n207\n00:11:38.802 --> 00:11:44.680\nSo, when we actually connect,\nwe'll have a window.\n\n208\n00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.675\nWe're in Windows, right?\n\n209\n00:11:45.675 --> 00:11:46.625\nThey love windows.\n\n210\n00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:51.276\nSo we're gonna have a window of\nthe other machine so it's kind of like,\n\n211\n00:11:51.276 --> 00:11:53.146\nthere's this German word.\n\n212\n00:11:53.146 --> 00:11:57.263\nIt's called like a [FOREIGN] because in\nFlorida we have all these sink holes,\n\n213\n00:11:57.263 --> 00:11:58.970\nwhich just means like a divot.\n\n214\n00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.220\nWe're peering into something.\n\n215\n00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:05.680\nSo ti's kind of like a [FOREIGN] into\nthe other operating system, if you will.\n\n216\n00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.745\nYeah, I don't know how.\n\n217\n00:12:06.745 --> 00:12:09.714\n[LAUGH] Anyways-\n&gt;&gt; Random language tips from Cherokee,\n\n218\n00:12:09.714 --> 00:12:11.490\nI like it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n219\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.198\n&gt;&gt; But it can be confusing sometimes,\n\n220\n00:12:13.198 --> 00:12:17.480\nso it's being able to go full screen with\nthat where it hides everything else.\n\n221\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.640\nTake advantage of all the real\nestate you have on your machine.\n\n222\n00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.492\n&gt;&gt; Right, especially if you have a couple\n\n223\n00:12:21.492 --> 00:12:25.264\ndifferent things, managements,\noptions going on, you're multitasking.\n\n224\n00:12:25.264 --> 00:12:25.989\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n225\n00:12:25.989 --> 00:12:30.782\nnothing to say like let's say you\ndrop that slider down to 1280 by 720.\n\n226\n00:12:30.782 --> 00:12:34.543\nThat doesn't mean once you make\nthe connection you can't go full screen or\n\n227\n00:12:34.543 --> 00:12:35.325\nvice-versa.\n\n228\n00:12:35.325 --> 00:12:38.822\nIt's just how does it start, basically.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n229\n00:12:38.822 --> 00:12:43.456\nyou also have the ability to go ahead and\nuse all monitors for the remote session.\n\n230\n00:12:43.456 --> 00:12:45.100\nThat's kind of an interesting one.\n\n231\n00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.340\nYou might have issues, but\nwe'll get there eventually.\n\n232\n00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.890\nThey are making advancements to that.\n\n233\n00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.874\nSo for instance, when Mike and\nI were testing before the show for\n\n234\n00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:57.094\nan upcoming show,\nhe is using three monitors.\n\n235\n00:12:57.094 --> 00:13:00.560\nBut all the text was super tiny,\nso I mean-\n\n236\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.140\n&gt;&gt; I find this beneficial, not so\n\n237\n00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.060\nmuch when the machine you're\nrouting into has multiple monitors,\n\n238\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.260\nbecause they're all gonna be\ndisplayed on one window on my screen.\n\n239\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.890\nBut if I'm sitting at a machine\nthat has multiple monitors, and\n\n240\n00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:16.870\nI'm remoting into a server or\nan end-user's PC to try to hepp them,\n\n241\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.910\nit's nice to be able to take advantage\nof all three of my monitors and\n\n242\n00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.470\nspread their desktop out and\nthings like that.\n\n243\n00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.620\nSo it's great when you have multiple\nmonitors, not so much when the target has\n\n244\n00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.040\nmultiple monitors.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but\n\n245\n00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:33.910\nthey have changed that in a newer app that\nwe'll take a look at a little bit later.\n\n246\n00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.809\nColors, I wouldn't lose sleep over\nthis setting right here because\n\n247\n00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.640\nmost of the time processors\nnow are able to.\n\n248\n00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.780\nI mean, I don't know how much performance\nyou'd get by dropping down to 15 bits\n\n249\n00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.450\nin color.\n\n250\n00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.580\nBut that is an option if you're\nseriously lagging there.\n\n251\n00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.080\n&gt;&gt; Back when we had 10 megabit per second\n\n252\n00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.681\nnetworks, this made a difference, right?\n&gt;&gt; True, yeah.\n\n253\n00:13:55.681 --> 00:13:56.853\n&gt;&gt; But nowadays, yeah,\n\n254\n00:13:56.853 --> 00:13:59.144\nit's not gonna make that much difference.\n\n255\n00:13:59.144 --> 00:14:02.460\nSure, but you might find yourself in need.\n&gt;&gt; This is true.\n\n256\n00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.730\nAll right, options,\nthat's what it's all about.\n\n257\n00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.830\nWe also have the ability here\nto display the connection bar,\n\n258\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:08.970\nwhen I use the full screen.\n\n259\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.880\nSo we're talking about a horizontal\n\n260\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.180\nUI element that will remind us that we\nare in a remote desktop connection,\n\n261\n00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.710\nnot working on maybe our local machine or\nsomething like that.\n\n262\n00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.255\nAll right, so that's the display tab.\n\n263\n00:14:23.255 --> 00:14:27.440\nLocal Resources, this is another cool one\nbecause you kinda have to think about\n\n264\n00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.200\nhow the system behaves right?\n\n265\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:37.797\nSo, audio, how is that gonna be handled?\n\n266\n00:14:37.797 --> 00:14:42.640\nMaybe I was troubleshooting audio, how\nwould I want the system to handle that?\n\n267\n00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.540\nDo I want it to play on this computer,\n\n268\n00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.200\nnot to play at all, or\nplay on the remote computer?\n\n269\n00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.240\nIn that particular situation,\nI'd want it to play on my computer so\n\n270\n00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:57.310\nI could see if the setting changes that I\nwere making were actually working, right?\n\n271\n00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:03.037\nSo just different situations, same thing\nwith recording for that audio as well.\n\n272\n00:15:03.037 --> 00:15:04.755\nAnd that's what we'll kinda look at here.\n\n273\n00:15:04.755 --> 00:15:08.197\nKeyboard will offer me\na couple of options here.\n\n274\n00:15:08.197 --> 00:15:13.761\nSo I can go ahead and use the keyboard on\nthis computer, on the remote computer,\n\n275\n00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:18.590\nand I really like this option here,\nOnly when using the full screen.\n\n276\n00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.650\nThat's just like a preference thing,\nbut again,\n\n277\n00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:27.380\nthat goes back to the multitasking and\njust kind of bringing\n\n278\n00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.650\nthe system into full focus for whichever\none you're working on at the time.\n\n279\n00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.820\nShrink it back down when you're\nmoving around, if that makes sense.\n\n280\n00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:41.220\nOkay, Printers and Clipboard,\nthese are two big ones.\n\n281\n00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.205\nBut if you do click on More,\nthere are a couple other options as well,\n\n282\n00:15:45.205 --> 00:15:50.087\nsuch as Smart cards, Ports, Drives, Video\ncapture devices and some other plug and\n\n283\n00:15:50.087 --> 00:15:51.000\nplay devices.\n\n284\n00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.993\nSo, you know, that's kind of helpful as\nwell, because maybe you want to print\n\n285\n00:15:55.993 --> 00:16:00.614\nsomething to your local machine from\nthe system that you're working on or\n\n286\n00:16:00.614 --> 00:16:01.600\nvise-versa.\n\n287\n00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.820\nThen you have this option here.\n&gt;&gt; That is really cool.\n\n288\n00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.800\nAnd that's what all these local\nresources options are for.\n\n289\n00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.810\nIf I'm remoted into a server and I need\nto print out something from that server,\n\n290\n00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.920\nthe server might be connected to\na printer, but it's somewhere else, and\n\n291\n00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.890\nI can't get to that printer.\n\n292\n00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.140\nOr if an end user, all right, so\nbeing able to bring that stuff and\n\n293\n00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.300\nhave it appear as a local resource\nto where I'm remoting from\n\n294\n00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.305\nis very advantageous.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n295\n00:16:27.305 --> 00:16:28.191\nAdvantageous, Mike.\n\n296\n00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:29.131\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n297\n00:16:29.131 --> 00:16:30.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n298\n00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.575\n&gt;&gt; I'm not the only one\n\n299\n00:16:31.575 --> 00:16:34.010\nwith the vocab words today.\n&gt;&gt; I know it's English.\n\n300\n00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.535\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, experience.\n\n301\n00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:42.655\nThis is kind of piggybacking on what Mike\nsaid earlier about the slow connections,\n\n302\n00:16:42.655 --> 00:16:44.205\nbecause they still may exist.\n\n303\n00:16:44.205 --> 00:16:47.765\nSo if that's the case,\nthen this setting may be helpful to you,\n\n304\n00:16:47.765 --> 00:16:49.690\nsomething to take a look at.\n\n305\n00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.950\nYou can pick and\nchoose what you will allow,\n\n306\n00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:58.630\nlike what is a higher priority for you,\nbecause maybe some issues that you've been\n\n307\n00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:03.900\nhaving for this particular\nmachine are the way fonts appear,\n\n308\n00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.140\nwhich doesn't really seem like\nit would make a lot of sense.\n\n309\n00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.000\nBut for us it does, because if our\nfonts can't appear on the computer\n\n310\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.690\nthat you're seeing then that\ncan be an issue, right?\n\n311\n00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.780\nSo just little things like that.\n\n312\n00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:20.710\nIf you are aware of the fact that you\nare running on a slower connection, right?\n\n313\n00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.140\nWhat did you say there Mike?\n&gt;&gt; Ten megabits.\n\n314\n00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.630\n&gt;&gt; Ten, yeah, so by default they're gonna\n\n315\n00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.254\ngo ahead and go into this stuff.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] gives me everything.\n\n316\n00:17:29.254 --> 00:17:30.637\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but If you're working with\n\n317\n00:17:30.637 --> 00:17:33.650\nsomething a little bit slower, then\nyou could go ahead and drop this down.\n\n318\n00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.410\nHopefully, you're not working with 56k but\nyou'll never know.\n\n319\n00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:43.090\nSo, you're not gonna be throttled,\nyour connectivity speeds are not gonna be\n\n320\n00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:49.290\nthrottled, but what will happen is they'll\njust recognize that certain features\n\n321\n00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.530\nare more important than others in kind of\nchoosing what to send and not to send.\n\n322\n00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.490\nDoes that make sense?\n\n323\n00:17:54.490 --> 00:18:00.560\nAll right, the last couple options here\nwe have persistent bitmap caching.\n\n324\n00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.900\nI think it's a good idea to go ahead and\n\n325\n00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.620\nuse that because you're not gonna\nbe retransmitting across the wire.\n\n326\n00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.479\nYou can go ahead and cache information\nas long as you have enough memory to\n\n327\n00:18:09.479 --> 00:18:12.071\nafford that,\nwhich shouldn't be a lot here, so\n\n328\n00:18:12.071 --> 00:18:15.191\nI really would suggest going ahead and\nusing that option.\n\n329\n00:18:15.191 --> 00:18:19.211\nAnd as well as connecting if\nthe connection drops because you're gonna\n\n330\n00:18:19.211 --> 00:18:22.226\nwanna try to go ahead and\ncomplete your ticket there so\n\n331\n00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:24.496\nyou can close that ticket out, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n332\n00:18:24.496 --> 00:18:26.557\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so just a couple options, again,\n\n333\n00:18:26.557 --> 00:18:30.262\nmaybe there's some reason why you don't,\nbut at least now you know.\n\n334\n00:18:30.262 --> 00:18:34.750\nAll right, let's see here what we've\ngot over on the advanced side.\n\n335\n00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:39.620\nSo, when we go to connect to a server,\nyou know, and\n\n336\n00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.050\nI have the server I didn't check to\nsee if that guy was still awake.\n\n337\n00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.790\nBut maybe we can connect to a server\nto show you what that would look like,\n\n338\n00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.800\nbecause when we connect to\na server let's think about,\n\n339\n00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.130\nsometimes we connect to a server to get\ninformation, and work resources right?\n\n340\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.240\nSo how would I know that the information\nI was receiving was legitimate and\n\n341\n00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.175\nnot fraudulent?\n\n342\n00:18:58.175 --> 00:18:59.840\nThat's mutual authentication.\n\n343\n00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.716\nSo as the person connecting,\nI need to authenticate to the server,\n\n344\n00:19:03.716 --> 00:19:06.781\nhowever the server also\nneeds to authenticate to me.\n\n345\n00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:11.228\nSo if for whatever reason,\nI hadn't set up certificate,\n\n346\n00:19:11.228 --> 00:19:16.217\nI don't have a certificate,\nI don't have any kind of PKI set up or\n\n347\n00:19:16.217 --> 00:19:21.120\nanything like that,\nthen I will receive a warning by default.\n\n348\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.200\nThis is the default setting, to warn me.\n\n349\n00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.010\nThen the operating system will give\nyou the option to continue to connect.\n\n350\n00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.770\nBut at least you're getting\na bit of a heads up.\n\n351\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.770\nIf you don't want that heads up,\nyou can go ahead and say that, connect and\n\n352\n00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:33.920\ndon't warn me.\n\n353\n00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.770\nOr you might even take a look at\nthis setting and consider it for\n\n354\n00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:40.110\na highly secure environment so\nthat you're not connected.\n\n355\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.610\nSo you're like look, I spent a lot of\ntime working on these certificates,\n\n356\n00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.060\nthey better use those things, right?\n\n357\n00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:48.780\nSo, all right, if we look at our\nsettings to connect from anywhere,\n\n358\n00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.400\nwhich brings up a good point here.\n\n359\n00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.280\nIf you want more advanced connections\nthere, we're not gonna go into detail here\n\n360\n00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.720\nbecause you will need to set up\na remote desktop gateway server.\n\n361\n00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.430\nSo that will something that will\nbe handled in the server class or\n\n362\n00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.050\nserver exam there.\n\n363\n00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:10.034\nBut I think in a nutshell\nthat's gonna be your options,\n\n364\n00:20:10.034 --> 00:20:14.330\nalso if you go back to this general tab.\n\n365\n00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:15.210\nYou have the option.\n\n366\n00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.260\nLet's say we go through and\nset this up to pristine condition.\n\n367\n00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.540\nI'm going to connect\njust the way I like it.\n\n368\n00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:24.770\nAnd I connect and\nthen tomorrow I get the same ticket or\n\n369\n00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.230\na similar ticket where I have\nto log back into that device.\n\n370\n00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:33.500\nIf it's a device I'm frequently remoting\ninto then maybe I want to go ahead and\n\n371\n00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.760\nsave this remote desktop connection.\n\n372\n00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.960\nSo I could go ahead and\nhit this option to save it.\n\n373\n00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.780\nBy default,\nit's gonna pop it into My Documents.\n\n374\n00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.250\nThe name there is just default,\nso if you wanted to go ahead and\n\n375\n00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.790\nput it on your desktop or something, you'd\nhave to go ahead and create a folder,\n\n376\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.430\nwhich might be, if it's your workstation\nor your technician computer,\n\n377\n00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:57.410\nthan maybe you have a list of different\ncomputers that you connect to.\n\n378\n00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.850\nJust options for you there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it can be very handy,\n\n379\n00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:03.780\nespecially if you want to bring drives\nwith you and printers when you connect to\n\n380\n00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.250\none machine but not when you\nconnect to different machines.\n\n381\n00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.070\nIt means you gotta go in there and\nchange those settings every time.\n\n382\n00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.170\nBy saving those RDP files,\nyou just double-click on it, and\n\n383\n00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.770\ngo.\n&gt;&gt; For sure, I'm just checking here, Mike,\n\n384\n00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:15.520\nwhile you're talking.\n\n385\n00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.020\nI'm taking advantage of our time,\n\n386\n00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.320\ntime management.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n387\n00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.470\n&gt;&gt; To see if-\n\n388\n00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.599\n&gt;&gt; The server is awake?\n\n389\n00:21:21.599 --> 00:21:22.328\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n390\n00:21:22.328 --> 00:21:27.283\nI'm gonna log in, just so I can maybe\nI don't know, pull something up.\n\n391\n00:21:27.283 --> 00:21:34.690\nMaybe, let's see, Notepad or something\nlike that, I don't know, PowerShell.\n\n392\n00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.827\nAnd we'll just do ipconfig so\n\n393\n00:21:36.827 --> 00:21:40.940\nyou guys can see what the desktop\nlooks like here, okay?\n\n394\n00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.113\nI know it's kinda small font,\nI'm just verifying that hey,\n\n395\n00:21:44.113 --> 00:21:46.200\nthere's something on the screen here.\n\n396\n00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.280\nThis is what our end user's\nworkstation looks like.\n\n397\n00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:54.260\nWell, here server, not end user,\nbut you know what I mean, okay?\n\n398\n00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.573\n10.1.0.2 is the IP address here,\n\n399\n00:21:56.573 --> 00:22:00.810\nthis is gonna be just a demo of a lab\nserver that I have set up here.\n\n400\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:06.870\nSo let's switch back to our client and\ninstead of connecting to client 01, let's\n\n401\n00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:12.330\ngo ahead and try to connect to a demo\nDC I think is the name of that server.\n\n402\n00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.300\nAnd here I have my local creds that\nI'm gonna go ahead and send with that,\n\n403\n00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.159\nwe'll hit Connect.\n\n404\n00:22:20.171 --> 00:22:26.980\nNow because of the security involved,\nlet's see here.\n\n405\n00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.361\nI'm gonna be patient, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n406\n00:22:30.361 --> 00:22:32.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm just, there, okay so\n\n407\n00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:34.019\nhere's the other thing.\n\n408\n00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:40.720\nThis technology does rely on networking,\nlike I've mentioned, so all of those\n\n409\n00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.630\npieces to the puzzle have to be correct\nbefore remote desktop will work.\n\n410\n00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:51.600\nSo, if you are having issues connecting,\ngo ahead and\n\n411\n00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.048\nremove the networking portion of that\nvariable and just test basic connectivity.\n\n412\n00:22:56.048 --> 00:23:01.371\nPing, really I guess that would be my\nnumber one go to [LAUGH] to test for\n\n413\n00:23:01.371 --> 00:23:02.900\nnetwork connectivity.\n&gt;&gt; If you're using your name instead of\n\n414\n00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:03.690\nan IP address,\n\n415\n00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.330\nmake sure name resolution is working.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n416\n00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.120\nname resolution and DNS.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n417\n00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.500\nyou have electrical\nconnectivity you can ping.\n\n418\n00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.810\nMake sure your firewall rules are open.\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n419\n00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.703\nMike's coming out with all of the [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; See, I've listened.\n\n420\n00:23:12.703 --> 00:23:13.280\nI've learned a lot.\n[LAUGH]\n\n421\n00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.770\n&gt;&gt; He might do this for a living or\n\n422\n00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:15.302\nsomething.\n\n423\n00:23:15.302 --> 00:23:15.826\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n424\n00:23:15.826 --> 00:23:17.157\nHave you done this before?\n&gt;&gt; Once or\n\n425\n00:23:17.157 --> 00:23:17.880\ntwice.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n426\n00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.569\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nput in my password.\n\n427\n00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.150\nBecause it does need to verify.\n\n428\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:26.620\nLike I said, I need to verify who I\nam connecting to this remote server.\n\n429\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:31.490\nNow, I did not give\na certificate to this server,\n\n430\n00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.330\nso leaving the setting in\nthat default configuration,\n\n431\n00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:38.590\nthe way we saw it,\nI should be given a warning.\n\n432\n00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.510\nJust to let me know that that server,\nin fact, doesn't have a certificate\n\n433\n00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:45.920\nto present for that mutual authentication.\n&gt;&gt; Now are you gonna be able to, okay,\n\n434\n00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.060\nthere we go, good.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Patience, see?\n\n435\n00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.499\nIt's a virtue.\n&gt;&gt; I know, I gave up too early.\n\n436\n00:23:50.499 --> 00:23:51.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, and\n\n437\n00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.350\nthat's all that this\nwarning is saying here.\n\n438\n00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.310\nIt's just saying, hey, this remote\ncomputer could not be authenticated due to\n\n439\n00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.890\nproblems with its security certificate.\n\n440\n00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.940\nThat's because it doesn't exist.\n\n441\n00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.926\nSo if you had an expired certificate or\n\n442\n00:24:01.926 --> 00:24:04.540\nmaybe even if That\ncertificate had been revoked.\n\n443\n00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:09.490\nI'm not sure about that one though,\nthey might just not even let you connect.\n\n444\n00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:13.250\nBut definitely investigate if you\nexpect that to be a valid and\n\n445\n00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.260\nintact certificate there.\n\n446\n00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:20.210\nSo, if I'm gonna continue\nto use a server without\n\n447\n00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:24.360\na certificate you could also do that,\nview the certificate here.\n\n448\n00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.600\nFor now I'm just gonna hit yes so\n\n449\n00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.312\nI can show you what that\nremote connection looks like.\n\n450\n00:24:28.312 --> 00:24:34.680\nAnd a little more patience and\nthen we'll eventually get there, but yep.\n\n451\n00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.287\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna say anything,\n\n452\n00:24:36.287 --> 00:24:37.820\nyou better be patient.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n453\n00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:44.350\nIt's pretty cool though when you\nthink about it because it does save,\n\n454\n00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:48.290\nsave money, saving a digital footprint we\ndon't hit the drive a car, fly a plane,\n\n455\n00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.781\nhow nice would that be?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\n\n456\n00:24:49.781 --> 00:24:52.933\nthis is a great remote management tool and\nthere is other ways that I know we're\n\n457\n00:24:52.933 --> 00:24:55.149\ngoing to talk about that you\ncan do remote management.\n\n458\n00:24:55.149 --> 00:24:59.386\nI might give somebody just access to\nDNS and give him a DNS console or\n\n459\n00:24:59.386 --> 00:25:00.832\nsomething like that.\n\n460\n00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:04.476\nBut there are times when you need access\nto the full desktop on that remote machine\n\n461\n00:25:04.476 --> 00:25:06.750\nand this is the way to go.\n&gt;&gt; Right and\n\n462\n00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:09.950\nthis is another thing that Microsoft is,\nyou'll see,\n\n463\n00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:15.830\nI'm just kind of talking now but I have\na feeling we're gonna be seeing different\n\n464\n00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:19.520\nmanagement techniques in the future so\njust keep an eye out for that also.\n\n465\n00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.330\nAll right, we've remoted into the server.\n\n466\n00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.900\nThis brings up a good point here Mike,\nso I don't see that\n\n467\n00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.980\nPowerShell window with that ipconfig\non it that we had done, right?\n\n468\n00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:35.860\nAnd that's because when I remote into\na server, I have the ability to have two\n\n469\n00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:41.840\nconcurrent login sessions there so\nthe other session still exists.\n\n470\n00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:46.160\nSo my local user is still logged\non over on the actual server here.\n\n471\n00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.910\nDid we close that window?\n\n472\n00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.720\nOkay, but anyways, I also closed,\nwait, this isn't the right machine.\n\n473\n00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.445\nHello, Cherokee.\n\n474\n00:25:53.445 --> 00:25:54.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here it is.\n\n475\n00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.420\nI was like,\nI didn't think I closed the window.\n\n476\n00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.930\nI wanted to leave it up for\nthis particular reason.\n\n477\n00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.750\nIt's up and it exists still.\n\n478\n00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.500\nThis is going to be our\nseparate session here.\n\n479\n00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.440\nYou can't have more than two sessions.\n\n480\n00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.520\nAnd if I were to just go ahead and\nclose out of the window associated\n\n481\n00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:17.400\nwith this remote desktop connection\nI'm not killing that session.\n\n482\n00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.870\nI am merely disconnecting from the window.\n\n483\n00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.350\nThe session still exists.\n\n484\n00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:30.250\nYou want to be respectful of that for\nadministration purposes.\n\n485\n00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.040\nSo especially if you\nhad multiple admins and\n\n486\n00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.860\nmaybe you were logged in at the same time,\n\n487\n00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:39.270\nor one was trying to login after you, and\nyou left some lingering sessions, and they\n\n488\n00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.950\ncouldn't get in, and blah, blah, blah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've had that scenario\n\n489\n00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.770\nhappen where your servers are locked up in\na server closet, and one of the companies\n\n490\n00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.860\nI worked with I didn't have access\nto the server closet directly.\n\n491\n00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.876\nI didn't have a key to get in the closet.\n\n492\n00:26:49.876 --> 00:26:53.780\nEarlier in the day two different admins\nhad both remoted into this particular\n\n493\n00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.081\nserver, done some work what have you and\nthen disconnected, but\n\n494\n00:26:57.081 --> 00:26:59.520\ndid not log off of their remote session.\n\n495\n00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.420\nSo later that evening when I roll in,\nI try to remote into that sever and\n\n496\n00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.060\nit's telling me that all the connections\nare used up, try again later.\n\n497\n00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.940\nAnd I had no way to remotely\naccess that machine,\n\n498\n00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.490\nno key to the closet to\nget into that machine.\n\n499\n00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:17.890\nSo I'm kinda stuck at this point because\nthey forgot to end their session.\n\n500\n00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:18.771\n&gt;&gt; Shame, shame.\n\n501\n00:27:18.771 --> 00:27:19.431\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n502\n00:27:19.431 --> 00:27:21.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, we won't do that.\n\n503\n00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.850\nYou guys make sure I don't do that for\nthis show.\n\n504\n00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:28.030\nBut if I wanted to minimize that, this\nis what we were talking about earlier.\n\n505\n00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.190\nThis is, in fact, just a window.\n\n506\n00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:34.980\nSo the blue default background that\nyou see behind me is in fact my\n\n507\n00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:40.230\nclient Windows 10 operating system,\nand I can move my window\n\n508\n00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:45.560\naround to manage that real estate here\nif I had multiple things going on.\n\n509\n00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:52.780\nClient side though, you will need to\nkeep in mind that that remote desktop\n\n510\n00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.830\nconnection will be bumping that end users,\nso you wanna give them a heads up.\n\n511\n00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:00.087\nSo they have time to save their work,\nagain,\n\n512\n00:28:00.087 --> 00:28:05.061\nthis is just the whole moral aspect\nof it in having good remote desktop\n\n513\n00:28:05.061 --> 00:28:09.182\nconnection etiquette here.\n&gt;&gt; So keep that in mind.\n\n514\n00:28:09.182 --> 00:28:12.810\nYeah, so basically just go ahead and\nsign out,\n\n515\n00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.350\nit's like you would be logging off here.\n\n516\n00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.890\nTo go ahead and log off.\n\n517\n00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.080\nNot my power, right click.\n\n518\n00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.000\nAll right, there we go, Cherokee.\n\n519\n00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.600\nAnd just make sure you sign out.\n\n520\n00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:30.490\nThat would release that session so\nthat there would free that up so\n\n521\n00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:34.600\nthat if other admins needed to go ahead\nand log in they have the ability to do so.\n\n522\n00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.310\nNow that's just one option.\n\n523\n00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.600\nRemember, that's like\nthe full GUI experience,\n\n524\n00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.230\nif I wanted to look at some other options\nthen you're gonna need to stay tuned for\n\n525\n00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.202\nanother episode cuz that's it.\n&gt;&gt; Well all right, sounds good Cherokee,\n\n526\n00:28:48.202 --> 00:28:52.300\ngreat demonstration Sara, remote desktop\ntaking a look at remote management.\n\n527\n00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.090\nSo we appreciate it.\n\n528\n00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.390\nHope everybody out there\nenjoy watching this one.\n\n529\n00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:58.060\nSigning off for ITproTV,\nI've been your host Mike

00:00:05.943\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.943 --> 00:00:09.277\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:09.277 --> 00:00:12.493\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.493 --> 00:00:15.408\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:15.408 --> 00:00:17.090\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.259\nToday we are installing and configuring\nWindows 10, preparing for the 7-698 exam.\n\n9\n00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.064\nIn this episode, we're taking\na look at configuring updates.\n\n10\n00:00:26.064 --> 00:00:29.320\nThis is a part two, so if you missed\nthe first part, make sure you go back and\n\n11\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.065\ncheck that out.\n\n12\n00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:33.324\nBut continuing along with us is none\nother than Miss Cherokee Boose,\n\n13\n00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:34.512\nwelcome back Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:37.757\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me Mike,\nwe had that cliffhanger, remember?\n\n15\n00:00:37.757 --> 00:00:38.733\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yes, yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.144\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We kind of ran out\nof time in the last show.\n\n17\n00:00:41.144 --> 00:00:43.755\nSo I think right now,\nwe'll just pick right back up,\n\n18\n00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:46.380\nbecause we had spoke about\na lot of different things.\n\n19\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.374\nAnd different ideas associated\naround our Windows updates, but\n\n20\n00:00:49.374 --> 00:00:53.680\nnow is the time to go ahead and look at\nthose settings, so, let's pick back up.\n\n21\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.340\nWe'll go ahead and\npull up our settings options here, and\n\n22\n00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.150\nwe're gonna go under our update and\nsecurity option there.\n\n23\n00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.480\nAnd we had a little sneak peak at\nthat ninja kiddy from the last show,\n\n24\n00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.420\nif you recall.\n\n25\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.940\nThey're talking about\nthat insider program, but\n\n26\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.620\nwhat else do we have available to us?\n\n27\n00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.040\nWell there are quite a few settings that\nare associated with our Windows updates\n\n28\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.500\nhere, so we'll go ahead and click on that.\n\n29\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.830\nSo if your system hadn't\nbeen checked recently,\n\n30\n00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.910\nthen you can go ahead and\ncheck for updates.\n\n31\n00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.640\nMy system is set here to\nautomatically check for\n\n32\n00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.150\nupdates so It says I'm good to go.\n\n33\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.548\nAnd we'll look at something\na little bit later,\n\n34\n00:01:33.548 --> 00:01:36.778\nthere's like a little troubleshooting\nwizard that you can run.\n\n35\n00:01:36.778 --> 00:01:40.628\nAnd I think there are some pending updates\nout there which is kind of funny, because\n\n36\n00:01:40.628 --> 00:01:44.268\nsometimes if you look at that, and I know\nthis has happened to you before Mike.\n\n37\n00:01:44.268 --> 00:01:50.316\nIt says Ttat your system is up to date,\nand then when you go ahead and\n\n38\n00:01:50.316 --> 00:01:54.426\nmanually launch that [CROSSTALK] so\nany ways.\n\n39\n00:01:54.426 --> 00:01:56.942\nLet's look at this first option,\n\n40\n00:01:56.942 --> 00:02:01.726\nwhere it say change active hours,\nso this is pretty cool, Mike.\n\n41\n00:02:01.726 --> 00:02:08.489\nIf you are one of those people who get\ngood mojo, or flow, when you're working.\n\n42\n00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.441\nYou're on a flow, and\n\n43\n00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:12.790\nthen all the sudden the computer has\nto restart because of an update.\n\n44\n00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's so fun.\n\n45\n00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.150\n&gt;&gt; It's not, it's not fun.\n\n46\n00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.962\nSo what you can do with this setting,\n\n47\n00:02:17.962 --> 00:02:23.445\nis actually decide when might be\nan optimal mojo time or whatever, so.\n\n48\n00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:26.717\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here they just have a basic work hour\n\n49\n00:02:26.717 --> 00:02:29.818\nstarting at 8:00 AM and ending at Five PM.\n\n50\n00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:34.195\nAnd then you can see that there's\na maximum of at least 18 hours,\n\n51\n00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:38.512\nto go ahead and offset any restarts\nassociated with that update.\n\n52\n00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:43.534\nIf you were working night shift or\nif you were, this were your home PC and\n\n53\n00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:48.332\nyou wanted to go ahead\n&gt;&gt; And tailor this to maybe when you're at\n\n54\n00:02:48.332 --> 00:02:53.713\nhome and like to watch Netflix,\nor ITPRO.TV, on your laptop.\n\n55\n00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:56.120\nYou might wanna go ahead and\nchance those hours to reflect that.\n\n56\n00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.870\nWe're gonna keep them at eight to five,\nbecause-\n\n57\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.930\n&gt;&gt; It's nice to give you that option,\n\n58\n00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.580\nbecause you might work a second shift,\nor like you said,\n\n59\n00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.070\nI like to do some work at home.\n\n60\n00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.243\nAs soon as I get home,\n\n61\n00:03:06.243 --> 00:03:09.385\nsaid I want a couple of extra\nhours there with no updates.\n\n62\n00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:11.937\n[LAUGH] That's wishful, thinking Mike.\n\n63\n00:03:11.937 --> 00:03:16.733\n[LAUGH] All right, I'm joking, I'm joking.\n\n64\n00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:21.210\nRemember, we don't want to keep\npushing these updates off or\n\n65\n00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.826\ndo any kind of silly hacks\nto prevent the updates,\n\n66\n00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:28.371\nbecause they are in fact useful and\npurposeful.\n\n67\n00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:32.462\nBecause Every time there's a,\nsomething that's patched,\n\n68\n00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:35.460\nthere's another vulnerability out there.\n\n69\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.818\nSo it's a continual cycle that we're on\nhere, and that's why we see them so often.\n\n70\n00:03:41.818 --> 00:03:45.720\nNow, we have a few options here.\n\n71\n00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.170\nFirst of all,\nlet's take a look at our update history,\n\n72\n00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.000\nif you recall the different terms\nthat we covered in the last show.\n\n73\n00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.812\nThe difference between feature updates,\nthose twice per year updates,\n\n74\n00:03:54.812 --> 00:03:59.670\nversus our quality updates which\ntypically we see on a per month basis.\n\n75\n00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.501\nSometimes they might be\nmore frequent than that,\n\n76\n00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:07.976\nI can't promise anything,\nbut that's what we see here.\n\n77\n00:04:07.976 --> 00:04:11.879\nNow, in the past the interface\nwas a little bit different, and\n\n78\n00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.468\nwe'll take a look at that in a little bit.\n\n79\n00:04:14.468 --> 00:04:18.497\nBut you would be able to see each,\nlike it all would start with a KB for\n\n80\n00:04:18.497 --> 00:04:23.322\nthat knowledge base, pointing you back\nto documentation for specific update.\n\n81\n00:04:23.322 --> 00:04:26.553\nAnd you could really on a granular level,\nchoose and\n\n82\n00:04:26.553 --> 00:04:30.820\nremove updates that might be causing\ninstabilities in your system.\n\n83\n00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.283\nOr weren't compatible with a certain\napp that you're running, or whatever,\n\n84\n00:04:34.283 --> 00:04:35.895\nhere it's a little more difficult.\n\n85\n00:04:35.895 --> 00:04:40.384\nThinking back to what we were talking\nabout before, with that one diagram where\n\n86\n00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:43.625\nthey were comparing that,\nthe holy Windows 7 machine.\n\n87\n00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:44.300\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n88\n00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.260\n&gt;&gt; Versus\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n89\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.390\n&gt;&gt; The way that the cumulatives\nare placed now.\n\n90\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.520\nIt's a little more different, they don't\nreally want to have those unpatched,\n\n91\n00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.170\nor systems with those holes in them.\n\n92\n00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.030\nSo.\n&gt;&gt; Again, I'm really just making\n\n93\n00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.630\nsure we've got consistent\ninstall basis around.\n\n94\n00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.630\nSo that's much easier\nto create new updates.\n\n95\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.230\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n96\n00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.370\nThere are certain things that you can do,\n\n97\n00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.790\nthrough like group policy and such, like\nfor instance here with driver updates.\n\n98\n00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.230\nWe have some in videos, now Mike and\nI have this same computer actually,\n\n99\n00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.515\nand we have issues with our\ndisplays from time to time.\n\n100\n00:05:21.515 --> 00:05:22.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n101\n00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.800\nLet's just look it.\n\n102\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.340\nI only have invideo.\n\n103\n00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.970\n&gt;&gt; You do?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n104\n00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.402\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I see.\n\n105\n00:05:26.402 --> 00:05:29.218\nAnd so,\nsometime you might not want a particular,\n\n106\n00:05:29.218 --> 00:05:33.477\nmaybe you find a particular driver isn't\nworking well with your systems, or\n\n107\n00:05:33.477 --> 00:05:35.917\nmaybe you want to test those specifically.\n\n108\n00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:40.482\nMaybe there are some kind of plug and\nplay device that is part of your company,\n\n109\n00:05:40.482 --> 00:05:42.660\nvery essential to your company, and\n\n110\n00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.312\nyou don't want to have some random\ndriver just being installed haphazardly.\n\n111\n00:05:47.312 --> 00:05:49.233\nSo, without going through\nthat proper testing and\n\n112\n00:05:49.233 --> 00:05:51.480\nvetting process like we spoke about.\n\n113\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.230\nYou can go ahead and remove drivers\nfrom your quality updates there.\n\n114\n00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.130\nSo, just a few things,\nyou can look at them individually there.\n\n115\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.570\nAnd the idea is you should be\nable to uninstall them, so\n\n116\n00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.295\nif I found that there was an issue here,\nand I think this is really cool.\n\n117\n00:06:11.295 --> 00:06:16.330\n[LAUGH] I lied,\nthis one says information coming soon.\n\n118\n00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.462\nBut overall, and I'll try to click\non a few more of these links,\n\n119\n00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:23.364\nbecause if your system has Internet\nconnectivity and you click on those links.\n\n120\n00:06:23.364 --> 00:06:27.120\nThis one obviously wasn't very helpful,\nbut I found a lot of them are.\n\n121\n00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.020\nAnd even looking at, we'll get to that\nin a minute here, but looking at some of\n\n122\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.480\nthe links that they have, one of them\nwent, trailed back to a little video.\n\n123\n00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.400\nAnd I thought, cool, because then it just\nhighlighted some of the features that were\n\n124\n00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.050\ncoming, or that were part of that last\nfeature update that I downloaded.\n\n125\n00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.548\nWe'll probably get to that Right here,\nbut, yeah.\n\n126\n00:06:48.548 --> 00:06:51.708\nLooking at your definitions,\nremember, these are really important,\n\n127\n00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:54.348\nguys, especially when, you know,\nwe're looking here for\n\n128\n00:06:54.348 --> 00:06:56.909\nour update to our Windows Defender,\nfor that antivirus.\n\n129\n00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:59.966\nYou wanna make sure you always\nhave those updated, and\n\n130\n00:06:59.966 --> 00:07:04.420\nyou can see like failed to install and\nthere's like little notifications, but\n\n131\n00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.765\nthen it's gonna go ahead and retry that.\n\n132\n00:07:06.765 --> 00:07:10.187\nLooks like on the very same day as well,\n\n133\n00:07:10.187 --> 00:07:15.581\nAad you can see that KB number\nlike I was talking about before,\n\n134\n00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:20.581\nso those numbers looking at that,\nI clicked out too far.\n\n135\n00:07:20.581 --> 00:07:24.453\nThere was one more I wanted\nto show you at the bottom,\n\n136\n00:07:24.453 --> 00:07:29.205\nI remembered just scrubbing\nthrough those documents online and\n\n137\n00:07:29.205 --> 00:07:32.556\nsuch, trying to really research a problem.\n\n138\n00:07:32.556 --> 00:07:37.084\nAnd now I really do like, like I said\nthat one wasn't very helpful, but\n\n139\n00:07:37.084 --> 00:07:39.433\nthat was a third party driver there.\n\n140\n00:07:39.433 --> 00:07:43.309\nSo for their particular updates,\nwill have more information for you.\n\n141\n00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.484\nAnd then there's also, this one's\nnot too fancy here, just I did have\n\n142\n00:07:49.484 --> 00:07:54.345\na Windows Malicious Software Removal\nToolkit that was installed as well.\n\n143\n00:07:54.345 --> 00:07:58.937\nNow if I had, I haven't recently\n\n144\n00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:03.530\nhad a major feature update okay?\n\n145\n00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.980\nIf I had, within the last ten days,\n\n146\n00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:12.500\nhad a major feature update,\nthen I would be able to revert\n\n147\n00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.560\nback to before I had installed\nthat feature update.\n\n148\n00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.240\nNotice how I'm saying feature,\nnot quality, here.\n\n149\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.252\nWhenever I click on\nthis option right here,\n\n150\n00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:28.830\nuninstall updates,\nit will take me to a separate window.\n\n151\n00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.810\nAnd you can get here,\nthis is actually under your Control Panel.\n\n152\n00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.470\nAnd I was gonna show you that as well, but\nit takes you to this exact same place.\n\n153\n00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:40.040\nYou just go under the Control Panel,\nand then, as if you were\n\n154\n00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.120\nuninstalling a program, see how they put\nthem under the programs and features here?\n\n155\n00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.401\nThere's a little box.\n\n156\n00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:46.775\nAnd let me zoom in so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n157\n00:08:50.103 --> 00:08:51.180\nLet me close that out of here.\n\n158\n00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.638\nI got click happy with\nthe wrong zooming tool.\n\n159\n00:08:57.093 --> 00:09:00.320\nYou would go ahead and\njust check that, and then uninstall.\n\n160\n00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.500\nYou can also double-click on them to\ngo ahead and uninstall those as well.\n\n161\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.600\nBut these are the ones\nthat you can uninstall.\n\n162\n00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.500\nSo you just might wanna make sure and\ncheck, because I think they're probably\n\n163\n00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:17.420\ngonna try to push them onto the next time\nyou get like a quality update because of\n\n164\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:22.560\nthat cumulative methodology that we\nspoke about in the last show there.\n\n165\n00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.669\nAll right, I'm gonna close out of here.\n\n166\n00:09:27.669 --> 00:09:28.393\nRecovery options.\n\n167\n00:09:28.393 --> 00:09:32.390\nSo what happens if\nsomething's really messed up?\n\n168\n00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:38.210\nI mean, system crashes, I've got blue\nscreens, applications locking up.\n\n169\n00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.845\nWell, it's kind of interesting.\n\n170\n00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:42.120\nWe don't have that option\nto really pick and\n\n171\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.320\nchoose out all the little\npieces like we did before.\n\n172\n00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.207\nThey kind of want you to go back\nto either resetting this PC, and\n\n173\n00:09:48.207 --> 00:09:51.811\nif you recall we've spoke about this\nbefore in our troubleshooting episode.\n\n174\n00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:57.382\nThis is going to basically, well,\nreset the PC to those factory settings but\n\n175\n00:09:57.382 --> 00:10:01.853\nleave all of your data,\nthe end user's data, intact there.\n\n176\n00:10:01.853 --> 00:10:06.847\nThe only thing I will say about the,\nand this just reminded me,\n\n177\n00:10:06.847 --> 00:10:10.750\nbut for the other option about reverting.\n\n178\n00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.014\nIf you had feature update and it was\nwithin that 10 day period that you were\n\n179\n00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:19.480\ntesting it, and then you really didn't\nlike it then and you wanted to go back,\n\n180\n00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.000\nif within that 10 day period\nyou had changed your password,\n\n181\n00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.943\nyou would need to remember the old\npassword after you go back in time.\n\n182\n00:10:26.943 --> 00:10:30.611\nBecause it's essentially a checkpoint\nthat you're reverting to.\n\n183\n00:10:30.611 --> 00:10:31.453\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well that's good to know.\n\n184\n00:10:31.453 --> 00:10:32.160\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n185\n00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.991\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and let's see.\n\n186\n00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:38.910\nAnd what else we want to\nlook at here in our updates.\n\n187\n00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.370\nChanging our active hours.\n\n188\n00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.850\nWe looked at our update history.\n\n189\n00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.438\nLet's take a look at our advanced options\nbecause there are some really hidden,\n\n190\n00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:49.270\nthey're not really hidden, but\n\n191\n00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:53.630\nthere's just some little tentacles that\nwe could follow here, trails if you will.\n\n192\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.110\nSo there's information about other\nMicrosoft products whenever we update\n\n193\n00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.110\nWindows.\n\n194\n00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.650\nSo by default, they're gonna want\nyou to know about their products.\n\n195\n00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.450\nThat's on.\nYou can also toggle that off.\n\n196\n00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.820\nNow here, automatically download updates\neven over metered data connections,\n\n197\n00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.980\ncharges may apply.\n\n198\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:18.600\nSo I know some people try to get around\nthe whole update process by enabling this,\n\n199\n00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.880\nand then setting their,\nif we go back here under your,\n\n200\n00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.880\nlet me see here, go back one more to\nthe homepage, network and Internet.\n\n201\n00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.900\nAnd so here, for my Ethernet connection,\n\n202\n00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:40.410\nif I were to go ahead and set this\nconnection as a metered connection,\n\n203\n00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.630\nthen what that means is hey, whenever\nI detect this network there, or for\n\n204\n00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:49.360\nthis particular connection, I'm not gonna\ngo ahead and download and install updates.\n\n205\n00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.616\nSo remember, like I said, there's\na reason why we wanna have updates.\n\n206\n00:11:53.616 --> 00:11:56.180\nSo this is not a good idea unless\n\n207\n00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.010\nyou're using it the way that\nit was intended to be used.\n\n208\n00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.930\nSo maybe if you were on, I don't know,\n\n209\n00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:07.948\ndo people still really use the mobile\ncards, the air cards now a days?\n\n210\n00:12:07.948 --> 00:12:10.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sometimes, when you just have\none, you're going into some area that has-\n\n211\n00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.550\n&gt;&gt; Hot spots or something.\n\n212\n00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.950\nIf you have a cellular plan,\nmaybe you don't want to use that data.\n\n213\n00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.370\nAnd you want to wait until you get to\na work location or your home location.\n\n214\n00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.641\nMaybe you have cheaper, and you have wi-fi\nset up there or something like that.\n\n215\n00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:23.566\nJust to keep in mind.\n\n216\n00:12:23.566 --> 00:12:27.460\n[LAUGH] It's been a long\ntime since I've seen that.\n\n217\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.281\nAll right, so where were we?\n\n218\n00:12:32.281 --> 00:12:33.968\nWe were in advanced options.\n\n219\n00:12:33.968 --> 00:12:37.086\nThis is just a simple little\ntoggle to set reminders for you,\n\n220\n00:12:37.086 --> 00:12:39.181\nto let you know if we're gonna restart.\n\n221\n00:12:39.181 --> 00:12:42.461\nAgain, it's always a good idea\nto know when you're restarting.\n\n222\n00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:45.554\nBut using those active hours\ncan really help any of those,\n\n223\n00:12:45.554 --> 00:12:49.847\nI don't wanna say annoyances, but I don't\nwant any negativity associated with\n\n224\n00:12:49.847 --> 00:12:52.637\nupdates because like I said,\nwe want them, right?\n\n225\n00:12:52.637 --> 00:12:56.594\nSo [LAUGH] what if we don't want them?\n\n226\n00:12:56.594 --> 00:12:59.702\nOkay, well,\nwe might be able to not get them, but\n\n227\n00:12:59.702 --> 00:13:02.303\nthat's not really what we're here for.\n\n228\n00:13:02.303 --> 00:13:04.751\nBut what if I am about to shoot a show,\nand\n\n229\n00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:09.594\nI don't want updates happening in the\nmiddle of my show or something like that?\n\n230\n00:13:09.594 --> 00:13:11.540\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n231\n00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.990\nWell, yes, there is.\n\n232\n00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.060\nAnd that's where this little\noption comes into play here.\n\n233\n00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.967\nSo if you have some kind of, which I\nthink is good for like presentations or\n\n234\n00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:22.812\nany kind of important task\nthat you maybe executing.\n\n235\n00:13:22.812 --> 00:13:27.369\nYou can go ahead toggle this.\n\n236\n00:13:27.369 --> 00:13:30.128\nSo today's date, all right?\n\n237\n00:13:30.128 --> 00:13:31.017\nJune 6th.\n\n238\n00:13:31.017 --> 00:13:35.192\nIt'll go ahead and defer those updates,\nI think it is, what is it, 35 days?\n\n239\n00:13:35.192 --> 00:13:39.395\nI was thinking 30, but right here,\nyou can see that it'll defer them for\n\n240\n00:13:39.395 --> 00:13:40.810\nup to 35 days.\n\n241\n00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:46.129\nAnd then, tell you when the updates will\nbe paused until this particular date.\n\n242\n00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:51.028\nYou can always come in before that\ndate and then turn it back off,\n\n243\n00:13:51.028 --> 00:13:55.045\nor resume the update option,\nif you choose to do so.\n\n244\n00:13:55.045 --> 00:13:59.361\nNow, this is kind of interesting.\n\n245\n00:13:59.361 --> 00:14:03.474\nIf you think about those servicing\nchannels that we spoke about in the last\n\n246\n00:14:03.474 --> 00:14:07.273\nshow, if not, then definitely go back and\ncheck that out because-\n\n247\n00:14:07.273 --> 00:14:08.739\n&gt;&gt; You had a fantastic drawing,\n\n248\n00:14:08.739 --> 00:14:11.626\nI remember, that explained those rings and\nhow they fit.\n\n249\n00:14:11.626 --> 00:14:17.057\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That was piecemealed together\nfrom a lot of Ignite presentations, yeah.\n\n250\n00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:19.865\n[LAUGH] So\ntried to get as much info for you.\n\n251\n00:14:19.865 --> 00:14:23.165\nSo yeah, go back and check those out\nbecause I think that will put it into\n\n252\n00:14:23.165 --> 00:14:25.047\nperspective some of the settings here.\n\n253\n00:14:25.047 --> 00:14:28.097\nBecause look at this,\nusing this drop-down, all right?\n\n254\n00:14:28.097 --> 00:14:30.442\nSo I'm choosing what\nupdates are installed.\n\n255\n00:14:30.442 --> 00:14:34.497\nIf I hadn't seen that diagram, and\nI see semi-annual channel targeted versus\n\n256\n00:14:34.497 --> 00:14:38.170\nsemi-annual channel,\nthere's not a lot of information there.\n\n257\n00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.765\nI wouldn't guess, yeah,\nI wouldn't be able to even tell.\n\n258\n00:14:40.765 --> 00:14:43.612\nSo remember that your semi-annual channel,\n\n259\n00:14:43.612 --> 00:14:47.050\nthis is gonna be the default\noption actually targeted.\n\n260\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:51.341\nThat means those systems who are set\nwith this setting, which is the default\n\n261\n00:14:51.341 --> 00:14:56.010\nsetting, are gonna get those system\nas soon as they are available.\n\n262\n00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:02.090\nNow, if I wanted to go ahead and\nmethodically design a plan,\n\n263\n00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:06.340\nan update plan, then I can go ahead and\nchoose this option.\n\n264\n00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:11.217\nAnd then,\nI can choose different rings, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:11.217 --> 00:15:13.980\nOur service rings, there.\n\n266\n00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.881\nAnd then,\nset those groups of computers accordingly.\n\n267\n00:15:17.881 --> 00:15:22.360\nNow, I will also show you a way that\nwe can do that on a larger scale.\n\n268\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.390\nBut for here,\njust on a one-off type configuration,\n\n269\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:31.530\nI have the ability to go ahead and\nselect feature updates.\n\n270\n00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.810\nAnd let's take a look at the days.\n\n271\n00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.680\nIf you drop-down here for\nyour feature updates, so\n\n272\n00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:42.270\nhow far out can I actually\ndefer my future updates?\n\n273\n00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:46.230\nSo up to a year, which is kind of crazy,\nif you think about it.\n\n274\n00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.600\nBecause, I mean, it's not crazy [LAUGH].\n\n275\n00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.200\nI say it's crazy.\n\n276\n00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.575\nWell, in my mind,\n\n277\n00:15:52.575 --> 00:15:55.924\nit's crazy because operating\nsystems lasted a lot longer, right?\n\n278\n00:15:55.924 --> 00:15:57.990\nBut now-\n&gt;&gt; At least two years typically.\n\n279\n00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not one year and be done with it.\n\n280\n00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:01.798\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n281\n00:16:01.798 --> 00:16:05.190\nwith a semi-annual Feature release-\n&gt;&gt; You get a minimum\n\n282\n00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:05.910\nof 18-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n283\n00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.480\nthis will push you out to\nat least two of those.\n\n284\n00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:13.549\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you were one of those\ncompanies that wanted to be risky.\n\n285\n00:16:13.549 --> 00:16:18.286\nAnd the reason I say it's risky is\nif you think about how that release\n\n286\n00:16:18.286 --> 00:16:22.606\ncame overlaps, and if you decide\nto skip one of those releases\n\n287\n00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:27.594\naltogether feature update,\nthen you're gonna be usually pressed for\n\n288\n00:16:27.594 --> 00:16:32.107\na six month window there to test and\nperform a broad deployment.\n\n289\n00:16:32.107 --> 00:16:36.217\nWhich, if you have a small company and you\nfeel comfortable with having only a six\n\n290\n00:16:36.217 --> 00:16:39.374\nmonth window there,\nthen that's not even gonna be an issue.\n\n291\n00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:42.859\nBut just something to think about\nwhen you come up with that plan.\n\n292\n00:16:42.859 --> 00:16:46.907\nNow, Quality Updates,\nthat's a different story here.\n\n293\n00:16:46.907 --> 00:16:50.098\nNow, Quality Updates is gonna\nbe a lot shorter time frames.\n\n294\n00:16:50.098 --> 00:16:53.570\nSo we've got 30 days here, so\njust kind of keep that in mind.\n\n295\n00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.868\n&gt;&gt; And those include the Security Updates,\n\n296\n00:16:55.868 --> 00:16:59.553\nwhich is probably the reason they\ndon't let us push it out as long.\n\n297\n00:16:59.553 --> 00:17:02.291\n&gt;&gt; Right, you're gonna want those, yeah.\n\n298\n00:17:02.291 --> 00:17:07.146\nAnd also, if there was a hot fix,\nyou're gonna get that.\n\n299\n00:17:07.146 --> 00:17:10.414\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're gonna get that.\n\n300\n00:17:10.414 --> 00:17:15.491\nAnd those, if you think back to\nthe express update model, that's where\n\n301\n00:17:15.491 --> 00:17:21.086\nwe see smaller, incremental updates,\nsometimes like kind of just coming in.\n\n302\n00:17:21.086 --> 00:17:23.043\nAt least I've seen that.\n\n303\n00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:24.888\nSo delivery optimization.\n\n304\n00:17:24.888 --> 00:17:30.192\nThis is another change in the way\nthings have been done in the past.\n\n305\n00:17:30.192 --> 00:17:37.723\nBecause we would get these downloads,\nand they're were like x64 byte systems,\n\n306\n00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:42.469\napproximately 3.5 gigs for\nupdates in the past.\n\n307\n00:17:42.469 --> 00:17:49.716\nAnd they were able to go ahead and shave\noff a gig from the cumulative process,\n\n308\n00:17:49.716 --> 00:17:53.850\nand then the ESD process reduces those.\n\n309\n00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:58.660\nSo let me see here, there's a lot\nof information, it's pretty good to\n\n310\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.470\ntake a look at here for\nthis link I have put in the show notes.\n\n311\n00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:10.688\nAnd it covers different optimization\ntechniques that Windows 10 uses.\n\n312\n00:18:10.688 --> 00:18:14.720\nThis peer to peer distribution\nis pretty cool as well.\n\n313\n00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.660\nAnd I say its pretty cool,\nbut both Mike and\n\n314\n00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.960\nI we checked because I was like I\ndon't use that, do you use that?\n\n315\n00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.649\nHe was like no, I don't use that.\n\n316\n00:18:20.649 --> 00:18:22.846\nBut it is a good idea,\nif you think about it.\n\n317\n00:18:22.846 --> 00:18:26.630\nBecause when I use Windows update,\nso Windows update will go out to\n\n318\n00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.497\nthe Internet, out to Microsoft,\nand pull that update down for me.\n\n319\n00:18:30.497 --> 00:18:32.846\nThink about that on a larger scale.\n\n320\n00:18:32.846 --> 00:18:34.938\nSo Mike and I are in the same building.\n\n321\n00:18:34.938 --> 00:18:37.154\nWe're standing right next to each other.\n\n322\n00:18:37.154 --> 00:18:41.800\nSo Mike and I's systems are both going\nacross the wire, across our network,\n\n323\n00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.875\ngoing out over the Internet to Microsoft,\ngetting those updates,\n\n324\n00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:49.324\ndownloading them, and\ninstalling them on our systems.\n\n325\n00:18:49.324 --> 00:18:54.033\nBut if I were to go ahead and utilize the\npeer to peer method, I could go out and\n\n326\n00:18:54.033 --> 00:18:55.148\nget the updates.\n\n327\n00:18:55.148 --> 00:18:58.286\nAnd then,\nwhen Mike was ready to get his updates,\n\n328\n00:18:58.286 --> 00:19:02.280\nhis system would see my updates and\nthen just get them from me.\n\n329\n00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.250\n&gt;&gt; So if I can set mine to defer for\n\n330\n00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:05.124\none day\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:19:05.124 --> 00:19:06.770\n&gt;&gt; Let your PC do all the work and\n\n332\n00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.160\ngo get them, and\nthen I'll just get them from you.\n\n333\n00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:14.456\n&gt;&gt; Which, I mean, there's not,\nand it's just a nice thing to do.\n\n334\n00:19:14.456 --> 00:19:18.386\nBecause think about all your other\nco-workers that you're helping out,\n\n335\n00:19:18.386 --> 00:19:22.876\nincreasing their network speeds because\nthey don't have that network contention in\n\n336\n00:19:22.876 --> 00:19:26.765\nthere, they don't have to have any\nkind of speed limit on their network.\n\n337\n00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:28.145\n&gt;&gt; It definitely make sense.\n\n338\n00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:29.145\nAnd I know it's safe.\n\n339\n00:19:29.145 --> 00:19:31.245\nMicrosoft signs all of these updates.\n\n340\n00:19:31.245 --> 00:19:36.370\nSo it hopefully it'd be rather hard for\nsome bad actor to try to put some\n\n341\n00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:41.660\nmalware to somehow misconfigure something\nand give you a bad version of the update.\n\n342\n00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.553\n&gt;&gt; But we don't wanna say that\nsomething's not possible, I mean-\n\n343\n00:19:44.553 --> 00:19:45.720\n&gt;&gt; I'm old school.\n\n344\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Your computer make me nervous.\n\n345\n00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.419\n&gt;&gt; I guess we're both like a glass\nhalf empty kind of person.\n\n346\n00:19:50.419 --> 00:19:52.075\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it comes to this, sure.\n\n347\n00:19:52.075 --> 00:19:54.157\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you can also choose, I think,\n\n348\n00:19:54.157 --> 00:19:58.000\nif I'm not mistaken, to limit it to\njust your intranet, or intranet and\n\n349\n00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.047\nInternet,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n350\n00:19:59.047 --> 00:20:03.087\nwe'll see that in the settings there,\ntoo, which is a good option.\n\n351\n00:20:03.087 --> 00:20:05.041\nYou do have that.\n\n352\n00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:06.744\nSo it's anyone, local, or\njust straight from Microsoft.\n\n353\n00:20:06.744 --> 00:20:10.221\nSo you have a level of trust that\nyou can go ahead and set there.\n\n354\n00:20:10.221 --> 00:20:14.949\nAnd while we're on this page,\nI will just splint couple of other things.\n\n355\n00:20:14.949 --> 00:20:19.056\nYou can also take advantage of branch\ncaching if you gonna be running a Window\n\n356\n00:20:19.056 --> 00:20:20.803\nserver update service server.\n\n357\n00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:25.325\nAnd also, through a Windows update for\nbusiness, which I'll show you as well.\n\n358\n00:20:25.325 --> 00:20:29.490\nThat's kind of, with all these different\ntools that Microsoft is coming up with,\n\n359\n00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.130\nI was expecting a shiny new tool,\nand I'm like yeah, what is this?\n\n360\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.620\nAnd then I'm like, it's just\na collection of group policy settings.\n\n361\n00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.910\nSo there's nothing that\nyou have to download or\n\n362\n00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:43.550\ninstall, it's simply Windows update for\nbusiness is\n\n363\n00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:48.390\ntaking advantage of using some\nparticular group policy settings there.\n\n364\n00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.225\nBut yeah, just knowing that if you wanted\nto go and had to take advantage of branch\n\n365\n00:20:51.225 --> 00:20:55.390\ncache, you could even take this\nconcept to another level there,\n\n366\n00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.320\nto speed up your systems and\nyour downloads.\n\n367\n00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.210\nI'm trying to think, there is something\nelse I wanted to show you, but I think\n\n368\n00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.565\nthere was a better, I put it in a link so\nyou guys could go back and look at it.\n\n369\n00:21:05.565 --> 00:21:08.900\nYeah, a little more comprehensive\nchart on this page.\n\n370\n00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.140\nAssign devices to servicing channels.\n\n371\n00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.800\nWe talked about servicing\nchannels in the last show.\n\n372\n00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.670\nAnd then, this was just a kind of, I\nthought this was a cool little chart that\n\n373\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.850\nyou could take a look at to see what\noperating systems could be assigned.\n\n374\n00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.060\nThere are some restrictions there,\nand we won't go over all of them,\n\n375\n00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.380\nbut that link is provided\nin the show notes.\n\n376\n00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:31.030\nSo just might be something\ngood to know for the exam.\n\n377\n00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.920\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n378\n00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.152\n&gt;&gt; All right, and this is actually that\nexact setting that you were talking about,\n\n379\n00:21:36.152 --> 00:21:37.221\nMike, right here.\n\n380\n00:21:37.221 --> 00:21:43.610\nSo right now, so here,\nallow downloads from other PCs.\n\n381\n00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.050\nSo if I have, which this is good,\n\n382\n00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.340\nit says if you have an unreliable\nInternet connection.\n\n383\n00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.080\nSo think about that.\n\n384\n00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.920\nMaybe there's one particular branch\nlocation within your organization that\n\n385\n00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.590\nhas really crummy network connectivity.\n\n386\n00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:01.110\nSo if you had a system in that environment\nthat already had those updates,\n\n387\n00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:05.800\nthen it could just piggyback off of\nthat system, like you were saying there.\n\n388\n00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.330\nDon't go deferring your updates there.\n\n389\n00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:12.530\nBut here,\nit says allow downloads from other PCs.\n\n390\n00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.800\nSo currently, this is enabled for me.\n\n391\n00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.610\nBut notice the radio button right here,\nit says PCs on my local network.\n\n392\n00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.640\nI do have the option to go ahead and\n\n393\n00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.186\nchoose PCs on my local network\nas well as PCs on the Internet.\n\n394\n00:22:27.186 --> 00:22:32.060\nSo if we get all our little tinfoil\nhats and put them on and feel brave,\n\n395\n00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.105\nthen we can go ahead and\nleave the setting there.\n\n396\n00:22:34.105 --> 00:22:35.650\nAnd we'll do that, okay?\n\n397\n00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:36.632\nLiving on the edge here.\n\n398\n00:22:36.632 --> 00:22:41.580\nNow, so we're gonna go into more advanced\noptions from our Advance options.\n\n399\n00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:45.000\nWe're kinda going down that\nrabbit hole of update options.\n\n400\n00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.350\nDownload settings.\n\n401\n00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:53.080\nIf I wanna be really specific\nabout percentage, like for\n\n402\n00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.970\nthe downloads that I'm using,\nI can go ahead and throttle that as well.\n\n403\n00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.120\nAnd here, you can set a limit on\nhow much bandwidth this used for\n\n404\n00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.020\ndownloading updates in\nthe background versus foreground.\n\n405\n00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.720\nAnd then,\nif you look at this other option,\n\n406\n00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.060\nwhich is kind of interesting,\nis how generous do I wanna be?\n\n407\n00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.690\nThis reminds me of well,\nI might get myself in trouble.\n\n408\n00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.390\n[LAUGH] Although, I should say this.\n\n409\n00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.380\nMaybe there might some sites out there, or\n\n410\n00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:24.110\nlike ages ago, there's this one\nservice that rhymed with Mapster.\n\n411\n00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n412\n00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.500\n&gt;&gt; But anyways, you could go ahead and\n\n413\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.430\nset settings like this.\n\n414\n00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.820\nBecause if you think about it,\nI'm being generous.\n\n415\n00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.380\nI'm allowing other computers\nto take my updates, but\n\n416\n00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.320\nI don't want them bogging\ndown my computer.\n\n417\n00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.944\nBecause maybe I'm running like\nsome kind of application that is\n\n418\n00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.670\nsensitive, and relies heavily on my\nnetwork bandwidth or something like that.\n\n419\n00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:53.115\nOr maybe I'm on a metered connection,\nso I wanna go ahead.\n\n420\n00:23:53.115 --> 00:23:57.266\nWe know that a lot of service plans or\nSLEs will allow more for\n\n421\n00:23:57.266 --> 00:23:59.103\ndownload versus upload.\n\n422\n00:23:59.103 --> 00:24:05.462\nSo maybe I don't want to exceede\nMy service provider SLA there,\n\n423\n00:24:05.462 --> 00:24:09.363\nso I could go ahead and bring this down.\n\n424\n00:24:09.363 --> 00:24:11.511\nYeah, I don't know,\nit's totally up to you,\n\n425\n00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:15.440\nwhat a good generous number is there but\nI'm just gonna go ahead and leave that.\n\n426\n00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.360\nNow, I thought this was pretty cool.\n\n427\n00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:23.270\nI don't have much to show you here because\napparently I have been very stingy,\n\n428\n00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:27.540\nand I have all 500 gigs left available,\nbecause I haven't shared out, but\n\n429\n00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.870\nif you worry you could keep an eye on that\nwith this nice graphical element there.\n\n430\n00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:41.610\nAll right, and overall statistics here,\nand it's gonna show you that date,\n\n431\n00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:46.050\nand then it'll also show you where\nI'm getting this information from.\n\n432\n00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:51.210\nSo, for me, 100%, I've got all my\nupdates from Microsoft, but if I had PCs\n\n433\n00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:55.100\non my network, you can see the different\nhues or shades of blue here to go ahead.\n\n434\n00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.660\nAnd to get download versus upload there.\n\n435\n00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.860\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; I like that they make this\n\n436\n00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.450\ninformation so easily available because\nyou might be okay, well let me try it.\n\n437\n00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.670\nLet me see if I'm actually\ngonna save any bandwidth\n\n438\n00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.010\nby downloading updates from\nother PCs on my local network.\n\n439\n00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.150\nYou can see the results right here and\ndetermine whether or not it's worth it or\n\n440\n00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.970\nsomething that you don't want to use.\n\n441\n00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.080\nSo, very cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's no guess work.\n\n442\n00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:16.925\nIt takes all the guessing out of it.\n\n443\n00:25:16.925 --> 00:25:17.636\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI didn't have to set up monitoring-\n\n444\n00:25:17.636 --> 00:25:18.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n445\n00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.702\n&gt;&gt; Or have to run Wire Shark and\n\n446\n00:25:19.702 --> 00:25:21.070\ndo math or anything like that.\n\n447\n00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.140\nThey've got a nice handy chart that\nshows me all that right there.\n\n448\n00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.120\n&gt;&gt; So one thing I know,\nwe're getting close on time.\n\n449\n00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:31.010\nI do wanna show you, I'm not on\na domain controller to go ahead and\n\n450\n00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.180\nroll out group policy.\n\n451\n00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:39.310\nBut if I go ahead and bring up my, and I\nhave that in here already, my gpedit.msc.\n\n452\n00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:42.310\nOops, go ahead and zoom in so\nyou guys can just see that.\n\n453\n00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.930\nWe've been there before,\nyou could also just do a search.\n\n454\n00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:45.580\nI'm gonna hit OK.\n\n455\n00:25:46.808 --> 00:25:51.200\nAnd here, within our group policy editor,\nthis is just for the local machine, but\n\n456\n00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:56.080\nagain, it's more about I wanna show\nyou what this actually looks like.\n\n457\n00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.090\nBecause it's a little bit different here.\n\n458\n00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:02.520\nI might as well go full screen,\nlet's do it, live on the edge here.\n\n459\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.070\nAll right, so where is this going to be?\n\n460\n00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:08.373\nThis is going to be under Computer\nConfiguration, this top section over here\n\n461\n00:26:08.373 --> 00:26:11.814\non the left, and\nthen expand out Administrative Templates,\n\n462\n00:26:11.814 --> 00:26:15.342\nand then from there it is going\nto be under Windows Components.\n\n463\n00:26:15.342 --> 00:26:20.108\nAnd then all the way at the bottom,\nwe're gonna be looking for\n\n464\n00:26:20.108 --> 00:26:25.058\nour Windows Updates, and\nthen once we get in there notice here,\n\n465\n00:26:25.058 --> 00:26:29.950\nthis top folder or\nthis section right here, let me see.\n\n466\n00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.590\nIt's Windows Update for Business.\n\n467\n00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:36.450\nSo, this is not a shiny new tool that\nyou have to go out and download.\n\n468\n00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:40.910\nIt's literally just a collection of\npolicies that you can go in and configure.\n\n469\n00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:44.070\nSo I have a couple of different\noptions here, let me zoom in and\n\n470\n00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.520\nyou guys can see this.\n\n471\n00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.570\nSelect when preview builds and\nfeature updates are received,\n\n472\n00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:53.450\nI can go in and actually choose days.\n\n473\n00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:59.170\nSo, if I were to go ahead and\nenable this, I can set my rings here,\n\n474\n00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:00.660\nthat's what I'm doing with this settings.\n\n475\n00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.060\nSo, I'm configuring,\nokay do I wanna get the preview build, or\n\n476\n00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.910\nI want to be on the fast track,\ncuz that's hot off the press, brand new,\n\n477\n00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.520\nstill has that new update smell, right?\n\n478\n00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:15.260\nOr I can get the slow but still a preview\nbuild, or maybe I wanna go ahead and\n\n479\n00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:20.730\nbump it on down to my semi-annual channel,\nand then use days there.\n\n480\n00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:25.218\nSo, looking back at the links\nthat I had showed you,\n\n481\n00:27:25.218 --> 00:27:31.032\nMicrosoft does give some generic or\njust kind of rounded numbers for\n\n482\n00:27:31.032 --> 00:27:34.913\ndays that you might wanna go ahead and\ndefer.\n\n483\n00:27:34.913 --> 00:27:37.973\nBut really that's totally up to you and\nyour organization,\n\n484\n00:27:37.973 --> 00:27:41.093\nhow many days you wanna choose for\nthose individual rings, so\n\n485\n00:27:41.093 --> 00:27:43.676\nyou would just go ahead and\nset these there as well.\n\n486\n00:27:43.676 --> 00:27:47.428\nA couple different options after preview\nbuild or feature update is released,\n\n487\n00:27:47.428 --> 00:27:48.580\ndefer it.\n\n488\n00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:52.720\nSo how many days, and again,\nthis all goes back to configuring and\n\n489\n00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.640\nsetting up those rings.\n\n490\n00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.915\nSo that's gonna be for\nyour preview builds and feature updates.\n\n491\n00:27:59.915 --> 00:28:04.180\nThese, you need to set them for each one\nof these here because quality updates,\n\n492\n00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:08.050\nif you're taking advantage of those rings,\nyou'll need to configure that as well and\n\n493\n00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:09.930\nif you're using preview builds there.\n\n494\n00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:14.030\nBut just note that's where you wanna\ngo ahead and take a look at those.\n\n495\n00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.530\nAnd, I lied [LAUGH] there\nis one more thing, Mike.\n\n496\n00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:24.050\nI don't know, this one will be quick, just\nto keep in mind, Window store apps, right?\n\n497\n00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.467\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] those as well.\n\n498\n00:28:25.467 --> 00:28:28.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so we wanna be aware of that.\n\n499\n00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:33.534\nIf I wasn't using any kind of\nenterprise-wide management system,\n\n500\n00:28:33.534 --> 00:28:35.580\nmaybe MDM or something to that nature.\n\n501\n00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:42.510\nAnd I needed to go ahead and update my\nMicrosoft store apps locally, then you can\n\n502\n00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.330\nlaunch Microsoft store, which I just did\nby clicking on the icon in my task bar.\n\n503\n00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.918\nAlternatively you could perform a search.\n\n504\n00:28:48.918 --> 00:28:53.308\nOn the top right-hand corner,\nthe little lips buttons over here,\n\n505\n00:28:53.308 --> 00:28:55.233\ngo ahead and hit See More, and\n\n506\n00:28:55.233 --> 00:29:00.180\nthis first section in the top right-hand\ncorner is Downloads and Updates.\n\n507\n00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.695\nSo if you go there,\nI have a list of some recent activity.\n\n508\n00:29:03.695 --> 00:29:07.435\nAnd this is where you'll wanna go\nahead and check for get updates.\n\n509\n00:29:07.435 --> 00:29:11.495\nSo if I go ahead and, obviously I made an\ninternet connection, because that's where\n\n510\n00:29:11.495 --> 00:29:15.115\nwe're checking for those updates\ninside of the Microsoft store.\n\n511\n00:29:15.115 --> 00:29:17.685\nAnd currently I am good to go.\n\n512\n00:29:17.685 --> 00:29:21.625\nAnd if I needed to perform some updates,\nthey would be listed there.\n\n513\n00:29:21.625 --> 00:29:23.535\nSo it's really a simple interface.\n\n514\n00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:27.362\nBut I did lie about one more thing,\nMike, I'm so sorry.\n\n515\n00:29:27.362 --> 00:29:30.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There is a troubleshooting section,\n\n516\n00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.760\nas a matter of fact, couple of\ndifferent ways you can get there.\n\n517\n00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.450\nLet me just show you from Control Panel.\n\n518\n00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:40.507\nIt's easy if I were just to\ndo a search with Cortana or\n\n519\n00:29:40.507 --> 00:29:44.211\nsomething, but\nlet me go ahead and do a search.\n\n520\n00:29:44.211 --> 00:29:49.117\nOr here, I'll launch Control Panel,\nand then within Control Panel,\n\n521\n00:29:49.117 --> 00:29:54.129\neven if I start typing updates,\nsometimes, let's see if I can find it.\n\n522\n00:29:54.129 --> 00:29:58.603\nOkay, it's weird, UPD, and\nI see it, but then I add, or DA,\n\n523\n00:29:58.603 --> 00:30:02.585\nthat's because I had the wrong\nletter there, hold on.\n\n524\n00:30:02.585 --> 00:30:03.310\nOkay, so it's still there.\n\n525\n00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.450\nOkay, so I'm not crazy.\n\n526\n00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.390\nIt goes away if you fully type it in.\n\n527\n00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:07.629\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n528\n00:30:07.629 --> 00:30:08.999\n&gt;&gt; Don't even get me started on that.\n\n529\n00:30:08.999 --> 00:30:10.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Search algorithms,\n\n530\n00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.370\ncuz they boggle my mind.\n\n531\n00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:13.490\nBut yes, I've seen that.\n\n532\n00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:14.418\nThat's cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, so\n\n533\n00:30:14.418 --> 00:30:15.220\njust know that that happens.\n\n534\n00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.640\nYou're not going crazy.\n\n535\n00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.790\nYou might already be crazy like me,\nbut who knows.\n\n536\n00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:23.360\nAlso if you wanted to uninstall from\nControl Panel app like you have currently,\n\n537\n00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.310\nI don't know if they're going\nto be taking this feature away.\n\n538\n00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:29.650\nProbably not,\nbecause a lot of these legacy interfaces,\n\n539\n00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:33.620\nthey don't wanna leave you disabled or\nanything like that.\n\n540\n00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.200\nSo, you could also go in\nthis way to uninstall.\n\n541\n00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.300\nJust takes you to that exact\nsame window that we saw before.\n\n542\n00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.110\nI'm gonna delete the s off of updates so\nthat we can get to\n\n543\n00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:46.120\nwhere I really wanted to show you, and\nI promise, promise this is the last thing.\n\n544\n00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.030\nSo we can go ahead and\nclick on troubleshooting here.\n\n545\n00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:53.902\nThere's also an option to go ahead and\nlaunch this.\n\n546\n00:30:53.902 --> 00:30:55.930\nAnd now I got to see\nif I can even find it.\n\n547\n00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.684\nNot audio devices,\ndo you see Windows Updates on here, Mike?\n\n548\n00:31:01.684 --> 00:31:02.241\nI'm I going crazy?\n\n549\n00:31:02.241 --> 00:31:03.570\n&gt;&gt; I don't.\n&gt;&gt; That's weird.\n\n550\n00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:04.880\nRight here, okay.\n\n551\n00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.577\nOkay, I was gonna say don't tell me.\n\n552\n00:31:07.577 --> 00:31:11.734\n[LAUGH] All right, you can also get\nhere through the settings UI as well,\n\n553\n00:31:11.734 --> 00:31:14.560\ntakes you to the exact same wizard though.\n\n554\n00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.730\nAnd that's what this looks like.\n\n555\n00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:20.630\nSo if for whatever reason, and if I\nstart this, this is where it might tell\n\n556\n00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:25.660\nme if I had any kind of pending updates or\nsomething that wasn't so obvious.\n\n557\n00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.260\nYou could run this to go ahead and\n\n558\n00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:31.160\ncheck but yeah, I think that's it\nas far as updates go, for now.\n\n559\n00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.530\n&gt;&gt; All right, that's a lot of\ninformation on Windows Updates,\n\n560\n00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.880\na lot more options than we thought.\n\n561\n00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.370\nI know when we think of Windows 10, we\nthink we have no control over the update\n\n562\n00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.030\nprocess, but you've shown us that we\nreally do if we know where to look.\n\n563\n00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:42.710\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n564\n00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:43.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I hope everybody out there enjoyed\n\n565\n00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.010\nwatching this one.\n\n566\n00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.670\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n567\n00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:48.540\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee

00:00:10.123\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.123 --> 00:00:10.762\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:10.762 --> 00:00:15.180\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.990\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.926\nToday, we're doing that installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10 preparing for\n\n8\n00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:20.700\n70-698 exam.\n\n9\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.941\nIn this episode,\n\n10\n00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:27.240\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\ndifferent ways we can monitor Windows.\n\n11\n00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.914\nHere to show us all the different methods\ncan use, well, most of them anyway,\n\n12\n00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:32.346\nhopefully.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:32.346 --> 00:00:33.461\n&gt;&gt; Is none other than Cherokee Boose.\n\n14\n00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:36.420\nWelcome, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for that, Mike, intro.\n\n15\n00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.710\nI mean, what were you insinuating there,\nall of the different ways?\n\n16\n00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.520\n&gt;&gt; That there are a lot\n\n17\n00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.170\nof them, aren't there?\n\n18\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.970\nThat we have a lot of options when\nit comes to monitoring Windows.\n\n19\n00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.700\nIt seems like a lot of\nthe information is overlapping, so\n\n20\n00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.715\nwhat we're going to do today is\nkind of sift through all of that.\n\n21\n00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:56.860\nAnd let's just take a look at my screen\nto kind of give you an idea what\n\n22\n00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.290\nMike was talking about.\n\n23\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.450\nHere, I've just pulled up some of the\ndifferent tools that we'll be looking at\n\n24\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.500\nspecifically and just this episode.\n\n25\n00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.310\nAnd I think there's gonna be multi\nparts as we continue to go on.\n\n26\n00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.467\nI'm going to try to get a little of these\ndifferent tools in this episode, but yeah,\n\n27\n00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:13.040\nthere's a lot.\n&gt;&gt; There really are, there are.\n\n28\n00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.346\nAnd for the exam, you need to be familiar\nwith the different monitoring tools and\n\n29\n00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:16.939\nwhat they do.\n\n30\n00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.251\nAnd I think probably Cherokee,\n\n31\n00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:21.557\none of the things I always like to focus\non is whether it's real-time monitoring\n\n32\n00:01:21.557 --> 00:01:23.270\nversus historical monitoring.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n33\n00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.930\n&gt;&gt; Those are some of the things they might\n\n34\n00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.185\nask you on the exam.\n\n35\n00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:29.880\nWell, do I need to see what's\ngoing on right now, or\n\n36\n00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.720\ndo I need a record of what's\nhappened in the past?\n\n37\n00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.390\nAnd so, one of the things\nwe'll probably take a look at.\n\n38\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.450\n&gt;&gt; No, that's perfect,\n\n39\n00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.700\nbecause I always try to, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n40\n00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.850\n&gt;&gt; You guys probably might have heard me\n\n41\n00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.000\nsay something about flow.\n\n42\n00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.690\nI wanna have a good flow when\nI'm explaining something.\n\n43\n00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.710\nSomething that makes sense and I couldn't\nfind a good flow with with all those\n\n44\n00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.450\ndifferent tools for this show,\nand I'm like where do I start?\n\n45\n00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.460\nAnd you said Mike,\nwith real time monitoring tools,\n\n46\n00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.640\nI thought, that's a good place to start,\nsomething in the present.\n\n47\n00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.935\nLet's be in the present, so\nthat's what we'll be looking at this show.\n\n48\n00:01:57.935 --> 00:02:00.175\nWe'll look at real-time monitoring tools.\n\n49\n00:02:00.175 --> 00:02:03.255\nActually, at the very end\nwe'll look at some historical\n\n50\n00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:05.825\ninformation that we can\ncreate baselines with.\n\n51\n00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:09.825\nBut then we'll move chronologically\ntoward some other tool sets, and\n\n52\n00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:11.075\nthen other fringe\n\n53\n00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:14.895\nexam objectives they threw in there too.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n54\n00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:18.050\n&gt;&gt; So, okay, there's a lot here.\n\n55\n00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.840\nNow, what we're really gonna be\nlooking at is different types of\n\n56\n00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.640\ntools that will display and\ngenerate graphical components.\n\n57\n00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.280\nOr even text base components of\nraw data and what kind of data\n\n58\n00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.950\ncan we use to help us with problems and\nsituations in our environments.\n\n59\n00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.080\nWell, really, there's so, so much,\n\n60\n00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.530\nI'm gonna try my best to cover and\nmake sense of all this.\n\n61\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.035\nBut let me just kind of show you something\nthat may help, I don't know, it may not.\n\n62\n00:02:55.035 --> 00:03:00.060\n[LAUGH] But I was talking to Jason,\nour business analyst,\n\n63\n00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.100\nMike, and\nhe deals in large volumes of data.\n\n64\n00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.638\nAnd also this company is one\nspecific we got using in-house\n\n65\n00:03:09.638 --> 00:03:13.960\nTableau to represent data\nin a graphical format.\n\n66\n00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.060\nAnd he's like yes look at\nall these cool things.\n\n67\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.410\nNow what we're gonna be looking at\nisn't nearly as cool as like this, but\n\n68\n00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.695\nthis is the March Madness\ncircular bracket.\n\n69\n00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:26.650\nAnd some of these tables that\n\n70\n00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.860\nthey create using graphical components,\nyou guys can check this website out.\n\n71\n00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.170\nYou can get really\ncreative with information,\n\n72\n00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.080\ninformation can help solve\nall sorts of problems.\n\n73\n00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.560\nHousing issues here in Germany,\nand just so many things.\n\n74\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.950\nSo what we're gonna be looking at,\n\n75\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.110\nwe're not gonna be looking\nat those types of issues.\n\n76\n00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.900\nWe're really gonna be looking at\nissues surrounding our systems.\n\n77\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.550\nNow, even more specifically we'll\nbe looking at client side issues.\n\n78\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.610\nBecause I will say that Microsoft\nhas acknowledge to this plethora\n\n79\n00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.380\nof administrative tools,\nand they said, okay,\n\n80\n00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.930\nwe really need to fix that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n81\n00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.460\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's a little crazy.\n\n82\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.810\nSo they came out with a tool,\nit was code name project Honolulu,\n\n83\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.740\nand it is currently dubbed\nas the Windows admin center.\n\n84\n00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.370\nSo it kinda takes all of those different\n\n85\n00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.070\nmoving pieces that we were looking at on\nour screen here, and puts them into one.\n\n86\n00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.190\nWhat are they,\nthey use this glass pane reference, so\n\n87\n00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.800\nit's all behind this\npretty piece of glass.\n\n88\n00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.975\nAnd you see it all at once instead\nof all these little windows, right?\n\n89\n00:04:28.975 --> 00:04:35.970\nSo, unfortunately, that is used\nto manage servers at the moment.\n\n90\n00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.010\nBut I think basically how end\nusers will be perceiving and\n\n91\n00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.710\naccepting this tool may dictate if\nthey're gonna create something like that.\n\n92\n00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.810\nOr incorporate client side management\nas well, only time will tell.\n\n93\n00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.936\nWho knows?\nSo for now,\n\n94\n00:04:50.936 --> 00:04:55.900\nlet's really focus on the exam objectives,\nand like I said, focus on the present.\n\n95\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n96\n00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.660\nSo that's what we'll be looking at.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good, so\n\n97\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.640\nwith all these tools, where do we start?\n&gt;&gt; I know, there's so\n\n98\n00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.910\nmany different ways you can actually\naccess and launch these tools.\n\n99\n00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.730\nSo let's just take a look\nat a couple options.\n\n100\n00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.880\nSo, there really are so\nmany ways to go edit and\n\n101\n00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.760\naccess all of them and if I miss one or\nsomething I do apologize.\n\n102\n00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.720\nBut the best way to get familiarized\nwith all of these is well,\n\n103\n00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.760\nto just get in there and play around.\n\n104\n00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.300\nSo if you want to go ahead and\njust look for a administrative tools,\n\n105\n00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.210\nthis is one kind of category that\nMicrosoft puts a lot of these tools in.\n\n106\n00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.560\nYou can see over here\non the right hand side,\n\n107\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.820\nit's not just limited\nthough to monitoring tools.\n\n108\n00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.860\nSo just be aware of that, you'll have to\njust go through this list right here and\n\n109\n00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.880\npick some of them performance monitor,\nresource monitor, and so forth.\n\n110\n00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.080\nBut we're gonna be at absolutely no\nshortage of ways to go ahead and\n\n111\n00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.040\nlaunch these tools.\n\n112\n00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.560\nSo I'm gonna close out of here for now.\n\n113\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.402\nThe first tool I wanna focus in\non is gonna be Task Manager,\n\n114\n00:05:56.402 --> 00:05:58.790\nthis is a really great one to go ahead and\nstart with.\n\n115\n00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.306\nBecause even from someone\nwho's not even working in IT,\n\n116\n00:06:03.306 --> 00:06:08.020\njust your coworkers having\na problem with their computer.\n\n117\n00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.040\nAnd they're, my computer is locked up,\nI don't know what to do.\n\n118\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.925\nAnd then, dun-dun-da-duuun,\nMike to the rescue,\n\n119\n00:06:12.925 --> 00:06:17.930\n[LAUGH] and he comes over with\nhis keyboard shortcut here.\n\n120\n00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.945\nSorry, my hair's being crazy.\n\n121\n00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:21.010\nControl-Shift-Escape, all right?\n\n122\n00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.355\nSo we can go ahead and hit that,\nand it'll pull up Task Manager.\n\n123\n00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:25.100\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n124\n00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.500\n&gt;&gt; Now, you can also,\n\n125\n00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.380\nlet me close that here,\n\n126\n00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.600\nyou can also right-click on the task\nbar down here at the bottom.\n\n127\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.702\nOkay, and then pull that up as well, okay.\n\n128\n00:06:34.702 --> 00:06:40.360\nAnd so that's the icon and remember any of\nthese tools you can pin to the task bar.\n\n129\n00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.850\nIf you wanted to have an easy to launch\nfor access or something like that,\n\n130\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.217\nbut its very cool so maybe.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n131\n00:06:47.217 --> 00:06:49.660\ncan I throw any tool that I really love?\n&gt;&gt; Okay yeah.\n\n132\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.460\n&gt;&gt; There is times that i\n\n133\n00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.920\nfinds that the machine is unresponsive,if\nI can do a Ctrl+Alt+Delete, and\n\n134\n00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.300\nyou get to that log-off screen.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n135\n00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.090\n&gt;&gt; You can also launch\n\n136\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.880\nTask Manager from there.\n\n137\n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.240\nBecause I have seen where Explorer itself,\nwhich provides you your desktop and\n\n138\n00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.190\nyour Taskbar, if that service is hung up.\n&gt;&gt; It gets that bad, and\n\n139\n00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.115\nit's just like, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; You can't click on the Taskbar,\n\n140\n00:07:09.115 --> 00:07:11.360\nyou can't do those darn,\n&gt;&gt; Skateboard shortcuts\n\n141\n00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.010\n&gt;&gt; So if you can get into,\n\n142\n00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.690\nyou can act like you're gonna log off,\n\n143\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.410\nyou'll see the Task Manager option there.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n144\n00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.070\nif you think of more because\nlike I said there's so\n\n145\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.620\nmany different ways to go ahead and\nI'm sure there's a run line for that one.\n\n146\n00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.000\nI can't think off the top of my head, but\n\n147\n00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.700\nI've written down some of the run lines\nfor other ones that I did recall.\n\n148\n00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.285\nBut like I said, just getting in there and\n\n149\n00:07:27.285 --> 00:07:31.045\nplaying around with it is gonna be\nthe best way to go ahead and do that.\n\n150\n00:07:31.045 --> 00:07:32.885\nBut yeah,\nhere comes Mike with a shiny cape,\n\n151\n00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:33.505\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n152\n00:07:33.505 --> 00:07:34.775\n&gt;&gt; And he's like, I'm gonna\n\n153\n00:07:34.775 --> 00:07:38.025\nget there even if your computer is\nlocked up, by using Ctrl+Alt+Delete, or\n\n154\n00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:39.965\nwhatever method he chooses.\n\n155\n00:07:39.965 --> 00:07:41.905\nAnd then he's going to\nstart investigating, and\n\n156\n00:07:41.905 --> 00:07:44.855\nthat's what these tools\nare really designed to do.\n\n157\n00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:47.990\nIs to present us information to help us\n\n158\n00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.748\nfigure out what's going on right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n159\n00:07:49.748 --> 00:07:51.472\n&gt;&gt; So, any kind of analytics there is\n\n160\n00:07:51.472 --> 00:07:54.916\nreally what we're talking about.\n&gt;&gt; This is definitely my favorite tool to\n\n161\n00:07:54.916 --> 00:07:58.238\nstart with, it's easy to get to, and\nit gives you some basic information.\n\n162\n00:07:58.238 --> 00:08:00.900\nAnd then you can kind of figure out\nwhat you need to do from there.\n\n163\n00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.714\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and\n\n164\n00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:05.140\nthey have different categories here,\ncolumns.\n\n165\n00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.940\nLet me just full screen so we can see\neverything that we're working with.\n\n166\n00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.463\nNow these are going to be the default\ncolumns but they select which is great.\n\n167\n00:08:11.463 --> 00:08:14.245\nMicrosoft, [LAUGH] they kinda know\n\n168\n00:08:14.245 --> 00:08:15.235\ncomputers, okay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:08:15.235 --> 00:08:16.435\n&gt;&gt; They kinda know software.\n\n170\n00:08:16.435 --> 00:08:20.395\nSo [LAUGH] and they kinda know hardware,\nand how hardware behaves with software.\n\n171\n00:08:20.395 --> 00:08:25.192\nSo what they've done over\ntheir years is listen and,\n\n172\n00:08:25.192 --> 00:08:30.172\nfrom experience, look at things that are,\nI guess, most popular or most important.\n\n173\n00:08:30.172 --> 00:08:33.202\nAnd so they'll create a lot\nof defaults we'll find.\n\n174\n00:08:33.202 --> 00:08:38.752\nNow grant everything that we're\nlooking at can be tailored for more\n\n175\n00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:43.582\nspecific information, like right here,\nI can right click on this row right here.\n\n176\n00:08:43.582 --> 00:08:47.010\nAnd let me see if you guys can see that,\nI may need to zoom in a little bit.\n\n177\n00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:51.860\nSo the ones with the options\nhere with the checks\n\n178\n00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.750\nnext to them are gonna be the ones\nthat are currently displayed.\n\n179\n00:08:54.750 --> 00:09:00.215\nWe can also add some additional columns\nsuch as different types of publishers,\n\n180\n00:09:00.215 --> 00:09:04.390\nprocessor names which is kind\nof interesting because or\n\n181\n00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.420\nexcuse me, process names.\n\n182\n00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.890\nIt's interesting because when you think\nabout it some applications may be\n\n183\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:17.500\ndependent on more than just one process,\nsome applications share a process.\n\n184\n00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:22.178\nSo looking at it at a really detail\nlevel can help you trouble shoot\n\n185\n00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:25.690\nmore specific problems.\n\n186\n00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:30.500\nOnce you've narrowed down some pretty\ngeneric problems, or you know what?\n\n187\n00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.690\nTask Manager can be used for\ngeneric problems as well.\n\n188\n00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.270\nIt's really just a great all around tool.\n\n189\n00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.860\nSo I'm going to add one in here just\nto show you guys what this one is.\n\n190\n00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.330\nAnd like I said, I would like you to\ngo through and just check them all out.\n\n191\n00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.610\nBut this one's one of my favorites for\nPID, which stands for Process ID.\n\n192\n00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.970\nAnd we've got our newer\nlittle green leaf here for\n\n193\n00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:56.730\nthose apps or processes that may\nnot currently be in use there.\n\n194\n00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.280\nBut this Process ID, the reason I like it,\n\n195\n00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.420\nI think it's very\ncomplementary to another tool.\n\n196\n00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.870\nSo let me just go ahead and\nlaunch up Command Prompt right here,\n\n197\n00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.500\nto give you an example.\n\n198\n00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.230\nLike I said, I showed you that website for\ndifferent ways that you can get creative\n\n199\n00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.960\nwith using this tool, but this is just one\nway that I would like to use this tool.\n\n200\n00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:23.620\nSo if you recall when we were talking\nabout networking command line utilities,\n\n201\n00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.403\none of them was net stat.\n\n202\n00:10:25.403 --> 00:10:28.300\nSo if I go ahead and run net stat.\n\n203\n00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:33.740\nAnd I used my switches, actually let me\njust show you if you forgot real quick,\n\n204\n00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.980\nthe different switches\nthat are available to us.\n\n205\n00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.900\nNow remember these\nswitches can be stacked.\n\n206\n00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.530\nSo with a dash A we can display all\nthe connections and listening ports.\n\n207\n00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.520\nThe three that I'd like to stack\nto show you how it relates\n\n208\n00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.130\nspecifically to the process ID column\nwithin task manager, will be A.\n\n209\n00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.100\nAnd then it's going to be, N, and O.\n\n210\n00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.430\nSo let's take a look at those two here.\n\n211\n00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:01.070\nSo, N is gonna display addresses and\nimportant numbers, in numerical form.\n\n212\n00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.820\nAnd then O is gonna be\ndisplaying the owning process IT\n\n213\n00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.650\nthat's associated with each connection.\n\n214\n00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.000\nSo, let's go ahead and run that.\n\n215\n00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.110\nSo if I say netstat, and\nthen I do my -a, -o, -n.\n\n216\n00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:18.860\nOops, I've got to give it a space there.\n\n217\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.250\nReally doesn't matter the order.\n\n218\n00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.640\nWhoops.\n\n219\n00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.060\nAnd you've got to spell netstat right.\n\n220\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.280\nThat's one thing that you have got to do.\n&gt;&gt; That\n\n221\n00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:27.880\nhelps, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n222\n00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.450\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n223\n00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:32.980\nSo we'll go ahead and run that, so we can\nsee the different types of connections and\n\n224\n00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.970\nlisteners that we have available and\nthe states that they are in.\n\n225\n00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.510\nNow you'll notice in the far right hand\ncolumn here you do have those PIDs,\n\n226\n00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.330\nthose process IDs.\n\n227\n00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:46.750\nAnd a lot of information can\nbe established from looking.\n\n228\n00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.070\nI say established because\nI see that right there.\n\n229\n00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.060\nBut can be extracted from this format.\n\n230\n00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.130\nRemember TCP versus UDP.\n\n231\n00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:01.080\nTCP going to have the source and\ndestination where UDP is just that\n\n232\n00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.020\none way communications, so you are only\ngonna see that outbound IP there, but\n\n233\n00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:10.020\nit's pretty cool because if I see\ncommunication traveling over,\n\n234\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.640\nso these are going to be your sockets,\nreferencing those port numbers there.\n\n235\n00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.090\nAnd maybe there is a particular protocol\nthat you're not familiar, well,\n\n236\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.420\nthere probably are a lot that you're\nnot gonna know right off hand.\n\n237\n00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.260\nSome of them you will be familiar\nwith as you're scrolling.\n\n238\n00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.680\nEspecially pretty common\nones like our 443,\n\n239\n00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.590\nwhen you're looking at\nthings like HTTP and HTTPS.\n\n240\n00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:36.860\nThose are pretty straightforward, but\nsometimes what if your working on a system\n\n241\n00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:41.740\nand part of your company policy is\nthat you don't allow remoting or\n\n242\n00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.860\nany kind of remote management.\n\n243\n00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.950\nAnd you see like port 3389 being\nused on a particular socket here.\n\n244\n00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.710\nAnd then you can say okay\nwell look at this process ID.\n\n245\n00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.730\nAnd I'm going to close out of\nhere we're done with this.\n\n246\n00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.340\nBut then, over here I can sort these.\n\n247\n00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.570\nAnd these columns can all be\nsorted by clicking on them.\n\n248\n00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.200\nSo ascending or descending order there.\n\n249\n00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.980\nSo from whatever number that was and I\nforgot the number just from looking at it.\n\n250\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:16.250\nBut what you really can do Is correlate\nthat process ID, like, from netstat,\n\n251\n00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:20.890\nand it's actually a great way, I've\nactually found malware that way before, so\n\n252\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:25.960\nif malware is able to slide under\nthe radar with some kind of,\n\n253\n00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:32.550\nany kind of scanning software out there,\nthen you may be able to investigate\n\n254\n00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:36.510\na little bit more and get more information\nabout looking at things like that.\n\n255\n00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.270\nSo that's just, I don't know what\nkind of ways [LAUGH] I'm trying to\n\n256\n00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.720\nthink of like different ways to use\nit cuz there really are so many and\n\n257\n00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.790\nif your clever with it you can\nmake these tools work for you.\n\n258\n00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:50.860\nSo, that's what I wanna\nkind of throw out there.\n\n259\n00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:51.660\nWhat else here?\n\n260\n00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.780\nSo if i go ahead and take a look at\nthis again, if I go under file here,\n\n261\n00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.800\nso run a new task exit.\n\n262\n00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.640\nJust looking at the options up here so\nrunning a new task there, so for\n\n263\n00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.290\ninstance the first one\nthat pops up is CMD.\n\n264\n00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:10.500\nSo if I wanted to launch a command\nprompt okay go ahead and hit CMD.\n\n265\n00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:16.960\nSo you can put things like notepad.exc or\nwhatever and go from there.\n\n266\n00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.700\nBut thinking back to that first\nexample that like Mike coming over and\n\n267\n00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.340\nsaving someone I think the most\ncommon situation where\n\n268\n00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.800\nthat will happen is if you\nkinda have a pesky app,\n\n269\n00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:35.120\nan app with a leaky memory or an app\nthat is just really hogging your CPU.\n\n270\n00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.950\nSomething like that that has caused\nan instability in your system where,\n\n271\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.210\nlike he said, it's locked up,\n\n272\n00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.860\nyou're having a hard time even navigating\nthroughout the operating system.\n\n273\n00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.870\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\ngrab my Sentoo OneNote Tool.\n\n274\n00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.070\nI'm not using that right now.\n\n275\n00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:54.896\nSo what you could do is right-click\non that particular, actually, let me,\n\n276\n00:14:54.896 --> 00:15:02.120\nlet's launch notepad here and\nwe'll just go ahead and do it that way.\n\n277\n00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.100\nAll right, so I have notepad right.\n\n278\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.520\nI'm just gonna move it to the side and\n\n279\n00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.270\nlet's see if I can actually\nfind my notepad, right here.\n\n280\n00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:15.140\nAnd you'll notice currently my\nnotepad is at 0% utilization of\n\n281\n00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.800\nmy CPU which isn't anything, but\nthis is the kind of thing so\n\n282\n00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:25.270\nif that app that Mike was, maybe you're\nnot sure which app is the one that\n\n283\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:29.860\nis commandeering all of that CPU\nutilization, you don't know, so\n\n284\n00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:34.660\nby sorting in ascending order that's\nwhere these options would be helpful.\n\n285\n00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:40.717\nAnd then you could choose over\nthere to right-click and then.\n\n286\n00:15:40.717 --> 00:15:45.630\n[LAUGH] Hold on, hold on,\nlet me get to my real estate.\n\n287\n00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.516\nOkay, so now if I right click.\n\n288\n00:15:47.516 --> 00:15:51.098\nSo this my NotePad behind me, right,\nand then you just right click, and\n\n289\n00:15:51.098 --> 00:15:53.289\nit will go ahead and\nforce ending that task.\n\n290\n00:15:53.289 --> 00:16:00.003\nSo you will then be able to relinquish\nthat hostage CPU or memory or whatever.\n\n291\n00:16:00.003 --> 00:16:03.633\nTo go ahead and allow your system\nto try to get back on it's feet and\n\n292\n00:16:03.633 --> 00:16:05.740\nbecome stable again.\n\n293\n00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:11.110\nAnd it's really great because it can help\ntroubleshoot and isolate if the problems\n\n294\n00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.650\nreally just isolated to a particular\napplication or something else.\n\n295\n00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.740\nYou know what I mean?\n\n296\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.720\nOr if just contention, things like that.\n\n297\n00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.100\nSo a lot going on there.\n\n298\n00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.440\nTask manager has evolved over the years.\n\n299\n00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.348\nAnd I'm gonna go full screen again here,\n\n300\n00:16:29.348 --> 00:16:31.455\nso we can look at all\nthese different things.\n\n301\n00:16:31.455 --> 00:16:36.023\nLet's start from the back and\nI'll work my way forward.\n\n302\n00:16:36.023 --> 00:16:36.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n303\n00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.748\n&gt;&gt; Because that will\n\n304\n00:16:37.748 --> 00:16:40.080\nbe a segue into the next tool, services.\n\n305\n00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.299\nSo these is very similar,\nit's almost the exact same\n\n306\n00:16:44.299 --> 00:16:49.130\ninterface as our management console for\nour services.\n\n307\n00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.790\nSo if I wanna instead\nof typing services dot-\n\n308\n00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.860\n&gt;&gt; MSC.\n\n309\n00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.434\n&gt;&gt; Yes, MSC, there,\n\n310\n00:16:55.434 --> 00:16:57.850\nMicrosoft Services Console.\n\n311\n00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.576\nI could go ahead and\njust hit Open Services, and\n\n312\n00:17:01.576 --> 00:17:04.405\nthat'll launch up the actual MMC.\n\n313\n00:17:04.405 --> 00:17:08.826\nSo it's very similar interface though, and\n\n314\n00:17:08.826 --> 00:17:15.705\nthat can also help us really identify and\nwork with checking a status.\n\n315\n00:17:15.705 --> 00:17:18.634\nDo I need to start or stop and\nis this set to automatic for\n\n316\n00:17:18.634 --> 00:17:22.940\nsomething that needs to run as that\nsystem reboots, things like that.\n\n317\n00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:27.032\nAnd so the reason I think\nthat Microsoft may make or\n\n318\n00:17:27.032 --> 00:17:32.294\nadd clients management into\nthe Windows Admin Center is because\n\n319\n00:17:32.294 --> 00:17:38.930\nover the years I've seen this tool evolve\nand add these additional components.\n\n320\n00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.565\nSo I have a feeling that\nevolution will continue and\n\n321\n00:17:41.565 --> 00:17:43.290\nwe'll see something like that.\n\n322\n00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:49.400\nBut again, that's just speculation here,\na couple of more tabs, details, users.\n\n323\n00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.194\nCurrently I'm the only one logged on, but\n\n324\n00:17:52.194 --> 00:17:56.160\nif you had multiple people that\nhad logged into this system.\n\n325\n00:17:57.554 --> 00:18:02.860\nYou could click on that character\narrow and expand it out and\n\n326\n00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:07.400\nthen look on a per user basis there,\nstart up.\n\n327\n00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:13.648\nSo this is another interesting\nsection here, and again, instead\n\n328\n00:18:13.648 --> 00:18:19.025\nof going specifically to system 32.\n&gt;&gt; Msconfig, okay?\n\n329\n00:18:19.025 --> 00:18:20.751\n[LAUGH] There are so many.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n330\n00:18:20.751 --> 00:18:23.479\nI'm trying to keep them straight.\n\n331\n00:18:23.479 --> 00:18:25.373\nInstead of launching another tool,\n\n332\n00:18:25.373 --> 00:18:29.110\nyou see here that they're just kind\nof like packaged or bundled inside.\n\n333\n00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:33.382\nSo it's pretty helpful there\nif you wanted to go ahead and\n\n334\n00:18:33.382 --> 00:18:38.633\nmodify any kind of, maybe I find\nevery time I have a Dropbox actually,\n\n335\n00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:40.876\nlet's be real here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n336\n00:18:40.876 --> 00:18:42.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And you guys will see this as\n\n337\n00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.657\nwe're looking through my logs, I'm gonna\nair all my dirty laundry in this show.\n\n338\n00:18:46.657 --> 00:18:47.930\nYeah, well, [LAUGH] Slack.\n\n339\n00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.420\nSlack gives me problems sometimes, okay?\n\n340\n00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.724\nSo how about let's just go ahead,\n\n341\n00:18:54.724 --> 00:18:59.890\nthis is updating an EXE that's\nassociated with my Slack application.\n\n342\n00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:04.802\nBut maybe we go ahead and change this, and\nwe disable this on startup there because I\n\n343\n00:19:04.802 --> 00:19:08.280\ndon't want to deal with it anymore.\n&gt;&gt; I see in that’s, what is it,\n\n344\n00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.255\nthe startup impact, it says high, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n345\n00:19:10.255 --> 00:19:11.001\n&gt;&gt; Which means,\n\n346\n00:19:11.001 --> 00:19:14.300\nthis is an application that every\ntime you start your machine,\n\n347\n00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.550\nit’s set to start automatically.\n\n348\n00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.835\nAnd it’s impacting how\nlong it takes to start.\n\n349\n00:19:18.835 --> 00:19:21.205\nThat reason you’re sitting\nthere waiting to log in,\n\n350\n00:19:21.205 --> 00:19:24.800\nis because applications like this have\na high impact on the startup time.\n\n351\n00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.662\nSo if you don’t need it to be running\nas soon as you get onto your system,\n\n352\n00:19:27.662 --> 00:19:29.340\ndisable it, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n353\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.330\n&gt;&gt; And that way it's not starting\n\n354\n00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.132\nautomatically and\nyou can get into your system faster.\n\n355\n00:19:32.132 --> 00:19:34.156\nI was just checking mine.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n356\n00:19:34.156 --> 00:19:36.134\n&gt;&gt; And mine's already disabled.\n\n357\n00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:36.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good for you.\n\n358\n00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:40.183\n&gt;&gt; Slack is one that, yeah, unfortunately.\n\n359\n00:19:40.183 --> 00:19:40.773\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n360\n00:19:40.773 --> 00:19:45.042\nthat's another thing if you're\nexperiencing-which nowadays having slow\n\n361\n00:19:45.042 --> 00:19:49.000\nboot time this is not as big of\nan issue as it was in the past.\n\n362\n00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.920\nBut man, go ahead and\nstreamline this list, especially in Skype.\n\n363\n00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.974\nNo, that one's already disabled.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n364\n00:19:54.974 --> 00:19:56.760\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why Slack wasn't.\n\n365\n00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.965\n&gt;&gt; I have several download assistants and\n\n366\n00:19:58.965 --> 00:20:02.374\nupdate assistants for\ncertain applications, Logitech and\n\n367\n00:20:02.374 --> 00:20:04.280\nsome other ones.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.674\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it's great that it starts up\n\n369\n00:20:05.674 --> 00:20:08.420\nautomatically and it's checking to\nsee if there's any new drivers.\n\n370\n00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.990\nBut do I really need it running\nall the time automatically?\n\n371\n00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.120\nSee if there's a new driver for\nmy mouse, right?\n\n372\n00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.460\nAnd it has a high impact\non my startup performance.\n\n373\n00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.042\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n374\n00:20:16.042 --> 00:20:18.197\n&gt;&gt; So I'm okay running that manually,\n\n375\n00:20:18.197 --> 00:20:20.106\ncome in here and disable it.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n376\n00:20:20.106 --> 00:20:25.080\na lot of those like UI options that we\nsaw on the other tab apply here as well.\n\n377\n00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.928\nSo if I wanted to really examine\nmy high impact startup items,\n\n378\n00:20:28.928 --> 00:20:33.480\nthen I would go ahead and hit that so\nI could sort accordingly.\n\n379\n00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.994\nAll right, App History, so\nwe can take a look at any kind of\n\n380\n00:20:37.994 --> 00:20:42.897\napps that I do have installed and\nlook at network utilization.\n\n381\n00:20:42.897 --> 00:20:47.890\nIf I'm running over and this is\nimportant because my metered network.\n\n382\n00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:52.243\nSo if I have a metered connection\nestablish under my Ethernet settings and\n\n383\n00:20:52.243 --> 00:20:54.290\nthe system will be able to detect.\n\n384\n00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:58.000\nOkay, so maybe the reason\nyour bill is $500 this month\n\n385\n00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.700\nCherokee is because this application\nis sucking up all your bandwidth.\n\n386\n00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:08.385\nSo these are good ways to really be able\nto investigate these types of things,\n\n387\n00:21:08.385 --> 00:21:09.525\ntile updates.\n\n388\n00:21:09.525 --> 00:21:14.592\nSo maybe I find that there's a particular\nlife tile that's using a heck\n\n389\n00:21:14.592 --> 00:21:19.575\nof a lot of bandwidth or even just\nprocessing power of my system here but\n\n390\n00:21:19.575 --> 00:21:22.730\nhere you do see utilizing in bandwidth.\n\n391\n00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:24.350\nThere are other ways we can\nadd additional counters.\n\n392\n00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:29.200\nWe'll look at from, CPU memory,\neverything literally.\n\n393\n00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.673\nBut I can go ahead and disable that,\nremove that tile from my Start menu, or\n\n394\n00:21:33.673 --> 00:21:37.305\nwhatever, to really think about\nperformance of my system.\n\n395\n00:21:37.305 --> 00:21:39.734\nThat's what it's about.\n\n396\n00:21:39.734 --> 00:21:44.611\nAll right, also this hyperlink or\nthis link here to go ahead and\n\n397\n00:21:44.611 --> 00:21:46.460\ndelete usage history.\n\n398\n00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:51.384\nSomething I will note, and this will\napply to all the tools that we do take\n\n399\n00:21:51.384 --> 00:21:55.581\na look at, whenever we are using\na tool to monitor our system,\n\n400\n00:21:55.581 --> 00:21:58.840\nit's actually using system resources, too.\n\n401\n00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.067\nIt's kind of like cognitive thinking,\nthinking about thinking.\n\n402\n00:22:01.067 --> 00:22:04.750\nWell, we're [LAUGH] I don't\neven know how to explain it.\n\n403\n00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:07.792\nBut we're using system\nresources as we're viewing\n\n404\n00:22:07.792 --> 00:22:11.670\nwhat resources are using system resources,\nif that makes sense.\n\n405\n00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:17.420\nSo some of these things that we'll\nbe looking at do take up storage.\n\n406\n00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.985\nDo require CPU processing power.\n\n407\n00:22:18.985 --> 00:22:20.960\nDo require memory.\n\n408\n00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.750\nSo you might want to, and I'll try\nto remind you as we're going along.\n\n409\n00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.880\nCertain things maybe more\nimpactful than others.\n\n410\n00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.896\nSo you might wanna clear and purge some\ninformation and logs from time to time\n\n411\n00:22:31.896 --> 00:22:34.222\nlike you would with any kind of log baser.\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n412\n00:22:34.222 --> 00:22:38.399\nmaybe you've reconfigured one of these\napps to hopefully use less resources, and\n\n413\n00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:40.200\nyou wanna see if it worked, right?\n\n414\n00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.106\nSo let me start with a clean slate and\nmonitor those apps again to see if that\n\n415\n00:22:44.106 --> 00:22:48.517\nmade any difference in my performance.\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's really a great point,\n\n416\n00:22:48.517 --> 00:22:50.916\nMike, because if you think about this,\n\n417\n00:22:50.916 --> 00:22:55.440\na lot of these tools can be extremely\nbeneficial to establish baselines.\n\n418\n00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.126\nAnd if you are have worked in IT for\nany capacity or base lines can be used\n\n419\n00:22:59.126 --> 00:23:02.769\nin a lot of different fields but\nthey're extremely important in IT.\n\n420\n00:23:02.769 --> 00:23:08.294\nBecause if I know how a system works on a\nday to day when the system is healthy and\n\n421\n00:23:08.294 --> 00:23:09.610\ndoing well.\n\n422\n00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.547\nThen any anomalies or\nabnormalities within a baseline,\n\n423\n00:23:13.547 --> 00:23:18.303\ncan easily helped me come to a solution\nfinding a root cause quicker,\n\n424\n00:23:18.303 --> 00:23:22.731\nthus making me a better system\nnetwork whatever something, and\n\n425\n00:23:22.731 --> 00:23:25.370\na better employee all the way around.\n\n426\n00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:29.729\nSo keep that in mind,\ngreat point for baselines as well.\n\n427\n00:23:29.729 --> 00:23:33.720\nOkay, I'm trying to think here.\n\n428\n00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.656\nOkay, this is kind of a segue, which is\ngood because I do see looking at our time\n\n429\n00:23:37.656 --> 00:23:40.234\nwe're getting there closer\nto the end of the show.\n\n430\n00:23:40.234 --> 00:23:43.950\nBut this second tab here\nis where I want it to end.\n\n431\n00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.242\nThis is gonna be our\nperformance options here.\n\n432\n00:23:46.242 --> 00:23:51.203\nI really think that this is\na good clean UI, easy to look at,\n\n433\n00:23:51.203 --> 00:23:55.190\neasy to understand,\nthey've color coded it.\n\n434\n00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.687\nThey have put it right here inside of the\ntask manager, well, it's been there for\n\n435\n00:23:59.687 --> 00:24:02.770\nawhile but it was the green and black.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n436\n00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.218\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't as pretty in the past.\n\n437\n00:24:04.218 --> 00:24:09.950\nBut it's an easy way to look at\nsystem resources at a glance, right?\n\n438\n00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.586\nCPU, go ahead and click on these,\n\n439\n00:24:11.586 --> 00:24:14.360\nthis isn't interactive screen\nthat we're seeing here.\n\n440\n00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:19.120\nWe can look at disk utilization for\nthose reads and writes.\n\n441\n00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.223\nOur network statistics here.\n\n442\n00:24:21.223 --> 00:24:24.872\nI mean just scrolling\nthrough the list here,\n\n443\n00:24:24.872 --> 00:24:29.673\nit's a really nice way to get\na clear real-time snapshot or\n\n444\n00:24:29.673 --> 00:24:33.290\nidea about how this system is behaving.\n\n445\n00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:38.563\nYou have the option to go ahead and\nsee fewer details, if you just\n\n446\n00:24:38.563 --> 00:24:44.436\nwant maybe a lot of little windows open,\nso you can see things quickly.\n\n447\n00:24:44.436 --> 00:24:50.092\nAlso, talking about a number of\nways to get to certain utilities,\n\n448\n00:24:50.092 --> 00:24:56.790\nwe're gonna be talking about this\nparticular tool a little bit later.\n\n449\n00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:01.157\nIt's called Resource Monitor, and\nI just wanna point out that, like I said,\n\n450\n00:25:01.157 --> 00:25:04.873\nthere are a lot of different ways\nto go ahead and get to those tools.\n\n451\n00:25:04.873 --> 00:25:09.206\nAnd you'll find them kinda scattered like\nlittle hidden gems through out some of\n\n452\n00:25:09.206 --> 00:25:10.920\nthese other tools as well.\n\n453\n00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:16.470\nAnd a lot of these tools really\npiggy back atop each other and\n\n454\n00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:21.025\nyou'll find a lot of\noverlapping information.\n\n455\n00:25:21.025 --> 00:25:24.150\nAnd again, I think that may change\nin the future, but who knows?\n\n456\n00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:27.410\nFor now you just need to take\nthe time to go through the tools and\n\n457\n00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.810\nthen you can decide which ones\nare gonna be working best for you.\n\n458\n00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:34.305\nBut I think, Mike,\nthis is a good place to pause, so\n\n459\n00:25:34.305 --> 00:25:38.692\nthat we can start with a whole\nbrand new tool, and we'll move on.\n\n460\n00:25:38.692 --> 00:25:40.318\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good to me, Cherokee,\n\n461\n00:25:40.318 --> 00:25:41.470\nwe appreciate that.\n\n462\n00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.041\nI hope every body out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n463\n00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:46.320\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI have been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n464\n00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:46.890\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n465\n00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:53.566\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n466\n00:25:53.566 --> 00:25:54.897\n[MUSIC]\n\n467\n00:25:54.897 --> 00:25:58.033\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

for\n\n8\n00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.780\nthat 70-690 exam.\n\n9\n00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.400\nIn this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at system and data recovery.\n\n10\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.001\nWith us today is none other than\nMiss Cherokee Boose, welcome, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:29.813\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Mike,\n\n12\n00:00:29.813 --> 00:00:31.490\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good, so,\n\n13\n00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.814\ngotta recover our data and our systems?\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes, stuff happens, right?\n\n14\n00:00:35.814 --> 00:00:38.499\nThey have a bumper sticker for\nthat, I believe, right?\n\n15\n00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:39.292\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:41.536\n&gt;&gt; What do we do when that stuff happens?\n\n17\n00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:43.658\n&gt;&gt; We pray, we cross our fingers,\n\n18\n00:00:43.658 --> 00:00:45.709\nwe stick our head in the stand.\n\n19\n00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:48.804\nNo, if we know what to do,\nif we know the right tools to use-\n\n20\n00:00:48.804 --> 00:00:50.585\n&gt;&gt; Then we don't have to panic, right?\n\n21\n00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:52.940\nOkay cool, so\nthat's what we're gonna be talking about.\n\n22\n00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.880\nNot just in this show, but\nin the subsequent shows.\n\n23\n00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.800\nBecause there are a lot of different\noptions that we have available to us.\n\n24\n00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.950\n\"And we'll take a look at why and\n\n25\n00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.760\nwhen we would choose one of\nthose options over another.\n\n26\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.820\nSo let's take a look at my screen,\nwhat I've done here is, now this is not\n\n27\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.128\nevery single objective that we'll be\ntalking about in the next few shows here.\n\n28\n00:01:13.128 --> 00:01:15.422\nSo I'm gonna follow\nMicrosoft's objectives, but\n\n29\n00:01:15.422 --> 00:01:18.298\nI also found this cool link that\nI've provided in the show notes.\n\n30\n00:01:18.298 --> 00:01:20.957\nAnd I'll zoom in a little bit so\nyou guys can see what this is.\n\n31\n00:01:20.957 --> 00:01:27.202\nWe're taking a look at different\nproblems on the left-hand column here.\n\n32\n00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:29.500\nAnd then the solution on\nthe right-hand column.\n\n33\n00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.670\nAnd maybe if we go full screen for\njust a moment so\n\n34\n00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.520\nwe can take a look at some of these.\n\n35\n00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.270\nSo this is what we'll be looking at\non the right-hand side over here.\n\n36\n00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.760\nSo we're gonna start taking a look\nat something called restore points.\n\n37\n00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.886\nBut I think this link is pretty cool,\nespecially for studying purposes, so\n\n38\n00:01:45.886 --> 00:01:48.088\nyou can create flash cards or whatever.\n\n39\n00:01:48.088 --> 00:01:51.303\nWe'll also talk about these reasons as to\nwhy you would choose one over the other,\n\n40\n00:01:51.303 --> 00:01:52.010\nbut look at this.\n\n41\n00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.286\nSo let's say my problem is that\nmy PC isn't working well, and\n\n42\n00:01:55.286 --> 00:01:58.821\nI know that I've recently installed\nan app, driver, or update.\n\n43\n00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:03.158\nWell, that's fine if I have\nenabled restore points.\n\n44\n00:02:03.158 --> 00:02:08.587\nThere are little caveats to each one\nof these options that if I don't know,\n\n45\n00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:12.911\nI may end up hosed or\nin a situation that might invoke panic.\n\n46\n00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:16.982\nBecause it's a bad thing whenever\nsomething already happens,\n\n47\n00:02:16.982 --> 00:02:21.135\na problem already occurs,\nwe've gotta be more proactive here.\n\n48\n00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:24.474\nSo knowing the caveats is what we're\ngonna talk about, and set you up for\n\n49\n00:02:24.474 --> 00:02:25.345\nsuccess here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n50\n00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.445\nabsolutely, these are test questions.\n\n51\n00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:29.155\nObviously, they ask you things like this.\n\n52\n00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:32.663\nIf you're in this scenario,\nwhat would be the best tool to use?\n\n53\n00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:35.618\nAnd understanding what that is can\nget you a few points on the exam.\n\n54\n00:02:35.618 --> 00:02:36.444\n&gt;&gt; And obviously,\n\n55\n00:02:36.444 --> 00:02:38.155\nit's a good thing to understand,\n\n56\n00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:41.113\nbecause look at how many options\nwe do have available to us.\n\n57\n00:02:41.113 --> 00:02:45.280\nSo I mean, there could be quite a few test\nquestions from this particular section,\n\n58\n00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.670\nbecause there are a lot\nof things to cover here.\n\n59\n00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.888\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n60\n00:02:48.888 --> 00:02:52.594\nWe are gonna be, like I said, going\nthrough this list, but we might as well go\n\n61\n00:02:52.594 --> 00:02:56.149\nahead and start with restore points,\nsince we're right there anyways.\n\n62\n00:02:56.149 --> 00:03:00.198\nSo let me just get on into a virtual\nmachine that I have set up for us.\n\n63\n00:03:01.998 --> 00:03:07.140\nAll right, so what I've done here\nis just created a dummy file.\n\n64\n00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.508\nI'm gonna right click and\nselect Properties.\n\n65\n00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:13.710\nI do wanna kind of bring to your\nattention something that will segue\n\n66\n00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.874\ninto another option that\nwe have available to us.\n\n67\n00:03:16.874 --> 00:03:22.050\nSo if by default here, I go ahead and\ntake a look at these properties here.\n\n68\n00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.961\nAnd I'll zoom in so you guys can see that.\n\n69\n00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:28.034\nOn the far tab,\nI have a previous versions tab.\n\n70\n00:03:28.034 --> 00:03:32.627\nIf I go ahead and select that,\nnow what that means is, and\n\n71\n00:03:32.627 --> 00:03:37.223\nI have created this document,\nmade a modification, and\n\n72\n00:03:37.223 --> 00:03:42.160\nthen saved over top of\nthe preexisting original file.\n\n73\n00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.723\nHowever, I don't have the option here\nto revert back to a previous version.\n\n74\n00:03:46.723 --> 00:03:51.388\nAnd that's simply because I haven't\nenabled one of the following,\n\n75\n00:03:51.388 --> 00:03:54.134\neither file history or restore points.\n\n76\n00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:58.562\nSo if I had, then that would allow VSS,\nvolume shadow service,\n\n77\n00:03:58.562 --> 00:04:03.400\nto go ahead and also enumerate\nthe different versions here within this\n\n78\n00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.560\nprevious versions tab under\nthe properties section of this file.\n\n79\n00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.434\nSo we'll take a look at how\nto set up restore points.\n\n80\n00:04:10.434 --> 00:04:16.108\nWe'll also get into file history,\nbut just one thing at a time here.\n\n81\n00:04:16.108 --> 00:04:19.812\nOkay, restore points, well,\nwhat is a restore point?\n\n82\n00:04:19.812 --> 00:04:23.384\nRestore points are going to\nbe moments in time, okay,\n\n83\n00:04:23.384 --> 00:04:26.656\n[LAUGH] sounds like a Hallmark movie or\nsomething.\n\n84\n00:04:26.656 --> 00:04:29.680\n[LAUGH] But it's kind of interesting\nif you think about the name.\n\n85\n00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.271\nBecause if you are versed or are studying,\nhave worked with anything on\n\n86\n00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:38.954\nthe server side, you'll know that\nthe terminology differs slightly.\n\n87\n00:04:38.954 --> 00:04:43.949\nSo you'll hear either the term\ncheckpoints or snapshots, server-side.\n\n88\n00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:50.132\nBut here, check, [LAUGH] now I'm\nall mixed up, I can't even talk.\n\n89\n00:04:50.132 --> 00:04:53.950\nBut here on the client side,\nwe call them restore points.\n\n90\n00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.789\nOkay, so if you can keep it straight,\n\n91\n00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.980\nthen you're doing better than I am at this\npoint, all right, so that's what it is.\n\n92\n00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.160\nAnd I can create, it's basically\nadditional copies of the operating system.\n\n93\n00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.237\nSo I'm taking a photo,\na snapshot, if you will,\n\n94\n00:05:10.237 --> 00:05:14.812\nof my files and\nsettings of that moment in time of the OS.\n\n95\n00:05:14.812 --> 00:05:18.594\nRight, so what I'm gonna do,\nI think the easiest place to go ahead and\n\n96\n00:05:18.594 --> 00:05:22.140\nlaunch this would be just to\ntype it in to the search bar.\n\n97\n00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.300\nAnd you can type in, create a restore\npoint, and you see that pop up right here.\n\n98\n00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.993\nNow this will launch a window,\nbut right from the beginning,\n\n99\n00:05:29.993 --> 00:05:32.986\nI can't just go ahead and\ncreate a restore point.\n\n100\n00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:36.764\nAnd let me see if my system's just slow or\n\n101\n00:05:36.764 --> 00:05:42.337\nif I didn't really left-click there,\nthere we go [LAUGH].\n\n102\n00:05:42.337 --> 00:05:44.798\nOkay, so let's take a look at this.\n\n103\n00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:51.834\nNumber one, if I go and try to create\nright now, well, I can't, it's grayed out.\n\n104\n00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:56.190\nSo like I said, there is a little bit of\nplanning that you have to do to really\n\n105\n00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.270\nrely on some of these options.\n\n106\n00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.490\nSo what we need to do first is\nselect this Configure option.\n\n107\n00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.820\nAnd then from there, I need to\nactually turn on system protection.\n\n108\n00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.270\nSo by switching and\nchanging this radio button,\n\n109\n00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.630\nthat will enable me to go ahead and\nconfigure those checkpoints.\n\n110\n00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.254\nNow, like I said,\nwe're taking these photos, if you will,\n\n111\n00:06:18.254 --> 00:06:21.056\nof the operating system\nat a moment in time.\n\n112\n00:06:21.056 --> 00:06:24.743\nBut if I create one restore point,\ntwo restore point,\n\n113\n00:06:24.743 --> 00:06:29.395\nthree restore point, what if I start\nbogging down my system because I\n\n114\n00:06:29.395 --> 00:06:32.861\ndon't have enough storage\nspace in my hard drive?\n\n115\n00:06:32.861 --> 00:06:35.853\nWell, typically with\nthe cost to storage ratio,\n\n116\n00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:39.641\nit's not a huge problem these days,\nbut it could be a problem.\n\n117\n00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:45.570\nRight, so this little slider down here\nwill allow me to go ahead and cap off.\n\n118\n00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.710\nAnd you can see percentage-wise according\nto how much storage this system has,\n\n119\n00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.700\nand then it will also go ahead and\nwrite it out in gigabytes there.\n\n120\n00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.539\nAny kind of upper control limit there,\nI can set that.\n\n121\n00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:01.001\n&gt;&gt; I like double checking that,\n\n122\n00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:04.623\nI have seen a few times where I've\nenabled restore points on a system, and\n\n123\n00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:06.620\nsomehow that slider is all the way over.\n\n124\n00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:13.642\nAnd if you've got a large drive and\nit's using 50% of your two-terabyte drive.\n\n125\n00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:18.663\nDo you want a terabyte worth of\nrestore points, probably not.\n\n126\n00:07:18.663 --> 00:07:22.021\nSo do make sure you go back and check\nthat, if you're trying to figure out why\n\n127\n00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:25.063\nyour drive space is all used up,\nand you don't have that many files,\n\n128\n00:07:25.063 --> 00:07:27.024\nthis is a place to check.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is, and\n\n129\n00:07:27.024 --> 00:07:30.460\nthis is also the place here to go ahead\nand delete out those store points.\n\n130\n00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.750\nBecause like Mike says, if he was checking\non a system that had quite a bit, or\n\n131\n00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.230\ntoo many, or\nhe was noticing system performance issues.\n\n132\n00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.300\nThen we could go through and, as long as\nyour system was in a good healthy state,\n\n133\n00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.030\nand that's another thing.\n\n134\n00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.297\nYou've gotta think about,\nwhen you're taking this little picture,\n\n135\n00:07:46.297 --> 00:07:48.312\nthis moment in time for\nyour restore point,\n\n136\n00:07:48.312 --> 00:07:51.051\nyou don't wanna have that system\nbe unhealthy at the time.\n\n137\n00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:55.788\nBecause you have to think about,\nthis is something that I wanna use\n\n138\n00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:59.778\nas my backup plan, or\nrevert back to if things go wrong.\n\n139\n00:07:59.778 --> 00:08:03.337\nRestore points are good for\nsystem configuration issues.\n\n140\n00:08:03.337 --> 00:08:05.210\nSo you just wanna keep that in mind.\n\n141\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:11.420\nThe main thing is understanding\na point in time when this\n\n142\n00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.330\nissue may have occurred when you\nstart noticing those problems.\n\n143\n00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:22.600\nIf you have no clue and your end user\ncan't provide any kind of help as to\n\n144\n00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.400\nwhen they started noticing this problem,\nthis might not be the best option for you.\n\n145\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.840\nBecause you don't know if you're\ngoing to revert to a previous snatch,\n\n146\n00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.575\nor check, restore point.\n\n147\n00:08:30.575 --> 00:08:34.610\n[LAUGH] They used to be called,\nI don't know, they've changed it.\n\n148\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.600\nThey used to be called\nsnapshot server side.\n\n149\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.070\nThen they changed\nthe name to check points.\n\n150\n00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.183\nAnd now we're here in our restore.\n&gt;&gt; Restore points.\n\n151\n00:08:42.183 --> 00:08:42.945\n&gt;&gt; Restore points.\n\n152\n00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:44.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And this is, too,\n\n153\n00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.994\nwhere we can start combining some of\nthe tools we use cuz if you're not\n\n154\n00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:49.531\nsure what restore point to go to,\nyou could go check out something like\n\n155\n00:08:49.531 --> 00:08:51.360\nthe reliability monitoring.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n156\n00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.300\n&gt;&gt; Look, there's where those\n\n157\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.062\nerrors started.\n\n158\n00:08:53.062 --> 00:08:56.190\nLet me see if I have a restore\npoint that's prior to that date.\n\n159\n00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.066\nAnd maybe I can use that one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\n\n160\n00:08:58.066 --> 00:09:01.238\nwe really have talked about a lot\nof different tools that you have at\n\n161\n00:09:01.238 --> 00:09:05.105\nyour disposal built into the operating\nsystem to provide that historical data.\n\n162\n00:09:05.105 --> 00:09:09.537\nIf you haven't seen those shows or\naren't sure what we're talking about,\n\n163\n00:09:09.537 --> 00:09:11.280\ngo ahead and check those out.\n\n164\n00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.410\nWe're looking at monitoring tools\nthat we have available to us.\n\n165\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.570\nLet's go back into the system here,\n\n166\n00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.150\nand one thing I do wanna\nchange before we get started.\n\n167\n00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.060\nI do wanna bump up this max usage\na little bit, just slightly here.\n\n168\n00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.860\nWe should be good with seven gigs.\n\n169\n00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.630\nI really don't plan on creating any other\nrestore points right now on this system.\n\n170\n00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.690\nBut the reason being is the way that\nthe operating system works is on that\n\n171\n00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.490\nfirst in, first out type basis.\n\n172\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.800\nAnd with that small of allocation for\n\n173\n00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:47.810\nmy upper control limit, I'd only be able\nto have like one restore point there.\n\n174\n00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.900\nNow this is kind of interesting.\n\n175\n00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.030\nIf you have unlimited amounts of storage,\n\n176\n00:09:54.030 --> 00:10:01.490\nthere's actually a theoretical limit\nin the software of 64 previous versions\n\n177\n00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.628\nwhen we're talking versioning so under\nour file versioning and stuff like that.\n\n178\n00:10:04.628 --> 00:10:09.700\nNow as Microsoft's evolving and\nhaving all these updates, now they might\n\n179\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.190\nbe changing that, but for a very, very\nlong long time, it's always been that way.\n\n180\n00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:19.185\nAnd then it's the oldest is going to get\npushed out to create a newer version.\n\n181\n00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:21.760\nWe're talking about those\ndifferent versions.\n\n182\n00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.620\nAll right, so we're gonna hit OK.\n\n183\n00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:28.190\nAnd from here,\nthis part's pretty simple to go ahead and\n\n184\n00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.640\ncreate our restore points here.\n\n185\n00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.470\nSo we'll go ahead and hit Create.\n\n186\n00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.770\nThe name's pretty important.\n\n187\n00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:38.710\nYou wanna select something that will\nhelp indicate as to when it was created.\n\n188\n00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:43.003\nOf course,\nyou'll be able to see the time and date,\n\n189\n00:10:43.003 --> 00:10:47.201\nbut maybe something like\npre-software install or\n\n190\n00:10:47.201 --> 00:10:52.192\nwhatever you wanna go ahead and\nhave something noted there.\n\n191\n00:10:52.192 --> 00:10:54.180\nWe'll go ahead and hit that.\n\n192\n00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.740\nDoesn't take too long to\ncreate a restore point, again,\n\n193\n00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.690\ndepending on the size of your system,\nhow many files you have.\n\n194\n00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.080\nI don't have a lot going on here, so\nthis one shouldn't take very long.\n\n195\n00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.040\nWe'll hit Close.\n\n196\n00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.610\nAnd currently I have,\nwe'll take a look here under our C drive.\n\n197\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.930\nIf I wanted to go through and go back and\nrevert to a previous restore point,\n\n198\n00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:14.980\nlet's check that out here.\n\n199\n00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:20.530\nSo I'd select System Restore and launch\nthis little wizard, and then I would\n\n200\n00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.420\nbe displayed, or I can see any restore\npoints that I have listed here.\n\n201\n00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.930\nSo I only have that one\nthat we just created.\n\n202\n00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.780\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ngo through with this wizard.\n\n203\n00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.930\nI also wanna show you another\nway that we could go ahead and\n\n204\n00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:39.190\ninitiate a recovery option\nhere with System Restore.\n\n205\n00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:44.010\nBut I'm gonna hit Cancel for\nnow because the other way to go into our\n\n206\n00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:49.390\ntroubleshooting section, if you will,\nis going to involve a restart.\n\n207\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.400\nAnd once we're already in there,\n\n208\n00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.720\nMicrosoft kind of groups a lot\nof these tools together.\n\n209\n00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.640\nSo I wanna show you a few other things.\n\n210\n00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.820\nBut, like I said, there is some\nsetup work that needs to be done.\n\n211\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:04.830\nSo I do wanna show you how to create\na backup image or backup drive,\n\n212\n00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.430\nrecovery drive real quick so\nthat we can get that in the works for\n\n213\n00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.610\nwhen we go into our troubleshooting and\nperform that reset.\n\n214\n00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.020\nSo let's also take a look\nat my screen here.\n\n215\n00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.363\nAnd what I'm going to do is\nI'm going to go ahead and\n\n216\n00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:21.697\nstart typing here for recovery drive.\n\n217\n00:12:21.697 --> 00:12:26.270\nOops, all right, so\nwe'll go ahead and launch that.\n\n218\n00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:30.199\nAnd yes,\nwe'll allow recovery drives here to occur.\n\n219\n00:12:34.557 --> 00:12:36.005\nI say that.\n\n220\n00:12:39.753 --> 00:12:40.921\nWe'll try to be patient, okay.\n\n221\n00:12:40.921 --> 00:12:45.348\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n222\n00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:46.824\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n223\n00:12:46.824 --> 00:12:48.460\nhere we have the option to go ahead and\ncreate a recovery drive.\n\n224\n00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.990\nI've already created one on this system,\nso that when we get into the restart or\n\n225\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.810\nthe troubleshooting options, you guys can\nsee what it looks like to go ahead and\n\n226\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.320\nrevert back there.\n\n227\n00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.670\nBut it's actually a pretty\nsimple process here.\n\n228\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:07.200\nSo in the past, whenever you purchased\nyour operating system on a CD or\n\n229\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.440\nDVD, or even floppies, you could\nthen take that installation media\n\n230\n00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:18.020\nto perform recovery functions\nif the system is pretty hosed.\n\n231\n00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.900\nNow because our operating systems aren't\nshipped with those discs, CDs, and\n\n232\n00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:28.060\nreally hopefully not floppies, well,\nwhat do we do in that situation?\n\n233\n00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.300\nWell, they've given us\nan option to go ahead and\n\n234\n00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.160\ngenerate or\ncreate a recovery drive ourselves.\n\n235\n00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.588\nSo that's what this is.\n\n236\n00:13:35.588 --> 00:13:41.301\nYou can walk through the system, so\nbackup system files to the recovery drive,\n\n237\n00:13:41.301 --> 00:13:45.920\ndrive being kind of it gives you\noptions with that term, right?\n\n238\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.010\nSo we can put it to a CD, DVD.\n\n239\n00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.317\nWe can create it,\nback it up to an actual drive,\n\n240\n00:13:51.317 --> 00:13:55.810\nlike a drive that's been formatted\nas a volume network shares.\n\n241\n00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.820\nWe have some options there.\n\n242\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:58.930\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n243\n00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:02.740\nhit Cancel, because essentially it will\njust take a little while to go ahead and\n\n244\n00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.412\ncopy all your files, and\nthat's what's happening here.\n\n245\n00:14:05.412 --> 00:14:11.800\nAll right, so I did say I already\nhave a recovery drive created.\n\n246\n00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.770\nHow do I go ahead and\naccess that information?\n\n247\n00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.900\nWell, we need to perform a restart.\n\n248\n00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.740\nNow, also in the past when you would\nget into your advanced setup options,\n\n249\n00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.510\nyou'd have to hit a function key,\n\n250\n00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:28.540\nsometimes different manufacturers\nwould require a combo of keys.\n\n251\n00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.080\nOperating systems boot so fast these days,\nat least Windows operating systems,\n\n252\n00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.660\nthat we don't have that time really to\nhold down those key combinations and\n\n253\n00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.980\nwait for that pre-boot execution\nto go ahead and occur.\n\n254\n00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.510\nSo one thing that I find is the easiest\nway would be to go ahead and\n\n255\n00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.328\nhold down your Shift key, right?\n\n256\n00:14:47.328 --> 00:14:54.160\nAnd then right-click on the Windows icon,\nor the Start option there.\n\n257\n00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.084\nAnd then go ahead and restart while\nstill holding down that Shift key.\n\n258\n00:14:59.084 --> 00:15:00.840\nAnd you can let go.\n\n259\n00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.063\nYou don't have to hold it forever.\n\n260\n00:15:04.063 --> 00:15:09.800\nBut it will go ahead and allow us to\nboot into our recovery environment here.\n\n261\n00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.440\nSo this is something that when you're\nlooking at this particular domain for\n\n262\n00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.440\nthe exam, you need to go through\nall of these options here and\n\n263\n00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.540\nmake sure you understand them.\n\n264\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.348\nAnd also I will kinda flip back and\nmaybe if I remember to show you that chart\n\n265\n00:15:23.348 --> 00:15:27.770\nagain, you can see how it correlates\nbecause just getting in here,\n\n266\n00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.046\nit's a pretty simple-looking\nuser interface.\n\n267\n00:15:31.046 --> 00:15:34.404\nBut there are additional options that\nwe can take a look at, that might get\n\n268\n00:15:34.404 --> 00:15:37.670\na little confusing if you don't know\nexactly what each one of those do.\n\n269\n00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.360\nSo I have the ability to go ahead and\njust X and continue to Windows 10,\n\n270\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.030\nthat's not what we want.\n\n271\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.510\nIf I had a device, like a USB drive,\n\n272\n00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:51.980\nnetwork connection, how do I wanna boot,\nright, or Windows recovery DVD.\n\n273\n00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.690\nSo of course, I would have to have\nalready created one of those.\n\n274\n00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:55.824\nSo keep in mind,\n\n275\n00:15:55.824 --> 00:16:01.510\nthe scenario based type situations where\nyou might get asked something like that.\n\n276\n00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.353\nWhat we're gonna do is\nselect Troubleshoot.\n\n277\n00:16:04.353 --> 00:16:09.720\nNow, resetting this is also an option\nthat I have available to me.\n\n278\n00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.380\nSo, let's take a look at that actually.\n\n279\n00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:17.551\nWhen I go to Reset, there are two options\nthat I have available, all right?\n\n280\n00:16:17.551 --> 00:16:22.535\nI can reset the PC, Keep my files\nwill remove apps and settings, but\n\n281\n00:16:22.535 --> 00:16:25.200\nkeeps your personal files.\n\n282\n00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.390\nSo think about that, removing apps and\n\n283\n00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:33.900\nsettings, so\nremoving any software and settings.\n\n284\n00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:38.690\nThis will eliminate a lot of problems\nthat you might feel are associated or\n\n285\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:43.980\nhave evidence based on some of those\ntools that we spoke about earlier.\n\n286\n00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.265\nKeeps your files, but\njust keep that in mind for apps.\n\n287\n00:16:48.265 --> 00:16:51.510\nBecause sometimes apps, you don't\nknow where the install files are, or\n\n288\n00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.460\nyou lost the licensing keys ages ago.\n\n289\n00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:59.420\nAnd it's not something that is totally,\nwell, it's not irreversible.\n\n290\n00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.276\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n291\n00:17:02.276 --> 00:17:06.177\nBut, now, if you are sure that\nyou wanna get rid of everything,\n\n292\n00:17:06.177 --> 00:17:10.130\nthere's nothing really\nsensitive on that system.\n\n293\n00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:14.020\nAnd performance is more important\nto you for that overall system,\n\n294\n00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:14.800\nthe health of that system.\n\n295\n00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.870\nThen go ahead and remove everything.\n\n296\n00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.410\nSo that's resetting this PC.\n\n297\n00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:24.299\nIn the past, different versions,\ndifferent Windows client OS's\n\n298\n00:17:24.299 --> 00:17:29.120\ncalled it refresh or something like that.\n\n299\n00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.300\nBut for this moment in time,\nit's called reset for this option here.\n\n300\n00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.100\nNow, that'll be listed first, currently.\n\n301\n00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.380\nLike I said, this may change in\nthe future, but it's looked like this for\n\n302\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.580\na few builds now.\n\n303\n00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.580\nSo let's take a look at\nthe Advanced options.\n\n304\n00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:51.060\nSo this should look familiar to you, this\nis what we've been working with here for\n\n305\n00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.690\nsystem restore.\n\n306\n00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.450\nWe had created a restore point.\n\n307\n00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.500\nSo if I knew I had created restore\npoints in the past, and I wanted to take\n\n308\n00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:04.720\nadvantage of that option, this is another\narea where I would go in and launch that.\n\n309\n00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.806\nAnd if we go in and give it a second here.\n\n310\n00:18:10.806 --> 00:18:12.857\nI will be patient, I will be patient.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n311\n00:18:12.857 --> 00:18:13.651\n&gt;&gt; Keep telling yourself that.\n\n312\n00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:15.134\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n313\n00:18:15.134 --> 00:18:15.802\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n314\n00:18:15.802 --> 00:18:18.600\nwhat we're seeing here is\nan actual reboot of the machine.\n\n315\n00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.960\nMy virtual machine here is rebooting,\nso that's why it is taking longer.\n\n316\n00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.800\nBut I will have that option\nto go ahead and choose.\n\n317\n00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.040\nHopefully, my little restore point\nis there, cuz I only had that one.\n\n318\n00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.104\nSo let's take a look.\n\n319\n00:18:37.527 --> 00:18:43.030\nOkay, also keep in mind though that\nthis is good that we're seeing this.\n\n320\n00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.280\nBecause if I didn't have\nthat end users password\n\n321\n00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.790\nthen you might wanna keep that in mind.\n\n322\n00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.420\nIt's always good to\nhave an administrative,\n\n323\n00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.750\nor not just an administrative, but\nmaybe like a help desk account or\n\n324\n00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.860\nsomething where you have\naccess to that password there.\n\n325\n00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.897\nBut, we'll go ahead and type that in.\n\n326\n00:19:02.246 --> 00:19:06.079\nAnd this will bring us to that particular\npoint where we had, you guys have seen\n\n327\n00:19:06.079 --> 00:19:09.870\nthis before, and this was that\nrestore point that we had created.\n\n328\n00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:14.690\nSo we'll go ahead and walk through\nthe paces here and go ahead and finish.\n\n329\n00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:15.750\nAnd it says, once started,\n\n330\n00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.940\nrestore point cannot be interrupted,\ndo you wanna continue?\n\n331\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.960\nJust keep that in mind as well.\n\n332\n00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:27.240\nSo if you are working on\na system like a laptop,\n\n333\n00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.828\nalso make sure you have a power source.\n\n334\n00:19:29.828 --> 00:19:33.854\nYou don't wanna be working on a low\nbattery there, just to prevent any\n\n335\n00:19:33.854 --> 00:19:36.255\npotential corruption or whatever.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n336\n00:19:36.255 --> 00:19:38.893\nthat would not be a good thing if it\nfailed in the middle of performing\n\n337\n00:19:38.893 --> 00:19:39.985\nthe restore.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n338\n00:19:39.985 --> 00:19:41.171\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n339\n00:19:41.171 --> 00:19:42.799\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz then, maybe,\n\n340\n00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:46.943\nhopefully at that point,\nyou had already created a back up image,\n\n341\n00:19:46.943 --> 00:19:49.535\na recovery drive.\n&gt;&gt; Something else, yeah.\n\n342\n00:19:49.535 --> 00:19:51.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something else, for sure.\n\n343\n00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:55.790\nAnd that's a good point because you don't\nwanna just rely on one of these methods,\n\n344\n00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:59.080\nit's always good to have a varied plan.\n\n345\n00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.650\nNow this is gonna take a few minutes,\nso looking at the time, Mike,\n\n346\n00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.630\nI think it might be best if we go\nahead and just wrap things up.\n\n347\n00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.690\nThere is still a lot of things that I\nwould still like to look like in this\n\n348\n00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:11.535\nenvironment, so I think we will pick right\nback up once we finish this restoration.\n\n349\n00:20:11.535 --> 00:20:12.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds like a plan.\n\n350\n00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:13.690\nYou heard it from Cherokee.\n\n351\n00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.109\nWe'll stop there and\nwe'll come back and see what happened.\n\n352\n00:20:16.109 --> 00:20:18.360\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n353\n00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.140\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n354\n00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:21.913\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n355\n00:20:21.913 --> 00:20:24.218\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n356\n00:20:24.218 --> 00:20:30.200\n[MUSIC]\n\n357\n00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.275\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:04.939\n&gt;&gt; Live from San Francisco, California.\n\n4\n00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:06.420\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.219\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.644\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n7\n00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:15.569\nwelcome to another chatting\nepisode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:19.917\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick today we're\ninstalling and configuring Windows 10,\n\n9\n00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:21.946\npreparing for the 70-698 exam.\n\n10\n00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:25.564\nIn this episode we're doing a part\ntwo on system and data recovery.\n\n11\n00:00:25.564 --> 00:00:28.740\nAnd back in the studios to continue with\nus is none other than Cherokee Boose.\n\n12\n00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.816\nWelcome back, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me, Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:35.802\nWe were just going through the paces,\ntaking a look at how we can revert back to\n\n14\n00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:39.204\na previous moment in time\nwith that system restore.\n\n15\n00:00:39.204 --> 00:00:42.163\nI've actually just completed\nthat system restore.\n\n16\n00:00:42.163 --> 00:00:45.411\nIt's up here on my screen and\nI have a little successful message.\n\n17\n00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:46.821\nI know it's smart and hard to read.\n\n18\n00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:50.210\nBut it just says that the restore\ncompleted successfully.\n\n19\n00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.970\nThe system has been restored to,\nand then it lists the date and\n\n20\n00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.350\ntime when that restore\npoint was actually created.\n\n21\n00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.860\nNow, I'm kinda gonna do an experiment\nhere to see if this Restart\n\n22\n00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.870\nbutton also has that same functionality we\nsaw with the holding down of the Shift.\n\n23\n00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.700\nIf not, we'll just do another\nrestart to get back in\n\n24\n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.298\nto our troubleshooting options.\n\n25\n00:01:12.298 --> 00:01:16.720\nI'm holding in the Shift, let's see if\nit'll actually do that, I'm kinda curious.\n\n26\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.430\nBecause I do wanna spend some\nmore time taking a look at\n\n27\n00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.620\nother options that we have available to us\nwith those troubleshooting options there.\n\n28\n00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.564\nSo we'll find out here in a second.\n&gt;&gt; Drumroll please.\n\n29\n00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:30.176\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, we're gonna take\n\n30\n00:01:30.176 --> 00:01:34.300\na look at pulling in that recovery drive\nthat we'd created in the last show also.\n\n31\n00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.540\nIf you don't remember, we did do that.\n\n32\n00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.500\nDoesn't look like we're getting\ninto that option there, so\n\n33\n00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.920\nwe'll need to go ahead and\ndo another reboot.\n\n34\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.345\nBut that's okay.\n\n35\n00:01:43.345 --> 00:01:47.841\nWhile we are in the OS, there's one other\nthing that I wanted to remind you of so\n\n36\n00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.763\nwe can take a look at that as well.\n\n37\n00:01:51.817 --> 00:01:54.804\nIf I can be patient to get\nmy password field up here.\n\n38\n00:01:56.291 --> 00:02:01.138\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes that is the most\n\n39\n00:02:01.138 --> 00:02:05.643\ndifficult part.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] For me yes, yes.\n\n40\n00:02:05.643 --> 00:02:07.559\nPatience is a virtue.\n\n41\n00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:14.292\nOkay, I also see another notification\nhere, so that's pretty cool.\n\n42\n00:02:14.292 --> 00:02:17.192\nI'm gonna go ahead and just hit close.\n\n43\n00:02:17.192 --> 00:02:20.031\nBut one thing that I wanted to show\nyou while we're still talking about\n\n44\n00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:20.760\nrestore points.\n\n45\n00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.136\nIf I go ahead and hit my Windows key + I,\nnot Windows I key.\n\n46\n00:02:27.136 --> 00:02:30.344\nThat's kind of like the IKEA key.\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n47\n00:02:30.344 --> 00:02:34.561\na little furniture store.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, it's a combo, guys.\n\n48\n00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:39.285\nBut once I'm in my settings, this is where\nI really wanted to go to show you there\n\n49\n00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:43.957\nwas one other way I could launch that\nrestore point under update and security.\n\n50\n00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:47.462\nNow over on the left-hand pane\nyou'll see a recovery option.\n\n51\n00:02:47.462 --> 00:02:50.045\nI need to left-click there and\n\n52\n00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:54.624\nthen I have the option to go\nin number one reset this PC.\n\n53\n00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:57.783\nThat's what we also saw in\nthe last show at the very end.\n\n54\n00:02:57.783 --> 00:03:01.702\nWhen we were looking at that blue\ninterface in that troubleshooting section\n\n55\n00:03:01.702 --> 00:03:03.840\nwhen we restarted our system.\n\n56\n00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.960\nAnd then, we also have access\nto this advanced start-up there.\n\n57\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.500\nSo, if I go ahead and\nhit this restart now button,\n\n58\n00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.500\nthis would initiate that same effect as\nif we were holding down that shift key.\n\n59\n00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.479\nSo, we'll go ahead and do that now.\n\n60\n00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.605\nAnd then, once we get in there\nwe'll look at our back-up drive.\n\n61\n00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:23.303\nAnd then some other options before we\n\n62\n00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:27.491\nmove along with a number of\ndifferent recovery options.\n\n63\n00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:31.387\nAll right, so we're gonna go down\nhere to troubleshoot, if you recall.\n\n64\n00:03:31.387 --> 00:03:35.603\nWe've already looked at Reset this PC,\nso we'll go through Advanced Options.\n\n65\n00:03:35.603 --> 00:03:40.350\nAnd we did the System Restore already\nas well, so we performed that.\n\n66\n00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.210\nLet's see, what else do we wanna do,\nhow about this?\n\n67\n00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.640\nSystem Image Recovery, so if I had\ncreated a specific recovery drive,\n\n68\n00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.070\nand had access to that image, this would\nbe a great option for me, all right?\n\n69\n00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.250\nThe problem is, keep in mind,\n\n70\n00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.410\nthis is something that you\nhave to do ahead of time.\n\n71\n00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.900\nSo again here we'll see this process and\njust kind of what to expect there.\n\n72\n00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.670\nNow when I created the recovery drive for\nthis system,\n\n73\n00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.800\nwhat I did was I had basically\ncreated a fake hard drive.\n\n74\n00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.990\nI used a virtual hard drive.\n\n75\n00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.760\nBut in reality, you'd probably want to\nuse a real hard drive, an external drive.\n\n76\n00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.590\nGo ahead and\nmap this out to a network share, whatever,\n\n77\n00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.090\njust something that is stable.\n\n78\n00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.960\nSomething that you can, that location\nshould be reliable enough for\n\n79\n00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.080\nyou to trust it as a form of backup there.\n\n80\n00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.110\nSo again, I need to go ahead and select\nan account, and then I'll login here.\n\n81\n00:04:43.822 --> 00:04:48.998\nAll right, okay, so it's saying it cannot\nfind a system image on this computer.\n\n82\n00:04:48.998 --> 00:04:55.573\nAnd again, that may be because\nI had to kind of work with.\n\n83\n00:04:55.573 --> 00:04:59.050\nI wasn't doing things by the book,\nlike I just told you guys.\n\n84\n00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.020\nBut if I had, it would be indicated here.\n\n85\n00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.250\nAnd like I said,\nhonestly I feel like, maybe,\n\n86\n00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.310\nhaving an external drive\nwill be the way to go.\n\n87\n00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.210\nI could have done that, but I didn't.\n\n88\n00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.090\nBut this is exactly where\nyou would go to go ahead and\n\n89\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.910\nget that system booted up and ready to go.\n\n90\n00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.505\nAnd, again, this is one of those things\nthat you gotta think about ahead of time.\n\n91\n00:05:19.505 --> 00:05:20.654\n&gt;&gt; That's the biggest thing, it is.\n\n92\n00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:21.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n93\n00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:22.619\n&gt;&gt; You gotta plan ahead,\n\n94\n00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:25.730\nand you gotta make that system\nimage while the system is clean and\n\n95\n00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.410\neverything is running properly.\n\n96\n00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.154\nOnce a failure has occurred,\nit's a little too late to try to fix it.\n\n97\n00:05:30.154 --> 00:05:32.452\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's not something that,\n\n98\n00:05:32.452 --> 00:05:36.781\nwith creating your restore points,\nyou can go ahead and schedule tasks.\n\n99\n00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:42.342\nAnd even with backups,\nyou can set as an ongoing task.\n\n100\n00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:47.297\nWith your images, or\nrecovery disks, that's a one-off.\n\n101\n00:05:47.297 --> 00:05:51.776\nSo if you create that disk a year ago,\nand anything that's happened\n\n102\n00:05:51.776 --> 00:05:56.270\nfrom within that time,\nyou're not going to have available to you.\n\n103\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.090\nSo that's something else you\nneed to keep in mind as well.\n\n104\n00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.300\nSo that's kind of towards\nthe last resort-kind of option.\n\n105\n00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.940\nI would definitely reserve that for later.\n\n106\n00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.460\nLet's go back in and take a look at\nsome of these other options here,\n\n107\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.220\nagain, under advanced options.\n\n108\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.640\nGoing back to the previous version,\n\n109\n00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.930\nI don't think I'm gonna\nhave this option here.\n\n110\n00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.560\nLet's try it and see what happens.\n\n111\n00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.570\nI have had a cumulative or\n\n112\n00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.590\nquality update here recently, but\nI haven't had any major system changes.\n\n113\n00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.660\nNow, the way it works now, we have\nour two feature updates twice a year.\n\n114\n00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.342\nAnd from what I've heard, or\nhow it was just recently,\n\n115\n00:06:39.342 --> 00:06:41.925\nI don't know if this is going\nto change in the future.\n\n116\n00:06:41.925 --> 00:06:46.885\nBut you'll have a tiny buffer period\nafter a major system change like that\n\n117\n00:06:46.885 --> 00:06:47.931\nhas occurred.\n\n118\n00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:53.133\nApproximately ten days at the time\nof the filming of this show.\n\n119\n00:06:53.133 --> 00:06:54.883\nIf you had upgraded or\n\n120\n00:06:54.883 --> 00:07:00.628\nupdated within a small period of\ntime after that change had occurred.\n\n121\n00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:04.967\nYou would have the option here to\ngo back to a previous version, and\n\n122\n00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:06.836\nroll back and revert there.\n\n123\n00:07:06.836 --> 00:07:10.767\nI have not had that happen recently, so\nI'm just gonna go ahead and hit cancel.\n\n124\n00:07:10.767 --> 00:07:14.159\nBut know that that's also\nan option that you have available.\n\n125\n00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:21.340\nAll right, I think that's good for now.\n\n126\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.870\nThere's nothing else I wanted\nto look at right here.\n\n127\n00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.105\nYou do have UEFI settings, command prompt\noptions, but we're going to go back and\n\n128\n00:07:28.105 --> 00:07:29.324\njust boot this system.\n\n129\n00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:35.370\nBecause I wanna take a look\nat a more granular level.\n\n130\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.820\nSo maybe something's not\nwell with my system.\n\n131\n00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.750\nI'm not seeing any instabilities there,\nbut I'm having issues with files.\n\n132\n00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.090\nI've lost some data, or versioning,\n\n133\n00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.549\nmaybe some corruption,\nmaybe a disgruntled employee.\n\n134\n00:07:49.549 --> 00:07:51.699\nWho knows what the situation may be.\n\n135\n00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:53.441\nBut we do have options to go ahead and\n\n136\n00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:55.599\nhelp protect our data\nat that level as well.\n\n137\n00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:59.794\nSo the system will go ahead and boot up\nand then we'll look at how we can set up\n\n138\n00:07:59.794 --> 00:08:02.495\nFile history.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n139\n00:08:02.495 --> 00:08:04.651\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is a newer option.\n\n140\n00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.880\nThe objectives do call out to both\nfile history, the newer option,\n\n141\n00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.370\nas well as Windows Backup,\nand that's an option.\n\n142\n00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:19.475\nAnd even when we take a look at it, you\ncan see in parentheses it says Windows 7.\n\n143\n00:08:19.475 --> 00:08:23.840\nBecause with the older operating\nsystems that was the preferred method.\n\n144\n00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.372\nBut now file history is\nthe preferred method.\n\n145\n00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:30.522\nBut if you had created backups\nwith that previous method,\n\n146\n00:08:30.522 --> 00:08:33.749\nthey haven't abandoned\nthat method [LAUGH].\n\n147\n00:08:33.749 --> 00:08:36.230\nSo you still have the ability to go and\npull and\n\n148\n00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.790\nrevert to those backups\nyou may have created.\n\n149\n00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:44.150\nBut for now, it's probably a good idea,\nmoving forward, to go ahead and\n\n150\n00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.700\nuse file history as\nthe preferred choice there.\n\n151\n00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.530\nI'm just going to go ahead and\ndo a search for file history.\n\n152\n00:08:53.965 --> 00:08:57.730\nAnd I say that, and\nI will retype it, all right.\n\n153\n00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.740\nOkay, so the option that I\nsee here come up in search,\n\n154\n00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.760\nit just says restore your\nfiles with file history.\n\n155\n00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.330\nAnd notice that it does point back\nas a control panel applet, so\n\n156\n00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.640\nwe'll go ahead and\njust left-click to launch that.\n\n157\n00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.620\nCurrently, no file history was found.\n\n158\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.452\nI've never enabled it on this system.\n\n159\n00:09:18.452 --> 00:09:23.179\nSo what we can do is select this option,\nconfigure file history settings.\n\n160\n00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:30.210\nI need to have space as to\nwhere I wanna go ahead, and\n\n161\n00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.560\nwe just saw that with our recovery drive,\nright?\n\n162\n00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.856\nSo if I don't have an external drive,\n\n163\n00:09:37.856 --> 00:09:42.388\nwhat I can't do is in like\nthis situation go ahead and\n\n164\n00:09:42.388 --> 00:09:46.511\nuse another hard drive\nthat may be on my system.\n\n165\n00:09:46.511 --> 00:09:51.755\nSo, as long as I have that storage space\nthen I'm good to go, I'll go ahead and\n\n166\n00:09:51.755 --> 00:09:59.879\nselect turn on I'm trying to think.\n\n167\n00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:05.486\nLet me zoom in so we can take a look\nat what this says here, let's see.\n\n168\n00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:10.919\nSo file history saves\ncopies of your files so\n\n169\n00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:13.200\nyou can get them back if\nthey're damaged or lost.\n\n170\n00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.020\nSo basically everything that we just said,\nreiterating that.\n\n171\n00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.687\nSo the system does run initially there,\nI don't have a lot on this system here so\n\n172\n00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:22.079\nit shouldn't take too long.\n\n173\n00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:24.092\nI'm gonna go ahead and zoom out again so\n\n174\n00:10:24.092 --> 00:10:27.154\nyou guys can see some small\nlittle options available to us.\n\n175\n00:10:27.154 --> 00:10:30.444\nDown here towards the bottom we\nhave another link to go ahead and\n\n176\n00:10:30.444 --> 00:10:32.566\nbring us back to some recovery options.\n\n177\n00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:37.320\nAs well as directly to\nthat system image backup.\n\n178\n00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.130\nAnd again, we can take those images to\ncreate a recovery drive if you wanted to\n\n179\n00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.766\nhave that option as well.\n\n180\n00:10:43.766 --> 00:10:48.212\nNow, remember that file that we looked\nat before when we were talking about\n\n181\n00:10:48.212 --> 00:10:49.776\nthe different versions?\n\n182\n00:10:49.776 --> 00:10:52.780\nI see it kinda poking out\nover the background here.\n\n183\n00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.100\nSo I wanna just take a look at that.\n\n184\n00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.620\nAnd kind of re-explore,\nrevisit that option.\n\n185\n00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.910\nSo if we go into Properties here,\n\n186\n00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.890\nremember our Previous Versions tab\ndidn't have anything listed there.\n\n187\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.690\nAnd we've just created one copy here,\n\n188\n00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:13.010\nbut I do see now that change\nthat we had made earlier.\n\n189\n00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:18.110\nSo just gonna keep that in mind,\nwhenever there are gonna be a couple\n\n190\n00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.670\ndifferent ways to access these previous\nversions of files if you wanted to.\n\n191\n00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.380\nBut I'm just gonna hit cancel for now.\n\n192\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.590\nThis is where you could open it,\nto view it.\n\n193\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:31.445\nOr restore it to actually\nmake that the living\n\n194\n00:11:31.445 --> 00:11:35.457\nfile if that makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think they give\n\n195\n00:11:35.457 --> 00:11:38.469\nyou the option to either overwrite\nthe original or save as a new copy.\n\n196\n00:11:38.469 --> 00:11:41.722\nSo maybe you wanted to go back\nto a previous version but\n\n197\n00:11:41.722 --> 00:11:44.229\nnot lose the original?\n&gt;&gt; Well now we're just gonna have to\n\n198\n00:11:44.229 --> 00:11:45.197\ndo it, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n199\n00:11:45.197 --> 00:11:45.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, but\n\n200\n00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.640\nlet's do the open first so we can see.\n\n201\n00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.044\nSo open or open in file history.\n\n202\n00:11:50.044 --> 00:11:54.114\nSo, hm, let's open in file history\nsince we're talking about file history\n\n203\n00:11:54.114 --> 00:11:54.884\nanyways.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n204\n00:11:54.884 --> 00:11:58.045\nlet's do the whole dialogue box.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah cuz this is the same graphical\n\n205\n00:11:58.045 --> 00:12:02.585\nview right here that you would see if\nyou did a search for file history and\n\n206\n00:12:02.585 --> 00:12:04.445\nlaunched it that way.\n\n207\n00:12:04.445 --> 00:12:08.784\nAnd it's kinda sad,\nI only have one here, and one of one.\n\n208\n00:12:08.784 --> 00:12:13.259\nBut if this was a document that\nhad several previous versions.\n\n209\n00:12:13.259 --> 00:12:15.847\nYou could use these arrows to go ahead and\n\n210\n00:12:15.847 --> 00:12:18.978\ntab through to the different\niterations there.\n\n211\n00:12:18.978 --> 00:12:23.033\nSo if I decided that this was the one\nthat I wanted to go ahead and use.\n\n212\n00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:26.809\nI could hit this button if\nI hover over it, it'll say,\n\n213\n00:12:26.809 --> 00:12:29.037\nrestore to original location.\n\n214\n00:12:29.037 --> 00:12:34.432\nSo it'll go ahead and\nset this version as the living document.\n\n215\n00:12:34.432 --> 00:12:38.720\nI'm gonna just close out of this option so\nwe can look at the interface and\n\n216\n00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.610\nwhat this other option looks like.\n\n217\n00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.198\nSo here, we have restore or restore to.\n\n218\n00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:45.345\nSo is this what you were\ntalking about Mike?\n\n219\n00:12:45.345 --> 00:12:46.135\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n220\n00:12:46.135 --> 00:12:50.535\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so hm, let's see, restore to.\n\n221\n00:12:50.535 --> 00:12:52.838\nI can choose where I wanna restore it.\n\n222\n00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:54.161\nSo maybe I-\n&gt;&gt; Don't want to overwrite the original.\n\n223\n00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:54.680\n&gt;&gt; So maybe I don't wanna\n\n224\n00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.315\noverwrite the pre-existing.\n&gt;&gt; Or current I should say, yeah.\n\n225\n00:12:56.315 --> 00:12:58.305\n&gt;&gt; Current, yeah, okay, cool.\n\n226\n00:12:58.305 --> 00:13:01.536\nSo just keep that in mind as well,\nbecause maybe you're not sure if\n\n227\n00:13:01.536 --> 00:13:04.549\nthat's the correct version that\nyou need to be working with.\n\n228\n00:13:04.549 --> 00:13:07.698\nAnd you need to verify it, or run it past\nsomeone else, or something like that.\n\n229\n00:13:07.698 --> 00:13:12.270\nYou have the option to save it elsewhere,\npretty cool.\n\n230\n00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.783\n[LAUGH] That kinda stole the thunder\nof File History because really,\n\n231\n00:13:15.783 --> 00:13:17.000\nthat's it, right?\n\n232\n00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.460\nNo, but we'll go ahead and look at it\nfrom a different perspective as well.\n\n233\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.880\nSo we'll just close out of here like\nwe weren't just manipulating things.\n\n234\n00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.950\nAnd if I did a search for File History.\n\n235\n00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:33.290\nAll right, oops it's just gonna bring\nme back to that same option there.\n\n236\n00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.930\nOkay, this is what I wanted to see.\n\n237\n00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.930\nThis is that like default at\nfirst glance that you see.\n\n238\n00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.780\nIt's all the different buckets,\nif you will, your directories.\n\n239\n00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.810\nSo, Contacts, Desktop, Documents,\nI don't think I have any documents.\n\n240\n00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.390\nI might on this system,\nlet's see, nope, nothing here.\n\n241\n00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:57.310\nAnd you can navigate through as you would,\n3D Objects, Desktop,\n\n242\n00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.960\nlet's go back to Desktop.\n\n243\n00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.288\nThis is where you see that user data file\nthat we had taken a look at here, but\n\n244\n00:14:03.288 --> 00:14:04.743\nnot a whole lot going on.\n\n245\n00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:07.990\nLike I said, not too exciting, but\nI think it's a pretty cool concept.\n\n246\n00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:15.182\nBecause for as often as you have file\nhistory enabled you can go through and\n\n247\n00:14:15.182 --> 00:14:22.710\nrevert back to points in time from\nwhenever you initiated file history.\n\n248\n00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.790\nLet's see,\nyou also wanna keep in mind though,\n\n249\n00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.850\nstorage as well here with file history so\n\n250\n00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.169\nthat concept does apply.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n251\n00:14:34.169 --> 00:14:37.900\nwe've gone from like system\nrestore points to file history.\n\n252\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.090\nOther methods, Cherokee,\nwe can use to keep our files safe?\n\n253\n00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.036\n&gt;&gt; Of course the Cloud Mike,\n\n254\n00:14:41.036 --> 00:14:41.922\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yes of course.\n\n255\n00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:44.851\n&gt;&gt; Everything's in the Cloud these days,\n\n256\n00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:49.511\nbut no seriously OneDrive,\nMicrosoft's pushing it, right?\n\n257\n00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:50.978\nSo Microsoft wants us, or\n\n258\n00:14:50.978 --> 00:14:54.390\nhas asked us several times\nthrough the installation shows.\n\n259\n00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.540\nIf you've watched or\neven installed a Microsoft Windows 10 OS,\n\n260\n00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.050\nthey want you to use a Microsoft account,\nright?\n\n261\n00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:05.166\nReason being is you can leverage\nthe cloud if you do so.\n\n262\n00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:10.779\nIf I go to another system or if I just\nuse a web browser, log into that account.\n\n263\n00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:16.870\nI can use the web-based OneDrive and\nhave all my files synched there.\n\n264\n00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:21.610\nIt's a really good idea,\nreally good concept if you think about it.\n\n265\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:22.621\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n266\n00:15:22.621 --> 00:15:26.699\nI have switched to another machine here,\nso I can take advantage of that.\n\n267\n00:15:26.699 --> 00:15:30.524\nAnd I will show you that\nparticular account.\n\n268\n00:15:30.524 --> 00:15:33.184\nYou can see here under this info,\n\n269\n00:15:33.184 --> 00:15:37.780\nI am logged in as a demo test\naccount here, as John Doe.\n\n270\n00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.110\nTo go ahead and give us that\naccess to that Microsoft account.\n\n271\n00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:44.329\nAnd then, when I pull up file explorer,\n\n272\n00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:48.530\non the left hand side,\nOneDrive is integrated.\n\n273\n00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.280\nIt's part of the operating system now.\n\n274\n00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.023\nIf you haven't seen, we've done shows\nabout, specifically about OneDrive and\n\n275\n00:15:54.023 --> 00:15:56.424\nthe different settings and\noptions you have there.\n\n276\n00:15:56.424 --> 00:16:00.491\nBut when we're taking a look at\nusing file or data recovery,\n\n277\n00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:05.780\nthis is a perfect Option for that, so\nlet's go ahead and expand out OneDrive.\n\n278\n00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.100\nSo I've created a couple of\ndocuments here, and if you remember,\n\n279\n00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.710\nlet me zoom in so you guys can see this.\n\n280\n00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:22.160\nThe little cloud is gonna be signifying\nthat this document lives in the cloud.\n\n281\n00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.370\nIf I right-click on that,\nlet me just go to Properties and\n\n282\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:25.830\nshow you what I'm talking about here.\n\n283\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.080\nSo, if I look at the actual\nsize of the file, okay,\n\n284\n00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.390\nI can see it's 157 bytes,\nthat's pretty small.\n\n285\n00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:38.940\nBut if you look at the line right\nunderneath there, it says size on disk.\n\n286\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.800\nSo the physical hard disk for\nthis system, there are no bytes, right?\n\n287\n00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.010\nThat's because the file\nresides within the cloud.\n\n288\n00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:51.400\nI'm just gonna go ahead and hit Cancel,\nbut remember you do have the option to\n\n289\n00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.260\nbring that file down locally\nby right-clicking, and\n\n290\n00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:02.280\nyou have a couple options like always\nkeeping this file on this device.\n\n291\n00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.680\nThe reason they default to the cloud is,\nwell, number one, for\n\n292\n00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.070\nthat mobility, that ease of access there.\n\n293\n00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:12.376\nBut also,\nif you think about a lot of our mobile\n\n294\n00:17:12.376 --> 00:17:17.790\ndevices, you can't add storage\nto them easily, right?\n\n295\n00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.660\nIt is what it is, especially for\ntablets and things like that.\n\n296\n00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:26.970\nBut, that's definitely an option to\nahead and access your files that way.\n\n297\n00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.170\nAll right, looking at the time,\n\n298\n00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:33.530\nanother option that they have\navailable to us here, or\n\n299\n00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:38.960\nobjective that they call out is going to\nbe interpreting data from Device Manager,\n\n300\n00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.042\nresolve hardware and device issues,\nand perform driver rollbacks.\n\n301\n00:17:43.042 --> 00:17:46.830\nI kinda wanted to group those\nobjectives together, they make sense.\n\n302\n00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:47.680\nIt's hardware, right?\n\n303\n00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:54.180\nWe're talking about files, but,\ndriver rollback also recovery options.\n\n304\n00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.560\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at Device Manager.\n\n305\n00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.830\nI can't remember which machine it was on,\n\n306\n00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.770\nthis one or the other where I\nmessed with a printer driver.\n\n307\n00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.982\nWe're going to find out, all right?\n\n308\n00:18:08.023 --> 00:18:17.240\nLet's see Device manager, Now,\nI just added a folks printer.\n\n309\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.920\nAnd let me go down into\nmy printing queues.\n\n310\n00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.776\nAll right, so it wasn't on this machine,\nlet me switch onto the other one so\n\n311\n00:18:23.776 --> 00:18:25.477\nI can show what I've done there.\n\n312\n00:18:29.116 --> 00:18:30.942\nMake sure my cursor follows us.\n\n313\n00:18:38.765 --> 00:18:40.840\nDrivers, we have shows on that as well.\n\n314\n00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.470\nSo as you may know,\nthere can be issues with that.\n\n315\n00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.870\nLet me just see if it's\n[LAUGH] actually pulling up.\n\n316\n00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.310\nOkay it is, I just wasn't patient.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n317\n00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.050\n&gt;&gt; But in certain situations,\n\n318\n00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.670\nyou might want to revert back to\na previous version of that driver.\n\n319\n00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.360\nSo that's what we're gonna\nbe taking a look at here.\n\n320\n00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.500\nWe did have a show specific about\nDevice Manager, I'm pretty sure.\n\n321\n00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:08.280\nBut if not, just know that we can use\nDevice Manager as a viable tool to\n\n322\n00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:13.220\nhelp indicate any hardware issues,\ndriver issues that we may be facing.\n\n323\n00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:18.560\nSo, going through each one of these\nhardware components and looking at them.\n\n324\n00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.590\nBut specifically, the one that I had\nkind of set up was going to be for\n\n325\n00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.940\nthis, let me zoom in so\nyou guys can see this.\n\n326\n00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.160\nWhen I installed this printer originally,\nthe operating system chose the driver.\n\n327\n00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.230\nBut, let's kind of mimic or\n\n328\n00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.790\ntrick the system real quick into\nusing a poor choice for a driver.\n\n329\n00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.721\nSo if I go ahead and\nmanually update the driver,\n\n330\n00:19:38.721 --> 00:19:42.771\nbut instead of allowing Microsoft\nto choose the correct driver.\n\n331\n00:19:42.771 --> 00:19:46.427\nI'm gonna go ahead and tell the system\nto let me pick from a list of\n\n332\n00:19:46.427 --> 00:19:50.940\navailable drivers on my computer and\nnormally you wouldn't want to do this.\n\n333\n00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.070\nI'm trying to simulate\nwhat a bad driver is,\n\n334\n00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.940\nto why I'd want to go ahead and\nperform a roll back.\n\n335\n00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.837\nAnd if you've worked with any kind of\nprinters, you know you really don't wanna\n\n336\n00:19:59.837 --> 00:20:01.978\nbe working with a generic driver\nwhen it comes to printers.\n\n337\n00:20:01.978 --> 00:20:06.784\nThat's gonna cause a lot of problems,\nbut for now, I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n338\n00:20:06.784 --> 00:20:10.450\nput that generic driver in and\nwe'll hit Close.\n\n339\n00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:15.120\nNow, the first time I had right-clicked\nand looked at the properties associated\n\n340\n00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.170\nwith this device, I saw some options here.\n\n341\n00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.130\nBut if I wanna really go\ninto the properties here,\n\n342\n00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:26.548\nthat's where I can click on this\nspecific tab, my driver tab.\n\n343\n00:20:26.548 --> 00:20:28.200\nLet zoom in so you guys can see that.\n\n344\n00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:33.094\nAnd I now, I didn't show you\nbefore I probably should have.\n\n345\n00:20:33.094 --> 00:20:36.922\nWe can take a look at another device here,\nbut at first,\n\n346\n00:20:36.922 --> 00:20:40.498\nthis Roll Back Driver\noption will be grayed out.\n\n347\n00:20:40.498 --> 00:20:42.970\nAnd that make sense because\nif you think about it,\n\n348\n00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.710\nthat you can't roll back if\nyou only have one version.\n\n349\n00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.390\nAnd when you do perform a rollback,\n\n350\n00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.910\nyou're only performing the rollback one\nversion, not multiple versions ago.\n\n351\n00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:56.975\nAnd I knew, in 1968 it worked with this\ndriver, no, it doesn't work that way,\n\n352\n00:20:56.975 --> 00:21:00.335\nit only goes back to that\nlast known good driver.\n\n353\n00:21:00.335 --> 00:21:04.022\nAnd while this may not seem like\nsomething you perform regularly, but\n\n354\n00:21:04.022 --> 00:21:06.662\nwho knows with the way that\nthe updates are going.\n\n355\n00:21:06.662 --> 00:21:10.254\nAnd if Microsoft and\nthat manufacturer are working together and\n\n356\n00:21:10.254 --> 00:21:15.060\nthey're pulling those drivers in, and\nyou're getting them through your updates.\n\n357\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.680\nThere might be situations where you\ndo wanna revert back to that driver.\n\n358\n00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.650\nSo, just keep that in mind\nas a recovery option.\n\n359\n00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:26.288\nSo, I can see why they have\nput that in right here.\n\n360\n00:21:26.288 --> 00:21:29.010\nHere, and\nI'll just show you what it looks like.\n\n361\n00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:32.480\nFor instance, with something else,\nmaybe like a processor.\n\n362\n00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.630\nLet's go ahead and expand that out and\nlook at the properties there.\n\n363\n00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.670\nAnd go under Driver, and\nI'm lemme zoom in so you can see.\n\n364\n00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:44.440\nSo I had manipulated and\nmodified my processor info, so\n\n365\n00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.500\nI don't have the option to go ahead and\nroll back.\n\n366\n00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.900\nSo just kind of keep that in mind, that's\ngonna be found under Device Manager,\n\n367\n00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.640\nwhich can be found by doing a search,\nby going under Computer Management.\n\n368\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.430\nSo a couple of different\nways you could go ahead and\n\n369\n00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.510\naccess that, but I think that's\nabout it for this show, Mike.\n\n370\n00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.260\nWe've taken a look at several\ndifferent recovery options, but\n\n371\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.260\nwe're not finished yet.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n372\n00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.210\nWe got more system and data recovery,\nbut that is gonna do it for\n\n373\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.480\nthis particular episode.\n\n374\n00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.240\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n375\n00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.770\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n376\n00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:12.413\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n377\n00:22:12.413 --> 00:22:13.380\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n378\n00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:20.784\n[MUSIC]\n\n379\n00:22:20.784 --> 00:22:23.269\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

I'm glad to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:30.672 --> 00:00:31.363\n&gt;&gt; That's good [LAUGH].\n\n15\n00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:33.037\n&gt;&gt; And if I were to answer honestly about\n\n16\n00:00:33.037 --> 00:00:34.880\nhow's it going, I don't really know.\n\n17\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.130\nI'm gonna be covering\na topic in this show,\n\n18\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes, beware.\n\n20\n00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.698\nBut I do need to throw a disclaimer out\nthere because the topic that, well,\n\n21\n00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:45.960\nI'm gonna look at two topics.\n\n22\n00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.635\nWe'll reference workgroups, but\n\n23\n00:00:47.635 --> 00:00:50.590\nspecifically the objectives\ncall out homegroups.\n\n24\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.400\nAnd at this point in time,\nversion 1803 Windows 10\n\n25\n00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.110\nclient side OS does not support\nhomegroups, does not exist.\n\n26\n00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.520\nHowever, Microsoft has not updated\ntheir objective list to reflect that.\n\n27\n00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.380\nSo if at the time of you preparing for\nyour exam,\n\n28\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.070\nif they have taken it off\nthe objective list, then I'll say\n\n29\n00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.384\ngo ahead and keep on keeping on.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n30\n00:01:14.384 --> 00:01:15.246\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n31\n00:01:15.246 --> 00:01:20.420\n[LAUGH] Because it took a little bit\nof extra work to bring something,\n\n32\n00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.970\nto travel back in time, Daniel.\n\n33\n00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.942\nSo that's how I'm doing today.\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n\n34\n00:01:23.942 --> 00:01:24.677\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n35\n00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:26.145\n&gt;&gt; At least we have the caveat of be\n\n36\n00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:29.928\nprepared if you're trying to do something\nwith homegroups and you're going,\n\n37\n00:01:29.928 --> 00:01:32.650\nwhere is this homegroup business?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n38\n00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.755\n&gt;&gt; Your mileage may vary,\n\n39\n00:01:33.755 --> 00:01:35.940\nas Justin would say, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but workgroups is still viable,\n\n41\n00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.750\nit's still a thing.\n\n42\n00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.010\nSo be aware of that when you are studying,\nand we'll kinda of look at that.\n\n43\n00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.242\nI mean, there's not a lot to it\nwhen we talk about them, but\n\n44\n00:01:45.242 --> 00:01:47.320\nwe'll cover that anyway.\n\n45\n00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.190\nSo let's get started.\n\n46\n00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.190\nFirst of all,\nI have a Windows 10 system here.\n\n47\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.030\nAnd of course, this is an older version,\nlike I was just referencing.\n\n48\n00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.110\nSo I do have workgroups available to me.\n\n49\n00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.190\nNow if you're not sure if your system\nis already set up with a workgroup or\n\n50\n00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.845\nwork, excuse me.\n\n51\n00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:05.105\nHomegroup, workgroup, or\ndomain, you have no clue.\n\n52\n00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:09.124\nThe easiest way to tell is to pull up\nthose properties under the system page.\n\n53\n00:02:09.124 --> 00:02:10.261\n&gt;&gt; I thought you just ask Cortana.\n\n54\n00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:11.805\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n55\n00:02:11.805 --> 00:02:13.874\n&gt;&gt; Right, Cortana, what group am I in?\n\n56\n00:02:13.874 --> 00:02:15.939\nAnd workgroup-\n&gt;&gt; We're not on speaking terms right now,\n\n57\n00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.999\nso [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n58\n00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:19.955\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna right click on the Start\n\n59\n00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:20.685\nicon here.\n\n60\n00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.060\nNow, Control Panel, you do have\nthat oldie but goodie there, right?\n\n61\n00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.220\nSo you can go ahead and\naccess System under that category,\n\n62\n00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.420\nunder Category Viewer\nyou could pull them up.\n\n63\n00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.207\nBut just right-clicking on that Start\nmenu for me is the easiest way.\n\n64\n00:02:37.207 --> 00:02:39.470\nI will say this, though.\n\n65\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.360\nAs a matter of fact, let me minimize\nmy virtual machines real quick.\n\n66\n00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.530\nBecause I will show you\na difference of UI,\n\n67\n00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.750\nthe interface,\nwhenever we look at that here.\n\n68\n00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.740\nBecause, like I said,\nthis is an older version.\n\n69\n00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.457\nSo if you're looking at your system right\nnow and you're trying to figure out hey,\n\n70\n00:02:56.457 --> 00:02:57.531\nwhat am I connected to?\n\n71\n00:02:57.531 --> 00:03:01.058\nI'm doing the same thing,\nright-click and then select System, but\n\n72\n00:03:01.058 --> 00:03:03.470\njust notice the visual differences here.\n\n73\n00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.511\nSo this is version 1803.\n\n74\n00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:08.471\nThis is, at this current moment in time,\nwhat Windows is pushing out,\n\n75\n00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:09.595\nwhat it looks like.\n\n76\n00:03:09.595 --> 00:03:14.160\nSo if you were to try to access the System\nInfo, over on the right hand side here is\n\n77\n00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.130\nwhere you would click to\npull that information up.\n\n78\n00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.324\nSo this is my local machine.\n\n79\n00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:22.750\nI'm gonna close out of this, because I\nneed to demonstrate that older version.\n\n80\n00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.350\nBut I just wanted to show you\na slight difference there.\n\n81\n00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.250\nSo you're like, hey,\nthat's not what mine looks like.\n\n82\n00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.230\nBut that's all right.\n\n83\n00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.716\nAll right, so in this particular system,\nyou'll find that same\n\n84\n00:03:34.716 --> 00:03:38.712\ninformation over on the right hand\nside here under System Info as well.\n\n85\n00:03:38.712 --> 00:03:44.950\nAnd then again, like I said, you always\nhave Control Panel to kinda fall back on.\n\n86\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.750\nAll right, so\nwhat can I see here from this system?\n\n87\n00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.700\nI see that Client04 is the name\nof my computer name, right?\n\n88\n00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.410\nCurrently, I'm part of a workgroup.\n\n89\n00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.780\nSo by default,\nwhen you install an operating system,\n\n90\n00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.920\nyou default to this default\nWORKGROUP right here.\n\n91\n00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.480\nAnd that's what the default\nconfiguration is.\n\n92\n00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.200\nSometimes you may need to change that.\n\n93\n00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.740\nSo in business environments,\nmost likely we'll be working with domains.\n\n94\n00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.742\nAnd of course, this is Windows and\nMicrosoft land that we're in, so-\n\n95\n00:04:15.742 --> 00:04:16.722\n&gt;&gt; They love the domains.\n\n96\n00:04:16.722 --> 00:04:17.413\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n97\n00:04:17.413 --> 00:04:20.380\nBut sometimes you'll need to change that,\nright?\n\n98\n00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.896\nSo in order to do that,\nyou'll go ahead and\n\n99\n00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:27.718\nclick this link over on\nthe right-hand side.\n\n100\n00:04:27.718 --> 00:04:30.905\nNow, without going too much into\ndepth right now, like I said,\n\n101\n00:04:30.905 --> 00:04:33.160\nwe'll be looking at domains specifically.\n\n102\n00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.649\nThere's a lot to domains and\ndomain configuration.\n\n103\n00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:41.115\nBut for right now, I can go ahead and\nchange this from WORKGROUP, and\n\n104\n00:04:41.115 --> 00:04:43.816\nthen just change the name, like DEMOWG.\n\n105\n00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:47.074\nAnd when we compare\nworkgroups versus homegroups,\n\n106\n00:04:47.074 --> 00:04:52.280\nthat's where we're specifically gonna\nbe looking at in more detail here.\n\n107\n00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.910\nHomegroups are really\ndesigned to be easier.\n\n108\n00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.990\nHomegroups, I have to think about,\n\n109\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.040\nI have to know the name of it\nto connect to it to begin with.\n\n110\n00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.580\nSo everyone,\n\n111\n00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.280\nit's like you're sharing resources\non that local area network there.\n\n112\n00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.980\nAnd everyone in that same\nworkgroup can share but, Daniel,\n\n113\n00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.904\nyou have to know the name.\n\n114\n00:05:09.904 --> 00:05:13.650\nSo DEMOWG, you would need to know that,\nnot have that information-\n\n115\n00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.790\n&gt;&gt; That's not something that's just being\n\n116\n00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.740\nadvertised by the system, correct?\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you're not\n\n117\n00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.200\ngonna necessarily, as an end user,\nknow exactly where to find the setting.\n\n118\n00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.689\nAs I just showed you,\nin one version change,\n\n119\n00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.340\nit's not always gonna be really\nupfront for the end user.\n\n120\n00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.740\nSo there's also some other things\nto consider that are a little more\n\n121\n00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.760\neasier when it comes to connecting\nto homegroups versus workgroups.\n\n122\n00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.680\nSo with homegroups,\nyou don't have to worry about permissions.\n\n123\n00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.270\nIt's all or nothing there.\n\n124\n00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.420\nWhereas in workgroups, permissions\nstill apply, and things of that nature.\n\n125\n00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.126\n&gt;&gt; In a workgroup,\n\n126\n00:05:50.126 --> 00:05:51.794\nI have to have an account on the system.\n\n127\n00:05:51.794 --> 00:05:53.801\nEven though we're connected\nthrough a workgroup,\n\n128\n00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:56.315\nit doesn't mean I actually am able\nto use the resources, per se.\n\n129\n00:05:56.315 --> 00:05:57.689\nI have to have some sort of permissions,\nright?\n\n130\n00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:58.453\n&gt;&gt; You also have to have those\n\n131\n00:05:58.453 --> 00:05:59.477\npermissions, right.\n\n132\n00:05:59.477 --> 00:06:04.964\nSo workgroups are a little more advanced,\nas far as configuring goes.\n\n133\n00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:07.228\nBut I'm just gonna cancel out of this for\nnow,\n\n134\n00:06:07.228 --> 00:06:09.765\nso we can take a look at how\nto set up the homegroups.\n\n135\n00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:15.390\nIt's super easy, and like the name\nimplies, really designed for home use.\n\n136\n00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.390\nBut I think, and this is just my opinion,\n\n137\n00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.030\nbut what really replaced it\nwas the advent of the cloud.\n\n138\n00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.310\nBecause with One Drive, I can easily, I\ndon't have to be on a local area network.\n\n139\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.980\nAs long as you or\nI have Internet connectivity,\n\n140\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.060\nI could email you a link\nto a file in One Drive.\n\n141\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.621\nAnd then you'd have direct\naccess to it there and share it.\n\n142\n00:06:35.621 --> 00:06:37.719\n&gt;&gt; You don't need to have homegroups go,\n\n143\n00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:40.272\nwe'll make a file share and\ngive you access to that and\n\n144\n00:06:40.272 --> 00:06:42.955\nthen have to network everybody in.\n&gt;&gt; There's no setting,\n\n145\n00:06:42.955 --> 00:06:45.777\nno configuration and setting up.\n&gt;&gt; This is zero touch now,\n\n146\n00:06:45.777 --> 00:06:46.313\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n147\n00:06:46.313 --> 00:06:49.574\nthat's why I said skip this if you're,\nif you don't see-\n\n148\n00:06:49.574 --> 00:06:50.995\n&gt;&gt; Homegroups [LAUGH].\n\n149\n00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:52.430\n&gt;&gt; Homegroup on your objective list.\n\n150\n00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.300\nBut as of right now, it's still there,\nso we have to cover that.\n\n151\n00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.346\nI'm just gonna, let me go ahead and\nminimize this for now, and\n\n152\n00:06:58.346 --> 00:07:00.600\njust give ourselves some room here.\n\n153\n00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.670\nYou can actually do a search.\n\n154\n00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.010\nNow, and like I said, in the newer\nversions, if you go to do a search and\n\n155\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.430\nyou don't find that,\njust know that that's why.\n\n156\n00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.495\nI will say this about homegroups.\n\n157\n00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.540\nSo currently I'm on a workgroup\non this system here.\n\n158\n00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:22.340\nI can be joined to a domain and\njoin a homegroup.\n\n159\n00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.256\nI cannot be joined to a domain,\nand join a homegroup,\n\n160\n00:07:26.256 --> 00:07:28.444\nif that makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; You mean\n\n161\n00:07:28.444 --> 00:07:29.800\na workgroup?\n&gt;&gt; A homegroup.\n\n162\n00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.403\n&gt;&gt; Okay, see, cuz\n\n163\n00:07:30.403 --> 00:07:32.989\nthat could get confusing, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, let me, here,\n\n164\n00:07:32.989 --> 00:07:34.606\nI'll restate that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hit it again so we-\n\n165\n00:07:34.606 --> 00:07:35.257\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n166\n00:07:35.257 --> 00:07:36.147\n&gt;&gt; Bring it to us.\n\n167\n00:07:36.147 --> 00:07:38.409\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if this were my laptop and\n\n168\n00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:39.932\nat work-\n&gt;&gt; It is your laptop.\n\n169\n00:07:39.932 --> 00:07:40.579\n&gt;&gt; It is my laptop.\n\n170\n00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:42.774\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n171\n00:07:42.774 --> 00:07:43.351\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n172\n00:07:43.351 --> 00:07:44.533\n&gt;&gt; Funny [LAUGH].\n\n173\n00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:46.190\n&gt;&gt; And if I use my laptop at\n\n174\n00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.132\nwork-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n175\n00:07:47.132 --> 00:07:48.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Stretch of mind there.\n\n176\n00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.301\n&gt;&gt; I think I'm with you, so\n\n177\n00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:51.363\nfar [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n178\n00:07:51.363 --> 00:07:54.723\nI might sometimes use my laptop at home.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, that's true.\n\n179\n00:07:54.723 --> 00:07:56.239\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so when I'm at work,\n\n180\n00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:58.019\nI'm part of the domain.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n181\n00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.040\n&gt;&gt; I'm domain joined.\n\n182\n00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.865\nBut when I get home,\n\n183\n00:07:59.865 --> 00:08:01.522\nI'm not part of the domain-\n&gt;&gt; You're not there.\n\n184\n00:08:01.522 --> 00:08:02.319\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n185\n00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:05.360\nat home, I could be part of a homegroup.\n\n186\n00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.620\nAt work, I could be part of the domain.\n\n187\n00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.390\nHowever, at home I cannot\nstart a homegroup.\n\n188\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.704\nI can join a homegroup,\n\n189\n00:08:12.704 --> 00:08:15.345\nbut I cannot create a homegroup.\n&gt;&gt; That's an odd caveat\n\n190\n00:08:15.345 --> 00:08:17.883\nfor doing homegroups.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm trying to think of things that\n\n191\n00:08:17.883 --> 00:08:21.640\nthey could ask you on the exam, because-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good information.\n\n192\n00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.304\nCuz they might hit you with some weird\nquestion like, you're at home and\n\n193\n00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:27.350\nyou're trying to create a homegroup.\n\n194\n00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.495\nAnd you can't, why?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n195\n00:08:28.495 --> 00:08:29.260\n&gt;&gt; That that kind of stuff can get you.\n\n196\n00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.848\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the system is also joined to\n\n197\n00:08:30.848 --> 00:08:32.590\na domain and that'll be why.\n\n198\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.992\nBut I'm not joined to a domain\nhere on this computer.\n\n199\n00:08:34.992 --> 00:08:39.750\nAnd you can see that I do have the option\nto go ahead and create a homegroup there.\n\n200\n00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.759\nSo it says currently there is\nno homegroup on this network.\n\n201\n00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:45.125\nDing, ding, another-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n202\n00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:47.645\n&gt;&gt; Another thing here, you can only have\n\n203\n00:08:47.645 --> 00:08:50.596\none homegroup per network.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, that makes sense.\n\n204\n00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:51.247\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n205\n00:08:51.247 --> 00:08:52.246\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, why would you have\n\n206\n00:08:52.246 --> 00:08:53.375\nmultiple homegroups?\n&gt;&gt; I mean that would be\n\n207\n00:08:53.375 --> 00:08:55.217\nconfusing if you [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Which homegroup is this, again?\n\n208\n00:08:55.217 --> 00:08:57.168\nYeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Anyways.\n\n209\n00:08:57.168 --> 00:08:58.253\n&gt;&gt; And then you'd bogged down trying to\n\n210\n00:08:58.253 --> 00:09:00.170\nfigure out what homegroup\nyou're trying to connect to.\n\n211\n00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.132\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH].\n\n212\n00:09:01.132 --> 00:09:05.188\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nclick Create the homegroup.\n\n213\n00:09:05.188 --> 00:09:07.470\nI don't know.\n\n214\n00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.380\nI really, I'm gonna be sad to\nsee this little image go away.\n\n215\n00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.261\nIt reminds me of playing marbles or\nsomething.\n\n216\n00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.887\n&gt;&gt; It reminds me of David Bowie in\n\n217\n00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:18.505\nLabyrinth when he had the balls.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Anyways, yeah,\n\n218\n00:09:18.505 --> 00:09:20.190\nfocus, all right?\n\n219\n00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.220\nSo it's saying, look, we can share files\nand printers with other computers.\n\n220\n00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.050\nYou can also stream media to devices.\n\n221\n00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:31.050\nSo we'll see one setting where I could\nalso stream directly to smart TVs,\n\n222\n00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.480\nor any kind of Internet or\nnetwork connected device there.\n\n223\n00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.710\nNow the homegroup is password protected.\n\n224\n00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.701\nYou'll get a kick out of this one,\nMr Security.\n\n225\n00:09:39.701 --> 00:09:40.476\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n226\n00:09:40.476 --> 00:09:42.643\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's not as secure as\n\n227\n00:09:42.643 --> 00:09:44.594\nyou would think.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n228\n00:09:44.594 --> 00:09:45.806\n&gt;&gt; And you would hold Microsoft\n\n229\n00:09:45.806 --> 00:09:46.390\nto that bar.\n\n230\n00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:50.060\nBut then again,\nreally this was designed for home use.\n\n231\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.215\nSo hopefully you trust the people\nthat are in your home.\n\n232\n00:09:53.215 --> 00:09:56.045\nI think that's what they were thinking.\n&gt;&gt; That's a mistake right there.\n\n233\n00:09:56.045 --> 00:09:56.856\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n234\n00:09:56.856 --> 00:09:58.118\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna hit Next for now.\n\n235\n00:09:58.118 --> 00:10:02.287\nNow this is going to be the default,\nas far as what can or\n\n236\n00:10:02.287 --> 00:10:04.655\nshould, I won't say should.\n\n237\n00:10:04.655 --> 00:10:07.530\nThis is just the default page,\nI haven't changed anything.\n\n238\n00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:14.370\nNow, I think maybe if you're not\none to share tax documents or\n\n239\n00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.940\nsomething with your kids, or whatever,\nyou can go through and change that.\n\n240\n00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.800\nPictures, videos, but\nthat's just the default, how it is there.\n\n241\n00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.750\nWe'll go ahead and share for this demo.\n\n242\n00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.398\nI don't even know if I have a document,\nwe should create one though.\n\n243\n00:10:30.398 --> 00:10:30.922\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.550\n&gt;&gt; So we can see it play out.\n\n245\n00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:39.779\nAnd let's see, let's do that while\nwe're creating this homegroup.\n\n246\n00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:41.120\nIt's not gonna let me at this moment.\n\n247\n00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.470\nLet's just let that go.\n\n248\n00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:43.950\nOkay, this is what I was talking about,\n\n249\n00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.720\nsomething that you probably won't like.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n250\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.940\n&gt;&gt; What is wrong with this picture,\n\n251\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.113\nDaniel?\n&gt;&gt; That is a very difficult to remember\n\n252\n00:10:49.113 --> 00:10:51.701\npassword for one thing,\nif you're trying to remember, so\n\n253\n00:10:51.701 --> 00:10:53.716\nyou probably have to write it down.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n254\n00:10:53.716 --> 00:10:54.917\n&gt;&gt; Plus, it's not obfuscated or\n\n255\n00:10:54.917 --> 00:10:55.836\nanything.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n256\n00:10:55.836 --> 00:10:57.737\nit's in clear text right there.\n&gt;&gt; Here you go.\n\n257\n00:10:57.737 --> 00:11:00.336\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So those are two big things.\n\n258\n00:11:00.336 --> 00:11:01.092\nCuz number one,\n\n259\n00:11:01.092 --> 00:11:04.360\nhow's your kid gonna remember this\nif it was designed for home use?\n\n260\n00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.789\nBut the good news is you\ncan change that easily.\n\n261\n00:11:06.789 --> 00:11:08.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, it goes back to the whole idea\n\n262\n00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.812\nof the homegroup.\n\n263\n00:11:08.812 --> 00:11:10.676\nIt's not supposed to be difficult.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n264\n00:11:10.676 --> 00:11:12.855\n&gt;&gt; I mean, we always say about security,\n\n265\n00:11:12.855 --> 00:11:13.845\nthe easier it is,\n\n266\n00:11:13.845 --> 00:11:16.935\nthe less security is involved.\n&gt;&gt; The more difficult it is, it probably\n\n267\n00:11:16.935 --> 00:11:19.965\nhas more security, so I get the idea.\n&gt;&gt; There's also an option to print\n\n268\n00:11:19.965 --> 00:11:23.464\nthe password and the instructions here.\n&gt;&gt; Put it underneath your keyboard.\n\n269\n00:11:23.464 --> 00:11:23.994\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n270\n00:11:23.994 --> 00:11:25.602\ntape it on your refrigerator.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n271\n00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.127\nright there on the monitor.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n272\n00:11:27.127 --> 00:11:28.630\njust know that you do\nhave the option there.\n\n273\n00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.060\nWe're just gonna hit Finish for now.\n\n274\n00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.672\nBut I will go back in and then show you\nright here, you can change the password.\n\n275\n00:11:34.672 --> 00:11:39.490\nAll right, so let's do that before,\nbecause I don't remember the other one.\n\n276\n00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.530\nDo you?\n&gt;&gt; That's nice though,\n\n277\n00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.690\nthey let you choose your own password.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n278\n00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.980\n&gt;&gt; So it's not some random string of text.\n\n279\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.741\nI hate when you get\nthose wireless APs and-\n\n280\n00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:49.277\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n281\n00:11:49.277 --> 00:11:50.452\n&gt;&gt; It's on the bottom of it or whatever.\n\n282\n00:11:50.452 --> 00:11:53.384\nIt's this entirely crazy string of text.\n&gt;&gt; Like a sentence, yeah.\n\n283\n00:11:53.384 --> 00:11:53.921\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n284\n00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:55.948\nit's frustrating.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n285\n00:11:55.948 --> 00:11:56.850\nwe've changed the password.\n\n286\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.990\nThat should be easy enough for us.\n\n287\n00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.340\nAnd while we're here, let's go ahead,\nstill on this system,\n\n288\n00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.510\nlet me just close this.\n\n289\n00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.830\nAll right,\nlet's get some documents in here.\n\n290\n00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.309\nSo you can see this icon already\njust from File Explorer.\n\n291\n00:12:20.001 --> 00:12:21.858\n&gt;&gt; I'll get really creative with my\n\n292\n00:12:21.858 --> 00:12:24.255\ndocuments here and name this one DemoDoc.\n\n293\n00:12:24.255 --> 00:12:27.364\nAll right, now-\n&gt;&gt; I see what you did there,\n\n294\n00:12:27.364 --> 00:12:30.273\ncuz it's a demo for you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:12:30.273 --> 00:12:31.579\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n296\n00:12:31.579 --> 00:12:35.315\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] let's see here.\n\n297\n00:12:35.315 --> 00:12:37.765\nI think I'm gonna need to go ahead and\n\n298\n00:12:37.765 --> 00:12:40.960\nbring one other machine up.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, so\n\n299\n00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.780\nwe got this thing set up now.\n\n300\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.890\nIs that basically it?\n\n301\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.190\nHow easy is it for\nthe other users to connect to it?\n\n302\n00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:46.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Daniel,\n\n303\n00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.690\nit should be that easy and\nthat's the idea behind it.\n\n304\n00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.990\nSo let's go ahead and take a look and\nto see how easy it really is.\n\n305\n00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:58.470\nSo keep in mind that you would be\nable to connect to Windows 7, 8, 8.1,\n\n306\n00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.050\nto go ahead if you have varied\ndevices within your environment there.\n\n307\n00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.640\nSo, again, I'm just gonna go ahead and\ndo a search for HomeGroup.\n\n308\n00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:12.370\nAll right, I'll go ahead and pull that up.\n\n309\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.682\nNow, another potential test\nquestion would be this,\n\n310\n00:13:15.682 --> 00:13:19.000\nhomegroups are gonna be\nworking on private networks.\n\n311\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.370\nSo if I had my network profile set to\na public network, there'll be a fly out\n\n312\n00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:31.610\nthat comes out where you can change that\nsetting to a private network instead.\n\n313\n00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.816\nWhich makes sense, right?\n\n314\n00:13:32.816 --> 00:13:35.521\nWe don't wanna be sharing\neverything with everyone, so-\n\n315\n00:13:35.521 --> 00:13:36.716\n&gt;&gt; You're making my job harder.\n\n316\n00:13:36.716 --> 00:13:38.006\nCome on.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n317\n00:13:38.006 --> 00:13:39.446\n&gt;&gt; Now, of course you could always go in\n\n318\n00:13:39.446 --> 00:13:41.780\nand manually change those if\nyou didn't get that fly out.\n\n319\n00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.000\nBut that's usually what happens,\nor should, anyways.\n\n320\n00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.790\nNow notice that it says,\n\n321\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:52.300\nCherokee on CLIENT04 has created\na homegroup on the network.\n\n322\n00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.721\nSo it's asking me,\nI didn't need to do anything here.\n\n323\n00:13:55.721 --> 00:14:00.150\nSo that kinda goes to the whole\nnotion of ease of access there.\n\n324\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.320\nAnd this magnifier is driving me nuts,\nguys.\n\n325\n00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.010\nBut it's okay, we'll get through this.\n\n326\n00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.570\nI'm just gonna hit the Join now button.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n327\n00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:12.230\nyou're not default joined,\neven though you created the workgroup.\n\n328\n00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.686\nYou have to join it\nonce you've created it?\n\n329\n00:14:14.686 --> 00:14:16.065\n&gt;&gt; No, this is the other client.\n\n330\n00:14:16.065 --> 00:14:16.853\n&gt;&gt; You're on the other client,\n\n331\n00:14:16.853 --> 00:14:17.365\nthat's right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n332\n00:14:17.365 --> 00:14:18.121\nI switched clients.\n&gt;&gt; Wait,\n\n333\n00:14:18.121 --> 00:14:19.519\nyou've gotta put different\nbackgrounds on that client.\n\n334\n00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:20.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n335\n00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.065\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n336\n00:14:21.065 --> 00:14:23.190\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, she's on the same one.\n\n337\n00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.092\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] No, so\n\n338\n00:14:24.092 --> 00:14:26.910\nthis is like my child's computer.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, I'm following you.\n\n339\n00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I have set it up.\n\n340\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.170\nAnd then now I'll just say, okay,\ntell my kid hey, type in homegroup.\n\n341\n00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.470\nAnd it already says, hey,\nCherokee created a homegroup.\n\n342\n00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.180\nDo you want to join, right?\n\n343\n00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.830\nAnd so then we just hit Join,\nand then Next.\n\n344\n00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.740\nNow, I also will get this same option that\nI saw before as to what I want to share\n\n345\n00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.405\nfrom this side.\n\n346\n00:14:44.405 --> 00:14:47.700\nSo it's gonna be bi-directional\nwith the sharing there.\n\n347\n00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.840\nUnless you wanted it uni-directional,\nthen you could use one of these drop-down.\n\n348\n00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.800\nAnd then just say Not Shared if you wanted\nto keep pictures private or whatever.\n\n349\n00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.880\nSo I'm gonna just to go through and\nhit Next.\n\n350\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:02.145\nDo you remember the password?\n&gt;&gt; No, [LAUGH] you weren't paying\n\n351\n00:15:02.145 --> 00:15:06.314\nattention either?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I never am,\n\n352\n00:15:06.314 --> 00:15:08.785\nDaniel.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n353\n00:15:08.785 --> 00:15:11.935\ngood stuff.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if I can remember\n\n354\n00:15:11.935 --> 00:15:14.688\nthe password, I should be good to go.\n&gt;&gt; Here's hoping right?\n\n355\n00:15:14.688 --> 00:15:15.216\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n356\n00:15:15.216 --> 00:15:16.250\n&gt;&gt; Fingers crossed.\n\n357\n00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.103\n&gt;&gt; Yep, fingers crossed.\n\n358\n00:15:18.103 --> 00:15:22.693\nNetwork connectivity, so as long as\nyou're connected to your network,\n\n359\n00:15:22.693 --> 00:15:27.590\nthere is a little automated connection\nwizard if you do experience problems.\n\n360\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.300\nI think the main problem\nwould be just the setting for\n\n361\n00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.080\nyour profile there on your system.\n\n362\n00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.410\nBut I guess it will help\nyou if you need help there.\n\n363\n00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:41.820\nWe've joined the homegroup, and\nlike I said, it really is that easy.\n\n364\n00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:47.170\nNow let me just go ahead and\ntry to connect.\n\n365\n00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.208\nOr, I have a couple of files.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n366\n00:15:49.208 --> 00:15:54.409\nhow do you access these shared resources?\n&gt;&gt; So okay, I forgot I had names,\n\n367\n00:15:54.409 --> 00:15:57.794\nI was Barbara on the other computer.\n&gt;&gt; Barb.\n\n368\n00:15:57.794 --> 00:16:01.016\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's my child's computer.\n\n369\n00:16:01.016 --> 00:16:04.194\n[CROSSTALK] Okay, so you can see, so\nnow I'm back on the first computer.\n\n370\n00:16:04.194 --> 00:16:07.370\nAnd it really doesn't matter at this\npoint, and it should be the same for both.\n\n371\n00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.863\nBut that little marble icon that you\nwere talking about with the spinny?\n\n372\n00:16:10.863 --> 00:16:11.675\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n373\n00:16:11.675 --> 00:16:12.835\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so bottom left,\n\n374\n00:16:12.835 --> 00:16:16.350\nyou've got two different icons here,\nso Barbara and then Cherokee.\n\n375\n00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.290\nAnd then you have the little\nexpandable arrows, or carets,\n\n376\n00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.670\nwhatever you wanna call them.\n\n377\n00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.550\nAnd then you can go through and\njust drill down to search for.\n\n378\n00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.840\nIf you guys can see this,\nI'll zoom in a little bit.\n\n379\n00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.245\nYou can see the directories that are\npopulating as I am going through it, so\n\n380\n00:16:30.245 --> 00:16:32.270\nwhatever it is that I had shared.\n\n381\n00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.610\nNow this is my own computer, so\n\n382\n00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.320\nI really wouldn't want to be\nworking with anything there.\n\n383\n00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.270\nWork on it through your regular directory,\nyour documents or\n\n384\n00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.620\nwherever those local files are.\n\n385\n00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:46.582\nBut then you could go ahead and, I don't\nhave any music or videos for Barbara.\n\n386\n00:16:46.582 --> 00:16:50.280\nLet me zoom out.\n\n387\n00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:56.190\nLet's go back to the other one and\nsee if we can look at something special.\n\n388\n00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.050\n&gt;&gt; We should drop in a document, Rules for\n\n389\n00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.390\nSurviving the Upside Down, for Barb.\n&gt;&gt; The\n\n390\n00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.334\nupside down?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n391\n00:17:02.334 --> 00:17:02.849\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n392\n00:17:02.849 --> 00:17:04.275\n&gt;&gt; You didn't watch Stranger Things?\n\n393\n00:17:04.275 --> 00:17:04.841\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n394\n00:17:04.841 --> 00:17:06.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you gotta watch that.\n\n395\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.485\nJustice for Barb, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n396\n00:17:09.485 --> 00:17:11.415\n&gt;&gt; I can tell by her face that she is\n\n397\n00:17:11.415 --> 00:17:14.506\nunfamiliar with it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no movie references over here.\n\n398\n00:17:14.506 --> 00:17:16.110\n&gt;&gt; It's like, I don't watch television!\n\n399\n00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right.\n\n400\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:23.290\nSo let's go into Documents, and\nwe should see that really fancy one.\n\n401\n00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.831\nSo this is that DemoDoc, Daniel,\nthat we had created from before.\n\n402\n00:17:26.831 --> 00:17:30.440\nAnd I keep doing that\nwith my zoom [LAUGH].\n\n403\n00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.710\nBut this is the document that we had\ncreated on Cherokee's computer, and\n\n404\n00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.730\nI'm talking about myself in third person.\n&gt;&gt; Like you're not even here.\n\n405\n00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:38.450\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\n\n406\n00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.890\nthis is actually Barbara's computer,\nwhere we're seeing this.\n\n407\n00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:41.429\nSo I could go in-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n408\n00:17:41.429 --> 00:17:45.610\nwe're seeing the resource on the Cherokee\ncomputer, on the Barbara computer,\n\n409\n00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.256\nusing the homegroup connection.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it's really that-\n\n410\n00:17:48.256 --> 00:17:48.864\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty simple.\n\n411\n00:17:48.864 --> 00:17:49.637\n&gt;&gt; It's really that easy.\n\n412\n00:17:49.637 --> 00:17:52.610\nAnd I could go in and\nmodify it or whatever from there.\n\n413\n00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.184\nSo it's a cool idea, cool concept.\n\n414\n00:17:55.184 --> 00:17:56.710\nBut unfortunately,\n\n415\n00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.680\nit's kinda being phased out.\n&gt;&gt; Are there any kind of security\n\n416\n00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.210\nprotections in a homegroup?\n\n417\n00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.610\nOr is everything just a Wild West, and\nyou can do whatever you want to Barb's\n\n418\n00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.930\ncomputer, and Barb can do whatever\nyou want to your computer,\n\n419\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.658\nvia the shared resources, of course?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's gonna be all or\n\n420\n00:18:10.658 --> 00:18:11.540\nnone there.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n421\n00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.000\n&gt;&gt; So that's why you have the Not Shared\n\n422\n00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.210\noption and Shared.\n\n423\n00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.680\nSo you can't pick and\nchoose on a granular level,\n\n424\n00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.650\nif you have any subfolders\nwithin that directory.\n\n425\n00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.261\nIt is those categories\nthat they picked there.\n\n426\n00:18:23.261 --> 00:18:24.710\n&gt;&gt; So, be careful with your sharing when\n\n427\n00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.328\nit comes to the homegroup.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n428\n00:18:26.328 --> 00:18:27.838\n&gt;&gt; Sharing is not always caring.\n\n429\n00:18:27.838 --> 00:18:29.343\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right [LAUGH].\n\n430\n00:18:29.343 --> 00:18:30.953\n&gt;&gt; But I think that's it for\n\n431\n00:18:30.953 --> 00:18:33.721\nthis particular homegroup/workgroup.\n\n432\n00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:37.362\nWe'll look at workgroup compared\nto domain in subsequent shows,\n\n433\n00:18:37.362 --> 00:18:39.980\njust to kinda see the difference there.\n\n434\n00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.676\nBut I think that's about it for\nnow, Daniel.\n\n435\n00:18:41.676 --> 00:18:42.404\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\n\n436\n00:18:42.404 --> 00:18:44.424\nhomegroups are a whole lot of fun.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n437\n00:18:44.424 --> 00:18:45.331\n&gt;&gt; We had a good time with them.\n\n438\n00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:49.595\nAnd if you have a small home network and\nyour operating system still supports it,\n\n439\n00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:53.308\nthey can be easy to get things set up\nif you want to start sharing stuff.\n\n440\n00:18:53.308 --> 00:18:56.370\nSo Cherokee, we have you to thank for\nshowing us how we can do that.\n\n441\n00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.710\nBut it looks like we are out of time for\nthis episode, so\n\n442\n00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:59.780\nwe're gonna call it a day.\n\n443\n00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.331\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n444\n00:19:02.331 --> 00:19:03.346\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n445\n00:19:03.346 --> 00:19:05.255\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n446\n00:19:05.255 --> 00:19:11.505\n[MUSIC]\n\n447\n00:19:11.505 --> 00:19:13.540\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
