[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Cuz Windows 10 is\nsuch a departure from what we're used to.\n\n33\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.300\nAnd then we've seen it before,\nI mean going from Windows XP to Windows 7.\n\n34\n00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.440\nOr, did I skip Vista in there?\n\n35\n00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.160\nOr did I do that intentionally?\n\n36\n00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.220\nTo Windows 8, those kind of steps where,\nit's a new operating system, things are in\n\n37\n00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.610\ndifferent places the start menu,\nI have one or I don't, that kind of thing.\n\n38\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.690\n&gt;&gt; Just small little idiosyncrasies.\n\n39\n00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.700\n&gt;&gt; But you get to Windows 10.\n\n40\n00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.730\n&gt;&gt; And it's a game changer.\n\n41\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.\n\n42\n00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.850\nYou look at the objectives and it's like,\n\n43\n00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.689\nhey, we've got three sections that\ncomprise of about 30 to 35% of this exam.\n\n44\n00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.270\nAnd you're thinking,\nthe three objective domains.\n\n45\n00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.770\nThat's not a lot,\nwe've got, what do we have?\n\n46\n00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.440\nImplement windows for the first domain\nwe have configuring into the port\n\n47\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.550\npoor services and then we also\nhave manage and maintain windows.\n\n48\n00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.270\nWithin there there are a lot of\ndifferent tools and new features and\n\n49\n00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.940\njust really Microsoft or\nwindows as a whole has changed.\n\n50\n00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.400\nThe business model, we've seen\nthis big shift where we don't have\n\n51\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.260\nnecessarily a product per se anymore,\nbut you see the shift for\n\n52\n00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.710\nWindows as as service\nhere with Windows 10.\n\n53\n00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.170\nAnd that, I think,\n\n54\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.800\nis the biggest change that we're\nlooking at in this operating system.\n\n55\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.820\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n56\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.660\nAnd we're still in the mix.\n\n57\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.000\nWe can still get a Windows 10 ISO.\n\n58\n00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.460\nWe can install it, we can deploy it.\n\n59\n00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.640\nBut things are shifting, so\nwe're kinda seeing both at this point.\n\n60\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.460\nSo Cherokee, where do we start\nin our journey of installing and\n\n61\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.460\nconfiguring Windows 10?\n\n62\n00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I think the best place to\nstart would be with our specifications,\n\n63\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.090\nlike our hardware requirements.\n\n64\n00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.240\nBecause if you don't have\nthe hardware to go ahead and\n\n65\n00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.040\nrun the operating system, then you're\njust kind of, that's it, right?\n\n66\n00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.690\nSo let's take a look at my screen, and\n\n67\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.630\nI wanna go over a few\nthings that are essential.\n\n68\n00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.690\nNow keep in mind that these\nare going to be the bare minimums.\n\n69\n00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.410\nYou always,\nif you have the ability financially, or\n\n70\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.790\nyou have the right amount of resources.\n\n71\n00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.570\nYou wanna go ahead and think about other\ntypes of software applications or any\n\n72\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.970\nkind of requirements that you may have,\nbut it's important to know the minimums.\n\n73\n00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.020\nBecause let's just say from an exam\nperspective or even a business use case,\n\n74\n00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.980\nif you are provisioning virtual machines\nand your customer wants to get the most\n\n75\n00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.430\nreturn on investment for whatever it is\nthat project that they're rolling out,\n\n76\n00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.980\nthey don't want you over provisioning\nsystems and allocating a ton of\n\n77\n00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.140\nhardware resources if you're only\ngonna be utilizing it 30% or running.\n\n78\n00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.150\nSo we're gonna look at the minimums and\n\n79\n00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.960\nthen of course it's gonna be\nunique on a per use basis here.\n\n80\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.920\n&gt;&gt; One of the things I always like people\nto remember when they're looking at\n\n81\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.120\nthose minimum requirements\n&gt;&gt; One, as Cherokee pointed out,\n\n82\n00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.810\nit is minimum.\n\n83\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.510\nThat means this will run.\n\n84\n00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.420\nDoesn't mean you're gonna\nlike the way it runs, but\n\n85\n00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.500\nit will run on this amount of resources.\n\n86\n00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.020\nAnd two, it's taking into consideration\nnothing other than the operating system.\n\n87\n00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.900\nSo as soon as put your first\napplication and try to run it.\n\n88\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.470\nNow you're running out of resources cuz\nyour operating system is already running\n\n89\n00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.190\nat the minimum.\n\n90\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.960\nSo definitely as Cherokee says,\nthe more you can put in there,\n\n91\n00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.790\nthe better off you're going to be.\n\n92\n00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.880\nBut for the exam, you have to know, hey,\n\n93\n00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.490\nwhat is absolutely required to get\nthis operating system installed?\n\n94\n00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.810\n&gt;&gt; Right, because you might\nactually see a case study or\n\n95\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.330\nsomething like that where\nthey're giving you a scenario.\n\n96\n00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.790\nYou read through the scenario and\nthen they say, hey, could we go ahead and\n\n97\n00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.300\ndeploy this a certain way.\n\n98\n00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.870\nIt's basically like\nmeeting with a customer.\n\n99\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.270\nYou would have this conversation,\nwhat is your current environment?\n\n100\n00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.580\nWhat kind of requirements do you have?\n\n101\n00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.790\nSecurity requirements, budgeting\nrequirements, and things like that.\n\n102\n00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.290\nSo you might see actual\nquestions wrapped up into\n\n103\n00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.460\na case study that you\nmight see in real life.\n\n104\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.640\nSo let's take a look at the processor\nbecause here you need to have at least one\n\n105\n00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.560\ngigahertz or faster processor.\n\n106\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.550\nOr SOC, which stands for System on a Chip.\n\n107\n00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.520\nNow, when we look at RAM,\nthere are two different categories here.\n\n108\n00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.530\nWe need at least one gig if we're gonna\nbe running a 32 bit architecture.\n\n109\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.540\nHowever, if you plan on\nrunning that 64-bit,\n\n110\n00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.610\nyou're going to need at least 2 GB,\nright here.\n\n111\n00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.130\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n112\n00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.050\nAnd again, like Mike and I are saying,\nthis is minimum for that RAM.\n\n113\n00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.650\nI mean, that would be-\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if you could-\n\n114\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.510\n&gt;&gt; Just like a nightmare.\n\n115\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.790\n&gt;&gt; You know, it's kind of funny, because\nyou look at these specs, and you're like,\n\n116\n00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.680\nwait, a 1 Gigahertz processor?\n\n117\n00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.590\n2 GB of RAM.\n\n118\n00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.200\nI would have to special\norder that from somewhere\n\n119\n00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.130\nto get that few resources\nput in the systems.\n\n120\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.620\nSo if you're buying a new system or\nbuilding one,\n\n121\n00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.010\nmost likely these are not\ngonna affect you at all.\n\n122\n00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.960\nBut if we're thinking about upgrading,\ncuz companies, it's easy for us to think.\n\n123\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.460\nI'm just gonna go buy a new laptop.\n\n124\n00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.150\nBut what if you're buying hundreds or\nthousands of machines?\n\n125\n00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.490\nOr you're trying to keep\nMachines in production, right?\n\n126\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.160\nUpgrades are really where these\nminimum requirements come into play.\n\n127\n00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.220\nCuz it might have ran Windows 7 fine,\nbut will it run Windows 10?\n\n128\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.190\n&gt;&gt; And when you're creating your Virtual\nMachines and you're trying to think about\n\n129\n00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.960\nhow much of these resources should we\nallocate, this is a good starting point.\n\n130\n00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.090\nBut you definitely, like we said\nYou wanna test that out first.\n\n131\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now looking at your hard disk space\n\n132\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.590\nagain.\n\n133\n00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.730\nKind of mirroring what Mike was saying.\n\n134\n00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.915\nWoah, 16 gigs for your 32 bit.\n\n135\n00:06:23.915 --> 00:06:26.630\n[LAUGH] And then also here 20 gigs,\n\n136\n00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.280\na little bit more, for\nthat 64 bit architecture as well.\n\n137\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.930\nNow, for your graphics card, you're going\nto need at least DirectX 9 or later.\n\n138\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.230\nAgain, that's pretty common if you're\nbuying a newer piece of hardware.\n\n139\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.630\nThen that's going to come\nintegrated as well as your WDDM for\n\n140\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.050\nthose drivers to support that display,\nagain.\n\n141\n00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.950\nWe're at 800x600, so I think as long as\nyou check those, these are essentials and\n\n142\n00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.150\nthey're almost kind of like gimme\nquestions, because, they're essential.\n\n143\n00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.240\nYou need to know what they are.\n\n144\n00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.530\nSo if you can memorize those and just\nunderstand that then you're good to go.\n\n145\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.960\n&gt;&gt; I like easy questions.\n\n146\n00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.460\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n147\n00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.190\nOkay, now let's take a look at\nWell maybe I'm really not sure.\n\n148\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.160\nSo I know I've passed the hurdle, I've\nchecked my hardware, and I'm good to go.\n\n149\n00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.920\nBut I'm not really sure if Windows 10\nis right for me, so how can I tell?\n\n150\n00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.440\nWell, the good news is, Microsoft hands us\na ton of tools to streamline this process.\n\n151\n00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.860\nAnd I think maybe the hardest part\nof it all is just understanding what\n\n152\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.600\ntools to use, where can I find these\ntools and how can they help me.\n\n153\n00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.030\nSo I've tried to put\nthese links together for\n\n154\n00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.130\nyou to kind of streamline this as well.\n\n155\n00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.210\nSo one that I have a feeling Microsoft\nreally wants you to understand is called\n\n156\n00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.490\nthe Microsoft Assessment and\nPlanning Toolkit.\n\n157\n00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.790\nSo we'll be taking a look\nat this a little bit later.\n\n158\n00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:57.335\nBut I just wanna introduce this to you,\nas well as somewhere,\n\n159\n00:07:57.335 --> 00:08:02.800\nlet me see, I have a ton of\ntabs here open, but your ADK.\n\n160\n00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.692\nThis is the Windows Assessment and\nDeployment Kit.\n\n161\n00:08:05.692 --> 00:08:09.122\nThis is kind of like a bundle or\nlike a suitcase and\n\n162\n00:08:09.122 --> 00:08:12.302\nits got all these little\ntools inside of it and\n\n163\n00:08:12.302 --> 00:08:17.157\na lot of these tools that we will be\nlooking out throughout this series\n\n164\n00:08:17.157 --> 00:08:21.536\nactually are kind of fun on their own,\nbut maybe like a party.\n\n165\n00:08:21.536 --> 00:08:24.396\nLike when you start adding more,\nyou get more fun.\n\n166\n00:08:24.396 --> 00:08:27.725\nSo you get better features and\nthey just work.\n\n167\n00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:31.232\nThey are really designed in\na modular way to work together.\n\n168\n00:08:31.232 --> 00:08:36.127\nSo if you wanted to see what was included\nin our ADK, in our assessment and\n\n169\n00:08:36.127 --> 00:08:40.634\ndeployment kit, let me go ahead and\nclick on this link right here.\n\n170\n00:08:40.634 --> 00:08:45.381\nSome really great documentation and\nI'll scroll down, and maybe zoom in so\n\n171\n00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:46.800\nyou guys can see this.\n\n172\n00:08:50.099 --> 00:08:55.049\nSo you'll see some of these tools that\nwe'll talk about and just know that they\n\n173\n00:08:55.049 --> 00:09:00.692\nare available like the Windows Assessment\nToolkit, Windows Configuration Designer.\n\n174\n00:09:00.692 --> 00:09:05.451\nThese are going to be really focal\npoints within this series and also for\n\n175\n00:09:05.451 --> 00:09:09.355\nthe 697, which is complimentary\nto this show as well.\n\n176\n00:09:09.355 --> 00:09:11.887\nI just wanted to let you know that hey,\n\n177\n00:09:11.887 --> 00:09:15.066\nyou can grab it from this\nparticular link here.\n\n178\n00:09:15.066 --> 00:09:18.691\nBut also if you didn't want all of those,\nMicrosoft does break it down for\n\n179\n00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.281\nindividual downloads as well.\n\n180\n00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:24.004\nSo you can just kind of piecemeal\nthem together as you choose.\n\n181\n00:09:24.004 --> 00:09:31.299\nNow if you're really confused as to, look,\nI have this line of business application.\n\n182\n00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:33.725\nMy system isn't even going\nto be worth anything,\n\n183\n00:09:33.725 --> 00:09:36.450\nif I don't have this particular\napplication running.\n\n184\n00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.488\nThat's gonna be the deciding factor there.\n\n185\n00:09:39.488 --> 00:09:41.768\nWell, they put together this website.\n\n186\n00:09:41.768 --> 00:09:46.318\nSo you can just, I wouldn't say\nit's 100% comprehensive, but\n\n187\n00:09:46.318 --> 00:09:49.937\nthe most common applications\nare gonna be noted here.\n\n188\n00:09:49.937 --> 00:09:54.993\nThey even put a chart for their most\ncommon to see with what versions.\n\n189\n00:09:54.993 --> 00:09:59.069\nLet me zoom in, so you all can\nsee this like Cisco, any connect.\n\n190\n00:09:59.069 --> 00:10:02.754\nSo maybe this is a particular application\nthat your business relies on.\n\n191\n00:10:02.754 --> 00:10:05.465\nYou can look at a quick\nglance to see which versions.\n\n192\n00:10:05.465 --> 00:10:06.801\nWe're going to support that.\n\n193\n00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:10.460\nAnd if you have a custom application\nthat you wanna check on,\n\n194\n00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.340\nyou could go ahead and do that.\n\n195\n00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.921\nNow, I'm just gonna kind of\npick a haphazard one here.\n\n196\n00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:19.455\nSo let's say,\nSlack which is the messaging system.\n\n197\n00:10:19.455 --> 00:10:24.227\nBut perhaps that was something that was\nintegral that my business functionality.\n\n198\n00:10:24.227 --> 00:10:27.398\nSo I'm gonna check to see if\nWindows 10 is even a viable option.\n\n199\n00:10:27.398 --> 00:10:33.317\nSo I'll check and here,\nyou can see that Slack is adopted.\n\n200\n00:10:33.317 --> 00:10:37.128\nSo at least I can start making\nthose business decisions and\n\n201\n00:10:37.128 --> 00:10:41.948\nkind of formulate a plan to present to\nsomeone, if I'm not the decider for\n\n202\n00:10:41.948 --> 00:10:45.249\nthe IT department or\nwhatever your situation is.\n\n203\n00:10:45.249 --> 00:10:49.327\nJust kind of giving you a lot\nof tools at your disposal.\n\n204\n00:10:49.327 --> 00:10:52.344\nSo what else do we got here?\n\n205\n00:10:52.344 --> 00:10:55.017\nOnce, let's say we've decided,\nhey, you know what?\n\n206\n00:10:55.017 --> 00:10:57.680\nWindows 10 is a good choice for me.\n\n207\n00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.320\nWe need to start thinking about how\nwe're going to get that operating\n\n208\n00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.880\nsystem deployed.\n\n209\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.970\nThere are different situations, different\ninstances that you need to consider.\n\n210\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:12.800\nSo Microsoft breaks it down into these\nthree categories here and we'll talk\n\n211\n00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.900\nabout them holistically, and then look\nat them a little bit more individually.\n\n212\n00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.128\nThe first one is going to be wipe and\nload.\n\n213\n00:11:20.128 --> 00:11:21.426\nIt's kind of a funny name.\n\n214\n00:11:21.426 --> 00:11:24.265\nI used to know it as just a clean install.\n\n215\n00:11:24.265 --> 00:11:25.984\nMaybe like a bare-bones install.\n\n216\n00:11:25.984 --> 00:11:30.566\nBut basically, it's kind of like\ngetting a fresh new haircut.\n\n217\n00:11:30.566 --> 00:11:32.438\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So starting fresh and\n\n218\n00:11:32.438 --> 00:11:37.336\nwe'll take a look at that a little bit\nmore, but where this is important?\n\n219\n00:11:37.336 --> 00:11:39.847\nI wanted to kind of lay out these steps.\n\n220\n00:11:39.847 --> 00:11:43.341\nBecause if you've never taken\na Microsoft exam before,\n\n221\n00:11:43.341 --> 00:11:47.945\nthere are sometimes situations where\nyou need to know sequential orders.\n\n222\n00:11:47.945 --> 00:11:53.096\nSo this could be really helpful there just\nunderstanding how this process works.\n\n223\n00:11:53.096 --> 00:11:58.456\nSo looking at that wipe and load, you're\ngonna capture the data and settings.\n\n224\n00:11:58.456 --> 00:12:05.148\nSo I wouldn't say 100% synonymous,\nbut very similar to backing up.\n\n225\n00:12:05.148 --> 00:12:06.623\nSo if you create the backup,\n\n226\n00:12:06.623 --> 00:12:10.015\nit may be an additional not like\nyour normal enterprise backups.\n\n227\n00:12:10.015 --> 00:12:14.244\nBut hey, let's just make sure we have\na good working order of that information,\n\n228\n00:12:14.244 --> 00:12:16.622\nanything that I want\nto permanently retain.\n\n229\n00:12:16.622 --> 00:12:19.269\nBecause like I said,\nwe're wiping this information.\n\n230\n00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:21.769\nYou are wiping the system out.\n\n231\n00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:26.644\nWe're gonna deploy images, they can be\ncustom here and then we'll go ahead and\n\n232\n00:12:26.644 --> 00:12:31.011\ninstall or inject our drivers and\napplications and restore the data and\n\n233\n00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:32.266\nsettings that way.\n\n234\n00:12:32.266 --> 00:12:34.819\nSo really,\nthere's not too many situations.\n\n235\n00:12:34.819 --> 00:12:37.241\nI can't think of a situation\nwhere this would be horrible.\n\n236\n00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:41.014\nI don't know if you can, Mike,\nbut I think it's pretty viable.\n\n237\n00:12:41.014 --> 00:12:43.578\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's usually one\nof our favorite ways to go.\n\n238\n00:12:43.578 --> 00:12:46.766\nBecause you are removing all traces\nof the old operating system.\n\n239\n00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.854\nThere's no DLLs or\nanything weird hanging out.\n\n240\n00:12:49.854 --> 00:12:52.264\nThere may be-\n&gt;&gt; Residual lingering problems.\n\n241\n00:12:52.264 --> 00:12:55.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, little quirky things can go\nwrong when some DLLs get overwritten and\n\n242\n00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.408\nthey shouldn't have or they don't get\noverwritten and they should have.\n\n243\n00:12:59.408 --> 00:13:04.031\nSo quirky things can happen\nsometimes during an upgrade process.\n\n244\n00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:06.754\nThe only reason I can think\nthat you wouldn't do a wipe and\n\n245\n00:13:06.754 --> 00:13:10.044\nload though is if you had a line of\nbusiness, a custom application and\n\n246\n00:13:10.044 --> 00:13:12.849\nit wasn't easy to get the source\nfiles to reinstall that.\n\n247\n00:13:12.849 --> 00:13:16.586\nSo you need to try to preserve that app or\nsomething like that.\n\n248\n00:13:16.586 --> 00:13:21.141\nBut most of the time, we can simply\nyou know do some type of export.\n\n249\n00:13:21.141 --> 00:13:23.830\nGet the data off of there and\nthen we install.\n\n250\n00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.618\n&gt;&gt; And there are so many tools available\nto us today that make this process a lot\n\n251\n00:13:28.618 --> 00:13:30.977\neasier than historically has been.\n\n252\n00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:34.477\nNow l agree with Mike,\nl think this is great solution,\n\n253\n00:13:34.477 --> 00:13:36.921\nespecially for Enterprise options.\n\n254\n00:13:36.921 --> 00:13:41.567\nBut Microsoft really wants us to\nlean towards this middle column and\n\n255\n00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:44.267\nthis is going to be an in place upgrade.\n\n256\n00:13:44.267 --> 00:13:46.023\nSo I want you guys to think about that.\n\n257\n00:13:46.023 --> 00:13:49.601\nIn place upgrades will preserve the data,\nsettings,\n\n258\n00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:52.730\napplications and\nthe drivers theoretically.\n\n259\n00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.217\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n260\n00:13:54.217 --> 00:13:56.278\n&gt;&gt; And then you can go ahead and\n\n261\n00:13:56.278 --> 00:14:01.476\ninstall a standard operating system\nimage that as long as the upgrade\n\n262\n00:14:01.476 --> 00:14:07.301\npath is available for you, as long as\nyou're not working in an older system,\n\n263\n00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:10.192\nyou can see here that I have the usage.\n\n264\n00:14:10.192 --> 00:14:13.137\nYou have to be starting with\nat least Windows 7 or later.\n\n265\n00:14:13.137 --> 00:14:17.707\nSo we're not talking XP or Vista for\nthis particular or even older, but\n\n266\n00:14:17.707 --> 00:14:19.701\nfor these operating systems.\n\n267\n00:14:19.701 --> 00:14:22.453\n&gt;&gt; And that's something that's changed and\nwe're talking about all the big\n\n268\n00:14:22.453 --> 00:14:25.738\nchanges that Windows 10 is bringing, and\nthis is one area it's definitely changing.\n\n269\n00:14:25.738 --> 00:14:30.099\nI know you got a lot more to talk about\nit, but I'm old school and wipe and\n\n270\n00:14:30.099 --> 00:14:33.023\nload or\nclean installs was always the way to go.\n\n271\n00:14:33.023 --> 00:14:34.861\nWith Windows 10 though, that is changing.\n\n272\n00:14:34.861 --> 00:14:38.705\nAs you say, you're seeing Microsoft\ndriving you towards those end place\n\n273\n00:14:38.705 --> 00:14:41.997\nupgrades and it's so\neasy to do as long as you're 7 and later.\n\n274\n00:14:41.997 --> 00:14:44.389\nBecause the operating systems are so\nsimilar,\n\n275\n00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:47.936\nthe hardware requirements are the same and\nwe are seeing more of that.\n\n276\n00:14:47.936 --> 00:14:52.034\nAnd really, the upgrades that occur now\nwith this new upgrade model are almost\n\n277\n00:14:52.034 --> 00:14:55.526\nlike doing in place upgrades every\nfew months, every six months.\n\n278\n00:14:55.526 --> 00:14:58.263\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's kind of just\nlike that rolling system here.\n\n279\n00:14:58.263 --> 00:15:00.559\nSo definitely, we see that big change.\n\n280\n00:15:00.559 --> 00:15:05.255\nNow something to think about with the,\nI should have mentioned this prior to.\n\n281\n00:15:05.255 --> 00:15:07.457\nI have this little helpful tool section.\n\n282\n00:15:07.457 --> 00:15:12.366\nBut if you're not 100% sure with your\napplications and how they're gonna be\n\n283\n00:15:12.366 --> 00:15:17.348\ninteracting with the new operating system,\nMicrosoft does provide some tools to\n\n284\n00:15:17.348 --> 00:15:22.212\nhelp at least check and see if they're\ngoing to compatible with the new system.\n\n285\n00:15:22.212 --> 00:15:27.680\nYou might need to go ahead and check for\nupdates for those applications.\n\n286\n00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.043\nSometimes they're not compatible, so\nthat is something you wanna check on.\n\n287\n00:15:32.043 --> 00:15:34.211\nNow, talking about new.\n\n288\n00:15:34.211 --> 00:15:39.049\nThis is also a new component here at\nleast for me and the way that I always\n\n289\n00:15:39.049 --> 00:15:43.487\nwas thinking, because this\nprovisioning is not re-imaging.\n\n290\n00:15:43.487 --> 00:15:46.828\nSo this is not the same as like a wipe and\nload or clean install.\n\n291\n00:15:46.828 --> 00:15:51.424\nSo when you hear this term and I may,\nI gotta really try to use this term.\n\n292\n00:15:51.424 --> 00:15:55.904\nBecause in provisioning, I always thought,\nokay, well, I'm getting things ready.\n\n293\n00:15:55.904 --> 00:16:00.394\nWell, provisioning in Microsoft\nlanguage now is really\n\n294\n00:16:00.394 --> 00:16:05.175\nfocusing on Transforming\na device to an enterprise device.\n\n295\n00:16:05.175 --> 00:16:12.120\nSo let's say maybe I have, you see this\nterm right here, this acronym, CYOD.\n\n296\n00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.330\nSo you might be familiar with the term\nBYOD for bring your own device, but\n\n297\n00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.680\nnow you see something called\nchoose your own device.\n\n298\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.480\nSo it's all about the end user and the\nemployee and giving them options here, so\n\n299\n00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.980\nuser centric.\n\n300\n00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.910\nAnd, If I give someone that opportunity or\nthat capability to choose,\n\n301\n00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:32.680\nmaybe they really like the tablet\nthat they were using at home.\n\n302\n00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.490\nSo maybe it's running Windows 10 Home.\n\n303\n00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.070\nBut they want to bring it into work and\nstart running it there.\n\n304\n00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.570\nWell, we can't take that tablet as is.\n\n305\n00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.430\nThere are some things that we need to do\nto make sure that we're adhering to our\n\n306\n00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.270\ncorporate security policy.\n\n307\n00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:53.090\nAnd making sure that this device is\noptimized for business functionality.\n\n308\n00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.540\nSo that's what provision is.\n\n309\n00:16:54.540 --> 00:17:00.950\nSo I can create provisioning files and\nthen modify\n\n310\n00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:06.880\nthe existing operating system to make it\nworkable or usable in a work environment.\n\n311\n00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.260\nSo that's what provisioning is.\n\n312\n00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.290\nThat's kind of a newer one for\nme, too, there Mike.\n\n313\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it is, and\nwe see this especially like\n\n314\n00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:17.720\nif you're using In Tune as your\nmobile device management platform.\n\n315\n00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.237\nWe can provision Windows 10 devices,\nwe can provision an IOS devices and\n\n316\n00:17:22.237 --> 00:17:27.199\nlike you said, a kind of enterprise wide\npreparation of devices for company use.\n\n317\n00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:31.609\nAnd that means getting those\nsecurity profiles on there,\n\n318\n00:17:31.609 --> 00:17:37.647\nrequiring passwords or pins to get back\ninto the device requiring encryption.\n\n319\n00:17:37.647 --> 00:17:41.347\nMaking those choices for our users so they\ncan use them in our business environment\n\n320\n00:17:41.347 --> 00:17:43.610\nand comply with our security policies.\n\n321\n00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes and this so for\n\n322\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.920\nlike continuous monitoring,\nthis is not what they're referencing here.\n\n323\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.438\nSo that's gonna be an additional solution.\n\n324\n00:17:51.438 --> 00:17:56.008\nSo once you have provision device, then\nyou can go ahead and if you're gonna be\n\n325\n00:17:56.008 --> 00:18:00.441\nusing system center or some other\nmonitoring tool to make sure that there's\n\n326\n00:18:00.441 --> 00:18:05.247\nno configuration drift, or that you\nare still, in like some health compliance.\n\n327\n00:18:05.247 --> 00:18:09.943\nIf you have that kind of incorporated into\nyour security policy then that's something\n\n328\n00:18:09.943 --> 00:18:13.480\nadditional that you would want to\nmake sure stays with that device\n\n329\n00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.070\ndepending on if you have like different\ntypes of agents available for that.\n\n330\n00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:23.120\nBut Windows or Microsoft does provide\na good documentation on where I can go to\n\n331\n00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:29.570\nfind information on how I can go ahead and\nprovision different types of devices here.\n\n332\n00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:33.020\nSo here we can see it applies to\nWindows 10, Windows 10 mobile.\n\n333\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.557\nAnd you know that's another big\nthing I haven't mentioned yet Mike.\n\n334\n00:18:36.557 --> 00:18:38.975\n&gt;&gt; Mh-mm.\nThat a really big change is that,\n\n335\n00:18:38.975 --> 00:18:43.883\nwith the advent of Windows 10,\nthe developers at Microsoft really\n\n336\n00:18:43.883 --> 00:18:48.890\nwanted to stand behind this notion\nof having a cross device platform.\n\n337\n00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:57.370\nLike hey, this operating system works on\nyour laptop or your Xbox or your phone.\n\n338\n00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.820\nSo this is kinda of a cool\nidea that we see here and\n\n339\n00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.740\nthen there's also linkage to provide\ndifferent types of provisioning as well.\n\n340\n00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.195\nThat makes it a little bit easier for\nthe developers I would think.\n\n341\n00:19:07.195 --> 00:19:10.740\nCuz instead of developing four different\napplications for different platforms,\n\n342\n00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.790\nI've got one that's cross platform.\n\n343\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.500\nIf it's running Windows 10,\nit'll run on that device.\n\n344\n00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.750\n&gt;&gt; That's right and on Xbox, that's one\nthat I'm always gonna kinda think about,\n\n345\n00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.970\nbecause we are PlayStation\npeople over here, so.\n\n346\n00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:23.556\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n347\n00:19:23.556 --> 00:19:24.119\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n\n348\n00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:26.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I didn't say that.\n\n349\n00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.260\nAll right, so what else do we have here?\n\n350\n00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.840\nSo knowing what version you're currently\nrunning on is going to be a big\n\n351\n00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.550\ndetermining factor because we'll take\na look at upgrade paths a little bit more.\n\n352\n00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.940\nBut knowing like, let's say, hey I\ndon't want to perform a wipe and load.\n\n353\n00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.040\nI wanna look at an in place upgrade.\n\n354\n00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.590\nHow do I know if my system is\ncapable of allowing that to happen?\n\n355\n00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.420\nSo something we can do here.\n\n356\n00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.220\nAnd let me just go down.\n\n357\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.800\nIf you can either type in Cortana, in\nthe search bar, you can type in about and\n\n358\n00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.310\nit should bring up an information\nicon here that says about your PC.\n\n359\n00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:05.160\nSo right down here in this section,\nyou'll see Windows specifications.\n\n360\n00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.330\nIf I can zoom in a little bit,\nhopefully you guys can see that.\n\n361\n00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.140\nThere we go, right here.\n\n362\n00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.140\nSo we can see that I'm currently\nrunning Windows 10 Enterprise and\n\n363\n00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.730\nI have a Version 17.09,\nyou can see the build as well.\n\n364\n00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.270\nSo this will be a good\nindication to let you know\n\n365\n00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.490\ncurrently where you are in your systems.\n\n366\n00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.430\nThe map tool that I was\ntalking about previously,\n\n367\n00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:30.110\nthat is going to be a really\ncool tool that you guys can use.\n\n368\n00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.950\nSo I can check individually\non my system here.\n\n369\n00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.210\nBut let's say from an enterprise\nperspective, a networking perspective,\n\n370\n00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.960\nI wanna reach out to my network and\nsee if, hey, is Mike's device capable for\n\n371\n00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.050\nthis upgrade?\n\n372\n00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:44.740\nSo that tool is agentless, so\n\n373\n00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:49.420\nit means there's not an active piece\nof software residing on that computer.\n\n374\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:54.330\nAll it does is leverage a WMI query and\nit'll go ahead and pull that information\n\n375\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:58.520\nand generate a report to let you know who\nis available for this particular upgrade.\n\n376\n00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fantastic.\n\n377\n00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:03.100\nCuz I'm definitely not gonna run around\nto every machine if I have thousands of\n\n378\n00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.240\ncomputers where we geographically\nspread out at different offices.\n\n379\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.040\nI can't go to each machine and\ngo to that About screen.\n\n380\n00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.170\nI really don't wanna have to install\na piece of software on every device and\n\n381\n00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.550\nhave a report back, so the fact that\nthey've got this agentless tool,\n\n382\n00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.530\nthat allow me to get a report back and\n\n383\n00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.990\nsee Enterprise Wide, if we're ready\nto start upgrading, is fantastic.\n\n384\n00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so there's a couple other\nthings, so that's really cool because like\n\n385\n00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.150\nMike said, we don't wanna be running\naround sneaker netting things anymore.\n\n386\n00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.060\nAnother way you could quickly tell,\nlet me see if I can remember this.\n\n387\n00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:40.130\nIt's just gonna be Windows r here and\nI think, I already have it pulled up.\n\n388\n00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.850\nLet me zoom in so you can see this.\n\n389\n00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.710\nIt's going to be winver for\nWindows version.\n\n390\n00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.490\nClick OK and\n\n391\n00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.730\nthen it will pull up in a quick glance\nthe same information, if I can find it.\n\n392\n00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.225\nOkay, it's up here at the top left corner.\n\n393\n00:21:52.225 --> 00:21:56.165\nBut you can see here that this also\nhas my versioning information or\n\n394\n00:21:56.165 --> 00:21:57.980\nmaybe you can't because it's so small.\n\n395\n00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.305\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But there you go,\n\n396\n00:21:59.305 --> 00:22:00.995\nnow you should be able to see that.\n\n397\n00:22:00.995 --> 00:22:06.032\nSame info here, just a different\nway about getting that information.\n\n398\n00:22:06.032 --> 00:22:09.692\n&gt;&gt; I like that about screen two,\nbecause just above the Windows versioning\n\n399\n00:22:09.692 --> 00:22:12.699\ninformation is the PC's information,\nhardware-wise.\n\n400\n00:22:12.699 --> 00:22:18.250\nIt's a good time to check on your minimum\nrequirements, RAM, CPU, things like that.\n\n401\n00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:19.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike.\nIt's really great if we can look at that\n\n402\n00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:20.720\ninformation.\n\n403\n00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.048\nAnd any kind of information can be\nhelpful to us during this process.\n\n404\n00:22:24.048 --> 00:22:28.025\nFor instance, if you look at my screen,\nthe information we just obtained,\n\n405\n00:22:28.025 --> 00:22:29.527\nversion 1709, right?\n\n406\n00:22:29.527 --> 00:22:35.339\nSo this can also give us a clue as\nto what type of channels we are on,\n\n407\n00:22:35.339 --> 00:22:40.610\nas far as when and\nhow we obtain update information.\n\n408\n00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.720\nWe're gonna put a pin in this and\ncome back and\n\n409\n00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.710\nlook at this in more detail, but\nI just kind of wanted to point that out.\n\n410\n00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.970\nAny kind of information\nis going to be good for\n\n411\n00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.140\nus, at least getting started here.\n\n412\n00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.220\nSo to that note, let's go ahead and\n\n413\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.950\ntake a look at some information,\nreferencing skills or addition.\n\n414\n00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:04.190\nSo a skill is just going to be short for\nstock keeping unit.\n\n415\n00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:08.226\nAnd let me find that correct, here we go.\n\n416\n00:23:08.226 --> 00:23:12.970\nSo you`ll see different skews for\ndifferent fringe\n\n417\n00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:18.045\noperating systems, so\nin order to maintain with GDPR.\n\n418\n00:23:18.045 --> 00:23:21.936\nMicrosoft has to kind of pull back\nsome of its components, such as\n\n419\n00:23:21.936 --> 00:23:27.260\nthe Windows Media Player if we're talking\nabout shipping overseas and so forth.\n\n420\n00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:33.820\nBut let's take a look at their core or\nthe most used editions here.\n\n421\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.200\nSo I should say these are the editions,\nbut every now and\n\n422\n00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.410\nthen you'll find some slight differences.\n\n423\n00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:42.120\nSo Windows 10 Home, this operating system,\n\n424\n00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:47.070\nif you've been familiar with operating\nsystems in Windows environments for\n\n425\n00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.520\na while, it's kind of got that\nsame nostalgic feeling like, hey,\n\n426\n00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.420\nthis is gonna be really designed for\nmy home user.\n\n427\n00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.071\nIt's going to be at a lower price point.\n\n428\n00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:59.755\nIt doesn't have all the bells and whistles\nand a lot of those enterprise capabilities\n\n429\n00:23:59.755 --> 00:24:02.954\nthat we see, of course,\nwith that higher price, right?\n\n430\n00:24:02.954 --> 00:24:06.029\nSo Just keeping that in mind and\nas we continue and\n\n431\n00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:10.011\nwe'll look specifically at\nthose individual upgrade paths.\n\n432\n00:24:10.011 --> 00:24:13.668\nYou kinda have to think about that\nlike hey, if I'm starting out\n\n433\n00:24:13.668 --> 00:24:17.391\nwith Windows 7 Home edition,\nI shouldn't expect to go ahead and\n\n434\n00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:20.525\nbe running into that Pro edition and\nthings like that.\n\n435\n00:24:20.525 --> 00:24:24.850\nYou kinda have to keep in mind whenever\nyou're looking at these operating systems.\n\n436\n00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:29.228\nSo again, Pro is going to be\nkind of a step up in features\n\n437\n00:24:29.228 --> 00:24:32.386\navailable to us as well as Enterprise.\n\n438\n00:24:32.386 --> 00:24:34.300\nAnd so looking at the size,\n\n439\n00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:39.809\nmaybe I've determined that I wanna use\nthis operating system for my company.\n\n440\n00:24:39.809 --> 00:24:42.397\nSo trying to determine if\nI wanna go with Pro or\n\n441\n00:24:42.397 --> 00:24:45.881\nEnterprise is going to be what\nI really need to look at there.\n\n442\n00:24:45.881 --> 00:24:47.622\nWhat's the size of my organization?\n\n443\n00:24:47.622 --> 00:24:49.854\nAm I looking at a smaller or\na medium sized?\n\n444\n00:24:49.854 --> 00:24:52.328\nPro might be something that I'd choose.\n\n445\n00:24:52.328 --> 00:24:54.895\nOr if I need a larger scale ability,\n\n446\n00:24:54.895 --> 00:25:00.128\nthen Enterprise would probably be\nthe way that my company leans toward.\n\n447\n00:25:00.128 --> 00:25:04.418\nNow looking at Windows 10 Mobile and\nthat's not to say you can't have a mix in\n\n448\n00:25:04.418 --> 00:25:08.838\nyour environment and that's really what\nWindows 10 is all about is having that\n\n449\n00:25:08.838 --> 00:25:11.779\nfunctionality, that option\nto have that mix there.\n\n450\n00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:14.668\nSo again, we see Windows 10 Mobile.\n\n451\n00:25:14.668 --> 00:25:17.269\nNot as many features as the Enterprise,\nbut\n\n452\n00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:20.091\njust knowing that these\noptions are out there.\n\n453\n00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:23.811\nNow, Windows 10 Education is not\ngonna be something you can go out and\n\n454\n00:25:23.811 --> 00:25:25.299\npurchase in a retail venue.\n\n455\n00:25:25.299 --> 00:25:28.362\nThis is going to be on\na licensing option here for\n\n456\n00:25:28.362 --> 00:25:32.356\nthose educational partners,\nreally streamlined for that.\n\n457\n00:25:32.356 --> 00:25:39.389\nNow if you're using Windows 10 IoT Core,\nthat's going to be for your IoT devices.\n\n458\n00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:44.793\nAll sorts of like little projects\nthat you might have running along and\n\n459\n00:25:44.793 --> 00:25:49.464\nwe see this happening or\nthe use of IoT Core more nowadays than\n\n460\n00:25:49.464 --> 00:25:53.414\nwe didn't have this operating\nsystem in the past.\n\n461\n00:25:53.414 --> 00:25:55.596\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it wasn't a thing.\n\n462\n00:25:55.596 --> 00:25:57.943\n&gt;&gt; When there was no Internet of Things.\n\n463\n00:25:57.943 --> 00:25:59.625\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there weren't any thing.\n\n464\n00:25:59.625 --> 00:26:01.659\n&gt;&gt; But it was, but\nit wasn't like it is now, I guess.\n\n465\n00:26:01.659 --> 00:26:03.874\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there wasn't a need,\n\n466\n00:26:03.874 --> 00:26:06.795\nlet's just say that and then-\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, just a quick aside.\n\n467\n00:26:06.795 --> 00:26:08.818\nIt always makes me laugh,\ncuz we've had an Internet.\n\n468\n00:26:08.818 --> 00:26:10.896\nWe've had things connected\nto the internet, but\n\n469\n00:26:10.896 --> 00:26:12.440\nthat wasn't an Internet of Things.\n\n470\n00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.288\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't like\nan official acronym there.\n\n471\n00:26:14.288 --> 00:26:14.983\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n472\n00:26:14.983 --> 00:26:16.115\n&gt;&gt; With the IoT.\n\n473\n00:26:16.115 --> 00:26:18.139\n&gt;&gt; I know what they mean, but\nI just like picking on them.\n\n474\n00:26:18.139 --> 00:26:21.763\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and some of these you guys\nmight already be familiar with.\n\n475\n00:26:21.763 --> 00:26:24.746\nI just wanna kinda go over them, so\nyou know the options that are out there.\n\n476\n00:26:24.746 --> 00:26:29.383\nBecause even like this one, I was kind of\nlike shocked when I saw this one just kind\n\n477\n00:26:29.383 --> 00:26:31.032\nof jump out the bushes at me.\n\n478\n00:26:31.032 --> 00:26:33.578\nThis Windows 10 S like what is that?\n\n479\n00:26:33.578 --> 00:26:36.460\nBut I might even have a link here,\nyou guys.\n\n480\n00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:41.074\nI'll put it in the show notes,\nbut Windows 10 S is going to be,\n\n481\n00:26:41.074 --> 00:26:43.550\nthat's not the right one.\n\n482\n00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:46.070\nIt's going to be with security.\n\n483\n00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.636\nHere we go, actually.\n\n484\n00:26:47.636 --> 00:26:50.544\nMight as well take a look at\nthis since we're right here, but\n\n485\n00:26:50.544 --> 00:26:52.669\nI will scroll all the way\ndown at the bottom.\n\n486\n00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:55.815\nI think they have a little video\nthat you can watch right here,\n\n487\n00:26:55.815 --> 00:26:58.249\nif you click on this\nlearn about Windows 10 S.\n\n488\n00:26:58.249 --> 00:27:02.770\nSo this is going to be, if you think\nabout the term hardening a system,\n\n489\n00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:06.159\nthis is taking that idea and\nreally running with it.\n\n490\n00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:08.611\nYou're hardening a system\nwith Windows 10 S.\n\n491\n00:27:08.611 --> 00:27:13.692\nYou can only utilize\nWindows Store approved,\n\n492\n00:27:13.692 --> 00:27:16.826\napplications, browsers.\n\n493\n00:27:16.826 --> 00:27:18.569\n&gt;&gt; That's the way I think of that version.\n\n494\n00:27:18.569 --> 00:27:21.637\nThe S stands for store,\nbecause you can only run store apps.\n\n495\n00:27:21.637 --> 00:27:22.296\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n496\n00:27:22.296 --> 00:27:27.664\n&gt;&gt; And it's secured and hardened,\nbecause you can't do anything to it.\n\n497\n00:27:27.664 --> 00:27:30.408\nI can't install off the shelf products.\n\n498\n00:27:30.408 --> 00:27:33.685\nI can't put other things in there that\nare gonna open up security holes.\n\n499\n00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:37.745\nSo I don't know that it's that much more\nsecure than any other version of Windows,\n\n500\n00:27:37.745 --> 00:27:41.225\nbut it's hardened in the fact that you\ncan't do a lot of changes to it and\n\n501\n00:27:41.225 --> 00:27:42.345\nthat's a good thing.\n\n502\n00:27:42.345 --> 00:27:45.936\nAnd for some systems where I don't\nwant my users, maybe it's students and\n\n503\n00:27:45.936 --> 00:27:48.216\nI'm passing out services\nto all the students.\n\n504\n00:27:48.216 --> 00:27:50.289\nI don't want them adding and\ninstalling things.\n\n505\n00:27:50.289 --> 00:27:52.827\nSo definitely see a big future for that.\n\n506\n00:27:52.827 --> 00:27:56.044\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so just knowing that\nthat is available for you also.\n\n507\n00:27:56.044 --> 00:27:58.821\nAnd so if we look at some of\nthe differences here and you guys,\n\n508\n00:27:58.821 --> 00:28:02.150\nI encourage you to spend time and\nreally drill through the differences.\n\n509\n00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:06.543\nMaybe as we continue taking a look at\ndifferent features that the operating\n\n510\n00:28:06.543 --> 00:28:10.449\nsystem has to offer, you might get\nyour wheels turning and think,\n\n511\n00:28:10.449 --> 00:28:13.189\nI wonder if home has\nthat particular feature.\n\n512\n00:28:13.189 --> 00:28:16.608\nOr whatever feature is something that\nyou're like wow, I think that's great.\n\n513\n00:28:16.608 --> 00:28:19.217\nI really wanna take advantage of that and\nleverage it.\n\n514\n00:28:19.217 --> 00:28:21.885\nYou can look at,\nI think I have right here.\n\n515\n00:28:21.885 --> 00:28:24.004\nThere's, oops, somewhere.\n\n516\n00:28:24.004 --> 00:28:27.548\nSorry guys, I have so many tabs going on.\n\n517\n00:28:27.548 --> 00:28:31.755\nMicrosoft does and I'll try to find the\nlinks and put them in the show notes for\n\n518\n00:28:31.755 --> 00:28:34.927\nyou, but there are different\nfeatures like spreadsheets\n\n519\n00:28:34.927 --> 00:28:38.047\nthat show you which features\nare available and whatnot.\n\n520\n00:28:38.047 --> 00:28:41.145\nSo you can make that decision\non your own like Cortana.\n\n521\n00:28:41.145 --> 00:28:43.555\nMaybe that's something you need,\nmaybe it's not.\n\n522\n00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:48.696\nBut just knowing that you\nhave that option there.\n\n523\n00:28:48.696 --> 00:28:56.069\nSo again, this particular website, wrong\none has, let me zoom out a little bit.\n\n524\n00:28:56.069 --> 00:28:57.993\nYou can look at a glance.\n\n525\n00:28:57.993 --> 00:29:01.926\nThey take the two,\nI guess maybe the most popular ones here.\n\n526\n00:29:01.926 --> 00:29:04.558\nHome and Pro and\nkind of line them up side by side, so\n\n527\n00:29:04.558 --> 00:29:06.590\nyou can look at the differences there.\n\n528\n00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:09.373\nBut I think that's enough to get started.\n\n529\n00:29:09.373 --> 00:29:12.328\nI think you guys have plenty\nto look at as far as homework.\n\n530\n00:29:12.328 --> 00:29:16.362\nIf you're not familiar with these editions\nand these deployment options, but\n\n531\n00:29:16.362 --> 00:29:19.144\nthe good news is we're gonna\ncome back with a part two.\n\n532\n00:29:19.144 --> 00:29:22.614\nWe'll take an in-depth look at\nthose deployment options and\n\n533\n00:29:22.614 --> 00:29:24.288\nthen cover a few more things.\n\n534\n00:29:24.288 --> 00:29:26.341\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan, Cherokee.\n\n535\n00:29:26.341 --> 00:29:27.431\nI like what I've heard so far.\n\n536\n00:29:27.431 --> 00:29:31.330\nHope everybody out there has as\nwell look forward to part two.\n\n537\n00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:32.217\nHope to see you back here.\n\n538\n00:29:32.217 --> 00:29:34.818\nBut for now, signing off for ITProTV.\n\n539\n00:29:34.818 --> 00:29:36.149\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n540\n00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.874\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n541\n00:29:36.874 --> 00:29:38.583\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n542\n00:29:38.583 --> 00:29:44.449\n[MUSIC]\n\n543\n00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:47.863\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",
