Very good, Ronny, actually one of the\nthings that you can expect is if you're\n\n10\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.060\nlooking at this content is it's really\nfocused on the certification, the exam.\n\n11\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.916\nBut we want you to keep in mind\nthat maybe you're not going for\n\n12\n00:00:36.916 --> 00:00:38.210\nyour MCSA in Windows 10.\n\n13\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.490\nIf you are,\nthen you're in the right place,\n\n14\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.960\nbecause this is based on the second exam.\n\n15\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.130\nYou could be somebody that\nmaybe is an employer and\n\n16\n00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.270\nyou want to find out a little bit\nmore about Windows 10 for yourself.\n\n17\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.900\nOr maybe you're in a help desk\nsupport technician role right now and\n\n18\n00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.480\nyou want a little bit more\ninformation about Windows 10.\n\n19\n00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.460\nWell, this is a great place to do that.\n\n20\n00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.830\nKeep in mind that two of these exams\nkind of go together, and the content for\n\n21\n00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.830\nthem also go together.\n\n22\n00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.240\nSo we also have recorded the 7697, and\nthat is the first exam that you'll take\n\n23\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.670\nin the MCSA, and we definitely recommend\nyou going back and watching that,.\n\n24\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.910\nAnd then coming back to the 7698 in\norder to get the full benefit of what\n\n25\n00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.390\nwe offer as far as it comes to getting\ncertified for your MCSA in Windows 10.\n\n26\n00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.780\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, what types of topics are we\nreally gonna be covering in this new show\n\n27\n00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.900\nthat we're about to begin?\n\n28\n00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.909\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you've taken some\nprior Windows certification exams,\n\n29\n00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.185\none of the things you might have noticed\nis that they have a lot of local and\n\n30\n00:01:33.185 --> 00:01:36.269\nenterprise level technologies that\nthey ask you questions about.\n\n31\n00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:39.995\nThis is a little bit of a stray\nfrom the earlier format,\n\n32\n00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:45.260\nin the fact that primarily they're\ngonna be considering local management,\n\n33\n00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.100\nright, locally taking care of Windows.\n\n34\n00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.250\nHowever, you do have to keep in\nmind that there will be some\n\n35\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.090\nenterprise based technologies that\nmight make their way into the exam\n\n36\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.290\njust as relevant to\nmanaging Windows itself.\n\n37\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.004\nSo some of the things you can\nlook at is installation and\n\n38\n00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:01.480\nthe configuring of Windows.\n\n39\n00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.670\nWe'll take a look at things like\ninstallations, local installations\n\n40\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.010\nprimarily and then things like\nthe different installation types.\n\n41\n00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.420\nWe'll look at configuring the core\nservices within Windows 10.\n\n42\n00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.803\nAnd again that's gonna be something\nimportant, not only for the certification\n\n43\n00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:20.000\nendeavor, but also if you just want\nmore robust knowledge of Windows 10.\n\n44\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.013\nWe're primarily, and I wanna stress this,\n\n45\n00:02:23.013 --> 00:02:28.180\nprimarily we will be focused on local,\nthe local Windows operating system.\n\n46\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.630\nAnd only really with\nthe enterprise level technologies\n\n47\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.190\nthat are found in the enterprise\nwhere it applies.\n\n48\n00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.090\nThe other thing I want you to keep\nin mind too is that in Windows 8.1,\n\n49\n00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.310\none of the things that it brought in was\nintegration with a few cloud services.\n\n50\n00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.840\nSo you can expect to a see a little\nbit of that in Windows 10,\n\n51\n00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.630\nprimarily focused around\nyour Microsoft account.\n\n52\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.566\nSomething that they brought in,\nan integration with a Microsoft account in\n\n53\n00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:54.807\nWindows 8.1, we want you to know, that\nthat'll be one of the other things that\n\n54\n00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:58.019\nyou can expect inside of\nthe Windows 10 70-698 exam.\n\n55\n00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.823\n&gt;&gt; So when we start to take\na look at this idea, then, Wes,\n\n56\n00:03:00.823 --> 00:03:05.040\nwhat are some of the details that I need\nto know if I'm ready to take the exam?\n\n57\n00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, one of the things that\nyou can do is you can always go to\n\n58\n00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.840\nMicrosoft's website.\n\n59\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.530\nIn fact,\nI've pulled it up here on my computer,\n\n60\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.390\nto kinda give you guys a little\nbit of an example of it.\n\n61\n00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.940\nHere on my screen,\nwhat I've gone ahead and\n\n62\n00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.560\ndid is I pulled up the Microsoft\nwebsite that it can show you\n\n63\n00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.930\na lot of the information that you\nneed to know about the 70-698 exam.\n\n64\n00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.488\nI'll get that right here in bit.\n\n65\n00:03:26.488 --> 00:03:29.747\nAnd it'll let you know, it'll let you\nknow a little bit about the format,\n\n66\n00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:30.950\nthe language types there.\n\n67\n00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.130\nKeep in mind,\nI believe there's more than one language,\n\n68\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.740\nbut definitely check that out.\n\n69\n00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.740\nAnd it does show you that the audience\nis geared around IT professionals.\n\n70\n00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.159\nKeep in mind there's not a prerequisite,\nalthough they will tell you that there\n\n71\n00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.990\nare certain things that you really\nshould understand coming into this exam.\n\n72\n00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.160\nOne of the things that I'd like\nto talk about, real briefly here,\n\n73\n00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.380\nare some of the skills measured.\n\n74\n00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.328\nIt really boils down to three\ndifferent major domains, so\n\n75\n00:03:53.328 --> 00:03:56.696\nthe exam is kind of cut into thirds\nin what you'll need to know, and\n\n76\n00:03:56.696 --> 00:03:58.755\nthey deviate a little bit here or there.\n\n77\n00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:00.719\nYou could say 30% or 35%,\n\n78\n00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:05.200\nso it's really gonna be unique to\nyour question bank that you have.\n\n79\n00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.550\nYou can see some of the things that you're\ngonna see here required implementing\n\n80\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.070\nWindows, and then configuring\nthe core services like we said.\n\n81\n00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.940\nAnd then finally managing and\nmaintaining those Windows machines.\n\n82\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.310\nThey also give you some\nadditional preparation options.\n\n83\n00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.060\nNow, what if you're ready to\ntake the exam, how do you do it?\n\n84\n00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.432\nWell you can go to Pearson Vue.\n\n85\n00:04:22.432 --> 00:04:26.490\nPearson VUE is the Microsoft authorized\ntesting platform if you will.\n\n86\n00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.040\nA couple different ways that\nyou can get here if you know\n\n87\n00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.440\njust go to this website really.\n\n88\n00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.520\nMicrosoft 70-698 website,\nand if you schedule an exam,\n\n89\n00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.030\nit's actually gonna flip you right\nover to Pearson VUE's website.\n\n90\n00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.740\nHowever, if you want, you can also go\ndirectly to Pearson VUE website, and\n\n91\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.920\nthey can help you to locate your\nauthorized testing location so\n\n92\n00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.610\nthat you could schedule your exam.\n\n93\n00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.373\nKeep in mind, it's something that\nyou wanna do, and you can see for\n\n94\n00:04:53.373 --> 00:04:56.874\nUS dollars at the time of this\nrecording it's about $165,\n\n95\n00:04:56.874 --> 00:04:59.273\nyou might have to adjust\nthat a little bit.\n\n96\n00:04:59.273 --> 00:05:03.637\nSo if the 70-698 certification is\nsomething you decide that you wanna\n\n97\n00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:08.136\ntake well, this is where you can come to\nget a little bit more information about\n\n98\n00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:10.750\nthis exam, and\nwe'd like to see you pass it.\n\n99\n00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.272\nSo get in there and study,\n\n100\n00:05:12.272 --> 00:05:15.673\nbut keep in mind we've got\na lot more Windows 10 to come.\n\n101\n00:05:15.673 --> 00:05:18.364\n[NOISE]\n\n",
