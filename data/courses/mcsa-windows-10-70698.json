Very good, Ronny, actually one of the\nthings that you can expect is if you're\n\n10\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.060\nlooking at this content is it's really\nfocused on the certification, the exam.\n\n11\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.916\nBut we want you to keep in mind\nthat maybe you're not going for\n\n12\n00:00:36.916 --> 00:00:38.210\nyour MCSA in Windows 10.\n\n13\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.490\nIf you are,\nthen you're in the right place,\n\n14\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.960\nbecause this is based on the second exam.\n\n15\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.130\nYou could be somebody that\nmaybe is an employer and\n\n16\n00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.270\nyou want to find out a little bit\nmore about Windows 10 for yourself.\n\n17\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.900\nOr maybe you're in a help desk\nsupport technician role right now and\n\n18\n00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.480\nyou want a little bit more\ninformation about Windows 10.\n\n19\n00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.460\nWell, this is a great place to do that.\n\n20\n00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.830\nKeep in mind that two of these exams\nkind of go together, and the content for\n\n21\n00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.830\nthem also go together.\n\n22\n00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.240\nSo we also have recorded the 7697, and\nthat is the first exam that you'll take\n\n23\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.670\nin the MCSA, and we definitely recommend\nyou going back and watching that,.\n\n24\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.910\nAnd then coming back to the 7698 in\norder to get the full benefit of what\n\n25\n00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.390\nwe offer as far as it comes to getting\ncertified for your MCSA in Windows 10.\n\n26\n00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.780\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, what types of topics are we\nreally gonna be covering in this new show\n\n27\n00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.900\nthat we're about to begin?\n\n28\n00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.909\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you've taken some\nprior Windows certification exams,\n\n29\n00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.185\none of the things you might have noticed\nis that they have a lot of local and\n\n30\n00:01:33.185 --> 00:01:36.269\nenterprise level technologies that\nthey ask you questions about.\n\n31\n00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:39.995\nThis is a little bit of a stray\nfrom the earlier format,\n\n32\n00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:45.260\nin the fact that primarily they're\ngonna be considering local management,\n\n33\n00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.100\nright, locally taking care of Windows.\n\n34\n00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.250\nHowever, you do have to keep in\nmind that there will be some\n\n35\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.090\nenterprise based technologies that\nmight make their way into the exam\n\n36\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.290\njust as relevant to\nmanaging Windows itself.\n\n37\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.004\nSo some of the things you can\nlook at is installation and\n\n38\n00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:01.480\nthe configuring of Windows.\n\n39\n00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.670\nWe'll take a look at things like\ninstallations, local installations\n\n40\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.010\nprimarily and then things like\nthe different installation types.\n\n41\n00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.420\nWe'll look at configuring the core\nservices within Windows 10.\n\n42\n00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.803\nAnd again that's gonna be something\nimportant, not only for the certification\n\n43\n00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:20.000\nendeavor, but also if you just want\nmore robust knowledge of Windows 10.\n\n44\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.013\nWe're primarily, and I wanna stress this,\n\n45\n00:02:23.013 --> 00:02:28.180\nprimarily we will be focused on local,\nthe local Windows operating system.\n\n46\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.630\nAnd only really with\nthe enterprise level technologies\n\n47\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.190\nthat are found in the enterprise\nwhere it applies.\n\n48\n00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.090\nThe other thing I want you to keep\nin mind too is that in Windows 8.1,\n\n49\n00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.310\none of the things that it brought in was\nintegration with a few cloud services.\n\n50\n00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.840\nSo you can expect to a see a little\nbit of that in Windows 10,\n\n51\n00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.630\nprimarily focused around\nyour Microsoft account.\n\n52\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.566\nSomething that they brought in,\nan integration with a Microsoft account in\n\n53\n00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:54.807\nWindows 8.1, we want you to know, that\nthat'll be one of the other things that\n\n54\n00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:58.019\nyou can expect inside of\nthe Windows 10 70-698 exam.\n\n55\n00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.823\n&gt;&gt; So when we start to take\na look at this idea, then, Wes,\n\n56\n00:03:00.823 --> 00:03:05.040\nwhat are some of the details that I need\nto know if I'm ready to take the exam?\n\n57\n00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, one of the things that\nyou can do is you can always go to\n\n58\n00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.840\nMicrosoft's website.\n\n59\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.530\nIn fact,\nI've pulled it up here on my computer,\n\n60\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.390\nto kinda give you guys a little\nbit of an example of it.\n\n61\n00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.940\nHere on my screen,\nwhat I've gone ahead and\n\n62\n00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.560\ndid is I pulled up the Microsoft\nwebsite that it can show you\n\n63\n00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.930\na lot of the information that you\nneed to know about the 70-698 exam.\n\n64\n00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.488\nI'll get that right here in bit.\n\n65\n00:03:26.488 --> 00:03:29.747\nAnd it'll let you know, it'll let you\nknow a little bit about the format,\n\n66\n00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:30.950\nthe language types there.\n\n67\n00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.130\nKeep in mind,\nI believe there's more than one language,\n\n68\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.740\nbut definitely check that out.\n\n69\n00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.740\nAnd it does show you that the audience\nis geared around IT professionals.\n\n70\n00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.159\nKeep in mind there's not a prerequisite,\nalthough they will tell you that there\n\n71\n00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.990\nare certain things that you really\nshould understand coming into this exam.\n\n72\n00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.160\nOne of the things that I'd like\nto talk about, real briefly here,\n\n73\n00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.380\nare some of the skills measured.\n\n74\n00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.328\nIt really boils down to three\ndifferent major domains, so\n\n75\n00:03:53.328 --> 00:03:56.696\nthe exam is kind of cut into thirds\nin what you'll need to know, and\n\n76\n00:03:56.696 --> 00:03:58.755\nthey deviate a little bit here or there.\n\n77\n00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:00.719\nYou could say 30% or 35%,\n\n78\n00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:05.200\nso it's really gonna be unique to\nyour question bank that you have.\n\n79\n00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.550\nYou can see some of the things that you're\ngonna see here required implementing\n\n80\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.070\nWindows, and then configuring\nthe core services like we said.\n\n81\n00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.940\nAnd then finally managing and\nmaintaining those Windows machines.\n\n82\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.310\nThey also give you some\nadditional preparation options.\n\n83\n00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.060\nNow, what if you're ready to\ntake the exam, how do you do it?\n\n84\n00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.432\nWell you can go to Pearson Vue.\n\n85\n00:04:22.432 --> 00:04:26.490\nPearson VUE is the Microsoft authorized\ntesting platform if you will.\n\n86\n00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.040\nA couple different ways that\nyou can get here if you know\n\n87\n00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.440\njust go to this website really.\n\n88\n00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.520\nMicrosoft 70-698 website,\nand if you schedule an exam,\n\n89\n00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.030\nit's actually gonna flip you right\nover to Pearson VUE's website.\n\n90\n00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.740\nHowever, if you want, you can also go\ndirectly to Pearson VUE website, and\n\n91\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.920\nthey can help you to locate your\nauthorized testing location so\n\n92\n00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.610\nthat you could schedule your exam.\n\n93\n00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.373\nKeep in mind, it's something that\nyou wanna do, and you can see for\n\n94\n00:04:53.373 --> 00:04:56.874\nUS dollars at the time of this\nrecording it's about $165,\n\n95\n00:04:56.874 --> 00:04:59.273\nyou might have to adjust\nthat a little bit.\n\n96\n00:04:59.273 --> 00:05:03.637\nSo if the 70-698 certification is\nsomething you decide that you wanna\n\n97\n00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:08.136\ntake well, this is where you can come to\nget a little bit more information about\n\n98\n00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:10.750\nthis exam, and\nwe'd like to see you pass it.\n\n99\n00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.272\nSo get in there and study,\n\n100\n00:05:12.272 --> 00:05:15.673\nbut keep in mind we've got\na lot more Windows 10 to come.\n\n101\n00:05:15.673 --> 00:05:18.364\n[NOISE]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:17.390\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.040\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with more of our Windows 10 series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.070\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto lend his expertise on that very topic\n\n6\n00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.320\nis the man, the myth,\nthe legend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.570\nWes, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.503\nHow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:30.503 --> 00:00:31.220\n>> Man, it's going great Dan.\n\n10\n00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.190\nIt's always great to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.320\nThank you for having me.\n\n12\n00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.262\nThat's right we're at\nthe fork in the road.\n\n13\n00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:37.680\nAll right, what is the fork in the road?\n\n14\n00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.960\nThat means, well we gotta determine\nif we're gonna implement Windows, and\n\n15\n00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.960\nif, well we can implement Windows.\n\n16\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.480\nBecause how we implement Windows inside\nof our work environment will really\n\n17\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.530\nbe determined by, do we have\nprevious installations of Windows?\n\n18\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.980\nDo we have bare metal hardware?\n\n19\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.480\nAre we deploying new machines?\n\n20\n00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.980\nA lot of times we try to re-purpose old\nmachines cuz companies can't just afford\n\n21\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.790\nto go out on a whim just because a new\noperating system comes out every\n\n22\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.120\ncouple of months or so.\n\n23\n00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.890\nNot couple of months,\n[LAUGH] every couple of years.\n\n24\n00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.260\nWell it came out every couple of months.\n\n25\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.965\nWe'd really be in trouble there.\n\n26\n00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:14.090\nAnd that's what we're gonna look at today.\n\n27\n00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.080\nWe're gonna look at implementing Windows.\n\n28\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.810\nIt's one of the things that\nyou're gonna have to know if you\n\n29\n00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.410\nare attempting the 7698 exam which is\ninstalling and configuring Windows.\n\n30\n00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.990\nSo, why don't we say we\njust jump right in then.\n\n31\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.910\nI've got a website pulled up on my screen\nhere, and this is Microsoft's website.\n\n32\n00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.810\nAnd it shows you some of the system\nrequirements that you're gonna need\n\n33\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.440\nto know for installing Windows.\n\n34\n00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.240\nAnd the other thing that I would say is,\nif you're in an exam environment,\n\n35\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.740\nsome of the things that they like to do is\npresent you with scenario-based questions,\n\n36\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.800\nand they need you to figure out.\n\n37\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.490\nWell, what they're trying to figure is,\n\n38\n00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.200\ndo you know what those requirements\nare to install Windows on your machine?\n\n39\n00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.950\nSo it is important that you do\nunderstand these requirements.\n\n40\n00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.390\nNow, if you are familiar with Windows 7,\n\n41\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.700\nbeen really going back to Vista,\nbut maybe not quite Vista.\n\n42\n00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.120\nVista was a resource hog.\n\n43\n00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.070\nBut Windows 8 and 8.1,\na lot of the requirements were the same.\n\n44\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.060\nSo, a long line of operating systems,\neditions I should say.\n\n45\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.275\nWindows Editions that all have\nabout the same requirements.\n\n46\n00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:24.035\nHowever, keep in mind that what\nis the minimum recommendation\n\n47\n00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:26.935\nis a lot different than will\n\n48\n00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:31.980\nit support the processing power you need\nfor maybe a line of business application.\n\n49\n00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.640\nSo please keep in mind that\nwhen we say requirements,\n\n50\n00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.840\nthese really are the minimum requirements.\n\n51\n00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.380\nAnd in some of our other episodes, you\nmight've seen some of the other hosts say,\n\n52\n00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.710\nthese could be the painful requirements.\n\n53\n00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.690\nSo, do keep that in mind.\n\n54\n00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.780\nFor instance, you see the processor here.\n\n55\n00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.190\nWhen we look at it, well, what do we need?\n\n56\n00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.270\nGigahertz processor.\n\n57\n00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.990\nWell, gigahertz processor, we've had\ngigahertz processors for a while.\n\n58\n00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.620\nIf you're running a gigahertz\nprocessor and that's all it is,\n\n59\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.500\nchances are you probably need\nto upgrade that machine.\n\n60\n00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.614\nBut this really isn't a lecture on [LAUGH]\nstaying up to date with the latest and\n\n61\n00:03:04.614 --> 00:03:05.670\ngreatest.\n\n62\n00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.270\n>> You don't like clicking on\nthings then waiting six hours for\n\n63\n00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.830\nwhat you wanted to do, to do?\n\n64\n00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.374\n>> That's right.\n\n65\n00:03:10.374 --> 00:03:12.218\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You launched up that Windows 95\n\n66\n00:03:12.218 --> 00:03:12.770\nmachine.\n\n67\n00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.730\nYou come back two days later and half of\nthe screen is rendered, so very good.\n\n68\n00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.490\nWe don't want that.\n\n69\n00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.340\nThat's right.\n\n70\n00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.250\nHere's something that's kind of new to\nthe Windows environment in general,\n\n71\n00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.890\nif you'll notice that this\nprocessor right here say SoC.\n\n72\n00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.730\nWell what, oops,\n>> Southern California right?\n\n73\n00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.100\n>> Apparently it's going off\nthe screen here, and I change it,\n\n74\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.640\nlet's try that again there.\n\n75\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.670\n>> That's the lovely Mac trackpad.\n\n76\n00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.430\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n77\n00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.950\n>> Hard at work.\n\n78\n00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.870\n>> Jiminy Clickets everywhere, here.\n\n79\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.776\nAnd I'll try not to say that\ntoo many times in this episode,\n\n80\n00:03:41.776 --> 00:03:43.240\ncuz you'll probably say it.\n\n81\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.100\nBut it's the SoC, so all kidding aside,\nSoC, what is that for us?\n\n82\n00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.660\nThat's System on a Chip.\n\n83\n00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.450\nAnd this is something new to Windows.\n\n84\n00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.280\nYou'll probably be familiar other\noperating systems out there,\n\n85\n00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.670\nlike the RasPi, right?\n\n86\n00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.250\nWe've got the RasPi that's been around for\nawhile right?\n\n87\n00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.990\nArmed based architecture, a small board\nand it'ssystem on a chip everything's\n\n88\n00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.320\nbuilt in and that is a requirement for\nthe Windows 10 IoT core.\n\n89\n00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.240\nThe Internet of things\nanother acronym we're not,\n\n90\n00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.310\nhow should I say,\nwe're not lacks on our acronyms here.\n\n91\n00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.960\nAnd there will be something that you'll\njust probably have to be aware of.\n\n92\n00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.510\nSo, we've got system on a chip.\n\n93\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.310\nThe other thing is a gigabyte of ram.\n\n94\n00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.930\nIf you think about a gigabyte ram,\nmost of our systems takes 64 bits,\n\n95\n00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.830\nwe like 64 bit,\nit'd be a lot more than just 1GB of RAM.\n\n96\n00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.300\nSo the other things which we need to\nbe aware of are the hard drive space.\n\n97\n00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.269\n16 gigs of free space for 32 bit and\nyou'll see a little bit more,\n\n98\n00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:40.990\n20 gigs for 64 bit.\n\n99\n00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.690\nKeep in mind that when you have 64 bit,\n\n100\n00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.880\nyou have two different\nprogram files location.\n\n101\n00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.490\nYou've got an x86 program files, and\n\n102\n00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.290\nthen you've got regular program files\nwhich is your 64 bit applications.\n\n103\n00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.920\nAnd the graphics card here,\n\n104\n00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.730\nlooking at the graphics card when we look,\nwe need support for DirectX 9,\n\n105\n00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.290\nI believe they're up to 11 or\n12 by now so this is the very minimum.\n\n106\n00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.810\nAnd they talk about WDDM,\nthere we go again more of those acronyms.\n\n107\n00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.220\nWhat does that mean, that's\nthe Windows Display Driver Model and\n\n108\n00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.980\nthis is something that goes all\nthe way back to the days of this.\n\n109\n00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.060\nThere was a different model than the XPDM\nthat they had back in the days of\n\n110\n00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.896\nXP that was the XP Driver Model.\n\n111\n00:05:14.896 --> 00:05:19.418\nAnd problem with some of those display\ndrivers is they could get down there and\n\n112\n00:05:19.418 --> 00:05:24.011\nthe kernel and we know a lot of the blue\nscreens happen because of video adapters\n\n113\n00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:25.220\nback in the XP days.\n\n114\n00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.670\nBasically keeps it out of kernel\nmode puts it in user mode.\n\n115\n00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.080\nIt's a little bit better for your system.\n\n116\n00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.700\n>> More stable.\n\n117\n00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.750\n>> That's right, exactly, they maintains\nthe integrity of your operating system.\n\n118\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.810\nGood way to put it there.\n\n119\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.696\nDisplay 800x600.\n\n120\n00:05:35.696 --> 00:05:38.150\nYeah, we are going back to SVGA.\n\n121\n00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.200\n>> That's what they roll.\n\n122\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.430\n>> That's what they are saying.\n\n123\n00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.744\nSo SVGA most people wouldn't be\ncaught dead [LAUGH] to name of\n\n124\n00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:46.310\nSVGA based monitor.\n\n125\n00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.518\n>> 16 colors, right.\n\n126\n00:05:47.518 --> 00:05:48.870\nThat's wonderful.\n\n127\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.062\n>> That's right.\n\n128\n00:05:51.062 --> 00:05:53.050\nWe got 16 byte color.\n\n129\n00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.360\nAnd we can play pong monitor or\nsomething like that.\n\n130\n00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.800\n>> I guess if you had to pull out the old\nCRT for whatever reason, plug it in and\n\n131\n00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.227\nuse it, Would support it.\n\n132\n00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:03.280\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right and when we say that,\n\n133\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.133\nagain, keep in mind this\nis hardware support so\n\n134\n00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:08.620\n[LAUGH] it really is contingent on\nwhatever your video adapter is.\n\n135\n00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.810\nOr if you have integrated\ninto the motherboard itself.\n\n136\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.960\nSo that really takes care of some of,\n\n137\n00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.610\nwell, the minimum requirements\nthat you have to have.\n\n138\n00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.980\nKeep in mind that these\nare painful requirements.\n\n139\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.860\nYou're not gonna get the best user\nexperience if you are using these.\n\n140\n00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.780\nBut let's talk a little bit about\nthe exam, what might you see on the exam?\n\n141\n00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.890\nWell, they might give you\na series of computers.\n\n142\n00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.270\nYou've got 50 of these computers that are\nrunning on Windows 8.1 operating system\n\n143\n00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.040\nand they've got this series of hardware,\nand you need to deploy Windows 10.\n\n144\n00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.670\nWhat do you have to do?\n\n145\n00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.480\nAll right, and they might give you a some\nkind of drag and drop that says upgrade\n\n146\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.960\nthe RAM, upgrade the hard drive,\nupgrade the CPU or none of the above.\n\n147\n00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.360\nYou gotta love those.\n\n148\n00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.920\nI hate those types of answers.\n\n149\n00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.380\nSo, be prepared when\nyou go to the booth so\n\n150\n00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.850\nyou know regardless of what\nwhat scenario they set you in,\n\n151\n00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.580\nif those machines meet\nthe requirements to move into Windows.\n\n152\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.460\nNow there are some compatibility\nconsiderations that I want you to\n\n153\n00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.500\nwell, consider.\n\n154\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.448\nSome of the compatibility considerations\nare any malware, all right.\n\n155\n00:07:08.448 --> 00:07:13.900\nMake sure that your 80 malware is\ncompatible with the new operating system.\n\n156\n00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.570\nKeep in mind making sure things like\nyour subscriptions are current and\n\n157\n00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.250\nstuff, some of the things they point out.\n\n158\n00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.760\nSmall storage devices if you will\n\n159\n00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.230\nwith 32 gigabytes of hard drives\nspace [LAUGH] you gotta be careful.\n\n160\n00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.185\nAgain, talking 32 gigs,\nwe got thumb drives.\n\n161\n00:07:29.185 --> 00:07:33.102\n[LAUGH] In fact, you're into photography,\nDan, do you have a 32 gig little card,\n\n162\n00:07:33.102 --> 00:07:34.760\nSD card that might go to-\n>> Yeah, the SD cards, yeah.\n\n163\n00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.660\n>> That goes into your camera.\n\n164\n00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.070\nSo when we talk about 32 gigs,\nif you got a hard drive that is that old,\n\n165\n00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.780\nyou might be needing to upgrade but\nit may be about that time, right?\n\n166\n00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.926\n>> That's right.\n>> You might wanna think and mull it over.\n\n167\n00:07:45.926 --> 00:07:48.794\nYou know what,\nthis computer's done me well.\n\n168\n00:07:48.794 --> 00:07:52.302\nBut the storage space on here,\nyou don't have much on it at that point.\n\n169\n00:07:52.302 --> 00:07:56.997\nYou're basically keeping text files and\nmaybe some old lower resolution photos.\n\n170\n00:07:56.997 --> 00:07:58.185\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n171\n00:07:58.185 --> 00:08:00.270\nTo give you guys an example,\nwhen you do a base, and\n\n172\n00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.170\nwe're gonna talk about some of\nthis stuff in the later episodes.\n\n173\n00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.660\nWhen you do an image deployment, right,\nand you have a stock Windows image, and\n\n174\n00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.880\nI mean nothing extra added to it, you're\ntalking already seven gigs, all right.\n\n175\n00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.300\nAnd then you start adding software,\nagain, before you know it,\n\n176\n00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.330\nyou can't even install the Office Suite.\n\n177\n00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.600\nYou might as well just give that up and\ngo to the cloud.\n\n178\n00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.540\nSo pay attention to very limited storage.\n\n179\n00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.150\nNow the next thing that we have to\nconsider is the type of installation that\n\n180\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:33.060\nyou're gonna do in this really is\nsomething that you really need to\n\n181\n00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.510\nthink about, you really need to take the\ntime to figure out how am I gonna do this.\n\n182\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.200\nIf you're in a SOHO environment,\nright, a small office home office.\n\n183\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.440\nMicrosoft calls this a work group, right?\n\n184\n00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.690\nThe rest of the world\ntypically calls it a SOHO, and\n\n185\n00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.310\nthat means no more than ten computers.\n\n186\n00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.159\nThen you might have an easier\ntime doing your installation on\n\n187\n00:08:51.159 --> 00:08:55.913\na computer to computer basis, versus\nsomething like an enterprise who has\n\n188\n00:08:55.913 --> 00:08:58.563\nhundreds if not thousands of computers.\n\n189\n00:08:58.563 --> 00:09:02.850\nSo we wanna kinda talk about these couple\nof different types of installation.\n\n190\n00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.060\nOne is called a clean install, and\n\n191\n00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.970\nI've got this little diagram\non my computer here.\n\n192\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.840\nAnd let's say we've got two\ndifferent types, right?\n\n193\n00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.040\nWe've got clean install and\nwe've got an upgrade.\n\n194\n00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.970\nAnd what I'd like to do\nis just kind of focus in\n\n195\n00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.050\non the clean install for a second.\n\n196\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.660\nNow the clean install, it's probably one\nof the easiest installation types, and\n\n197\n00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.400\nwhy do I say that?\n\n198\n00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.930\nWell, I take my, if you can even\nfind them anymore, I take my DVD,\n\n199\n00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.650\nmy installation media, right.\n\n200\n00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:33.735\nAnd I pop it in the optical tray and\nI install the operating system.\n\n201\n00:09:33.735 --> 00:09:37.330\nThe other way you can do\nis formatting a USB drive.\n\n202\n00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.998\nPutting your operating system\ninstallation files on the USB drive and\n\n203\n00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:43.930\nplugging it into the computer and\nyou install, right.\n\n204\n00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.690\nYou go, you walk through,\nsimple clicks and\n\n205\n00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.780\nwe're gonna show you here in a minute even\nthough this really isn't the installation,\n\n206\n00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.390\nI wanna kind of show you\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n207\n00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.220\nI just start the install.\n\n208\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.600\nPop in the media and boot media and\ngo through a couple of clicks and\n\n209\n00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.120\nnow we've installed the operating system.\n\n210\n00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.262\nHowever, we've got to keep in mind that\nif you are in a situation where you're\n\n211\n00:10:02.262 --> 00:10:05.730\nsupporting end users that already\nhave previous versions of Windows,\n\n212\n00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.970\nthis could be problematic.\n\n213\n00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.970\nAnd why is that?\n\n214\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.750\nWell, because it is gonna format the data.\n\n215\n00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.440\nIf you have any data on that machine and\ndo a clean install,\n\n216\n00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.110\nwell, bye-bye to that information and\nthat could cause problems, specifically,\n\n217\n00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:22.700\nin situations where line of business\ndata is very, very important to retain.\n\n218\n00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.540\nI certainly don't wanna\nnegate the people that are in\n\n219\n00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.200\nthose work groups environments.\n\n220\n00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.480\nI know I couldn't afford,\nI would be devastated if I lose like\n\n221\n00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.500\nthe photos of my kids, right,\nthings that I can't get back.\n\n222\n00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.850\nI can replace any piece of software,\neven if it costs a little bit of money.\n\n223\n00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:41.200\nSome of the things you can't replace\nare memories, the memories of your kids.\n\n224\n00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.080\nSo things like that,\nyou do have to keep that in mind.\n\n225\n00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.748\nSo if you are in a SOHO\nenvironment out there,\n\n226\n00:10:46.748 --> 00:10:49.980\nwe certainly don't wanna\nnegate you by saying, hey,\n\n227\n00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.845\nyour data's really not that important\nbecause that's furthest from the truth.\n\n228\n00:10:54.845 --> 00:10:58.470\nHere's the other thing about\nthe clean installation, all right.\n\n229\n00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.610\nIf I have a series of applications\nthat are on this machine and\n\n230\n00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.300\nI've been using it for a while, well,\nwhat happens when I do a clean install?\n\n231\n00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.170\nWell, not only is the data\nthat we're talking about lost,\n\n232\n00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.650\nso is the application information.\n\n233\n00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.070\nThat is gone.\n\n234\n00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.960\nAll right, so it does require\napplication reinstallation.\n\n235\n00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.910\nAll right, and\nwe've kinda talked about that.\n\n236\n00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.100\nRemoves old files, the applications and\nthe settings, they are gone.\n\n237\n00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.420\nSo let me kinda show you, I've been\ntalking about it a little bit here,\n\n238\n00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.170\nlet me kinda show you.\n\n239\n00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.150\nNow I'm working in VMware.\n\n240\n00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.560\nI'm in a virtualized environment,\nso bear with me on this.\n\n241\n00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.700\nBut when it comes down to it,\nthe installation is gonna be the same.\n\n242\n00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.170\nSo let's launch up this machine here.\n\n243\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.090\nAnd you're gonna see it's gonna\ntell me boot to the media, right?\n\n244\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:43.980\nI press Enter.\n\n245\n00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:50.160\nAll I've done is I've put that\nDVD in the optical drive and\n\n246\n00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.270\nwe're booting to the media now, right?\n\n247\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.440\nSo as this process goes through,\nit's just a few clicks.\n\n248\n00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.987\nAnd you'll see here, once it gets loaded\nup, what's happening in the background\n\n249\n00:11:59.987 --> 00:12:03.432\nright now which is another technology\nthat we're gonna show you in this series,\n\n250\n00:12:03.432 --> 00:12:06.346\nis when P, the pre-installation\nenvironments loading into RAM.\n\n251\n00:12:06.346 --> 00:12:10.450\nIt's kinda like a live disk,\nif you will, or a memory res\n\n252\n00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.690\nin operating system that says,\nnow let's go ahead and install the image.\n\n253\n00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.580\nSo here's your clean install, right?\n\n254\n00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.770\nI got a couple of things that it's\ngonna ask me, language, time and\n\n255\n00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.070\ncurrency keyboard input method.\n\n256\n00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.310\nIf you are in the States here,\n\n257\n00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.750\ncuz I know that we got viewers that\naren't necessarily in the States,\n\n258\n00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:33.440\nwhatever the language is, the installation\nmedia that you have, right.\n\n259\n00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.630\nNow once you install it,\nyou can always go and\n\n260\n00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:41.470\nconfigure additional language and\nregional settings for sure, all right.\n\n261\n00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.810\nBut you'll see we can change time and\ncurrency if we want but\n\n262\n00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.020\nthe language to install, notice,\nI don't get an option here, right.\n\n263\n00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.180\nThat's specific to whatever\nthe installation media is.\n\n264\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.470\nAnd then of course the keyboard,\nwe can always change that too.\n\n265\n00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.890\nI'm gonna go ahead and leave it all\nthe same here and we're gonna choose Next.\n\n266\n00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:03.860\nAll right, now if you are studying for\nthis certification, and\n\n267\n00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:08.790\nI imagine by watching this you probably\nare, there is a lot of information,\n\n268\n00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.400\ngood information, about what to\nknow when installing Windows 10.\n\n269\n00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:19.315\nYou'll see here in a second here when\nwe choose Install Now, all right.\n\n270\n00:13:19.315 --> 00:13:22.370\nAnd I say that,\nthey might have taken that out.\n\n271\n00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.480\nI know that it was still in Windows 8.\n\n272\n00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.870\nThere's a little jump link when you're\ninstalling Windows 8.1 that says what to\n\n273\n00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.320\nknow before installing Windows.\n\n274\n00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.840\nYou click that link and it opens up.\n\n275\n00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.430\nThey might have taken it out in this one.\n\n276\n00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:33.470\nIt does look like they have.\n\n277\n00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.175\nSo here's my EULA,\nend user license agreement, right, and so\n\n278\n00:13:37.175 --> 00:13:40.466\nI gotto accept that, and\nwe will test Dan on the clause A,\n\n279\n00:13:40.466 --> 00:13:43.950\nsubsection B here at the end of the show\n>> I actually did read\n\n280\n00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:48.264\nthe Microsoft EULA one time,\nback when I was young and stupid.\n\n281\n00:13:48.264 --> 00:13:50.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n282\n00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.785\n>> You think, I need to look through this,\n\n283\n00:13:52.785 --> 00:13:57.078\nit's some sort of agreement that I'm\nengaging in and I got through that thing\n\n284\n00:13:57.078 --> 00:14:00.664\nand was, wow, there's an hour\nof my life I'll never get back.\n\n285\n00:14:00.664 --> 00:14:01.948\n[LAUGH]\n>> You will never get back.\n\n286\n00:14:01.948 --> 00:14:04.090\nI was gonna say,\nyou have a lot of time on your hands.\n\n287\n00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.280\nApparently, you had\nan hour of time anyway.\n\n288\n00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.066\n>> I was paranoid.\n[LAUGH]\n\n289\n00:14:06.066 --> 00:14:07.300\n>> [LAUGH] There we go.\n\n290\n00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.380\nYep, that's right.\n\n291\n00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.807\nYou don't want the copyright police\nto come and get you, for sure.\n\n292\n00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:11.504\n>> That's right.\n\n293\n00:14:11.504 --> 00:14:15.910\n>> But all joking aside,\nI'm gonna choose Next.\n\n294\n00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:20.096\nAbsolutely amazing, so\nthey do still have one link.\n\n295\n00:14:20.096 --> 00:14:23.400\nI can say this wasn't the link\nthat I was talking about.\n\n296\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.779\nIt says, help me choose which one I want.\n\n297\n00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.510\nIt used to be that in Windows 8.1,\n\n298\n00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:33.150\nthey had a link there that would tell you\nsome of the prerequisites of installing\n\n299\n00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.050\nthe Windows operating system and what you\nhad to meet before you could install it.\n\n300\n00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.270\nIt looks like they have\ntaken that away there.\n\n301\n00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.740\nNow we're gonna talk about\nthe upgrade install, coming up next.\n\n302\n00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.520\nI just kinda wanted to show you\nthe custom install, all right?\n\n303\n00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.290\nAnd again, a simple wizard.\n\n304\n00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.440\nNow you might be asking yourself,\nwell, wait, Wes,\n\n305\n00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.860\nyou're really not showing us anything.\n\n306\n00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.070\nWe've got an episode that we're\ngonna go into the installation,\n\n307\n00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.240\nwe're gonna talk about the installs.\n\n308\n00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.880\nI just want you to see that when it comes\nto a clean install, click, click, click,\n\n309\n00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.610\nclick, click, done, right.\n\n310\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:01.900\nNot that big of a deal.\n\n311\n00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.550\nSo the clean install, when we look at it\n\n312\n00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.240\ndoes come to the fact that it's\nan easier type of installation, right?\n\n313\n00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.071\nIt didn't take that much, all right.\n\n314\n00:15:10.071 --> 00:15:14.720\nSo this has a drawback, right?\n\n315\n00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.170\nIt's this concept right here, okay?\n\n316\n00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.964\nSo if Dan was the senior administration\nat a company and he said, Wes,\n\n317\n00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:28.328\nI need you to orchestrate this whole\ninstallation of Windows 10, and we're\n\n318\n00:15:28.328 --> 00:15:34.470\ngonna roll it out to deployment, well,\nif I'm an hourly employee, I'm happy.\n\n319\n00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.070\nWhy?\nBecause it's gonna take a long\n\n320\n00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.110\ntime to do 10, 100, 200, 500 computers.\n\n321\n00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:42.990\nWhy?\nBecause I'm gonna have to take my\n\n322\n00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.130\ninstallation media whether it be a DVD in\nthe optical tray or be a USB thumb drive\n\n323\n00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:51.334\nin the USB port I'm gonna have to go\ncomputer to computer to computer, and I'll\n\n324\n00:15:51.334 --> 00:15:55.707\nstop that right there cuz you can see,\nkind of annoying, kind of boring, right?\n\n325\n00:15:55.707 --> 00:15:57.260\n[LAUGH] Well,\nit's a decentralized process.\n\n326\n00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.880\nSo now, what if Dan says,\nI wanna monitor this deployment.\n\n327\n00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.670\nI want to know did it succeed, is it okay?\n\n328\n00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.430\nThere’s no way to know,\nhe’s going to have to call up Wes.\n\n329\n00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.100\nWes I need you to sneaker\nnet over there and\n\n330\n00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.060\ntell me if that deployment or\noperating system is running.\n\n331\n00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.805\nSo it's completely decentralized and\nthat's why I say the clean installation is\n\n332\n00:16:16.805 --> 00:16:20.755\na good model if you are in\na small environment.\n\n333\n00:16:20.755 --> 00:16:24.065\nIf you are in an environment that is\nsupporting hundreds of computers,\n\n334\n00:16:24.065 --> 00:16:25.555\nthis is not the way you're going to do it.\n\n335\n00:16:25.555 --> 00:16:29.200\nIt's just too, I would say complex.\n\n336\n00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.990\nNot complex, just too involved, right?\n\n337\n00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.890\nAnd again the decentralization\nis a problem.\n\n338\n00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.390\nAll right, so enough about clean installs.\n\n339\n00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.560\nHow about a little bit about\nthe upgrade installation?\n\n340\n00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.636\nNow.\n>> The dirty install.\n\n341\n00:16:40.636 --> 00:16:43.010\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right, [LAUGH] that's exactly.\n\n342\n00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.950\nWhy did he say the dirty install?\n\n343\n00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.620\nRight.\nWell sometimes clean installs\n\n344\n00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.170\nare considered spring cleaning.\n\n345\n00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.490\nWhat do you mean spring cleaning?\n\n346\n00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.020\nWell, if I know I've all\nready got my data right?\n\n347\n00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.060\nIt doesn't matter what kind of upgrade or\nyou do an upgrade or a clean installation.\n\n348\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.170\nShould have backed up your files\nbefore you do any kind of install.\n\n349\n00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.010\nRight?\n\n350\n00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:02.250\nWell, the clean installation\nis called a clean installation\n\n351\n00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:03.150\nbecause it cleans house, right?\n\n352\n00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.460\nIt does a spring cleaning for\nyou, cleans the hard drive off.\n\n353\n00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.310\nYou got to reinstall the applications and\nload your data back on, but\n\n354\n00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.250\nyou got a nice fresh installation.\n\n355\n00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:17.790\nNow, what if your company has spent\n$70,000 on a line of business application\n\n356\n00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.840\nthat they can't get any support for\nanymore.\n\n357\n00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.880\nMaybe the software vendor in\nits life cycle of the software,\n\n358\n00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.870\nmaybe they're no longer in business.\n\n359\n00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:29.300\nAnd your company certainly wants to get\ntheir money's worth out of that line of\n\n360\n00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.290\nbusiness application,\nyou can't get any more product keys,\n\n361\n00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:36.350\nyou can't re-install it, well the clean\ninstall is not gonna be for you.\n\n362\n00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:37.840\nThat's not gonna be the one you want,\n\n363\n00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.770\nbecause it's gonna\ndelete that application.\n\n364\n00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.970\nAnd that's where the upgrade comes in.\n\n365\n00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.840\nAll right?\nNow, back to Dan's comment,\n\n366\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.520\nthe dirty install,\nwhat do you mean by that?\n\n367\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.040\nWell, when you do an upgrade,\nthink about the Russian dolls right.\n\n368\n00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.300\nI put a doll in there and\nthen I put a bigger doll in there and\n\n369\n00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.360\nthen bigger doll in there,\nwhat's underneath,\n\n370\n00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.700\nall the way down there somewhere\nunderneath was that first doll right.\n\n371\n00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.150\nSo you get remnants of the last operating\nsystem, because that's what it does.\n\n372\n00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.980\nRight.\nIt installs Windows 10 over an existing\n\n373\n00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.820\ninstallation, leaving remnants of\nthe old operating system behind.\n\n374\n00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.955\nNow, that is one of the reasons it's\nconsidered kind of like a dirty install.\n\n375\n00:18:18.955 --> 00:18:22.955\nIt leaves everything that you\nhad there before, all right?\n\n376\n00:18:22.955 --> 00:18:26.175\nNow here's one of the benefits though,\nis that it retains old files,\n\n377\n00:18:26.175 --> 00:18:27.145\napplications, and settings.\n\n378\n00:18:27.145 --> 00:18:33.625\nAnd if it is a situation where you do\nneed to preserve that application,\n\n379\n00:18:33.625 --> 00:18:36.585\nwell then maybe the upgrade\ninstallation is for you, all right?\n\n380\n00:18:36.585 --> 00:18:39.635\nHowever, it does take\na little bit more research.\n\n381\n00:18:39.635 --> 00:18:43.670\nYou have to verify that you have\ncompatibility with those applications that\n\n382\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.400\nare gonna be left behind.\n\n383\n00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.340\nWhat do you mean you're gonna have to\ndo a research on the compatibility of\n\n384\n00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.860\nthose applications?\n\n385\n00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.340\nYou're not formatting the hard drive.\n\n386\n00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:55.190\nYou're leaving applications that could\nhave been supported in Windows 8,\n\n387\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.420\nWindows 7, Windows 8.1.\n\n388\n00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.580\nAnd we don't know if there\nare truly supported in Windows 10.\n\n389\n00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.870\nSo there's a little bit more research.\n\n390\n00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.950\nThe other thing is, it might introduce\ncompatibility issues, right.\n\n391\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.870\nThat research might lead you to believe,\nthat yes it retains my applications.\n\n392\n00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.970\nBut now I've got problems with the\napplication even though it's still there.\n\n393\n00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.600\nSo you can get these all sorts,\n\n394\n00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:20.070\nthat little quirky mishaps as far as\nthe deployment goes, or the upgrade.\n\n395\n00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.120\nAll right.\n\n396\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.320\nThe other ones here, let me go ahead and\n\n397\n00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.170\njust mention this as well,\nis it's also decentralized, right.\n\n398\n00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.380\nThere we go, I get that call from Dan.\n\n399\n00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:33.280\nDan says, Wes I need you to upgrade,\nwe've got 5, 10, 15 machines here and\n\n400\n00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.550\nthis is part of my Dev team and they've\ngot that application on there that we\n\n401\n00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.050\ncan't afford to loose, so I need you to\ngo in get in there and do the upgrades.\n\n402\n00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:45.010\n>> Too bad they can't do like upgrades\nlike this through WSUS services.\n\n403\n00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.930\nThey are the administrative services\nwhere you get all of your updates from,\n\n404\n00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.530\nthat says, there are updates waiting for\nyour computer.\n\n405\n00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.250\nToo bad you can't just have,\nyeah Windows 10,\n\n406\n00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.350\nlet's go from Windows 8.1 to\nWindows 10 and throw that in there.\n\n407\n00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.220\nThat would be a nice feature.\n\n408\n00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.630\n>> That would be very,\nvery nice in the update.\n\n409\n00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.540\nThey come close in the WDS,\nwhich we're gonna mention coming up.\n\n410\n00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.990\nBut yeah, that would be very, very nice.\n\n411\n00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:08.190\nAnd you're going to see upgrades from and\nwhat I am talking about, I'm glad you\n\n412\n00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.520\nmentioned that let me go ahead and\nmake sure that we are specific on this.\n\n413\n00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:15.170\nThis is about upgrades from installation\nmedia, this is another upgrade type and\n\n414\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:16.835\nthat is the Windows Store.\n\n415\n00:20:16.835 --> 00:20:19.715\nThat's one of the new things in Windows\n10, is the fact that I can also\n\n416\n00:20:19.715 --> 00:20:24.225\nupgrade from the Windows Store provided I\nhave a Microsoft, what do they call it,\n\n417\n00:20:24.225 --> 00:20:27.325\nthe MCA, the Microsoft Account I believe.\n\n418\n00:20:27.325 --> 00:20:29.705\nIt used to be called the Windows Live ID.\n\n419\n00:20:29.705 --> 00:20:34.510\nAnd you can actually get your,\nas of the shooting of this.\n\n420\n00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.700\nWoah, Dan,\ndo you know what the date is today?\n\n421\n00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.424\n>> It's the 6th, 7/6/2016.\n\n422\n00:20:37.424 --> 00:20:42.320\n>> The 6th, yeah, so as of right now,\nthe upgrade is still free.\n\n423\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.010\nI don't want, you might be watching this a\nlittle bit later, they might change that.\n\n424\n00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.340\nIf I've got a Windows Live/Microsoft\n\n425\n00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:53.720\naccount I can actually do an upgrade\nfrom inside of the Windows Store today.\n\n426\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.090\nAgain, this one's\ncompletely decentralized.\n\n427\n00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.110\nKeep in mind that the upgrade I'm\nstill gonna have to go from computer\n\n428\n00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.760\nto computer to computer.\n\n429\n00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.270\nAnd even if I do it in a Windows Store,\nguess what?\n\n430\n00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:06.780\nComputer to computer to computer,\nthen it gets even more complex because\n\n431\n00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:11.290\neverybody would have to\nhave their individual MSA,\n\n432\n00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.010\nthe Microsoft account and\nlog in to the Windows Store.\n\n433\n00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.390\n>> And I see why things like imaging\nabilities that we're gonna see later\n\n434\n00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.645\nbecome very, very helpful and\nvery, very nice for us.\n\n435\n00:21:21.645 --> 00:21:22.420\n[LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely.\n\n436\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.990\n>> We're not doing what\nWest is talking about.\n\n437\n00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.460\n>> Yeah.\nYou truly do not wanna do that at all.\n\n438\n00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.180\nAll right Dan, so\nwe've been talking about the upgrade.\n\n439\n00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.240\nLet's go ahead and see a little bit\nabout what the upgrade would look like.\n\n440\n00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.250\nNow keep in mind in another episode,\nwe're gonna do the installation, so\n\n441\n00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:39.210\nthis is just the high level overview\nThose of you watching out there,\n\n442\n00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.530\nwe're gonna talk a lot more about it.\n\n443\n00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:45.070\nBut the difference between the upgrade and\nthe clean installation,\n\n444\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.950\nyou'll notice here I've got a Windows\n8.1 machine and it is already running.\n\n445\n00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.820\nAnd you might say, well, wait a second if\nyou're gonna install an operating system,\n\n446\n00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.660\nwhy is your operating\nsystem running already?\n\n447\n00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.450\nWell, that's because an upgrade\nhappens a little bit different, right?\n\n448\n00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.100\nYou see when we did the clean install,\nit gave you the two choices.\n\n449\n00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.040\nAnd you click upgrade,\nit says this can't be done from here,\n\n450\n00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.070\nyou actually have to run this\ninside of the operating system.\n\n451\n00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.980\nSo, that's what we're doing here.\n\n452\n00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:13.320\nWell, so with the upgrade, notice that the\nmain point to take away is the fact that\n\n453\n00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.020\nwell, I already got an operating system,\nright?\n\n454\n00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.470\nI've already got Windows\n8.1 installed here.\n\n455\n00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.010\nKeep in mind that if you did this,\nyou'd want to make sure that every,\n\n456\n00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.490\nall your updates are done.\n\n457\n00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:27.520\nAnd in the optical tray here, right,\nI've got my installation media.\n\n458\n00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.280\nAnd all I'm going to do\nis just click on it.\n\n459\n00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.370\nAll right, and the installer,\nthe setup.exe, I believe it is,\n\n460\n00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.340\nis going to fire off.\n\n461\n00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:38.736\nAnd notice that we get the Windows 10\nlogo, and notice that says preparing 100%.\n\n462\n00:22:38.736 --> 00:22:43.480\nSo it's gonna ask us a couple of things\nabout our updates and everything,\n\n463\n00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.690\nand I'm just gonna say, no.\n\n464\n00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.560\nWe're gonna save that, like I said,\nfor a later episode, and\n\n465\n00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.720\nI'm gonna say no,\nI'm not worried about the updates.\n\n466\n00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.900\n>> You really should be.\n\n467\n00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.160\n>> And I'm not going to make\nthis installation any better for\n\n468\n00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.820\nMicrosoft, unless they make it better for\nme.\n\n469\n00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.940\nAnd what to choose next,\nand then what does it do?\n\n470\n00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.750\nIt goes through and it checks your PC.\n\n471\n00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:08.520\nIf you chose to do the updates,\nit would reach out to Windows Update, and\n\n472\n00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.050\nif it found any additional updates that it\nneeded to do, it would pull them down and\n\n473\n00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.330\nit would start to install them.\n\n474\n00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.478\nSo, you can see that it says,\ngetting a few things ready.\n\n475\n00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:21.101\nKeep in mind though that the operating\nsystem has to be present to do an upgrade,\n\n476\n00:23:21.101 --> 00:23:25.104\nthat is one of the requirements to\ndo an upgrade is a previous licensed\n\n477\n00:23:25.104 --> 00:23:26.180\ncopy of Windows.\n\n478\n00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.400\nNow the other way that you could\nalso upgrade too is you will see,\n\n479\n00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.320\nin a later episode,\nis we can do this from the Store here too.\n\n480\n00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.343\nAll right, so that's some things\nthat you have to think about.\n\n481\n00:23:35.343 --> 00:23:40.739\nNow the last type of\ninstallation that we have that\n\n482\n00:23:40.739 --> 00:23:46.395\nyou need to worry about,\nis one that is known as the.\n\n483\n00:23:46.395 --> 00:23:47.362\nThe image deployment.\n\n484\n00:23:47.362 --> 00:23:49.570\nForgot my train of thought there.\n\n485\n00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:54.450\nAnd Dan had mentioned slightly about this\none when he talked about we do imaging and\n\n486\n00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:55.560\nstuff like that.\n\n487\n00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:01.650\nAnd it makes it easier on us\nin an enterprise environment.\n\n488\n00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.750\nSo let's talk a little bit about that,\nright?\n\n489\n00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.550\nSo I've got a diagram again,\n\n490\n00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.810\nback to our diagram here we've\ngot Image Deployment, right?\n\n491\n00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:09.019\nThis is easier for enterprises.\n\n492\n00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.560\nWhat is it that makes it easier?\n\n493\n00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.850\nWell it's an automated type installation.\n\n494\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.740\nAnd it could be integrated with WDS,\nsomething known as\n\n495\n00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:23.900\nWindows Deployment Services, so\nnow, when Dan calls up, Dan says,\n\n496\n00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.160\nwell hey Wes, you know those 50 computers\nthat I need you to upgrade to Windows 10?\n\n497\n00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.120\nIn fact, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna push out a deployment and\n\n498\n00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.210\nall I need you to do is just be there,\nif you will.\n\n499\n00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.260\nTo boot the network adapter, right?\n\n500\n00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.790\nBoot to the Pixie adapter, and\nit's going to call out to the network,\n\n501\n00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:43.550\nand then those computers reach back\nover to a server on our network, and\n\n502\n00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:47.380\nthey actually talk to the server, and\nthey pull down their operating system.\n\n503\n00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.140\nNow, that is good.\n\n504\n00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.880\nBut what makes this even better is,\n\n505\n00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.480\nremember all those line of business\napplications we were telling you about?\n\n506\n00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.600\nIf you do an upgrade\nthat leaves them behind,\n\n507\n00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.720\ndoes implement,\nit could cause some compatibility issues.\n\n508\n00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:04.890\nHowever, if we're doing the clean install,\nit wipes those applications.\n\n509\n00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:06.540\nAnd then we to turn around and\nreinstall it, right.\n\n510\n00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.884\nSo additional work has to\nhappen after the fact.\n\n511\n00:25:09.884 --> 00:25:13.868\nWell what we can do with the imaging\nprocess in an image deployment is,\n\n512\n00:25:13.868 --> 00:25:18.070\nwe can bake in those line of business\napplications into the image itself.\n\n513\n00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:23.200\nSo the computers that we want that\nare in our production configuration for\n\n514\n00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.860\nthe production environment,\nthe moment the image gets deployed to\n\n515\n00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.030\nthe hard drive of those machines,\nthe first time they fire it up,\n\n516\n00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:33.630\nwell guess what, all of those applications\nare there, the settings can be there.\n\n517\n00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.910\nAny additional features that you might\nhave to install will also be there.\n\n518\n00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.340\nSo, The Image Deployment is great.\n\n519\n00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:43.890\nAnd one of the main things to keep\nin mind here about this one guys is\n\n520\n00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.730\nCentralized Deployment and Management.\n\n521\n00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:50.550\nThe process of being able to monitor\ndeployment, as well as you can even\n\n522\n00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:54.570\nintegrate this with things like a SCCM,\nthe System's Center Configuration Manager.\n\n523\n00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:59.430\nAnd you can go completely, what's known\nas a ZTI, zero touch installation.\n\n524\n00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.490\nThe one that I was telling\nyou about me having to go and\n\n525\n00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:06.420\nstill fix the machines is something\nknown as a light touch, LTI,\n\n526\n00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:12.500\nlight touch installation but the process\nof being automated and scalability and\n\n527\n00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:17.650\nintegration into the Windows deployment\nservices makes this a much better choice.\n\n528\n00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.890\nAnd the more obvious choice,\nif you will, once you know about it, for\n\n529\n00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.250\nan enterprise level environment.\n\n530\n00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:29.240\nAll right, so that is the different\ntypes of installations, if you will.\n\n531\n00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.190\nAgain, keep in mind, we're gonna\nwalk you through this process so\n\n532\n00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:37.170\nyou could see it more in depths and some\nlater episodes when we actually install\n\n533\n00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.390\nWindows just wanna kinda\nbrief you over with that.\n\n534\n00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.600\nRemember, clean installation.\n\n535\n00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.240\nWhat's the clean installation gonna do?\n\n536\n00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.540\nIt's gonna format everything it'll give\nyou a nice clean operating system but\n\n537\n00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.290\na little more work at getting\nthose applications back online.\n\n538\n00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:52.427\nLike Dan mentioned, the upgrade,\nthat's the dirty installation right.\n\n539\n00:26:52.427 --> 00:26:54.990\nIt's going to leave the remnants behind.\n\n540\n00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.930\nThe old operating system's going to\nstill have its bits and pieces and\n\n541\n00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:02.290\nits fingers in there, but the benefit is\nthe application stayed behind, its files,\n\n542\n00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.660\ndata, settings.\n\n543\n00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.760\n>> Now Wes, typically with windows,\n\n544\n00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.420\nin my experience anyway,\nthey love to do additions, right?\n\n545\n00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.060\nThere is this addition there\nis that addition, home, pro,\n\n546\n00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.960\nenterprise, ultimate, you name it,\nthey come up with some crazy name for\n\n547\n00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.120\nten different types of editions of\nthe exact same operating system,\n\n548\n00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.430\nbasically it's just a set of\nfeatures turned off or on.\n\n549\n00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.597\nDo we see that same kinda\nthing here with Windows 10?\n\n550\n00:27:24.597 --> 00:27:25.319\n>> Well, of course.\n\n551\n00:27:25.319 --> 00:27:29.226\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yes, it's consistency and\n\n552\n00:27:29.226 --> 00:27:30.589\ninconsistency.\n\n553\n00:27:30.589 --> 00:27:33.860\nThat's right, and joking aside guys,\nif you remember some\n\n554\n00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:38.990\nof your early operating systems or\neditions of Windows, it doesn't change.\n\n555\n00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:43.779\nIn Windows 7, some of you guys\nare very familiar with Windows 7,\n\n556\n00:27:43.779 --> 00:27:48.909\nremember we had home, we had premium,\nall kinds of basic, we had pro,\n\n557\n00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:53.520\nultimate and business or\nenterprise is what it was called.\n\n558\n00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.440\nAll right, well, guess what?\n\n559\n00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.651\nWindows 10.\n\n560\n00:27:55.651 --> 00:27:57.520\nLet's check out some\nof the additions here.\n\n561\n00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.950\nWe've got Home.\n\n562\n00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.780\nHome Edition is exactly\nwhat it sounds like.\n\n563\n00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.127\nYou don't get some of the high-level or\nadvanced security functionality,\n\n564\n00:28:05.127 --> 00:28:05.906\nthings that are.\n\n565\n00:28:05.906 --> 00:28:06.908\n>> Folks that are winning\nthe game show [CROSSTALK].\n\n566\n00:28:06.908 --> 00:28:07.760\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n567\n00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.748\nThat's the one that you go\ninto Best Buy typically and\n\n568\n00:28:10.748 --> 00:28:16.580\nyour typical third-party reseller\nyou find in their products.\n\n569\n00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.500\nAgain, it doesn't have some\nof the security features, but\n\n570\n00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.000\nmore media-centric, if you will.\n\n571\n00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.310\nThe pro edition now.\n\n572\n00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.500\nNow, when we talk about pro\nedition now we're talking about\n\n573\n00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.810\nmore security features, right?\n\n574\n00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:32.820\nWe get things like, not App Locker but\nDomain Join, right,\n\n575\n00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:33.970\nthat's one of the big things.\n\n576\n00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:37.960\nWith a Pro Edition I can take this\ncomputer and I can join it to a corporate\n\n577\n00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.940\nnetwork, right, the domain, where Home I\ncannot, I don't have that ability.\n\n578\n00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.455\nHere's the other thing,\nthat when you get for instance in Pro,\n\n579\n00:28:45.455 --> 00:28:50.970\nwhen you get the ability to connect\nto that computer over remote desktop.\n\n580\n00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.550\nSo that if Dan says, you know what Wes?\n\n581\n00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:56.030\nI'm sorry man, you're sneakernet,\nyou're really slow man.\n\n582\n00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.620\nYou gotta change your sneakers.\n\n583\n00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.860\nI wanna go ahead,\nI wanna get into that computer.\n\n584\n00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.850\nWell in Pro edition Dan can connect\nto it over remote desktop and\n\n585\n00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:06.500\nhe's still sitting at his desk in some\nother location and he can manage it right?\n\n586\n00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.010\nYou don't get that in the Home edition\nbecause they don't think that somebody\n\n587\n00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:10.740\nthat's in a basic Home edition, mom and\n\n588\n00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:15.170\npop, grandma if you will, kids are really\ngonna need that functionality.\n\n589\n00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:21.130\nSo it is a more featuresque as\nwe talk about more office or\n\n590\n00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.690\nbusiness class feature.\n\n591\n00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:29.540\nEnterprise Now Enterprise has all\nthe features, right, applocker,\n\n592\n00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:36.030\ndirect access, right, other stuff as well.\n\n593\n00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.670\nI can't think of some of them\noff the top of my head but\n\n594\n00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.262\nthe big ones really is Applocker,\ndirect access.\n\n595\n00:29:41.262 --> 00:29:46.563\nThe ability to control what applications\ncan or can't cannot run on the machine and\n\n596\n00:29:46.563 --> 00:29:50.653\nyou get all those business or\nenterprise level features that you\n\n597\n00:29:50.653 --> 00:29:55.444\ndon't typically get on the pro edition but\nthere is a restriction on this.\n\n598\n00:29:55.444 --> 00:29:59.959\nThe Enterprise editions are not going\nto be something that you can just go to\n\n599\n00:29:59.959 --> 00:30:05.480\na third party resaler and say yeah,\nI'm gonna take the Enterprise edition.\n\n600\n00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.860\nNo, that's not gonna happen.\n\n601\n00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.980\nThe reason it's not gonna happen is this\nis a volume license edition of Windows.\n\n602\n00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.620\nYou have to go to Windows,\nsign a volume license contract, and\n\n603\n00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.628\nenter into a software assurance policy.\n\n604\n00:30:14.628 --> 00:30:21.910\nAll right, now, there's one that Dan\nmentioned that you don't see here.\n\n605\n00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:23.770\nAnd I want you to keep this in mind.\n\n606\n00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.170\nThey no longer have Ultimate Editions.\n\n607\n00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.440\nThey stopped that in Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n608\n00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.341\nAll right, the reason is actually,\nI don't know the reason.\n\n609\n00:30:33.341 --> 00:30:37.962\nI'm gonna sit there and say,\nthe reason is, and I don't know why.\n\n610\n00:30:37.962 --> 00:30:39.701\n>> It's the third moon on Jupiter.\n\n611\n00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:40.717\nLet's move to that.\n\n612\n00:30:40.717 --> 00:30:42.135\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n613\n00:30:42.135 --> 00:30:44.501\nAnd ultimate was a way\nthat if somebody needed or\n\n614\n00:30:44.501 --> 00:30:47.225\nthought they needed\nthe enterprise level features and\n\n615\n00:30:47.225 --> 00:30:50.880\nfunctionality that they can go ahead and\nbuy it in the days of Windows 7.\n\n616\n00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.660\nApparently, I would say maybe popularity\nis the reason that they said, nah,\n\n617\n00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.510\nwe'll just leave that with\nvolume licensed customers.\n\n618\n00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:00.590\nSo, there isn't a business edition\nanymore, that's pro here now,\n\n619\n00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:03.170\nand there's no longer an ultimate edition.\n\n620\n00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:05.270\nHowever, we do have some\ndifferent mobile editions,\n\n621\n00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:09.650\nyou have the basic Windows Mobile, and\nthen you have Enterprise Mobile, and that,\n\n622\n00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:14.902\nwith the trend B-Y-O-D that allows you\nto bring in advanced features too.\n\n623\n00:31:14.902 --> 00:31:18.800\nAnd a new thing in Windows in general,\nthe Windows family,\n\n624\n00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.650\nis arm based architecture\nthat is not just Windows RT.\n\n625\n00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.961\nAll the arm based architecture that we've\nbeen talking about in our Windows clients\n\n626\n00:31:26.961 --> 00:31:30.616\nhas been centered around the Windows RT\nand Windows 8.1 RT tablets.\n\n627\n00:31:30.616 --> 00:31:35.320\nWell that's not really the case anymore\nbecause now we have system on a chip and\n\n628\n00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.106\nthe IOT is one that can\ngo on the raspberry pie.\n\n629\n00:31:38.106 --> 00:31:40.120\nAll right, so\nwe got some of those editions.\n\n630\n00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:45.997\nI would be aware of\nthe editions on the exam.\n\n631\n00:31:45.997 --> 00:31:47.233\nBe aware of some of the features.\n\n632\n00:31:47.233 --> 00:31:51.588\nWe're gonna talk about some of those\neditions when we look at upgrading, and\n\n633\n00:31:51.588 --> 00:31:55.100\nwhy you would upgrade to one over\nthe other in a later episode.\n\n634\n00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:00.099\nNow, there are just a few more features\nthat they call out on the exam\n\n635\n00:32:00.099 --> 00:32:03.183\nthat I really want you\nguys to be aware of.\n\n636\n00:32:03.183 --> 00:32:06.905\nAgain, because they call\nthem out by objective.\n\n637\n00:32:06.905 --> 00:32:10.486\nAll right, and that is Cortana,\nMiracast and Secure Boot.\n\n638\n00:32:10.486 --> 00:32:13.172\nAll right,\nI'm gonna do these kind of our order.\n\n639\n00:32:13.172 --> 00:32:16.595\nSecure Boot, if you've been around\nWindows, you've probably seen this before.\n\n640\n00:32:16.595 --> 00:32:18.785\nIt's not a Windows-centric technology.\n\n641\n00:32:18.785 --> 00:32:19.525\nKeep that in mind.\n\n642\n00:32:19.525 --> 00:32:23.825\nThis is an industry-wide standard for\nkeeping your firmware or\n\n643\n00:32:23.825 --> 00:32:26.955\nprotecting your operating\nsystem at a very low level\n\n644\n00:32:26.955 --> 00:32:29.840\nbefore the operating system\neven comes online, right?\n\n645\n00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.430\nIt does have some requirements\nin order to support it.\n\n646\n00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:37.270\nFirst of all, you need what is known as\nthe Unified Extensible Firmware Interface.\n\n647\n00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:42.430\nYes, UEFI, don't try to say that\nten times fast, firmware platform.\n\n648\n00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:48.740\nAnd that is version 2.3.1 that you need,\nand you also need a Windows,\n\n649\n00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:53.950\nwhat is it, the certification authority\nstored in that signature database.\n\n650\n00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:58.180\nSo there are some requirements and the\nbenefit of the Secure Boot is rootkits,\n\n651\n00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.930\nthey like to install themselves low\nportions of the operating system,\n\n652\n00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:04.940\nright before the operating system's\nanti-virus even comes online.\n\n653\n00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.870\nThis gives you a way in combination\nwith something like ELAM,\n\n654\n00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:10.591\nthe Early Launch Anti-Malware drivers,\n\n655\n00:33:10.591 --> 00:33:14.190\nthat makes sure that your boot\ncode hasn't been modified.\n\n656\n00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:18.210\nThe low-level system drivers,\nyour critical kernel boot start drivers,\n\n657\n00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:19.590\nalmost said boot strap drivers.\n\n658\n00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:21.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Boot start drivers\n\n659\n00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:22.090\nhaven't been modified.\n\n660\n00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:27.700\nAgain, that's why you'd\nwant something like this.\n\n661\n00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:32.562\nMiracast, some of you guys are probably\nfamiliar with Wi-Fi Direct.\n\n662\n00:33:32.562 --> 00:33:35.280\nWi-Fi Direct is another\nindustry-wide standard.\n\n663\n00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.590\nThis is Microsoft's flavor,\nif you will, of Wi-Fi Direct.\n\n664\n00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:41.610\nIt's based off of Wi-Fi Direct.\n\n665\n00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.190\nThe ability to take for\ninstance, your phone, and\n\n666\n00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:47.960\njust transfer that screen\nup to your PC as well.\n\n667\n00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.097\nNow, that does have something specific.\n\n668\n00:33:50.097 --> 00:33:54.147\nRemember we talked about\nthe basics requirements for\n\n669\n00:33:54.147 --> 00:33:56.763\nWindows and that was WDDM 1.0.\n\n670\n00:33:56.763 --> 00:33:58.843\nIn Miracast, it's 1.3.\n\n671\n00:33:58.843 --> 00:34:01.600\nSo, do keep that in mind in\ncase they ask you on the exam.\n\n672\n00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.530\nThat's the Windows Display Driver Model\n1.3 and a Wi-Fi adapter.\n\n673\n00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:08.260\nAgain, that supports Wi-Fi Direct because\n\n674\n00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.900\nthis is basically Microsoft's\nflavor of Wi-Fi Direct.\n\n675\n00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:11.920\nIt's what it's piggy backing,\n\n676\n00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:17.860\nit's what it's using, you probably seen\nthat in other applications out there.\n\n677\n00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.529\nLast but not least, Cortana, right?\n\n678\n00:34:20.529 --> 00:34:22.866\nWe've gotta know a little\nbit about about Cortana.\n\n679\n00:34:22.866 --> 00:34:25.445\nI know that if all the Halo\nfans are sleeping.\n\n680\n00:34:25.445 --> 00:34:26.080\n>> Great, Halo.\n\n681\n00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.357\n>> I was gonna say, if all the Halo fans\nwere sleeping, they just perked up and\n\n682\n00:34:29.357 --> 00:34:31.294\nthey'll at least listen\nto this part of it.\n\n683\n00:34:31.294 --> 00:34:35.926\n[LAUGH] Cortana, again, is another one\nof those personal assistants that you've\n\n684\n00:34:35.926 --> 00:34:38.620\nseen that we have on\nmany different platforms.\n\n685\n00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.160\nAnd this requires something that\nyou don't hear about, Hi-Fi.\n\n686\n00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.180\nWe always hear about Wi-Fi.\n\n687\n00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.850\nHigh fidelity microphone, and\n\n688\n00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:48.960\nit also needs a driver that supports\nthe microphone array geometry.\n\n689\n00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.050\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n690\n00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:53.880\nAnd again, it's just a requirement that\nyou might need to know for the exam.\n\n691\n00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.120\nAll right, if you wanna disable Cortana,\n\n692\n00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.160\nyou can disable Cortana so,\nit's not a deal breaker.\n\n693\n00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.975\nBut if you wanna get the benefits of\nthe features and maybe [LAUGH] answer\n\n694\n00:35:02.975 --> 00:35:06.351\na question on the exam,\nI would know a little bit about these.\n\n695\n00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:10.324\nBut all in all, I think the only thing\nthat I would say last when you're gonna\n\n696\n00:35:10.324 --> 00:35:14.437\nimplement Windows is determining\nthe media type that you're gonna install.\n\n697\n00:35:14.437 --> 00:35:19.796\nOr you can install from a DVD,\nyou can install from a USB,\n\n698\n00:35:19.796 --> 00:35:23.936\nyou can create a WIM file,\nan image format.\n\n699\n00:35:23.936 --> 00:35:27.239\nSo, just keep in mind how you're\ngonna install your operating systems.\n\n700\n00:35:27.239 --> 00:35:30.810\nIf you're gonna use a deployment,\nit's gonna be a WIM file.\n\n701\n00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:35.830\nIt's gonna be an image file,\nif you're gonna use your optical drive,\n\n702\n00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.680\nit's gonna be DVD, and\nthen finally the USB.\n\n703\n00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:43.282\nOn the USB side of that, remember,\nmake sure that your BIOS supports, or\n\n704\n00:35:43.282 --> 00:35:45.216\nyour UEFI supports boot to USB.\n\n705\n00:35:45.216 --> 00:35:48.720\nThey've supported that for a long time,\nmost hardware manufacturers.\n\n706\n00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.064\nBut just make sure you turn it on,\nbecause sometimes boot to USB might be\n\n707\n00:35:52.064 --> 00:35:55.205\nturned off in your boot order and\nyou throw that USB drive in there.\n\n708\n00:35:55.205 --> 00:35:57.783\nYou try to boot to it and\nunfortunately it doesn't boot and\n\n709\n00:35:57.783 --> 00:35:59.895\nit goes to the hard drive,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n710\n00:35:59.895 --> 00:36:03.618\nBut we will see more of\nthe installations in later episodes.\n\n711\n00:36:03.618 --> 00:36:07.879\n>> All right, Wes, well, we thank you for\nstopping by and giving us that litany of\n\n712\n00:36:07.879 --> 00:36:12.204\ndifferent pieces of information that we\nneed to know about getting ready to, and\n\n713\n00:36:12.204 --> 00:36:14.642\ninstalling Windows 10 operating system.\n\n714\n00:36:14.642 --> 00:36:16.865\nThat being said, we do thank you,\nagain, for dropping by.\n\n715\n00:36:16.865 --> 00:36:18.806\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou in upcoming episodes.\n\n716\n00:36:18.806 --> 00:36:20.428\nHopefully we'll see you there as well.\n\n717\n00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:22.180\nAs for this one,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n718\n00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.627\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie\n\n719\n00:36:24.627 --> 00:36:25.578\n>> And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n720\n00:36:25.578 --> 00:36:27.659\n>> And we'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.980\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.540\nwe are continuing on with more Windows 10.\n\n5\n00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.180\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto lend his expertise on that topic,\n\n6\n00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.590\nis our good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.980\nWes, welcome back, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.700\nSo glad to have you.\n\n9\n00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.490\nHow's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.120\n>> Man, it's going great, and\nthank you for having me here.\n\n11\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.540\nThat's right,\nwe're diving back into Windows 10.\n\n12\n00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.200\nMoving along in our MCSA track\nremember this is the 7698 exam and\n\n13\n00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.270\none of the things that are gonna call\nout is well how to install Windows.\n\n14\n00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.680\nI figure if you gonna need to know\na little bit about Windows you should know\n\n15\n00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.550\nwhere to start and\nthat's what we're gonna look at today.\n\n16\n00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.730\nWe're gonna look at\nthe installation of Windows.\n\n17\n00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.170\nWe got a few different things\nthat we're gonna tackle.\n\n18\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.570\nOne of the first things that we're\ngonna tackle is just the basic clean\n\n19\n00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.530\ninstallation.\n\n20\n00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.510\nIn a previous episode, we talked about\nthe different types of installations and\n\n21\n00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.060\nsome of the considerations,\nwhichever one that you're gonna implement.\n\n22\n00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.130\nWe talked about a clean installation,\nwe talked about an upgrade installation,\n\n23\n00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.750\nand what those really mean for us.\n\n24\n00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.830\nAs a quick recap, keep in mind clean\ninstallations gonna format everything,\n\n25\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.660\nincluding your applications.\n\n26\n00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.850\nUser data is going to be gone,\nWindows settings, all of that is gone.\n\n27\n00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.130\nThe upgrade, in place upgrades,\n\n28\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.660\nkeep in mind they do retain things like\nyour applications, your Windows settings,\n\n29\n00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.680\nyour files, and because of that if you\nhave a line of business application that\n\n30\n00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.935\nmaybe you can't afford to format and lose,\nthe in place upgrade might be for you.\n\n31\n00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:36.185\nSo that's what we're gonna tackle today.\n\n32\n00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:38.905\nWe talked enough about it and\nsome of those considerations,\n\n33\n00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:40.085\nnow we're gonna actually implement it.\n\n34\n00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:42.825\nIn fact,\nrather than just keep talking about it,\n\n35\n00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:44.405\nlet's show you an installation here.\n\n36\n00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:46.635\nAll right, so we've got\na bare-metal hub machine here and\n\n37\n00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:51.230\nwe're gonna go ahead and what we've done\nis we've put in our DVD if you will,\n\n38\n00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.360\nit's an ISO file and\nit's gonna boot into WinPE.\n\n39\n00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.780\nNow, keep in mind as this is booting up,\nwe did mention you have to determine how,\n\n40\n00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.910\nif you are gonna do a clean installation,\n\n41\n00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.150\nwhat is the media gonna\nbe that you're gonna use?\n\n42\n00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.420\nKeep in mind that you can\nuse things like your DVD or\n\n43\n00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.470\nUSB if you've got a bootable USB.\n\n44\n00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.070\nIn image deployment, which we'll\nshow you how to create an image and\n\n45\n00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.350\nthen deploy that image,\nyou use the network, right?\n\n46\n00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.810\nYou do a PXE boot a pre-execution\nenvironment boot, if you will.\n\n47\n00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.550\nKeep in mind that what we're doing right\nnow is essentially the DVD installation,\n\n48\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.860\nopen it up the cup holder, just kidding.\n\n49\n00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.370\nThe optical tray and\n\n50\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.215\nputting in the DVD and\npushing any key to start the installation.\n\n51\n00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:37.440\nDan did show me where the other key\nwas right before we started, so\n\n52\n00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.960\nwe should be good.\n\n53\n00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.050\n>> It was right there.\n\n54\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.570\n>> It was.\n\n55\n00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.776\n>> Right in front of\nyour face the whole time.\n\n56\n00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:42.630\n>> The whole time, that's right.\n\n57\n00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.748\nSo couple of things that we start out\nwith is just your language to install.\n\n58\n00:02:46.748 --> 00:02:50.200\nNow, do wanna keep in mind that\nthis is just the base language that\n\n59\n00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.530\nthe installation media is written in.\n\n60\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.765\nIf you will or programmed in however you\nwanna say that, you can change this later.\n\n61\n00:02:57.765 --> 00:03:00.105\nIt's something that you can't\nchange on the initial install,\n\n62\n00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:04.095\nit's based on whatever your ISO file is or\nyour DVD, your media is.\n\n63\n00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:08.925\nTime, currency and format we'll show\nsome of those post installation options\n\n64\n00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:11.960\ncoming up and\nthen your keyboard layout as well.\n\n65\n00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.950\nWe choose Next and then if we\nwanna launch into something like\n\n66\n00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.570\nthe Windows Recovery Environment,\nthat was taken care of in the 7697,\n\n67\n00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.280\nthey did a real good job, so if you're not\nfamiliar with the recovery environment,\n\n68\n00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.030\ngo back and watch those videos.\n\n69\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.850\nEven I would say going into this exam\nas well, so that you're prepared.\n\n70\n00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.470\nOne of the things that [INAUDIBLE]\nalways happens with a Microsoft exam is\n\n71\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.980\nthere's a little bit of overlap on both.\n\n72\n00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.820\nSo definitely go back and watch those.\n\n73\n00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.550\nBut it's just as simple here,\nis choosing install now.\n\n74\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.080\nNow goes through a couple of little\nthings here that it's gonna do,\n\n75\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.280\nit's gonna check the hardware here and\nthen what we should get is\n\n76\n00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.100\ncouple of things, we should get\nan end user license agreement.\n\n77\n00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.140\nAll right, and then the next thing\nthat we get is, well let's go ahead,\n\n78\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.770\nwe'll accept the EULA and then we'll test\nDan on his knowledge of the end user\n\n79\n00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.710\nlicence agreement here at the end of the,\njust kidding.\n\n80\n00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.500\nAll right, we'll choose Next.\n\n81\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.280\nNow, we've got a couple of\ndifferent options here.\n\n82\n00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.132\nIt's interesting, they give you\noptions and, well, not really.\n\n83\n00:04:07.132 --> 00:04:08.640\nThey kinda looks like\nthey give you options,\n\n84\n00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.917\nI'll show you what I mean in a second.\n\n85\n00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:13.205\nOn the exam,\nthey might give you a text based answer,\n\n86\n00:04:13.205 --> 00:04:17.734\nit doesn't give you any kind of exhibit\nlike this screen here to look at and\n\n87\n00:04:17.734 --> 00:04:22.414\nyou'll notice that it says Upgrade\ninstallation which is something we're\n\n88\n00:04:22.414 --> 00:04:28.000\ngonna take a look at here in a bit later\nin this episode and they also have Custom.\n\n89\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.155\nAll right, now you might say wait Wes,\n\n90\n00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:33.280\nI thought you were showing\nus a clean install?\n\n91\n00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.220\nWhat's a custom installation?\n\n92\n00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.360\nThat's a clean install.\n\n93\n00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.210\nI don't know why they call it a custom\ninstallation cuz basically what this is\n\n94\n00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.210\ngonna do is it's gonna format\nthe whole entire drive.\n\n95\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.490\nIt's gonna remove all of your settings\nif you have a prior installation\n\n96\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.860\nof Windows on here.\n\n97\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.120\nSo just keep that in mind for the exam.\n\n98\n00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.660\nIf you do need a little bit of help,\n\n99\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.460\nI love these little hyperlinks\nthat they have in here.\n\n100\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.100\nAnd it can tell, here you go,\n\n101\n00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.420\npretty much what you need to know if\nyou are going to move or upgrade.\n\n102\n00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.430\n>> I'm guessing they call it custom\nbecause it does allow you to\n\n103\n00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.160\nlike partition your drive and\nthings of that nature.\n\n104\n00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.092\nYou make it kind of a little\nmore the way you want it.\n\n105\n00:05:10.092 --> 00:05:12.581\nBut Wes is right, other than that\nyou're basically just saying,\n\n106\n00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:15.026\nhere's the operating system,\nplease install it on this drive,\n\n107\n00:05:15.026 --> 00:05:16.330\nthank you very much and hit next.\n\n108\n00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.930\n>> [LAUGH] And\nthat's exactly what it is, so\n\n109\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.420\nit doesn't really give\nyou too many options.\n\n110\n00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.690\nWell, let's look at the options\nthat Dan was talking about.\n\n111\n00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.850\nIf I do hit Custom,\nthe next screen that I get, well,\n\n112\n00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.190\nthat's exactly what he was talking about.\n\n113\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.820\nYou'll see right there the ability\nto install it on the hard drive.\n\n114\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.930\nWell, what did he mean by customization?\n\n115\n00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.630\nIf I want to,\nlet's say I got a 1 terabyte drive and\n\n116\n00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.700\nmaybe I don't wanna give a whole\nterabyte over to Windows.\n\n117\n00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.060\nMaybe you're doing something like\noperating system isolation where you wanna\n\n118\n00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.780\nput your operating system on one partition\nand your data on another partition.\n\n119\n00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.100\nKeep in mind you're not doing this for\nfault tolerance or redundancy.\n\n120\n00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.900\nYou're just saying that if I get\na virus in my operating system,\n\n121\n00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.830\njust blow the operating system away and\nmy data's okay.\n\n122\n00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.570\nSo you can do things like that.\n\n123\n00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.680\nMaybe you're doing a multi-boot.\n\n124\n00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.290\nMaybe you're in an environment that's\nmixed environments using a lot of Linux\n\n125\n00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.870\nand a lot of Windows and\nyou need a Linux box, too.\n\n126\n00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.750\nWell, you can partition it\nright here if you want.\n\n127\n00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.170\n>> And Wes, it's really popular and for\ngood reason, to do the whole isolation of\n\n128\n00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.110\nthe operating system because\nwe wanna do an upgrade, right?\n\n129\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.000\nYou wanna do something that\ninvolves a system-wide thing,\n\n130\n00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.194\nyou don't have to worry about your program\nfiles or your applications, and your data,\n\n131\n00:06:17.194 --> 00:06:19.510\nyour pictures, whatever else you have.\n\n132\n00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.110\nYou can just focus in on\nthe outputting system itself and\n\n133\n00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.010\neverything else stays off to the side,\nuntouched.\n\n134\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.860\nAnd so it's a really popular thing\nto do so if you are ready and\n\n135\n00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.940\nwilling go ahead and do that.\n\n136\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.750\nI say it's a worthy effort.\n\n137\n00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.390\n>> I pretty much do this every time on my\nown personal machines I'll do operating\n\n138\n00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.290\nsystem isolation.\n\n139\n00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.930\nIf it's a Windows machine, I know my\nWindows machine at the house is that way\n\n140\n00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.710\nand it does lend itself to,\nif you're running an antivirus scan,\n\n141\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.940\nagain it's gonna try to quarantine\nthose viruses to that single partition,\n\n142\n00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.210\nrather than hopping partitions or\ncorrupting your data altogether.\n\n143\n00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.930\nNow, there might be a couple things.\n\n144\n00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.490\nThis isn't so much for the exam.\n\n145\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.410\nHowever, I do want you to know this for\nthe real world.\n\n146\n00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:05.840\nIf you ever get into a situation where you\ncome into this screen here and it's blank.\n\n147\n00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.590\nWell, sometimes there are a couple\nof things that can happen.\n\n148\n00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.920\nIf you have a RAID controller, let's say\nan external RAID controller, and what I\n\n149\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.040\nmean by that is one that's not built in or\nintegrated into the motherboard.\n\n150\n00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.370\nIt might be that you need a driver for\n\n151\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.855\nthe RAID controller card\nthat's in the machine.\n\n152\n00:07:19.855 --> 00:07:22.780\nIf it is something,\na RAID controller that you have\n\n153\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.890\nintegrated into the functionality\nof the chip set of the motherboard,\n\n154\n00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.680\nit could be a chip set driver for\nthe motherboard itself.\n\n155\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.470\nYou get the ability here,\nand let me show you.\n\n156\n00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.850\nYou can load the driver if you need to.\n\n157\n00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.350\nYou've got that chip set driver,\nor that RAID controller driver,\n\n158\n00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.120\ngo to the manufacturer.\n\n159\n00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.368\nDownload it, put it on the thumb drive,\nand then choose Load Driver.\n\n160\n00:07:41.368 --> 00:07:45.658\nAnd it's gonna give you the option, it's\ngonna say okay do you wanna browse and\n\n161\n00:07:45.658 --> 00:07:47.723\nthen I could browse to that location.\n\n162\n00:07:47.723 --> 00:07:50.583\nNow, I don't have to worry\nabout a driver here, but\n\n163\n00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:52.997\nthis is where you would\nload them if you did.\n\n164\n00:07:52.997 --> 00:07:56.345\nI will also say that again, not so\nmuch for the exam, but more for\n\n165\n00:07:56.345 --> 00:08:00.251\nthe real world You always wanna update\nyour Windows operating system, and\n\n166\n00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:04.467\nthere's not really a guarantee that when\nyou install your operating system that\n\n167\n00:08:04.467 --> 00:08:06.960\nyour network adapter's\ngonna be recognized.\n\n168\n00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.500\nNow, Windows does a very good job.\n\n169\n00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.100\nThey've got a lot of Plug-in and\nplay drivers,\n\n170\n00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.580\na pretty big driver story that\nis already bundled with Windows.\n\n171\n00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.250\nSo I would say probably\n80 to 90% of the time,\n\n172\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.560\nyou are not gonna have\nto worry about this.\n\n173\n00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.370\nBut I will tell you,\n\n174\n00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.420\nif it is a mission critical machine and\nyou need to get it going online quick.\n\n175\n00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.870\nGo ahead and just do your research.\n\n176\n00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:33.370\nGo out to the manufacturer's website, find\nout, let's say, it's an Intel adapter.\n\n177\n00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.700\nDownload the driver.\n\n178\n00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.880\nPut it on the thumb drive.\n\n179\n00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.200\nPlug it into the machine.\n\n180\n00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.300\nUse this wizard here to\nbrowse to that location.\n\n181\n00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.560\nLoad the driver up.\n\n182\n00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.130\nAnd then after you've got the driver\nloaded up, let me show you here,\n\n183\n00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.930\nyou can do a rescan.\n\n184\n00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.070\nIt isn't gonna find anything that\nI don't have a driver present, but\n\n185\n00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.600\nthen it'll try to rescan it,\n\n186\n00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.149\nit'll look at the removal media and\nhopefully it'll pull that driver over.\n\n187\n00:08:58.335 --> 00:09:01.630\nNow that's how you get the drivers going.\n\n188\n00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.490\nOnce you are ready to go from there,\n\n189\n00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:08.190\nit's just a simple as clicking\nnext which is your install.\n\n190\n00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.830\nNow that your install is going,\n\n191\n00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.270\nyou'll see that a couple of things\nare happening in the background.\n\n192\n00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:17.070\nOne of the things that happens is when PE\nis now grabbing the install.wim file and\n\n193\n00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.010\nit is unpacking this image and\nit's writing it to the hard drive.\n\n194\n00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:25.120\nNow, as it writes it to the hard drive, it\nmakes several configuration passes setting\n\n195\n00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.920\nup different configurations if you will.\n\n196\n00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.800\nAnd then finally,\n\n197\n00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.270\nwhat we want is we hope that once it's\npost in, the post installation is done and\n\n198\n00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:38.050\nwhat you'll see here, is this post\ninstallation get going fast screen.\n\n199\n00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.940\nNow you could use the express settings\nthat you see down here in the lower\n\n200\n00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.030\nright hand corner and this makes it\nfairly easy you just get started.\n\n201\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.040\nLike it says express settings or\nyou could choose, and again this one's\n\n202\n00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.700\nkinda hard to see right here but\nwe also got the customize settings.\n\n203\n00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.760\nI would use the express settings,\nbut well what fun is that.\n\n204\n00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.440\nWell we wanna show you if there's some of\nthat customizations here that you can do.\n\n205\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.762\nAll right, so we'll go into\nthe customization process here.\n\n206\n00:10:03.762 --> 00:10:07.510\nAll right,\n\n207\n00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.730\nyou could see some of the things you\ncan turn on, you can turn it off.\n\n208\n00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.020\nAgain, personalization,\nlocation, and stuff, and\n\n209\n00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.050\nwe're gonna leave all of these pretty\nmuch like the express settings.\n\n210\n00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.460\nBut it is good to actually see these here,\nBrowser options, error reporting and\n\n211\n00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.060\nstuff, the customer experience program,\nall of that.\n\n212\n00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.870\nYou can opt in or you can opt out and\n\n213\n00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.070\nthen what it does is that it goes\nthrough the process of detecting\n\n214\n00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:35.510\nall of the devices and\nit starts to build the user profile.\n\n215\n00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.600\nNow let me make sure that I do correct\nsomething because the user profile\n\n216\n00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.200\ntechnically isn't created till the user\nthat you create first logs in, and\n\n217\n00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.900\nthat's where the next step actually\nis it's the user account creation and\n\n218\n00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.650\nthat's the screen that we see here.\n\n219\n00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:48.990\nWe're gonna do a couple of things.\n\n220\n00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.696\nWe could join this computer right\nto a domain, as you can see Azure,\n\n221\n00:10:52.696 --> 00:10:56.650\nAzure in the Cloud there, or we could\njoin a local active directory domain.\n\n222\n00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.130\nYou might say, well wait a second,\ncan we name the computer?\n\n223\n00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.330\nDo we have to join an Active Directory\nDomain, what if I'm in a Soho?\n\n224\n00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.880\nWell that's okay, it's kind of a little\ncryptic in it's terminology here.\n\n225\n00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.670\nIt says,\nJoin a local Active Directory domain.\n\n226\n00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.800\nAnd then once you clicked this,\nnotice it's gonna tell you,\n\n227\n00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.280\nif you plan to join the PC to a domain,\nwe'll help you set up a local account now.\n\n228\n00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.170\nSo that's what we're gonna do and\nwe're gonna choose next on this, alright.\n\n229\n00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.890\nAnd it's gonna say,\nwho's gonna use this PC?\n\n230\n00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.060\nAnd I'm gonna use some of the same\nnames that I've been using.\n\n231\n00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.360\nWe'll just call this one admin and\nthen we'll type our password.\n\n232\n00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.810\nAnother one of those super\nsecret Microsoft passwords.\n\n233\n00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.970\nAnd we'll choose Next.\n\n234\n00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.230\nNow at this point it is\ngoing to build the profile.\n\n235\n00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.090\nSo let me just again be specific here.\n\n236\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.080\nBecause right here, now it's saying hi,\nwelcome, sit back, drink your coffee, and\n\n237\n00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.770\nwe're gonna get everything set up for\nyou and everything will be just awesome.\n\n238\n00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.370\nSo what we have going on in\nthe background guys, so you know.\n\n239\n00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.300\nIs that there is something\nknown as the default profile.\n\n240\n00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.490\nAnd it's kind of like a template.\n\n241\n00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.130\nAny time you create a new user, and\nthat user logs in for the first time.\n\n242\n00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.600\nThe default profile gets copied down and\n\n243\n00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.020\nmakes basically a second duplicate copy\nand then it attaches that username to it.\n\n244\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.820\nAnd then when the user logs in,\n\n245\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.110\nall of their settings will be\nnow located in their profile.\n\n246\n00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.500\nStores things like their desktop, stores\nthings like their documents if you will.\n\n247\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.750\nWhat else?\nPictures, videos.\n\n248\n00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:28.240\nSo all that is stored in the user profile\nand some the user settings as well.\n\n249\n00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:34.820\nNow it could take a little bit for\nthe first user to actually get logged in.\n\n250\n00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:39.140\nBut as you can see the installation\nreally isn't that bad.\n\n251\n00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.250\nWhen it comes down to it,\n\n252\n00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:44.330\nthe big thing with your installation that\njust do your research ahead of time.\n\n253\n00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.430\nIf you've got manufacturer's help,\nyou can go up to their websites and\n\n254\n00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.120\nyou can find out.\n\n255\n00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.950\nDo they have drivers for\nthe current operating system,\n\n256\n00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.710\nthe current edition of Windows.\n\n257\n00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.100\nIf you do, can you pre-download those?\n\n258\n00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:02.570\nA lot of times, the manufacturers will\nwork with Windows, and they'll try to\n\n259\n00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:07.630\nbundle them in with the shipping of the\noperating system when it first comes out.\n\n260\n00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.250\nSometimes depending you might have to\nwait later on till a service pack.\n\n261\n00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:15.010\nNow, you can see right here that\nwe've now logged into the machine.\n\n262\n00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.190\nThe profile is built.\n\n263\n00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.420\nAnd we're ready to go.\n\n264\n00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.730\nThe installation is done.\n\n265\n00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.190\nIt's asking me about my networks.\n\n266\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.850\nThis is some of the post installation\noptions that you have to configure, and\n\n267\n00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.020\nit's asking me, do I trust this network?\n\n268\n00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.270\nAnd if I trust the network,\nit assigns the private profile.\n\n269\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:33.590\nBut Dan, you can see right here,\na basic clean installation.\n\n270\n00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.720\nIt's not a very automated\nprocess kind of decentralized.\n\n271\n00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.580\nBut for\nthe most part it's not too difficult.\n\n272\n00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.150\n>> No, pretty easy to walk through and\ncoming from,\n\n273\n00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:47.290\nI guess Windows 95 era,\nmy first Windows installation.\n\n274\n00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.115\nThis is a whole lot less painless\nthan it was what it used to be.\n\n275\n00:13:50.115 --> 00:13:54.305\nThey come a long way,\nmade it much easier and faster.\n\n276\n00:13:54.305 --> 00:13:59.275\nI mean basically, Wes has installed\nWindows within really about ten minutes?\n\n277\n00:13:59.275 --> 00:14:00.925\n>> Yeah.\n>> It takes you about ten minutes to get\n\n278\n00:14:00.925 --> 00:14:05.600\na full blown Windows operating system\ninstalled on your computer, up and\n\n279\n00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.590\nrunning and now you just have\nsome post installation to do\n\n280\n00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.870\nwhich will take you varying amass of\ntime depending on what you need to do.\n\n281\n00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.680\nBut other than that, very straightforward.\n\n282\n00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.700\nI love this, we used to keep images all\nthe time, using third party software\n\n283\n00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.600\nbecause it will take forever and a day Now\nI can just say, I need Windows no problem.\n\n284\n00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.920\nThrow in the DVD and hit install and\n\n285\n00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.060\nthen ten minutes later I've\ngot a working machine.\n\n286\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.530\nI really like the clean installs.\n\n287\n00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:29.400\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n288\n00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.530\nWhen it comes down to it,\nI'm kind of blessed because in the time\n\n289\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:39.650\nI got into computing versus the time that\nDan's been in the business for awhile now.\n\n290\n00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:42.140\nYou don't have to worry about some of the\nthings that you had to worry about before\n\n291\n00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.300\nlike all the how detection and\nstuff like that.\n\n292\n00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.490\nThey've really made it simplistic.\n\n293\n00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.660\nNow that was a clean install,alright.\n\n294\n00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.250\nKeep in mind that everything is formatted,\nwe've got a fresh, I say fresh user but\n\n295\n00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.410\na fresh user profile if you will.\n\n296\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.050\nWe're clean.\n\n297\n00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:56.750\nWe're ready to go.\n\n298\n00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.040\nWe do have some post-installations\nthat we need to take care of,\n\n299\n00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.920\nbut we want to show you the other\ntype of installation that you can do.\n\n300\n00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.770\nNow, this installation isn't quite so\nclean [LAUGH].\n\n301\n00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:07.560\n>> Dirty.\n\n302\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.943\n>> That's right,\nthis is dirty installation.\n\n303\n00:15:08.943 --> 00:15:10.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And what do we mean by that?\n\n304\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.090\nRemember what we've already\ntouched base on the fact,\n\n305\n00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:15.445\nthat the upgrade type of installation,\nin place upgrade.\n\n306\n00:15:15.445 --> 00:15:18.000\nLeave remnants of the old\noperating system behind.\n\n307\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.770\nNow, let me show you what I mean here,\nfor instance I've got Windows 8.1 here,\n\n308\n00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:23.440\nit is updated.\n\n309\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.140\nI will tell you, do your updates\nbefore you do an in place upgrade.\n\n310\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.800\nYou wanna make sure\neverything is up to date,\n\n311\n00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.480\nin the current operating system you have,\nbefore you install the new one.\n\n312\n00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.780\nBecause of the fact that it is\nleaving some of those remnants behind.\n\n313\n00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.830\nNow let's go ahead, I'll tell you.\n\n314\n00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.170\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe will get logged in here.\n\n315\n00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:45.822\nThe other part of this, I have to say,\nis something to keep in mind.\n\n316\n00:15:45.822 --> 00:15:51.757\nWhen you are doing an an upgrade,\nall right.\n\n317\n00:15:51.757 --> 00:15:55.274\nWhether you're doing an upgrade, I say\nwell you know an upgrade, whether you're\n\n318\n00:15:55.274 --> 00:15:58.741\ndoing an upgrade or you're doing a clean\ninstallation one of the things that the do\n\n319\n00:15:58.741 --> 00:16:02.032\ncall out in the Windows exam is being\nable to migrate from previous versions.\n\n320\n00:16:02.032 --> 00:16:04.043\nSo.\nWe're kind of doing two things here at\n\n321\n00:16:04.043 --> 00:16:06.445\nonce so you can understand\nwhere we're going with this.\n\n322\n00:16:06.445 --> 00:16:12.400\nWe're gonna show you the in place upgrade\nfrom an earlier edition of Windows.\n\n323\n00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.530\nBut at the same time we're also\ngonna show you how to migrate\n\n324\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.610\nfrom a previous installation of Windows.\n\n325\n00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.360\nNow there's a couple of things that\nyou have to have in order to do this.\n\n326\n00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.430\nYou have to have what's know as the USMT\ninstalled in order for this to work.\n\n327\n00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:29.024\nNow with the USMT\n>> That's a branch of the military, right?\n\n328\n00:16:29.024 --> 00:16:31.800\n[LAUGH]\n>> I was gonna say that's a crazy acronym.\n\n329\n00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.770\nLet's not acronym you to death and\nassume you know it,\n\n330\n00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.650\nthat's the user state migration tool.\n\n331\n00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:36.490\nAnd here comes another one,\n\n332\n00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.140\njust when you thought we were done with\nacronyms I got five more for you or so.\n\n333\n00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:45.010\nWindows ADK, that's the Windows Assessment\nand Deployment Kit, and it is what you\n\n334\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.630\nwill need to download ahead of time in\norder to have the user state migration.\n\n335\n00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.880\nI actually have what's known\nas the technician's computer.\n\n336\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.420\nWhen you're gonna migration you\ngot a technician's computer\n\n337\n00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.370\nthat you have to download\nthe ADK in order to get\n\n338\n00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.600\naccess to the user state migration\nthat we're gonna show you.\n\n339\n00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.910\nSo let me go ahead and show you right\nhere with our Windows 10 machine.\n\n340\n00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.130\nAgain keep in mind that this\nis our technician's computer.\n\n341\n00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.880\nOnce you download and\ninstall the ADK set up,\n\n342\n00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.910\nit's on some of the deployment\ntools that we're using right now.\n\n343\n00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.060\nIt's about a four gig install, if you use\nlike the assessment and performance tool\n\n344\n00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.790\nkits that are in there it comes up\nto about six and a half, 6.6 gigs.\n\n345\n00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:25.350\nSo make sure that when you install it you\ndo have adequate installation space or\n\n346\n00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:26.530\ncapacity on your drive.\n\n347\n00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:30.760\nWe're gonna drop down to local disk C,\nProgram x86,\n\n348\n00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.560\nand you'll see that\nthere's this Windows Kit.\n\n349\n00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.030\nAnd I'll tell you why here in a second,\n\n350\n00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.530\nI'm going through the trouble\nto show you this path.\n\n351\n00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.250\nWe're gonna go to Windows Kits,\nthis is the 10, this is for\n\n352\n00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.140\nWindows ADK for Windows 10.\n\n353\n00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.700\nYou might have some in there like 8.1 and\n8,\n\n354\n00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.060\nthose would be the prior editions\nof Windows in that folder so\n\n355\n00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.338\nbe careful, especially on the exam,\nmake sure you pick the right path.\n\n356\n00:17:50.338 --> 00:17:54.100\nAnd then a door in front of a door,\nwe've got the assessment and\n\n357\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.420\ndeployment kit, and then last but\nnot least, look here,\n\n358\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.880\nwe've got the user state migration tool\nand that's what we're really looking at.\n\n359\n00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.920\nNow the next thing you'll have, and\n\n360\n00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.220\nthe what's kind of interesting with this\nDan is this a you'll see that the three\n\n361\n00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.790\ndifferent architectures that we\ntalked about when we talked about\n\n362\n00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.420\nimplementing Windows in a previous episode\nwe said that they're gonna be 64 bit.\n\n363\n00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:18.300\nWe said that they're gonna be the AMD\nbased, right, system on a chip and stuff.\n\n364\n00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.120\nAnd that they're also gonna be the 32 bit.\n\n365\n00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.900\nWell you can see that you\nuse user-state migration for\n\n366\n00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.210\neach edition of Windows that you have.\n\n367\n00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.830\nThat's another thing that you\nhave to keep in mind, and\n\n368\n00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.003\nthat's why we want to show\nyou this path here so\n\n369\n00:18:30.003 --> 00:18:33.880\nthat if you are on the test you know that\nif you're in a 64 bit, you go to amd64.\n\n370\n00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.780\nNow you might say but wait a second,\nis this an Intel platform?\n\n371\n00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:42.990\nWell yeah, but AMD really has the 64 bit\ncomputing architecture that we use today.\n\n372\n00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:49.310\nNow that being said, here is your path,\nall right, the path to destruction.\n\n373\n00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.660\nI don't know.\n[LAUGH] So\n\n374\n00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.770\nwe got program files X-86 Windows\nkits as you can see, and\n\n375\n00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:58.010\nthis is gonna be important for the command\nline option that you're gonna see.\n\n376\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.649\nNow there are two components in here\nthat we need to talk briefly about so\n\n377\n00:19:01.649 --> 00:19:06.750\nthat you're aware of what they do and then\nwe'll show you exactly what they'll do.\n\n378\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.210\nThe first one is scanstate.\n\n379\n00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.510\nAll right, scanstate is one of\nthe major components in the USMT,\n\n380\n00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:17.350\nUser State Migration Tool,\nthat collects all of the user settings,\n\n381\n00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.220\nthe user data, the Windows settings, and\n\n382\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:24.200\nstores them in an intermediate store\non the computer that you're upgrading.\n\n383\n00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.860\nOr the one right before\nyou do the clean install.\n\n384\n00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:30.560\nNow once you use scanstate you go ahead,\n\n385\n00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.870\nyou do in your in place upgrade or\nyou do you clean installation, and\n\n386\n00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:38.000\nthen you load the USMT back on that\nmachine and you run load state.\n\n387\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.770\nAnd load state looks at that data store,\nwhich is just XML files, I'll show you\n\n388\n00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:46.420\nthem here in a second, and it says, this\nis the information in a migration file\n\n389\n00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:50.360\nthat we need to put back on the machine\nand it puts the user data back there.\n\n390\n00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.090\nKeep in mind this is not a replacement for\nbackups.\n\n391\n00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:57.510\nThis is only for the purpose,\nit does back data up, but\n\n392\n00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.330\nit's only for\nthe purposes of the migration.\n\n393\n00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.450\nYou do not want to use\nthis as a substitution for\n\n394\n00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.900\nany kind of back up software,\nalways use your backup software.\n\n395\n00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.290\nNow what I need to do, and\nI've already gone ahead and done this so\n\n396\n00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.960\nyou guys don't have to or you guys don't\nhave to wait for me to copy it over.\n\n397\n00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:17.760\nI need to take this folder, AMD64,\nand i need to copy this over to\n\n398\n00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.700\nthe source computer,\nsource of the upgrade or the installation,\n\n399\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.190\nprior to running the installation so that\nI'll have these tools on that machine.\n\n400\n00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.750\nAnd that's what we've got here.\n\n401\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.150\nWe've got our Windows 8 machine,\n8.1 more specifically, and\n\n402\n00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.460\nyou'll notice if I come down here.\n\n403\n00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.310\nI'll go ahead and\nopen up File Explorer, and\n\n404\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:43.090\nthen from File Explorer we'll\nget down to C: here and\n\n405\n00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:47.720\nyou should see that I have already\nloaded up the User State Migration Tool.\n\n406\n00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.400\nNow technically I don't really need\nload state on this if I'm doing a clean\n\n407\n00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.080\ninstallation.\n\n408\n00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.240\nWhy?\nBecause, well,\n\n409\n00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.890\nonce I do the clean install it's gonna\nformat it but I do need scanstate here.\n\n410\n00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.740\nIf I'm doing an in-place upgrade,\nthat might be a little bit different.\n\n411\n00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.690\nAll right, so now that's enough\nabout USMT and scanstate.\n\n412\n00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.310\nWhat is it that I'm doing\nthat I'm backing up?\n\n413\n00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.430\nWell I tell you what,\nwe got another user on this machine here.\n\n414\n00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.110\nLet me go ahead and\nsign out as my administrative user,\n\n415\n00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.850\nand you'll see that I have user one here,\nright.\n\n416\n00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:17.550\nWe're gonna go ahead,\n\n417\n00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.410\nwe're gonna make some documents, we're\ngonna make some important documents that\n\n418\n00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.800\nman we got to save before\nwe do the upgrade.\n\n419\n00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.870\nIf don't save it before\nwe do the upgrade and\n\n420\n00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:29.080\nthen we do the upgrade well then\nthose documents are gonna be lost.\n\n421\n00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.680\nSo we'll go ahead and we're gonna\nget signed in here as the User01.\n\n422\n00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.640\nAnd let's go ahead and\n\n423\n00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.475\nwe're gonna create some very important\ninformation that we can't afford to lose.\n\n424\n00:21:40.475 --> 00:21:43.270\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm sure it's gonna be awesome.\n\n425\n00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.860\n>> It's gonna be absolutely amazing,\nI could tell you.\n\n426\n00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.001\n>> This is a text document.\n\n427\n00:21:47.001 --> 00:21:49.592\n[LAUGH]\n>> Don't steal my thunder now.\n\n428\n00:21:49.592 --> 00:21:50.266\nThat's exactly where I'm going.\n\n429\n00:21:50.266 --> 00:21:54.617\nThese are important files and\nyou have to have them, right.\n\n430\n00:21:54.617 --> 00:22:01.248\nSo we'll go ahead and on the desktop\nhere we're gonna do exactly that,\n\n431\n00:22:01.248 --> 00:22:07.120\nwe're gonna do a new text\ndocument that is very important.\n\n432\n00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.170\n>> It is important because if we don't\nmake these documents then you can't see\n\n433\n00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.730\nhow this works so-\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n434\n00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.720\n>> They are important.\n\n435\n00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.690\n>> And I'm gonna say,\n\n436\n00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:21.810\nthis is Very important text, all right.\n\n437\n00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:25.360\nAnd we'll go ahead and save that and we'll\nclose that, now that's on the desktop.\n\n438\n00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.630\nLet me go ahead, I wanna show you that\nif I just stopped here with just text,\n\n439\n00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.640\nright, and documents you don't really see\nwhat the user state migration is actually\n\n440\n00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.180\ndoing here.\n\n441\n00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:40.890\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do is we'll run our,\n\n442\n00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:45.920\nwe'll go ahead and\ngo into the downloads folder.\n\n443\n00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.090\nWell I'll tell you what,\nwe'll go to documents.\n\n444\n00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:53.880\nWe'll put another very\nimportant document here, and\n\n445\n00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.620\nwe'll call this Very important as well.\n\n446\n00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.510\nNow one of the things that you\nmight notice is that we don't have,\n\n447\n00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.830\nwe can't see the file extensions.\n\n448\n00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.340\nNotice that we cannot see the file\nextensions right here, right?\n\n449\n00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.810\nIt says Very important but\nthat's all I get.\n\n450\n00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:16.590\nI know that this is a rich text\ndocument but I don't see the extension.\n\n451\n00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:19.830\nSo let's go ahead and\nmodify some settings for user one as well.\n\n452\n00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.210\nMaybe user one wants to\nview those file extensions.\n\n453\n00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:27.700\nWell we could choose View, all right,\nwe'll hide the extensions.\n\n454\n00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:32.710\nWe'll uncheck that and we'll choose\nShow Hidden Files and Folders, all right.\n\n455\n00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.490\nNow if I come back,\nlet's see that in action.\n\n456\n00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:40.250\nIf I come back to Local Disk C you can\nsee that ProgramData kinda grayed out or\n\n457\n00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.560\ndulled there, so\nthat's a hidden system file.\n\n458\n00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.860\nSo now we have some settings, right.\n\n459\n00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.123\nNow the next thing that we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna go ahead now that we have some\n\n460\n00:23:48.123 --> 00:23:49.794\nthings to save, is we're gonna log out.\n\n461\n00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.160\nAnd we will go ahead and\nlog out as our end user here.\n\n462\n00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:04.630\nAnd we're gonna log back in,\nAs our administrator.\n\n463\n00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:09.890\nAnd what we'll do is we'll go ahead and\nwe'll start the migration process.\n\n464\n00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.010\nNow Dan, this could take a little bit and\nI know Dan's over here looking at me\n\n465\n00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.270\nsaying, I don't know about the time,\nman, you sure we have enough time here?\n\n466\n00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.080\nAnd I think it is going to take a little\nmore time than what we have left so.\n\n467\n00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.190\n>> Okay, well I guess we will have\nto pick this back up with a part\n\n468\n00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:23.640\ntwo which we always look forward to.\n\n469\n00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.160\nSo Wes, thanks for dropping by.\n\n470\n00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.170\nWe'll see you in part two, hopefully\nwe'll see you guys there as well.\n\n471\n00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.420\nAs for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n472\n00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.960\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyou host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n473\n00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.740\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n474\n00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.167\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n475\n00:24:37.167 -->

another\ngreat episode of IT PRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.180\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n5\n00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.310\ntoday's episode we're actually doing the\npart two continuation in our Windows 10\n\n6\n00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.330\nseries on installing, the different\nways for installing Windows 10.\n\n7\n00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.860\nJoining us back in the studio\nto continue on that very path\n\n8\n00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.260\nis our good friend Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.510\nWes, welcome back sir.\n\n10\n00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.520\nSo good to have you,\nwhere do we begin today?\n\n11\n00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.230\n>> That's right.\n\n12\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.950\nYou know in the last episode,\nDan got on me.\n\n13\n00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.670\nRight after we said, okay, nice episode.\n\n14\n00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.915\nHe goes, man, do you realize you\nleft them with a cliffhanger?\n\n15\n00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:45.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, he's got your back out there.\n\n16\n00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.330\n[LAUGH] So we're coming back,\nand what we're gonna do,\n\n17\n00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.950\nin the previous episode we were\ngetting ready to do a migration,\n\n18\n00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.450\na user state migration tool and we had\njust gone to our Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n19\n00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.950\nWe had copied over the USMT and\nI said, and that's the USMT and\n\n20\n00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.381\nnow we're gonna do the migration and\nwe'll talk to you next time.\n\n21\n00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:03.140\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.590\n>> So, we're actually\n\n23\n00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.270\ntalking to you next time,\nthis is next time.\n\n24\n00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240\nSo, let's go ahead and\nwe'll dive right into it.\n\n25\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.400\nJust keep in mind that we have already\ncopied the user state migration to\n\n26\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.340\nour 8.1 machine so\n\n27\n00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.020\nthat we can migrate the user data that\nwe also created in the previous episode.\n\n28\n00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.960\nSo, here on our machine,\nI've got the Windows 8.1 machine here up.\n\n29\n00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.899\nI do want you to keep in mind the previous\nepisode when we showed you the full path\n\n30\n00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.580\nwhen you install the Windows 80K.\n\n31\n00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.090\nThat path is important.\n\n32\n00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.150\nThis path is kind of artificial,\nbecause I've copied USMT,\n\n33\n00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.740\nand I've put it right where\nI want the software to be.\n\n34\n00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.510\nThere's one other file\nthat we didn't talk about.\n\n35\n00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.630\nAnd we talked about scan state and\nload state.\n\n36\n00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.000\nScan state, scanning the computer,\ntaking those settings and data off.\n\n37\n00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.360\nLoad state, loading them back onto\nthe computer after the upgrade.\n\n38\n00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.410\nGreg's finished,\nI didn't mention the config file.\n\n39\n00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.840\nIt's an XML file, in fact, most of\nthese configurations are done by XML,\n\n40\n00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.210\nthe extensible markup language, and\nyou don't have to know that for the exam.\n\n41\n00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.260\nI can spell XML on a good day, you\ndon't have to know the language itself,\n\n42\n00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.830\njust know that the configuration\nfiles are written in XML.\n\n43\n00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.410\nAll right, so the config file.\n\n44\n00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.360\nOne of the things that's kinda\ninteresting is if you look through here,\n\n45\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.750\nyou will not find a config file.\n\n46\n00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.100\nThey are in alphabetical order,\nand you see that I have csiagent.\n\n47\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.420\nDon't worry,\nwe're not doing a CSI episode here, but\n\n48\n00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.960\nI don't have my configuration file.\n\n49\n00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.690\nSo what does a config file do?\n\n50\n00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.330\nA config file, what it does is it\nactually, you have to generate it first,\n\n51\n00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.620\nwhich is what we'll go ahead and do here.\n\n52\n00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.560\nWhen you wanna exclude certain settings,\ncertain locations if you will,\n\n53\n00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.810\nand you do not wanna back them up,\nwell you can generate the config file.\n\n54\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.020\nAnd that config file\ntells ScanState when you\n\n55\n00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.910\nrun, don't include these\nin your migration data.\n\n56\n00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.060\nSo this is something that\ncan help streamline and\n\n57\n00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.220\nmake sure that you're only pulling over\nthe settings that you want, and I'm gonna\n\n58\n00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.640\nshow you what I mean by that because not\nevery setting, not every or maybe location\n\n59\n00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.080\nwithin the user profile do you really want\nto migrate back over to the new machine.\n\n60\n00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.980\nSo to do this, first of all we have to\nnavigate to the area where the USMT is.\n\n61\n00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.700\nAnd remember, like I was telling you,\n\n62\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.730\nknow where this utility is when\nit comes to the Windows 80K.\n\n63\n00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.570\nThis is an artificial location, we just\nkind of placed it here on C colon so\n\n64\n00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.800\nwe could get to it fairly easy.\n\n65\n00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.580\nThis is a 64 bit implementation,\nso we're gonna do a CD,\n\n66\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.470\nand you'll see there's AMD 64.\n\n67\n00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.020\nIf I tab through this,\nwe also have ARM and x86.\n\n68\n00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.865\nActually it doesn't start with an x.\n\n69\n00:03:44.865 --> 00:03:48.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> AMD 64, x86 is also in there.\n\n70\n00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.870\nSo these are where those files are.\n\n71\n00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.980\nAnd it's not important that you\nknow all these different files,\n\n72\n00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.010\nbut that's the same location that we\nwere just looking at in File Explorer.\n\n73\n00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.760\nNow, some of the things\nI want you to know for\n\n74\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.890\nthe exam is how you generate\nthat configuration file.\n\n75\n00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.220\nTo do this,\nall you're going to do is type scanstate.\n\n76\n00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.490\nAnd then you're going to do a /i.\n\n77\n00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.520\nAnd then what are you gonna migrate?\n\n78\n00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.760\nApplication data, user settings,\nif you will, and user data.\n\n79\n00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.270\nWell, we're gonna say all right,\nwe're gonna migrate application settings.\n\n80\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.150\nSo we're gonna do migapp.\n\n81\n00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.940\nAll right, and then remember, migapp.xml.\n\n82\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:34.470\nAnd then we're gonna do a \\i for\ninclude as well, migrate, or miguser.xml.\n\n83\n00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.530\nSo remember,\nI said all of the files are typically XML.\n\n84\n00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.900\nIt tells the software this is what\nyou keep, this is what you don't.\n\n85\n00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.070\nAnd then what we have to do, and\nhere's the important part of this and\n\n86\n00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.800\nwhat I want you to remember on the exam,\nthey might give you a scenario where\n\n87\n00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.830\nyou need to do more than one step,\nand the totality\n\n88\n00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.330\nof each step represents a complete\nsolution, and this will be the first step.\n\n89\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.450\nSo it's genconfig, and it's gonna\nword wrap here on me a little bit,\n\n90\n00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.290\ngenconfig, all right, and\nthen we're gonna say config.xml.\n\n91\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.980\nAll right,\nlet's make sure I spelled that right.\n\n92\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.010\nAnd then we're gonna do V 13 and\nwe're gonna run that.\n\n93\n00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.450\nNow, as you can see,\nit says starting the migration process.\n\n94\n00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.160\nYou say well, wait a second Wes,\n\n95\n00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.060\nyou said you're gonna exclude stuff\nbefore you actually start migrating.\n\n96\n00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.205\nWell, all this did was\ngenerate a big file.\n\n97\n00:05:28.205 --> 00:05:29.660\nLet's verify that fact.\n\n98\n00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.060\nIn fact, if i go into here now,\ni can see that i have a config file\n\n99\n00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.730\nand if i wanted to, lets take a look\nat that, we'll do config.xml.\n\n100\n00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.070\nAnd is it going to run it?\n\n101\n00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.770\nOkay, I'll tell you what,\nwe'll just do this from the GUI.\n\n102\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.780\nThere is that config.xml file\nthat we're gonna look at, and\n\n103\n00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.320\nwe're just gonna go ahead and choose edit.\n\n104\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.170\nNow, like I said guys,\nI don't want you to worry.\n\n105\n00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.161\nDon't stress out over the test that\nyou have to know all of this stuff.\n\n106\n00:05:58.161 --> 00:05:58.800\nYou don't.\n\n107\n00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.950\nAll right, what is this doing?\n\n108\n00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.850\nWell, look at, and\nwe'll scroll back up here, and\n\n109\n00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.320\nthen kinda zoom in a little bit,\nnotice it says user data and\n\n110\n00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.430\nyou maybe see that data, it says user\ndata, migrate equals yes, right?\n\n111\n00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.870\nSo it's saying that user data,\nyou're gonna migrate, right?\n\n112\n00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.940\nSo at this point,\n\n113\n00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.840\nthe config file isn't needed cuz\nI'm not excluding anything, right?\n\n114\n00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.370\nYou can see the basis,\njust migrate everything.\n\n115\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:27.200\nWell, do I really want somebody's\nentire music collection to be migrated?\n\n116\n00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.590\nDo I really want an entire\nphoto album migrated?\n\n117\n00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.110\nDo I want shared videos,\nshared files migrated?\n\n118\n00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.610\nWell, you might.\n\n119\n00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.310\nI can't rule that out.\n\n120\n00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.100\nBut in a business environment, chances\nare you probably don't wanna include\n\n121\n00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.050\nevery single bit of the MP4s\nthat are on this machine.\n\n122\n00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.180\nSo one of the things that I typically\ndo here is I'll do a control F for\n\n123\n00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.620\nfind, and I'll look for shared.\n\n124\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.740\nThat's all I'm doing.\n\n125\n00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.560\nNow keep in mind, I'm showing you how\nto modify the configuration file and\n\n126\n00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.970\nhow to exclude stuff.\n\n127\n00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.030\nWhat you exclude is up to you and\n\n128\n00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.370\nit's always contingent on\nwhat your environment needs.\n\n129\n00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.120\nBut you will know, you will have\nto know how to do this, right?\n\n130\n00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.590\nSo that's important for the exam.\n\n131\n00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.850\nSo I'm gonna do a find next here.\n\n132\n00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.890\nAnd you'll see that we have some\nshared information right here.\n\n133\n00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.929\nAll right, shared music.\n\n134\n00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.190\nI don't want these things to be included,\nright?\n\n135\n00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.750\nYour pictures,\nI don't care about your pictures.\n\n136\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.230\nHopefully you didn't take them to work and\nyou did back them up.\n\n137\n00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.020\nNow if you're in some kind of business\nthat's doing multimedia work,\n\n138\n00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.180\nyou might need those.\n\n139\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.950\nSo I'm gonna say, you know what,\nI don't want your pictures.\n\n140\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.520\nWe're not taking those.\n\n141\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.500\nIn fact, go ahead and scroll out here.\n\n142\n00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.760\nThere we go, get my mouse to work again,\nand I'll need that control F.\n\n143\n00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.039\nNow, what about some of\nthe other stuff that's here?\n\n144\n00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:52.939\nAlright, music, sorry guys that's\nwhy they call him administrator.\n\n145\n00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.013\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We don't want this stuff.\n\n146\n00:07:55.013 --> 00:07:58.617\nAlright, so no we don't want that.\n\n147\n00:07:58.617 --> 00:08:01.840\nAll right, and then video,\nI don't want video.\n\n148\n00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.350\nNotice what I'm doing, guys, all I'm doing\nis going through here and the stuff that I\n\n149\n00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.730\ndon't wanna migrate, I'm just changing\nin the quotes here from yes to no.\n\n150\n00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.610\nAnd we'll go through here, shared video,\nthese are the shared documents,\n\n151\n00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:13.790\nI don't want the shared documents.\n\n152\n00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.520\nThat's available to everybody and most\nlikely somebody's also got a copy of that\n\n153\n00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.640\nin their profile as well, so\nnow I'm migrating double the information.\n\n154\n00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.230\nHey, we don't want that,\nwe wanna streamline it.\n\n155\n00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:28.210\nSo I'll go down here and let's see,\nshared music, we'll change this as well,\n\n156\n00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.650\nwe'll say no.\n\n157\n00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.821\nShared desktop, all the shared information\nI, typically, guys, I change to no,\n\n158\n00:08:33.821 --> 00:08:35.485\nI don't need this information.\n\n159\n00:08:35.485 --> 00:08:38.017\nOops, but I do need that information,\n\n160\n00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:40.869\nthere we go and choose no and\nthen we save it.\n\n161\n00:08:40.869 --> 00:08:44.640\nAll right, now once it is saved,\nwe've now told,\n\n162\n00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.153\nessentially through\nthe configuration file,\n\n163\n00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:52.650\nwe've told the USMT when scan\nstate runs don't keep these.\n\n164\n00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.580\nKeep everything else that says yes but\ndon't keep what we just changed to no.\n\n165\n00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.990\nNow I will tell you when you run this\nfile, sometimes, if you're going through\n\n166\n00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.450\nupdates, if you're doing like a Windows\nDefender does, their definition updates,\n\n167\n00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.850\nyou might get an error in those\nupdates when you go to do a load stay.\n\n168\n00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:14.640\nAnd it'll say fail error\ncannot continue and\n\n169\n00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.260\nyou'll notice that the process\ndoes finish for the user.\n\n170\n00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.540\nSo just as a heads up there might\nbe some things that error out,\n\n171\n00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.920\nI'm gonna show you how you\ncan get around that error.\n\n172\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.430\nIt's kind of funny how you get around\nit too, I'll show you that coming up.\n\n173\n00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.240\nSo now that we've configured\nthe config file, boy,\n\n174\n00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.340\nthat's redundant, config the config.\n\n175\n00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.390\nNow that we've got that setup,\nnow we're ready to, well,\n\n176\n00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.820\nrun scan state and\nget this information migrated.\n\n177\n00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.020\nNow, there's a couple different\nway that you can do this.\n\n178\n00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.400\nYou can migrate this information\nup to a shared location,\n\n179\n00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.100\nso I could this by, in fact,\nlet me clear about this screen here,\n\n180\n00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.890\nand I could do, for instance,\nI could do scan state.\n\n181\n00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:01.280\nThen I could do a UNC path might be\nsomething like file server 01 and\n\n182\n00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.540\nI might have like a migration file,\nmigration folder in that.\n\n183\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.520\nAll right, I can do it that way, the other\nthing is, you can also do a local.\n\n184\n00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.250\nThis is something that doesn't really get\non you too much about if you wanna just\n\n185\n00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.580\nstore it locally and then you wanna\nsneaker net or you wanna move it yourself.\n\n186\n00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.460\nAnd that's what we're gonna do here,\n\n187\n00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.160\nwe're just gonna keep it\non the local hard drive.\n\n188\n00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.740\nSo I'm gonna do a scan state and then\nI'm gonna tell it where I want it to go.\n\n189\n00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.950\nI'm gonna say right there on C: USMT, and\n\n190\n00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:35.890\nlet me just double check, make sure\nthat I do have that there and I do not.\n\n191\n00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.420\nSo, go ahead and make sure that\nyou provision a folder there.\n\n192\n00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.610\nIt does create a folder, but\n\n193\n00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:45.280\nI like to just make sure that I populate\na folder before hand to point it to.\n\n194\n00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.670\nAgain, that is really contingent\non how you want to run this.\n\n195\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:52.920\nSo now what we're gonna do, scan state,\nwe're pointing it to that folder on C.\n\n196\n00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.970\nNow we've got to include\nthose migration files and\n\n197\n00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.710\nthat is something to keep in mind too.\n\n198\n00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.474\nThe second part when you actually start\nthe scan state, you're gonna include those\n\n199\n00:11:01.474 --> 00:11:05.132\nsame files that you did when you generated\nthe config files, so it's just a wash,\n\n200\n00:11:05.132 --> 00:11:06.849\nrinse, repeat on that, if you will.\n\n201\n00:11:06.849 --> 00:11:11.195\nSo this is going to be /, let me get\nmy cursor out of the way there so\n\n202\n00:11:11.195 --> 00:11:16.172\nyou guys can see that, i:, and\nthen the first one was the mig app, right,\n\n203\n00:11:16.172 --> 00:11:19.620\napplication settings,\nand again, XML-based.\n\n204\n00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:27.497\nThen we're gonna do a forward slash, we're\nalso gonna do another i:,MIGuser.xml.\n\n205\n00:11:27.497 --> 00:11:32.960\nAll right, and\nhere's where the important part is,\n\n206\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.020\nbecause we have a configuration file,\nif you don't use a configuration\n\n207\n00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.487\nfile it just says we're just gonna\ngo ahead and migrate everything but\n\n208\n00:11:40.487 --> 00:11:45.010\nnow we have to do a /config; and\n\n209\n00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.510\nthen, we say, config.xmf or xml.\n\n210\n00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.720\nSee, I told you I could spell xml,\non a good day, all right.\n\n211\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:12:00.610\nAnd then last but not least,\nV13 and we run this, all right.\n\n212\n00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.840\nNow, you'll see that depending on\nthe size of the migration, and\n\n213\n00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.290\nwe'll kinda zoom in here\nas this goes through it.\n\n214\n00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:11.650\nAt first it goes through a couple of\nphases right, it you'll see that examines,\n\n215\n00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:15.050\nhey what is it that I need to,\nwhat is it that I even need to do?\n\n216\n00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:18.790\nLet me go and look at those XML files,\nthose XML files tell me where to look.\n\n217\n00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.480\nAnd then I'll come back and when I come\nback, I'm gonna start gathering the data.\n\n218\n00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.100\nNow, depending again on\nhow much information,\n\n219\n00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:30.270\nyou just see it didn't take too long for\nuser01 and our admin there, this computer,\n\n220\n00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.640\nguys, it doesn't always run this fast.\n\n221\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.760\nYou can see that it's kind of\nskipping along pretty good.\n\n222\n00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.360\nIf this was a machine that\nmaybe our company, and\n\n223\n00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.930\nit's actually finished which\nis really good for us.\n\n224\n00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.040\nIf this was a company where maybe Dan,\nlike I said in some of the other episodes,\n\n225\n00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.050\nwhere Dan said hey Wes, I need you,\nwe've got this special computer\n\n226\n00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.430\nthat we're not gonna clean install it,\nwe're gonna do an upgrade.\n\n227\n00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.970\nWe've had it in our dev room for\nabout two years now,\n\n228\n00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.410\nit could have a lot of\ninformation on it and\n\n229\n00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.410\nit could be important information that you\nneed to back-up before you do the upgrade.\n\n230\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.845\nSo, you might be sitting here waiting for\na progress bar right?\n\n231\n00:13:03.845 --> 00:13:07.850\n30% of our IT career is either waiting on\na reboot or staring at a progress screen.\n\n232\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.711\n>> Welcome to the IT biz kids.\n\n233\n00:13:09.711 --> 00:13:12.291\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right, well said.\n\n234\n00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:17.247\nSo, it could take a little bit but now,\njust so you know that we aren't doing\n\n235\n00:13:17.247 --> 00:13:21.980\nany magic voodoo, what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna close that down.\n\n236\n00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.655\nAnd Dan, I'm gonna go a little bit\nfurther here and I am going to,\n\n237\n00:13:26.655 --> 00:13:31.420\nI'll tell you what we'll go ahead,\nwe'll do the upgrade for it.\n\n238\n00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.252\nI was gonna show you and I showed you\nin the clean installation that I can\n\n239\n00:13:34.252 --> 00:13:37.410\ncompletely delete this user now,\nuser01, I can delete it.\n\n240\n00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.190\nRight, I could recreate that user and\n\n241\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.310\nthen right now,\nI can run load state and guess what?\n\n242\n00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.380\nAll of those files and settings\nare back so it's kinda interesting and\n\n243\n00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.410\nyou might be thinking again,\nwell that's a great back-up tool.\n\n244\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:54.260\nNo, it's migration tool, it doesn't\nback-up things like system state data, so\n\n245\n00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.530\nyou just keep that in mind.\n\n246\n00:13:55.530 --> 00:14:00.190\nSo now that we've got all of our\ninformation on our migration file ready,\n\n247\n00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.280\nnow what we need to do is\nwe’re gonna go ahead and\n\n248\n00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.550\nwe’re gonna take that migration file.\n\n249\n00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.460\nLet me show you here too guys.\n\n250\n00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.400\nSo down on local disk C,\nyou’ll see USMT and like I\n\n251\n00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.910\ntold you it’s gonna generate a file so\nthis is gonna be a little bit redundant.\n\n252\n00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:17.350\nI go USMT, and then I go USMT, so-\n>> In case you\n\n253\n00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.140\ndidn't know where the USMT was.\n\n254\n00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.190\n>> Just in case.\n\n255\n00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.240\nNow this is kinda interesting,\nit's a migration file.\n\n256\n00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.555\nIf you're in Windows 10 it doesn't\ngive you this pretty little icon,\n\n257\n00:14:27.555 --> 00:14:31.395\nthat icon is actually\na Windows Easy Transfer file, right?\n\n258\n00:14:31.395 --> 00:14:34.385\nIn Windows 8 I can just click on this and\nit'll start the Windows Easy Transfer,\n\n259\n00:14:34.385 --> 00:14:36.505\nit's not the way that they want\nyou to use it in Windows 10.\n\n260\n00:14:36.505 --> 00:14:38.815\nIn fact, I don't even think\nit generates an icon anymore,\n\n261\n00:14:38.815 --> 00:14:41.580\nbecause Windows Easy Transfer,\nthey're pretty much using a lot of\n\n262\n00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.880\nother things like File History, some of\nthe newer technologies that Windows has.\n\n263\n00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.970\nSo, they're kinda taking a wet transfer of\njust, it's fallen by the way side here.\n\n264\n00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.450\nBut, what I wanna do is I wanna copy this,\n\n265\n00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.751\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncopy the whole USMT folder.\n\n266\n00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.575\nWe'll go ahead and copy that and\n\n267\n00:14:58.575 --> 00:15:04.150\nI\"m gonna just put it on my File Share\nhere and, we'll put it here in software.\n\n268\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.882\nAll right, and we'll paste it right there,\nso now I have that user data.\n\n269\n00:15:09.882 --> 00:15:14.468\nKeep in mind, do your back-ups, I cannot\nstress that enough because if something\n\n270\n00:15:14.468 --> 00:15:18.922\ngoes wrong with the migration and you have\nto reinstall your operating system and\n\n271\n00:15:18.922 --> 00:15:22.656\nstart fresh, to go with another\nmigration you lose all your data and\n\n272\n00:15:22.656 --> 00:15:25.380\nit could be a very,\nvery bad day at the office.\n\n273\n00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.010\nSo Dan that has half of\nthe migration done, all right,\n\n274\n00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.090\nwe still gotta do some\nload state coming up.\n\n275\n00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:35.280\nBut now we're essentially into\nthe upgrade, we're ready for an upgrade.\n\n276\n00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.631\nNow there's a couple of different\nways that you could do an upgrade.\n\n277\n00:15:38.631 --> 00:15:42.735\nYou can do an upgrade through the Windows\nStore, right, and this is just as simple\n\n278\n00:15:42.735 --> 00:15:46.782\nas Launching the Windows Store icon,\nlogging in with your Microsoft account and\n\n279\n00:15:46.782 --> 00:15:51.681\nit'll notice, it'll say you've got Windows\n8.1, upgrade to Windows 10 today for free.\n\n280\n00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:55.531\n>> It can't be that simple Wes [LAUGH]\n>> It is pretty much that simple believe\n\n281\n00:15:55.531 --> 00:15:59.160\nit or not, provided you have\nall your updates, all right?\n\n282\n00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.290\nAnd then what it'll do, is it'll\nstart loading that information for\n\n283\n00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.530\nyou from the Windows store And\nit will start the upgrade process.\n\n284\n00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.790\nWhat we're gonna show you here is\n\n285\n00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.750\nan upgrade process with\nthe installation media.\n\n286\n00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.520\nAnd they want you to know\nthe two different methods.\n\n287\n00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.070\nKeep in mind that the method we're\ngonna do from the Windows store\n\n288\n00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.260\nis really going to be close\nto the installation media.\n\n289\n00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.980\nJust a couple of little differences\nbecause right we're gonna\n\n290\n00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.540\nclick the optical drive icon and\nwe're gonna start it from there.\n\n291\n00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:33.350\nNow, remember that even though we have\na couple of options in your installation\n\n292\n00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:38.260\nmedia and they say do your upgrade,\nyou cannot run an upgrade from\n\n293\n00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.390\nthe installation media itself.\n\n294\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.810\nSo when we showed you the clean install,\nright.\n\n295\n00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:46.710\nIt gave you the two options.\n\n296\n00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:47.470\nCustom and upgrade.\n\n297\n00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.760\nWell, if you click upgrade, it says\nyou can't do the upgrade from in here.\n\n298\n00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.160\nYou have to run it from\nthe inside of Windows.\n\n299\n00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.080\nSo I'm still trying to figure\nout why they even put that\n\n300\n00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.320\nbutton in the wizard as well.\n\n301\n00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.360\nIt's like we've got a nice pretty button\nhere, when it doesn't really do anything.\n\n302\n00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.130\n>> Yeah, why not just put it in an\ninfographic that says if you would like to\n\n303\n00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:07.050\ndo the update or the upgrade,\nthen go run from Windows itself and\n\n304\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.760\nnot have a button option,\njust have the information.\n\n305\n00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.820\nThey do a lot of things that don't\nmake sense over at Microsoft.\n\n306\n00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.990\n>> That's right, so that is another one\nof those that they just left in there,\n\n307\n00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.090\nso what you didn't see is I went ahead and\n\n308\n00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:22.410\nI loaded the optical drive up\nwith the installation media, and\n\n309\n00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.930\nyou can see that we got our\nDVD drive here ready to go.\n\n310\n00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.620\nAnd if I open this up, you can see\nthis is normal installation media.\n\n311\n00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.700\nI can run this setup.exc, and I want you\nto know that from an exam standpoint.\n\n312\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.880\nIs that if you're doing the update they\nmight say, or if you're doing an upgrade,\n\n313\n00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.930\nexcuse me, not doing an update.\n\n314\n00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.590\nIf you're doing an upgrade,\non the exam they might say something like,\n\n315\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.480\nwell, what do you do?\n\n316\n00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.530\nDo you load in the installation media and\n\n317\n00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.700\nboot the installation media and\nthen click upgrade?\n\n318\n00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.200\nAnd that would be wrong.\n\n319\n00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.850\nYou would get that answer wrong on the\nexam and it would be counted against you.\n\n320\n00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:57.040\nThe right way to do this and the right\nanswer if you're in an exam environment\n\n321\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.250\nwould be to launch up your Windows 8\nmachine and then launch the upgrade\n\n322\n00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.460\nprocess inside of Windows 8 and\nyou'll see that come up here.\n\n323\n00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:09.240\nAnd then click the EXE they might say\ngive you a question about command prompt.\n\n324\n00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.686\nI make it easy guys.\n\n325\n00:18:11.686 --> 00:18:14.130\nDouble-click the icon.\n\n326\n00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.060\nIt's that simple.\n\n327\n00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.853\nAnd then just say yes to the UAC.\n\n328\n00:18:20.104 --> 00:18:21.070\nAnd then it prepares.\n\n329\n00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:24.365\nIt looks at your computer and it says,\nokay, we've looked at your computer.\n\n330\n00:18:24.365 --> 00:18:26.135\nDo you wanna get updates?\n\n331\n00:18:26.135 --> 00:18:29.415\nNow, you could defer the updates,\nI do not recommend it, all right.\n\n332\n00:18:29.415 --> 00:18:32.465\nBecause what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna reach out to Windows Update and\n\n333\n00:18:32.465 --> 00:18:37.655\nit's gonna pull down the updates\nthat it sees this computer needs now\n\n334\n00:18:37.655 --> 00:18:39.745\nto help the update process along.\n\n335\n00:18:39.745 --> 00:18:41.705\nSo, that's what we're gonna go ahead and\ndo.\n\n336\n00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:44.435\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsay get updates now, and\n\n337\n00:18:44.435 --> 00:18:49.610\nI can tell you, the get updates now could\ntake a little bit and then once it's done\n\n338\n00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:54.510\nWe're to come back, and we'll go ahead and\nwe'll continue on in the wizard.\n\n339\n00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.840\nNow after a little bit of\nthe whole spinning cheerio there,\n\n340\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.450\nyou'll see that it checks for its updates\nand then the next thing it's going to do\n\n341\n00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.050\nis it's going to ask for\nyour end user license agreement.\n\n342\n00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.740\nNow Dan this is kind of funny because it's\nactually going to check updates a couple\n\n343\n00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.580\nof times so even though it said check\nupdates don't get your hopes up to it,\n\n344\n00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.170\ndon't check in updates right I guess that\nwas just that checking updates to check\n\n345\n00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.170\nupdates before we check updates and\nI will show you what I mean.\n\n346\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.550\n>> Do you check updates?\n\n347\n00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:20.560\nI gonna schedule that.\n\n348\n00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.925\n>> Just in case you don't-\n>> No.\n\n349\n00:19:21.925 --> 00:19:23.185\nWe're gonna check some updates here.\n\n350\n00:19:23.185 --> 00:19:28.655\nSo we're gonna choose Accept, and when we\naccept the end user license agreement,\n\n351\n00:19:28.655 --> 00:19:32.945\nit's gonna check for updates again, and\nthen once it gets through the checking for\n\n352\n00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:37.035\nupdates here, we come back then,\nwe're gonna show you how\n\n353\n00:19:37.035 --> 00:19:40.219\nyou can choose what you wanna keep or\nwhat you don't wanna keep.\n\n354\n00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.360\nOnce you've gotten done checking\nthe updates and then checking updates and\n\n355\n00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.230\nthen checking updates,\n\n356\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.720\nthe next thing that you'll see is it gives\nyou the option of what you want to do.\n\n357\n00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:55.005\nThe first thing it says is that, hey,\nwe're gonna install Windows 10 Enterprise.\n\n358\n00:19:55.005 --> 00:19:59.395\nAnd keep Windows settings\npersonal files and applications.\n\n359\n00:19:59.395 --> 00:20:04.075\nAll right, now you also have a little\njump link here that you can change\n\n360\n00:20:04.075 --> 00:20:05.385\nthis by default.\n\n361\n00:20:05.385 --> 00:20:10.110\nSince you're doing an upgrade,\nMicrosoft and this installer process\n\n362\n00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:14.100\nassumes that you're gonna do an in place\nupgrade because of the fact that, well,\n\n363\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.660\nyou didn't do a clean install.\n\n364\n00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.240\nBut you don't have to.\n\n365\n00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.200\nAnd I'm going to,\nby choosing change what to keep,\n\n366\n00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.940\nyou'll see that I've got\nthree different options.\n\n367\n00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:27.040\nNow, I will tell you, doing the in place\nupgrade, I could choose this first one,\n\n368\n00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.110\nshow would be over with,\nthe migration portion of it, right?\n\n369\n00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.840\nI don't wanna do that to you,\ncuz the upgrade process is still the same\n\n370\n00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.550\nregardless of whether you keep your\nfiles or you don't keep your files.\n\n371\n00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.220\nBut keep in mind that we did a ScanState,\nall right?\n\n372\n00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.140\nAnd that is a great way that whether\nyou're doing a clean install, or you're\n\n373\n00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:47.920\ndoing an upgrade installation, to ensure\nthat the user data and settings do remain.\n\n374\n00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.070\nSo, what we're gonna say is keep nothing.\n\n375\n00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.680\nAll right we're gonna\nleave the registry here.\n\n376\n00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.490\nRemember, backups, backups,\nbackups and apparently updates too.\n\n377\n00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.858\n>> Take a back up,\nyou backup it and update it.\n\n378\n00:20:57.858 --> 00:20:58.370\nAnd.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n379\n00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.430\n>> That's right.\n\n380\n00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.490\nAnd then we'll choose next.\n\n381\n00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.580\nAnd you see for a brief second there,\nit was really fast,\n\n382\n00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:05.560\nit said checking updates again.\n\n383\n00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.960\nSo I guess they just wanted to\nmake sure it's like one of those-\n\n384\n00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:10.170\n>> It's a feint.\n\n385\n00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:10.728\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n386\n00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:11.253\n>> We're done.\n\n387\n00:21:11.253 --> 00:21:13.460\n[LAUGH] All right, now make sure and\n\n388\n00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.911\nnotice that it changed what\nit said it was gonna do.\n\n389\n00:21:17.911 --> 00:21:22.450\nAll right, this little check mark and it\nstill gives you this last little option,\n\n390\n00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.260\nare you sure?\n\n391\n00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.430\nAre you really really sure?\n\n392\n00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.150\nAnd we're gonna say yeah,\nI'm sure, i'm sure.\n\n393\n00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.080\n>> Smoke them if you've got them.\n\n394\n00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:29.730\n>> That's right.\n\n395\n00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.330\nAnd we're gonna choose install.\n\n396\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.890\nNow there are two different phases I\nwant you to keep in mind, all right?\n\n397\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.180\nIt says installing Windows here,\nand you're gonna think yes,\n\n398\n00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.938\nonce this gets to 100%, I'm done.\n\n399\n00:21:42.938 --> 00:21:43.960\nNo, no you're not.\n\n400\n00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:49.290\nWhat you're doing right now is you're\nactually installing Windows 10 installer,\n\n401\n00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.670\nand then it's gonna install Windows.\n\n402\n00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.410\nSo again,\na little bit more redundancy here.\n\n403\n00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.430\n>> This is my favorite\ntype of installation.\n\n404\n00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:59.020\nI've installed many various types of\nprograms and operating systems, and\n\n405\n00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.380\nI love when they tell you,\nhere we go, we're off to the races.\n\n406\n00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.660\nYou have now gotten to the part\nwhere you can install.\n\n407\n00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.071\n>> Right.\n>> And that's what we're doing here.\n\n408\n00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:07.606\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n409\n00:22:07.606 --> 00:22:11.290\nAnd depending on your Internet connection\nand how many updates you need,\n\n410\n00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.130\nit will really dictate\nhow long this screen is.\n\n411\n00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:18.190\nBut what we're gonna see here is that\nthe main Windows installation screen is\n\n412\n00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:23.070\ngonna come up, unlike the little\nWindows 10 WinPE screen here.\n\n413\n00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.500\nAnd it's gonna look\nconsiderably different.\n\n414\n00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.810\nAlright, so\nwe've seen the WinPE screen, and\n\n415\n00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.980\nremember I told you that wasn't\nactually the installation of Windows,\n\n416\n00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.750\nthat was just downloading the Windows\nFiles through a Windows PE interface.\n\n417\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.750\nLet's show you what the actual\ninstallation screen looks like.\n\n418\n00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.590\nSo, pretty simplistic screen here.\n\n419\n00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.330\nI kind of zoom in, if I can,\ndown here to the bottom and\n\n420\n00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.590\nshow you it copies the files.\n\n421\n00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.110\nThis is the same process\nas the installation itself.\n\n422\n00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.430\nWhen you seen the clean installation and\nit says installing windows and\n\n423\n00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.680\nit goes through its series of option.\n\n424\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.750\nNow, what's happening is, it's writing\nit to the hard drive if you will.\n\n425\n00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.170\nThen you can see it installs\nthe features on the drivers.\n\n426\n00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.870\nThen, at the end it\nconfigures the settings.\n\n427\n00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:02.910\nThis, 6% here.\n\n428\n00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.800\nThis is gonna take awhile guys.\n\n429\n00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:10.880\nAs you can see, we're really only\non 6% and this would probably\n\n430\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.050\ntake about an hour or so and I know Dan is\nover here saying, We don't have an hour.\n\n431\n00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.325\n>> We.\nThe episodes only 30 minutes.\n\n432\n00:23:17.325 --> 00:23:18.700\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n433\n00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.600\nSo what we're going to do here,\n\n434\n00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.430\nis we're going to take one of the magic,\nmagic of TV.\n\n435\n00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.350\nAnd we'll come back,\nonce this is installed.\n\n436\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.800\nSo the second,\nWindows installation screen, has finished.\n\n437\n00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:30.760\nAnd we are back.\n\n438\n00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.188\nThe first thing, that you're going to\nsee here, is, hi, we're back [LAUGH].\n\n439\n00:23:34.188 --> 00:23:35.800\n>> [LAUGH] So what.\n\n440\n00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.950\n>> Exactly, so\nwelcome back just in case you didn't know.\n\n441\n00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.981\nNow it does remember\nthe earlier user accounts.\n\n442\n00:23:42.981 --> 00:23:47.703\nKeep that in mind, so you're gonna have\nto put in your password here and a great\n\n443\n00:23:47.703 --> 00:23:52.786\nthing is I'm pretty sure it doesn't change\nthe password from the previous user that\n\n444\n00:23:52.786 --> 00:23:57.537\nlock them out of all of their stuff You\nguys have seen the customized settings.\n\n445\n00:23:57.537 --> 00:24:01.597\nWe did that on the clean install so\nwe're going to skip over that because\n\n446\n00:24:01.597 --> 00:24:05.939\nwe ultimately didn't change anything and\ndid an express setting anyways.\n\n447\n00:24:05.939 --> 00:24:09.345\nYou do have the option if you\nwant to choose default apps.\n\n448\n00:24:09.345 --> 00:24:11.035\nI think this is kinda interesting, though.\n\n449\n00:24:11.035 --> 00:24:13.015\nWatch redundancy on this one, then.\n\n450\n00:24:13.015 --> 00:24:16.865\nPhotos and Microsoft Edge right\nnow are set to the default apps.\n\n451\n00:24:16.865 --> 00:24:21.615\nSo let me choose my default apps and\nI get to choose the same thing.\n\n452\n00:24:21.615 --> 00:24:23.560\nSo I can either say no-\n>> Whole lot of options there, yeah.\n\n453\n00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.280\n>> Yeah, exactly, so\nit's kinda like having options only not.\n\n454\n00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.340\n>> Default apps or no?\n\n455\n00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.170\n>> That's right, and\nyou can change these later guys.\n\n456\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.310\nSo joking aside,\n\n457\n00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:36.170\nthey do give you the option that says hey,\nI'm not gonna use Microsoft edge, right.\n\n458\n00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.930\nI wanna use Chrome or\nI wanna use something else.\n\n459\n00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:42.280\nThat's okay, uncheck it if you want,\nthat's really up to you, but\n\n460\n00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.390\ndo wanna show you that.\n\n461\n00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.070\nAnd now it's gonna finalize the settings.\n\n462\n00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.180\nNow what's going on right here?\n\n463\n00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:51.050\nThis is the user profile being built for\nthe administrator.\n\n464\n00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:55.920\nSo keep that in mind, that all it kept was\nsettings, in our migration process, right?\n\n465\n00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.580\nWe kept settings and\nwe kept user documents,\n\n466\n00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.850\nnow we have a completely new User\nprofile that is being built.\n\n467\n00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:07.590\nAnd then once the user profile's built,\nwe should be able to log in, and\n\n468\n00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:11.190\nthen we can run our load state and\nthen we can get those files back.\n\n469\n00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.830\nAnd without further ado, we're upgraded.\n\n470\n00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:18.470\nWe've got our Windows 10 machine, so if\nwe take a second here, look at the system\n\n471\n00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:24.070\nproperties We will see that we\nnow have our Windows 10 machine.\n\n472\n00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.960\nIt is ready to go.\n\n473\n00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.230\nIt's got the same computer name.\n\n474\n00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.320\nHowever, one of the things I\nwant you to keep in mind, so,\n\n475\n00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.920\nthe upgrade is finished, right?\n\n476\n00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.320\nNow we've gotta talk about\nthe migration aspect of it, right?\n\n477\n00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:40.020\nWe do have to copy the USMT for\nthe load state and\n\n478\n00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.880\nthe migration files back\ndown to this machine.\n\n479\n00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.390\nSo, I've gone ahead and\n\n480\n00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:48.990\njust like in our Windows 8 machine,\nI had already copied those.\n\n481\n00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.080\nThey're down on C:, and\nyou can see them right there.\n\n482\n00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.840\nAnd now what we have to do is\nwe have to run load state.\n\n483\n00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.060\nBut one of the things I want you to keep\nin mind is that you might have to create\n\n484\n00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.950\nthe additional users on the machine\nafter clean installation or an upgrade.\n\n485\n00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.310\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you that process.\n\n486\n00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:09.520\nAnd the fact that, well,\nwe have admin, but\n\n487\n00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.960\nI'm kinda betting that user01\nisn't gonna be there anymore.\n\n488\n00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:18.960\nSo, if we look, we'll do local users and\ngroups, we go into users, and sure enough\n\n489\n00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.790\nAdmin that I'm currently logged in is\nthere, but guess what, User01 is not.\n\n490\n00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.340\nSo, let's go ahead and\nwe'll just take a second here, we'll do,\n\n491\n00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:30.910\ncreate a new user and\nwe'll call it User01, and\n\n492\n00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:39.270\nwe'll go ahead and uncheck user\nmust change their password and\n\n493\n00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.280\nwe will go ahead and\nConfigure that password.\n\n494\n00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.170\nNow, when we do this,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n495\n00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.220\nwe're gonna let it create the profile,\nright.\n\n496\n00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.320\nSo, I'm gonna do a switch\nuser here real quick and\n\n497\n00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.130\nit, we don't have this user\nactually logged in yet.\n\n498\n00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.660\nSo technically the profile\ndoesn't exist yet.\n\n499\n00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.770\nTheir account, their SID that security\nidentifiers in Windows, Windows sees it,\n\n500\n00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.890\nsees it down in the registry but\nwhat it doesn't see is the profile itself.\n\n501\n00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:10.100\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll log into user as user01 and\n\n502\n00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.280\nwe let that profile get built.\n\n503\n00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.510\nNow kind of as a recap,\n\n504\n00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:17.970\nwhile this is building that profile,\nremember what we did.\n\n505\n00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:22.440\nWe downloaded the Windows 80k,\nwe used the user state migration tool\n\n506\n00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.510\non the source computer, the source of\nthe files that you need to migrate, right?\n\n507\n00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:30.050\nYou can do this on a technician's computer\nbecause you can always copy like we did,\n\n508\n00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:34.690\nUSMT over to that source computer or\na number of computers if you need to.\n\n509\n00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.450\nWe generated the config file, right.\n\n510\n00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.410\nWe said this is what we don't wanna have.\n\n511\n00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.820\nWe don't want scan state to scrape, right.\n\n512\n00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.320\nWe don't want it to rake these settings or\nwe don't want it to rake our videos,\n\n513\n00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.660\nif you will, or music,\nthat's all up to you.\n\n514\n00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:52.650\nAnd then after the config file was\nnot only generated and configured,\n\n515\n00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:56.390\nwe saved it We ran scan state,\nwe pointed at the config file and\n\n516\n00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.660\nit stored that up in that migration file.\n\n517\n00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:03.940\nSo our user is logged in here, and\nnow we've got that profile built.\n\n518\n00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.890\nNow what we're gonna go ahead and\ndo is I'm gonna sign out one more time and\n\n519\n00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:10.020\nI'm gonna sign back in as our admin and\nthen we're gonna run load state.\n\n520\n00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.650\nAnd we're gonna end up finishing the\nmigration because well that's important\n\n521\n00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:19.130\nfor this process and it's certainly\nimportant for your success on the exam.\n\n522\n00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:22.370\nAnd that's one of the things we want\nyou to be successful on the exam.\n\n523\n00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:28.360\nSo now logging back in, all right, keep in\nmind that on this destination computer.\n\n524\n00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.450\nWe've already got the user\nstate migration ready to go.\n\n525\n00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:36.900\nThe other thing I would keep in mind guys,\nwhich is kinda interesting,\n\n526\n00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.600\nI know it might throw you off a little\nbit, but I want you to remember that\n\n527\n00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.490\nwe don't need the config\nfile when we do load state.\n\n528\n00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.860\nWhat, you don't need\nthe configuration file?\n\n529\n00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.890\nI want you to have it in your mindset\nwhat the configuration file does.\n\n530\n00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.760\nAnd excludes stuff to be gathered.\n\n531\n00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.750\nOur migration file all ready\nhas the stuff that's gathered.\n\n532\n00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.440\nWe don't need it anymore.\n\n533\n00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.450\nSo, that is something that is important.\n\n534\n00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:06.200\nSo, we'll go ahead.\n\n535\n00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:11.963\nRemember we've got a user state migration,\nwe'll go ahead and get in there and\n\n536\n00:29:11.963 --> 00:29:17.395\nstill has to be the same architecture\nthat we've been working, AMD 64.\n\n537\n00:29:17.395 --> 00:29:21.775\nAnd all of those files that we have there,\nthere's our load state, and\n\n538\n00:29:21.775 --> 00:29:24.235\nnow what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna run our load state command.\n\n539\n00:29:24.235 --> 00:29:27.265\nNow, the migration and\nI will take a second to kinda show you\n\n540\n00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:30.380\nwhat I was talking about in\nthe previous episode here.\n\n541\n00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:35.360\nRemember what I've told you that it's\na Windows Easy Transfer File and\n\n542\n00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.030\nwell in Windows 8.1 we still\nhave Windows Easy Transfer.\n\n543\n00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:44.050\nIcon here, no file association,\nno Windows Easy Transfer right,\n\n544\n00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:45.815\nso it doesn't and generate the icon.\n\n545\n00:29:45.815 --> 00:29:49.095\nSo just a little heads up and a little\nfollow up with what I said earlier.\n\n546\n00:29:49.095 --> 00:29:51.135\nSo now what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna create a load state.\n\n547\n00:29:52.985 --> 00:29:56.585\nAnd, again, we're gonna include\nthose same files that we did before.\n\n548\n00:29:56.585 --> 00:30:01.120\nSo it'll be mig app .xml.\n\n549\n00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:07.673\nOops, and apparently I need to\nknow how to spell migapp.xml.\n\n550\n00:30:08.878 --> 00:30:13.967\nAnd then it's miguser.xml.\n\n551\n00:30:16.448 --> 00:30:21.170\nAll right,\nthen we're gonna do a /v and 13.\n\n552\n00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.770\nNow I'm gonna put another switch in here,\nguys, and I just want you to know this,\n\n553\n00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:24.800\nit's gonna error out.\n\n554\n00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.500\nAll right.\n\n555\n00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.510\nI have some signature and definitions from\nWindows Defender that's gonna say it's\n\n556\n00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:30.850\ngoing to cause a fatal error.\n\n557\n00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:31.360\nAll right.\n\n558\n00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.570\nNow if I don't put this switch C\nin here It'll show you the error,\n\n559\n00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:40.280\nit'll say fatal error, canceled due\nto whatever the abort operation.\n\n560\n00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.140\nTo ignore this warning\nit'll say add to switch C.\n\n561\n00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.540\nHere's something that's funny.\n\n562\n00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:51.020\nEven if you add the switch C,\nlet's see what I did here,\n\n563\n00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.970\nload State, we double check here, [LAUGH].\n\n564\n00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:57.270\nIt doesn't know what to load.\n\n565\n00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:00.520\nIt would help if I pointed it\ntowards the migration file that I\n\n566\n00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.850\nwas just talking about.\n\n567\n00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:06.144\nThat tends to help a little bit, so\n[LAUGH] let's try that again, usmt,\n\n568\n00:31:06.144 --> 00:31:08.210\nand we'll go ahead and run it again.\n\n569\n00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.260\nSo, we did figure out the error and\nI wanna show it to you guys.\n\n570\n00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.680\nSo, that if you would\nconfront this problem,\n\n571\n00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.200\nyou would know exactly how to fix it.\n\n572\n00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.890\nLet me show you in the PC here,\nwhen I generated this error,\n\n573\n00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:23.270\nit tells me that it says,\ninvalid check the store parameter.\n\n574\n00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:26.290\nThat's exactly what it was,\nit wasn't a permissions issue.\n\n575\n00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:31.980\nIt was the fact that when I copy\nthe USMT folder to the SQL and\n\n576\n00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:36.300\nit was a folder that I named USMT.\n\n577\n00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.762\nUnderstand that it's looking to\nthe where you store those settings And\n\n578\n00:31:40.762 --> 00:31:45.369\nthen it's looking for a USM T4,\nI know it sounds a little bit redundant,\n\n579\n00:31:45.369 --> 00:31:50.304\nin fact we mention it in scan state where\nit's SQL and backslash USMT, right?\n\n580\n00:31:50.304 --> 00:31:50.858\nIt was double.\n\n581\n00:31:50.858 --> 00:31:52.159\nWell, it actually needs that.\n\n582\n00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:53.501\nSo now I put that back, and\n\n583\n00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:57.051\nyou can see that redundancy that\nwe were Mentioning before, right?\n\n584\n00:31:57.051 --> 00:32:00.212\nIf I look into this file here,\nthere's actually two USMT.\n\n585\n00:32:00.212 --> 00:32:03.777\nSo it is actually looking for\ninside of the folder that you\n\n586\n00:32:03.777 --> 00:32:08.470\ncreate another directory called USMT and\nthen the migration file in here.\n\n587\n00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:12.740\nSo you can see, I'm still running\nthe same command that I was before.\n\n588\n00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.420\nThat's what's changed though guys and\n\n589\n00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.510\nthat's what I want you to know\nas far as the error goes.\n\n590\n00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:19.810\nCuz you look at the error and you say\nwell, you didn't really changed anything.\n\n591\n00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:20.910\nWell, yes I did.\n\n592\n00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:25.030\nI had to actually put the second\nUSMT directory in there.\n\n593\n00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:29.080\nThe c option is to ignore the errors\n\n594\n00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.377\nthat are probably gonna happen and it says\nthat it starts the migration process.\n\n595\n00:32:33.377 --> 00:32:38.170\nAnd that's what's happening, so\nright now you can see again, depending\n\n596\n00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:42.900\non the amount of information that you\nhave to collect and goes up to the store.\n\n597\n00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:46.670\nIt's gonna be about the same amount of\ntime bringing that information back\n\n598\n00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.220\ndown to the destination computer.\n\n599\n00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:54.570\nI've seen where the user themselves\ntypically go fairly fast.\n\n600\n00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:59.310\nBut I will tell you that sometimes this\ncomputer section, where it's says 3 of 3,\n\n601\n00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.800\nthat could take a little bit.\n\n602\n00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.072\nAnd again, it's all contingent on\nhow much information that you have.\n\n603\n00:33:05.072 --> 00:33:09.500\nSo as you can see, it's kind of churning\nalong here and it's taking its time.\n\n604\n00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.670\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ngo ahead and use the magic of TV and\n\n605\n00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:18.020\nwe're gonna pick up once\nthe migration process finishes.\n\n606\n00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.160\nAll right, so the migration\nprocess hopefully has finished and\n\n607\n00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.280\nwe can see what it looks\nlike on the computer here.\n\n608\n00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.430\nAnd that's all just like the scan state,\n\n609\n00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:29.720\nwe wait until it says 100% and\nwe hope that the migration has happened.\n\n610\n00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.107\nNow, to truly test the cell,\nwe are gonna switch users and\n\n611\n00:33:33.107 --> 00:33:37.119\nwe're gonna find out if those super\nimportant documents that Dan and\n\n612\n00:33:37.119 --> 00:33:41.080\nI created when you bit at the scan\nstate actually are on the desktop.\n\n613\n00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.896\nNow let's go ahead and\nI'll sign out here as Admin,\n\n614\n00:33:43.896 --> 00:33:46.008\nwe're gonna sign back in as User01.\n\n615\n00:33:46.008 --> 00:33:48.694\nNow keep in mind,\nUser01 when we did the upgrade,\n\n616\n00:33:48.694 --> 00:33:52.010\ndidn't even have an account on\nthis machine after the upgrade.\n\n617\n00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:57.690\nSo we're hoping, we'll keep our fingers\ncrossed and we'll hope that this works.\n\n618\n00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.410\nI will tell you that I didn't get\nthe error that I was expecting which is\n\n619\n00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.205\nnice, that's great.\n\n620\n00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:05.740\nBut if you do get an error on that,\nmost likely,\n\n621\n00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:10.540\nyou'll see that like Windows Defender\nsignatures might be causing the problem.\n\n622\n00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.840\nAnd if you put the dash c in there,\njust go ahead and process that anyways,\n\n623\n00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.846\ndon't warn me and just go ahead and\nfinish the operation.\n\n624\n00:34:17.846 --> 00:34:22.260\nBut interestingly enough then, you can\nsee right here we've got some very,\n\n625\n00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:26.352\nvery important text back on the Desktop.\n\n626\n00:34:26.352 --> 00:34:31.090\nAnd what's kind of interesting is that\nwe've got our file extensions too.\n\n627\n00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.540\nYou can't see them by default,\nthey're turned off and\n\n628\n00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:37.450\nthere's our very important text\nthat we absolutely had to have.\n\n629\n00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:40.730\n>> It's funny, I did a show with Don\none time where, the same kind of idea.\n\n630\n00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.220\nWe had to have some sensitive\ndocumentation and I had download some\n\n631\n00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:48.100\ndeclassified files from the NSA about\nthe drone program here in America.\n\n632\n00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.370\nAnd Don was like is\nthat a classified file?\n\n633\n00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:51.311\nI'm like no, it's declassified [LAUGH].\n\n634\n00:34:51.311 --> 00:34:52.546\n>> That's great.\n\n635\n00:34:52.546 --> 00:34:56.950\n>> Because I wanted to look important,\nso I was typing that stuff up.\n\n636\n00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:58.170\nMy little anecdote for the show here.\n\n637\n00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:02.780\n>> Absolutely, that would be fun, I gotta\ndo that one time, I'll remember that.\n\n638\n00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.010\nNow let's go to the documents.\n\n639\n00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.770\nRemember desktop is part of the profile.\n\n640\n00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:10.550\nLet's see if we go into documents if our\nvery,very important document is well,\n\n641\n00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:14.510\nin documents and\nthere it is, our RTF file.\n\n642\n00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:17.320\nRemember that we also did some\nsettings configurations and\n\n643\n00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.280\nI haven't configured anything for\nthe user.\n\n644\n00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.890\nRemember we created the user,\nwe logged in and logged out.\n\n645\n00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:25.800\nBut if I go up to the tab/option here,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n646\n00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.870\nI'm gonna go over to Options in the Ribbon\nbar and then the View tab one more time.\n\n647\n00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:36.530\nNow, with the View tab here you can see,\nif I kinda zoom in just a little bit here.\n\n648\n00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:39.990\nThat we got the Hide Extensions for\nKnown File Types and it is unchecked.\n\n649\n00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.430\nSo that does show you that yes,\nnot only the documents, but\n\n650\n00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:44.940\nit did retain the user settings.\n\n651\n00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.410\nWhich are important especially for your\nend users when you're doing migrations and\n\n652\n00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:49.760\ndeploying a new operating system.\n\n653\n00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.890\nSo keep in mind that it's important\nwhen you run your scan state,\n\n654\n00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:56.310\nremember your config file,\nremember the config.xml file.\n\n655\n00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:58.830\nWhat that does is it\nexcludes locations and\n\n656\n00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:01.530\nyou can really tailor make\nwhatever your migration is.\n\n657\n00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.630\nWhat you wanna keep,\nwhat you don't wanna keep.\n\n658\n00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:06.170\nYou can get really, really granular on it.\n\n659\n00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:08.680\nBut on another note,\nwhen you run load state,\n\n660\n00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.900\nkeep in mind those three\nfiles that we used, right?\n\n661\n00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:16.180\nThat was the mig docs, the mig user and\nmig app all being XML files.\n\n662\n00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:20.670\nYou're gonna need the same files\nthat you used within scan state\n\n663\n00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.150\non the load state minus that config file.\n\n664\n00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.290\nNow Dan, I've got a lot more to go.\n\n665\n00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.400\nUnfortunately over here,\nDan's giving me the evil eye.\n\n666\n00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.620\nSo it does look like we're gonna have to\nsave that for another episode, right?\n\n667\n00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.410\n>> That leads us to a trilogy\nof installing Windows 10,\n\n668\n00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:36.970\nso we look forward to that.\n\n669\n00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:38.830\nWes, we thank you for dropping by today.\n\n670\n00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:42.060\nWe look forward to seeing you\nin the

one,\n\n673\n00:36:46.077 --> 00:36:47.239\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n674\n00:36:47.239 --> 00:36:49.386\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n675\n00:36:49.386 -->

another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.601\nI am your host, Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:22.623\nAnd in today's episode, we continue with\nour trilogy in our Windows 10 series,\n\n6\n00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:26.702\nour series inside of a series, which is\ninstalling and getting Windows installed,\n\n7\n00:00:26.702 --> 00:00:29.170\nupgrades, and\nall of that other good stuff.\n\n8\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.870\nJoining us back in the studio to round\nthat series out, our good friend Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.210\nWes Bryan, Wes, welcome back sir.\n\n10\n00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.956\n>> And I'll tell you what,\nit's great to be here and yeah,\n\n11\n00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:40.700\nwe're working on a novel on this one for\nsure.\n\n12\n00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.701\nWe did have a few extra things that\nthey call out on the exam that\n\n13\n00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:45.974\nwe really couldn't fit\nin that last episode.\n\n14\n00:00:45.974 --> 00:00:47.179\nSo we wanna go ahead and\n\n15\n00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:51.400\ntake the time to show you some\nadditional things that you need to know.\n\n16\n00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.930\nWhich includes things like\nadditional Windows features.\n\n17\n00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.390\nLet's go ahead and dive right in here and\n\n18\n00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.230\nwe'll show you what we\nneed to get taken care of.\n\n19\n00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.029\nNow this is the upgrade machine,\nby the way,\n\n20\n00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:04.059\nthis would work on a clean\ninstall likewise too.\n\n21\n00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.558\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\nright-click on the little Windows start\n\n22\n00:01:07.558 --> 00:01:10.180\nicon here and\nI'm gonna choose Programs and Features.\n\n23\n00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.800\nWe're gonna show you a couple\ndifferent ways that you can do this.\n\n24\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.500\nOne, through the graphical user interface.\n\n25\n00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.270\nAnd then one, most likely,\nthat will be on the test.\n\n26\n00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.510\nIf you wanna turn features on or\noff, it's very simple.\n\n27\n00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.590\nAll you have to do is go to Programs and\nFeatures, and\n\n28\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.370\nthen you'll see this\nlittle hyperlink here.\n\n29\n00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.650\nAnd then you could choose that.\n\n30\n00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.820\nAnd what it does is it kind\nof queries the machine there.\n\n31\n00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.740\nAnd it says, okay,\nwhat's already installed?\n\n32\n00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.300\nWhat isn't installed?\n\n33\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.210\nAnd present you with this dialogue box.\n\n34\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.470\nNow I'll go ahead and do one here.\n\n35\n00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.720\nA lot of times, and especially in some\nof the labs that we do here at ITProTV,\n\n36\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.920\nI commonly named the .NET Framework\nin some of the older ones.\n\n37\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.080\nAnd you can see that well, it's here,\nbut it isn't installed by default.\n\n38\n00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.506\nAnd that's something that\nthey want you to know.\n\n39\n00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:55.440\nFor instance, Hyper-V is in here,\nif you have to implement a Hyper-V\n\n40\n00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.880\non your machine, you could turn that\nfeature and functionality on as well.\n\n41\n00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.510\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're just\ngonna put a check mark in there, or\n\n42\n00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.660\nI guess a little square,\nit's not really a check mark.\n\n43\n00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.742\nWe'll choose OK.\n\n44\n00:02:05.742 --> 00:02:09.146\nAnd then what it's gonna do is it's gonna\nlook and it's gonna see, did we have\n\n45\n00:02:09.146 --> 00:02:12.462\nany of that information locally or\ndo we need to reach out to Windows Update?\n\n46\n00:02:12.462 --> 00:02:17.171\nSo you do need to keep in mind that you\nhave to have an Internet connection\n\n47\n00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:17.880\nfor this.\n\n48\n00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.480\nSo we'll go ahead and choose download\nthe required files, and what it does is it\n\n49\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.500\nreaches out to Windows Update, it says\nokay, these are the files that I need, and\n\n50\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.760\nit pulls it down to the machine and\nit enables that feature for us.\n\n51\n00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.650\nSo you can see that right now it lets us\nknow that it's downloading the required\n\n52\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.750\nfiles.\n\n53\n00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.996\nWhile that's running, there's another\nway that we can do this is likewise,\n\n54\n00:02:38.996 --> 00:02:42.820\nwe can always drop down to\na command prompt if we need to.\n\n55\n00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.540\nDo make sure that it is an administrative\ncommand prompt when you run this.\n\n56\n00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.494\nYou need to have administrative privileges\nand this is where that the deploying image\n\n57\n00:02:51.494 --> 00:02:56.310\nand servicing manager, DISM command that\nwe showed you when we were slipstreaming\n\n58\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.870\nand updates, or was it drivers,\nexcuse me, to an image.\n\n59\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.330\nWell, it's the same command.\n\n60\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.220\nIt can do a lot of different things for\nyou.\n\n61\n00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.549\nSo for instance, we could type, if we\nwanted to do this from command prompt.\n\n62\n00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.030\nWe could do dism/online, all right?\n\n63\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.940\nVersus, like, for instance, slipstreaming\nthese into like an image file.\n\n64\n00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.350\nThat would be a little bit different,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.020\nThat would be an offline servicing.\n\n66\n00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.910\nThis is actually a little bit\ndifferent than the one we did.\n\n67\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.560\nThis is an online servicing.\n\n68\n00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.543\nAnd then it's just enable-feature and\nthen you just gotta tell\n\n69\n00:03:27.543 --> 00:03:32.243\nit what the feature name is, so\nwe do a /, and we do feature,\n\n70\n00:03:32.243 --> 00:03:37.149\nit's not case sensitive on this,\nso don't worry about that.\n\n71\n00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:39.340\nIt just kind of makes it a little\neasier to see what's going on.\n\n72\n00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.608\nAnd then maybe for\ninstance maybe I want the telnet client.\n\n73\n00:03:42.608 --> 00:03:45.000\nMaybe I wanna test communications\non certain ports, so\n\n74\n00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.410\nI need that turned on, and\nthere is a telnet client.\n\n75\n00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.270\nBut it is an additional feature in Windows\nand it's not installed by default.\n\n76\n00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.500\nAnd then when we run that,\nit's gonna do the same thing.\n\n77\n00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.480\nYou say enabling the feature and\nlook how fast that was.\n\n78\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.320\nI don't know if the other\none is finished yet.\n\n79\n00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.614\nOkay, so it has finished.\n\n80\n00:04:01.614 --> 00:04:05.214\nYeah, it was fairly fast, but\nI will tell you that enabling the telnet\n\n81\n00:04:05.214 --> 00:04:09.380\nclient's a lot faster there, so you can\nsee that now we have a telnet client,.\n\n82\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.114\nAnd I tell you what, we will go ahead and\ntest that, we will see if it's working.\n\n83\n00:04:12.114 --> 00:04:17.652\nWe'll do a telnet,\ntrying to think of a server\n\n84\n00:04:17.652 --> 00:04:22.338\nout there that we might be able to test,\n\n85\n00:04:22.338 --> 00:04:25.611\nsmtp, maybe gmail.com.\n\n86\n00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:28.150\nMaybe we want to see if\nthey're got port 25 open.\n\n87\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.730\nAnd you can see now telnet client is\nworking, we're connected over port 25.\n\n88\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.960\nJust for purposes of showing that the\nfeature is on, it's turned on, it's there,\n\n89\n00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.370\nit's ready for us.\n\n90\n00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.610\nAll right, now once it completes\nthe changes we can close that down.\n\n91\n00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.270\nAnd if we open it back up just to confirm\nthat it is there you'll see that it's got\n\n92\n00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.370\nthe check marks that .NET Framework\nis there now and it is ready to go.\n\n93\n00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.150\nSo not too difficult.\n\n94\n00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.998\nI do wanna recap one thing though,\ndo keep in mind that DISM command for\n\n95\n00:04:57.998 --> 00:04:59.488\nenabling features.\n\n96\n00:04:59.488 --> 00:05:03.788\nBecause they might want you to prove on an\nexam that you can do this from the command\n\n97\n00:05:03.788 --> 00:05:05.420\nline interface.\n\n98\n00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.910\nNow, we did talk about the installation\nmedia only having a single\n\n99\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.960\nlanguage ready for us, and it was based on\nthe ISO file that we're using to install.\n\n100\n00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.100\nIn this case, here in the States,\nwe're using English.\n\n101\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.890\nIf you're watching from other\ndifferent regions, if you will,\n\n102\n00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.240\ngeographical regions, you're gonna use\nthe language that's native to your tongue.\n\n103\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.240\nBut the good thing is, if you happen\nto have, let's say for instance,\n\n104\n00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.460\nan English installation and\nyou need to install additional languages,\n\n105\n00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.900\nmaybe you need to change\nwhat region you're part of.\n\n106\n00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.240\nWell, you can also do that as well.\n\n107\n00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.800\nAnd what we're gonna do here is we're\ngonna come down to the Control Panel,\n\n108\n00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.800\nwell actually right-click on the start\nicon, and then go to Control Panel.\n\n109\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.610\nAnd you see on this option here that\nsays Clock, Language, and Region.\n\n110\n00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.760\nAnd this is another thing that\nthey do call out on the exam,\n\n111\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.170\nknowing how to do this.\n\n112\n00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.300\nSo, we'll go in here and\nexplain these here.\n\n113\n00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.470\nDate and Time, pretty straight forward.\n\n114\n00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.790\nIn fact,\nI know my head's covering it up right now.\n\n115\n00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.570\nNow that we've got my big head out of\nthe way here, if we click on the date and\n\n116\n00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.550\ntime down here, we'll choose Date and\n\n117\n00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.670\nTime Settings, and\nyou'll see the dialogue box come up.\n\n118\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.464\nRight, and this is the newer\ninterface in Windows 10 for changing,\n\n119\n00:06:11.464 --> 00:06:16.273\nif you will, your date and time,\nchanging the date and time formats.\n\n120\n00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:18.604\nWe can change all of that\nfrom here as well and\n\n121\n00:06:18.604 --> 00:06:20.560\nI would be used to the new interface.\n\n122\n00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.590\nAnd you can also do this through the\ntraditional Control Panel option where we\n\n123\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.600\nchose Date and Time.\n\n124\n00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.070\nSome of you have probably been\nin Windows for a while and\n\n125\n00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.970\nprobably recognize this screen more.\n\n126\n00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.191\nSo two different interfaces,\none coming from more of the new\n\n127\n00:06:33.191 --> 00:06:37.188\nAction Center All Settings type menu\nversus what you've seen in the past.\n\n128\n00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:41.048\nThen if we needed to change the timezone\nfrom Havana, we can, we can\n\n129\n00:06:41.048 --> 00:06:45.340\nalways change it to the Eastern time zone\nhere if I could find it in the list.\n\n130\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.440\nNot Easter Island,\nwe're certainly not going there.\n\n131\n00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.380\nEastern time, there it is and\nI can choose OK.\n\n132\n00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.770\nIf I wanted, I can change date and\ntime or the time itself if I want to.\n\n133\n00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.380\nSo all fairly straightforward process\non that, but the language as well.\n\n134\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.010\nNotice that we have this Language and\nInput Settings and\n\n135\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.130\nif I want, I have the ability\nto add a different language.\n\n136\n00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.815\nSo if I choose Add Language, for instance,\n\n137\n00:07:12.815 --> 00:07:17.715\nyou're supporting a company that\nhas Spanish speaking people.\n\n138\n00:07:17.715 --> 00:07:18.464\nWell, you know what?\n\n139\n00:07:18.464 --> 00:07:21.911\nYou're gonna have to search that,\nyou might have to implement that.\n\n140\n00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:25.296\nAnd the good thing is,\nwe can do that as well.\n\n141\n00:07:25.296 --> 00:07:28.543\nSo you could see Spanish comes up and\nif I want, I can open this and\n\n142\n00:07:28.543 --> 00:07:31.086\nthe different dialects of Spanish,\nif you will.\n\n143\n00:07:31.086 --> 00:07:34.610\nWe'll say maybe Spanish United States,\nand we'll choose add.\n\n144\n00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.230\nAnd notice down here in\nthe lower right hand corner now,\n\n145\n00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.130\nwe have this English button\nthat wasn't there before.\n\n146\n00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.460\nAll right and that's good because it\ngives us the ability to switch back and\n\n147\n00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.970\nforth really quick without having to go\nall the way back into the Control Panel.\n\n148\n00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.280\nBut, well,\nthat really isn't all that we can do.\n\n149\n00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.280\nWe can go over here to Options if we want,\nall right, and\n\n150\n00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.840\nthat also give us the ability to\nchoose the input method, right?\n\n151\n00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.070\nIt changes the language, but\n\n152\n00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:04.150\nwe also have the ability, if we want we\ncan choice the input language here, and\n\n153\n00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.100\nyou can see we could preview it if\nwe want and what it looks like.\n\n154\n00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.262\nSo we have the ability to do that too.\n\n155\n00:08:09.262 --> 00:08:13.190\nAll right, so very straightforward\nprocess, not too difficult,\n\n156\n00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.150\njust know where it is and know what\nyou can do there in the settings.\n\n157\n00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:20.084\nIf we back out of this just a little bit,\nwe can also change region.\n\n158\n00:08:20.084 --> 00:08:26.020\nAll right, and notice that I just pulled\nthis up, cuz remember we showed the first\n\n159\n00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.530\nlocation in the new interface and it had\nall of the different formats right there?\n\n160\n00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.545\nWell, it's a little bit different\nin the traditional Control Panel.\n\n161\n00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:34.105\nYou can see your formats here.\n\n162\n00:08:34.105 --> 00:08:36.495\nWe can change location and\nthen some of the administrative and\n\n163\n00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:38.415\nI wouldn't worry too much about these.\n\n164\n00:08:38.415 --> 00:08:40.905\nBut format and location,\nyou have that there as well.\n\n165\n00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:44.915\nSo just some of the additional\npost installation options that\n\n166\n00:08:44.915 --> 00:08:49.375\nyou should be aware of for the exam and\nfairly straightforward process.\n\n167\n00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:51.205\nBut again something that\nyou might need to know and\n\n168\n00:08:51.205 --> 00:08:54.235\nsomething that you might need to\nimplement in your work environment.\n\n169\n00:08:54.235 --> 00:08:55.590\nAnd hopefully you'll be ready to do that.\n\n170\n00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.627\n>> All right, Wes, we got all our little\nodds and ends squared away, now we know,\n\n171\n00:08:59.627 --> 00:09:03.302\nfrom start to finish, from soup to nuts,\nhow to get Windows installed or\n\n172\n00:09:03.302 --> 00:09:06.015\nupgraded or migrated,\nwhatever the case may be, and\n\n173\n00:09:06.015 --> 00:09:09.190\neven afterwards doing a little\npost-installation as well.\n\n174\n00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.560\nThank you for that, Mr. Wes Brian.\n\n175\n00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.710\nThat being said, it looks like we have\ncompleted our little trilogy here.\n\n176\n00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.850\nWe hope you've enjoyed it.\n\n177\n00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.560\nWe hope you've had a good\nlearning experience as well.\n\n178\n00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.650\nThat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nclose down the show.\n\n179\n00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.800\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n180\n00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.705\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n181\n00:09:23.705 --> 00:09:26.315\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n182\n00:09:26.315 -->

ITPRO.TV,\n\n3\n00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:17.771\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:21.807\nAnd today's episode, well, it's more\nWindows 10 and joining me in the studio\n\n5\n00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:25.200\nagain today to help us out with that\nendeavor is our good friend, Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.060\nWes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.350\nWes welcome back sir, so\nglad to have you today how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.260\n>> Man it's going great and as always\nit's a pleasure to be here with ITPROTV.\n\n9\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.330\nThat's right we are coming back with\nlike Dan said more of Windows 10 and\n\n10\n00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.155\nmore specifically we're gonna be\nfocusing ion on Virtual Hard Disks\n\n11\n00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:40.545\nas well as native boot.\n\n12\n00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:44.745\nAnd in the context is VHD's,\nwe talked about these virtual hard drives.\n\n13\n00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:50.245\nIt's basically a file that it composes\nall normal file disk operations.\n\n14\n00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:54.770\nNow, one of the things that we're gonna\nshow you here, or talk about, are some of\n\n15\n00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.590\nthe scenarios that you might use something\nknown as native boot and these VHDs.\n\n16\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.120\nAnd then ultimately, what we want to\nshow you is from beginning to end,\n\n17\n00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.390\nhow to set this up and\nthen how to deploy it as well.\n\n18\n00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.680\nSo really fun stuff coming up here,\nwe'll go ahead and dive right in.\n\n19\n00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.360\nWhen we look at native boot scenarios,\na couple of things that we can use,\n\n20\n00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.050\nNative Boots, imagine a VHD, a Virtual\nHard Disk, that you have, let's say,\n\n21\n00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.350\nif you've got a Hyper-V platform.\n\n22\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.800\nAnd, maybe, your company's implemented\nHyper-V, right, well, you'll, probably,\n\n23\n00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.930\nhave a lot of VHD files in Hyper-V,\nor, at least, a few of them, and\n\n24\n00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.320\nwhat if you need to manage them?\n\n25\n00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.890\nWell, this is a nice way that you can\nactually pull these VHDs down and\n\n26\n00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.810\nyou can use the client side Hyper-V\nthat's built in to the operating systems,\n\n27\n00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.810\na feature in Windows 10.\n\n28\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.450\nBut you can also boot them\n\n29\n00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.950\nalmost like in a dual boot system\nwhere you can also service them.\n\n30\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.930\nSo that's one of the things, you can also\ndo things like offline management as well,\n\n31\n00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.730\nwhich is really good to.\n\n32\n00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.770\nModifying reference VHDs is also a thing,\nif you're doing image servicing.\n\n33\n00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.020\nThe other thing that you can do\nis managing image deployment.\n\n34\n00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.290\nMaybe somebody is bringing\nin their computer and\n\n35\n00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.960\nyou wanna control every aspect\nof the operating system and\n\n36\n00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.920\nmaybe they already have\na parent operating system.\n\n37\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.720\nWell, that's another thing that's good\nabout data boot is that you can this multi\n\n38\n00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.660\nboot situation where you have\nWindows 10 already installed.\n\n39\n00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.690\nAnd then you deploy the virtual drive, or\n\n40\n00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.750\nthe virtual hard disk, in Windows 10 and\nit turns it into multi boot.\n\n41\n00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.410\nSo we're gonna show you how to ultimately,\n\n42\n00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.260\nhow to take a machine that has\nno parent operating system.\n\n43\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.160\nIt's been completely formatted and\nit won't boot, and then we're gonna deploy\n\n44\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.290\na VHD to it, reboot it and hopefully by\nthe end of the show it will start up.\n\n45\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.690\n>> Yeah Wes, it's actually really cool\nthat we're able to use VHDs right?\n\n46\n00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.850\nThe virtual hard drives is typically\nwhat we think of obviously for\n\n47\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.801\nvirtualization using V,\nnot VMWare, I'm sorry Microsoft.\n\n48\n00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:47.887\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But your Hyper-V technology,\n\n49\n00:02:47.887 --> 00:02:50.170\nand that's where we\nnormally think about VHDs.\n\n50\n00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.820\nBut we're gonna be able to take that VHD,\n\n51\n00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.820\nslap it on an actual metal machine and\nhave it boot to\n\n52\n00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.300\nit without any kind of virtualization\nsoftware or anything and just make it go.\n\n53\n00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.890\n>> Yeah, and that's a good point to make\nis one of the reasons that the performance\n\n54\n00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.780\nis better because as Dan's talking about,\nthe hypervisor,\n\n55\n00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.460\nthe virtualization technology, well.\n\n56\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.940\nWhy would that be better not having it?\n\n57\n00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.910\nWell, that's an extra layer of software,\nright?\n\n58\n00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.500\nWhen you think about abstractly, you\nthink about your virtualization, right?\n\n59\n00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.810\nYou have a guest operating system, and\nyou got that middle man, if you will,\n\n60\n00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.960\ncommunicating between\nthe operating system.\n\n61\n00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.360\nThe pair in operating system and then\nfinally done with the hardware, right?\n\n62\n00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.390\nWell, imagine if we take all of\nthat in the middle, completely out.\n\n63\n00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.660\nAnd we put a virtual drive\non that hard drive and\n\n64\n00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.510\nit gets to talk directly\nto the hardware itself.\n\n65\n00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.440\nSo there are performance reasons that\nthis is actually a little bit better.\n\n66\n00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.944\nAgain, keep in mind it's not\na replacement for Hyper-V.\n\n67\n00:03:39.944 --> 00:03:43.439\nIt's certainly not something that you\nwould wanna do continually maybe in\n\n68\n00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:44.780\na production environment.\n\n69\n00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.910\nBut definitely lends itself\nto things like test labs and\n\n70\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.370\nagain things like managing your desktop\nimages or even reference VHDs, right?\n\n71\n00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.020\nMaybe I have a reference VHD that\nwe are using native boot and\n\n72\n00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.310\nwe're gonna push this VHD\nout to multiple computers.\n\n73\n00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.860\nWhat happens when it comes time\nto do an update to Windows 10?\n\n74\n00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.870\nWhat do you do with that VHD?\n\n75\n00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.540\nDo you pull it to ten computers and let\neach computer take their time to update?\n\n76\n00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.320\nNo, I can deploy it to a machine right?\n\n77\n00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.089\nI can update the machine and\nthen I can take that virtual drive and\n\n78\n00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:16.871\nthen put it back on an intermediate\nstore and now it's updated.\n\n79\n00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:17.397\nSo again,\n\n80\n00:04:17.397 --> 00:04:21.245\ndoes line itself is another way that\nyou can do things like image servicing.\n\n81\n00:04:21.245 --> 00:04:23.925\nSo I tell you what Dan,\nrather than talk about it\n\n82\n00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:26.125\nwhat do you say that we go in here and\nsee what we're doing here?\n\n83\n00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:27.215\n>> Less yak, more do.\n\n84\n00:04:27.215 --> 00:04:28.305\n>> That's exactly what.\n\n85\n00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:29.225\nLet's go ahead and do this.\n\n86\n00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:33.895\nSo the first thing that we're going to do\nis we're going to create the VHD file.\n\n87\n00:04:33.895 --> 00:04:36.932\nNow, coming up, you'll see that\nwe gonna move the VHD file.\n\n88\n00:04:36.932 --> 00:04:39.760\nFor instance to a USB thumb drive.\n\n89\n00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.380\nBut for now we're in our technician's\ncomputer, keep that in mind.\n\n90\n00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.300\nAs one of the precursors, I should\nmention, that if you gonna do this,\n\n91\n00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.240\nyou do need to have\nthe Windows ADK installed.\n\n92\n00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.490\nThat's the Windows Assessment and\nDeployment Kit, as part of this process.\n\n93\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.020\nSo, please do keep that in mind.\n\n94\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.370\nNow, what you don't need to create\nthe virtual hard drive is ADK.\n\n95\n00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.250\nThat's all built right in the disk part.\n\n96\n00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.470\nYou know the command line utility that\nwe've been using in Windows for a while.\n\n97\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.410\nIf we're not doing this through the\ngraphical user interface disk management.\n\n98\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.940\nSo tell you what we'll go ahead and\nwe'll start this process out.\n\n99\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.230\nI got my computer here and I'm gonna go\nahead and let's do our DIR command here,\n\n100\n00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.090\nour dir option, or command N.\n\n101\n00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.190\nNotice that I'm gonna go ahead\nan make a folder here for this VHD,\n\n102\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.133\nso we'll just do our MD option here and\nI'll just call it VHDs.\n\n103\n00:05:31.133 --> 00:05:35.910\nAnd then we'll go ahead and run our dir.\n\n104\n00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.730\nOption here making sure that\nour VHD directory is there.\n\n105\n00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.770\nNow, that is not really a requirement but,\n\n106\n00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.520\nthat's just me I like to keep\nit a little bit more structured.\n\n107\n00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.107\nSo, that some of these commands\njust kinda flow in line.\n\n108\n00:05:48.107 --> 00:05:51.790\nHow you do,\nwhere you put this is up to you.\n\n109\n00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:58.610\nSo, understand that if you were in an exam\ntype situation, the paths might change.\n\n110\n00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.950\nBut that's the only variable.\n\n111\n00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.680\nEverything else should stay the same.\n\n112\n00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.610\nSo be able to recognize these on the exam.\n\n113\n00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.060\nSo the first thing that we're gonna do\nis we're gonna drop down to diskpart.\n\n114\n00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.750\nNow diskpart,\n\n115\n00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.200\nyou'll notice that I'm in administrative,\nlet's see if we can zoom in.\n\n116\n00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.720\nI'm on an administrative\nWindows PowerShell.\n\n117\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.180\nIf you are in a standard user PowerShell,\nyou'll see that the UAC will trigger,\n\n118\n00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.380\nbecause it does require\nadministrator privileges.\n\n119\n00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.384\nSo this is not something\nthat a standard user can do.\n\n120\n00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:29.070\nAll right, so we're in this part here.\n\n121\n00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.140\nAnd one of the first things that were\ngonna do here is we are gonna run\n\n122\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.965\ncreate vdisk.\n\n123\n00:06:36.965 --> 00:06:39.420\nRight, that's our virtual disk.\n\n124\n00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.080\nAnd then we gonna tell it\nwhere we wanna create it.\n\n125\n00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.850\nSo where gonna go ahead and do file.\n\n126\n00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:49.720\nAnd then I'm gonna do c:\\vhds,\nthat directory I just created.\n\n127\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.595\nNext thing we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna name the VHD.\n\n128\n00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:58.532\nAll right, and\nwe're gonna name this test01.vhdx.\n\n129\n00:06:58.532 --> 00:07:02.081\nNow, you could do the older VHD format.\n\n130\n00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:07.115\nIt does have some limitations that\nthe newer vhdx format doesn't have.\n\n131\n00:07:07.115 --> 00:07:08.975\nSo I'm gonna go with the newer format.\n\n132\n00:07:08.975 --> 00:07:14.155\nBut just be aware of that,\nyou can also do the vhd format here too.\n\n133\n00:07:14.155 --> 00:07:16.635\nNow that we've got the path,\n\n134\n00:07:16.635 --> 00:07:20.845\nwe have to say what type of drive are we\ngonna create and how big should it be?\n\n135\n00:07:20.845 --> 00:07:23.545\nSo for our demonstration purposes,\n\n136\n00:07:23.545 --> 00:07:29.043\nwe're gonna do around a 40 gig drive here,\nso 40,960 megabytes.\n\n137\n00:07:29.043 --> 00:07:31.150\nIt is in megabytes, by the way,\n\n138\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.900\nand then we have to tell it what kind\nof virtual drive is it gonna be.\n\n139\n00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.740\nNow in a production environment\nfix drives are a lot better but\n\n140\n00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.500\nkeep in mind that when you\ndo a fix drive it allocates\n\n141\n00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.700\nall of the amount of that\nvirtual drive right away.\n\n142\n00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.160\nI'm gonna use, for the lab purposes and\nalso just demonstrating here.\n\n143\n00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.413\nI'm gonna use what's known as a dynamic\ndisk or not dynamic disk, dynamic VHD.\n\n144\n00:07:54.413 --> 00:07:58.462\nGotta be careful with that because VHDs\ncan't be what's called a dynamic disk.\n\n145\n00:07:58.462 --> 00:08:02.440\nIt's a dynamic VHD file, and\nthat means that it's going to expand and\n\n146\n00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.470\ngrow over time.\n\n147\n00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.330\nAnd even though I'm making\nit a 40 gigabyte disk,\n\n148\n00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.700\nif I install 7 gigs, that's all it's gonna\ntake up on the hard drive at that time.\n\n149\n00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.300\nAnd it'll expand up to a maximum,\nif you will, that you see here,\n\n150\n00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.860\nhence the term maximum.\n\n151\n00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.199\nAnd in fact, you know what-\n>> So 40 gigs is its ceiling ability to,\n\n152\n00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:21.826\nI can grow up to 40 gig.\n\n153\n00:08:21.826 --> 00:08:24.180\n>> That's right but\nyou can't take any more than that.\n\n154\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.880\nAnd that does lend itself to the fact\nthat you have to type maximum\n\n155\n00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.190\nequals, all right?\n\n156\n00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.764\nSo I did miss that part there.\n\n157\n00:08:31.764 --> 00:08:38.148\nAnd then we do 40,960.\n\n158\n00:08:38.148 --> 00:08:39.849\nAnd then we're gonna tell it type.\n\n159\n00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:42.908\nAnd this is where we could say,\nI could type fixed,\n\n160\n00:08:42.908 --> 00:08:47.620\nright, and that's gonna say, okay,\nall 40 gigs is allocated right away.\n\n161\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:53.540\n40 gigs, you're gonna waste that, if you\nwill, on your storage capacity right away.\n\n162\n00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.236\nHowever, what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna type expandable.\n\n163\n00:08:58.812 --> 00:09:03.909\nAll right, and what that says, make it\na dynamic virtual hard disk, all right.\n\n164\n00:09:03.909 --> 00:09:06.199\n>> You would think it would be dynamic.\n\n165\n00:09:06.199 --> 00:09:08.260\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> Cuz it's dynamic [LAUGH] disk.\n\n166\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.540\n>> And let me show you here,\nit does say that I got an error,\n\n167\n00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.310\nI can see the error right away.\n\n168\n00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.844\nWhen you move between\nthe DISM command [LAUGH] and\n\n169\n00:09:14.844 --> 00:09:17.575\nDISKPART, one of the things that\nyou'll notice is that when you're in\n\n170\n00:09:17.575 --> 00:09:21.570\nDISM a lot of times you'll have\nthis file:c: for the path.\n\n171\n00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.802\nThis is actually file=, so I just missed\nthat right there cuz we're in DISKPART,\n\n172\n00:09:24.802 --> 00:09:26.988\nwe're not in\nthe Deployment Image Servicing Manager.\n\n173\n00:09:26.988 --> 00:09:30.746\nAnd when we run this you can see\nit does complete successfully.\n\n174\n00:09:30.746 --> 00:09:33.450\nAll right so, well,\nwhat did that really do for us?\n\n175\n00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.660\nLet's drop back down to our,\nwell you know what,\n\n176\n00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.040\nI'll stay in the graphical user interface,\nor the command line here.\n\n177\n00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.840\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nget into our VHD folder or\n\n178\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.940\ndirectory, and we'll do a dir here.\n\n179\n00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.737\nAnd now you can see, well,\nI've got my file right there.\n\n180\n00:09:50.737 --> 00:09:55.710\nIt's ready to go, test01.vhdx, all right?\n\n181\n00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.740\nNow if I was to go back to DISKPART and\n\n182\n00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:04.860\nI was to do a list disk option, that\nshows me all the disks in the machine.\n\n183\n00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.800\nIf I do a list disk, you're gonna see,\n\n184\n00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.350\nwell where is that 40 gig disk\nthat we just created, where is it?\n\n185\n00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.390\nWell, I created it but\nI still have to attach it, right.\n\n186\n00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.740\nAttaching is, like we said other episodes,\nlike with ISOs or\n\n187\n00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.660\nif you're in the Linux,\nthat's mounting the file.\n\n188\n00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.220\nYou can't use the file just\nbecause you created it.\n\n189\n00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.210\nSo that's what we have to do.\n\n190\n00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.475\nNow, at the first part\nof this is selecting it.\n\n191\n00:10:27.475 --> 00:10:30.450\nNow I will tell you that you're\ngonna see me switch back and\n\n192\n00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.580\nforth between abbreviations and\nfull commands here.\n\n193\n00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.530\nOne of the things I like about DISKPART\nis the abbreviations that are allowed.\n\n194\n00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.550\nSome of you guys probably in the Cisco\nworld out there know you can do,\n\n195\n00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.750\ninstead of show interface, right, you can\ndo S-H-I-N-T and it's the same thing.\n\n196\n00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.170\nWell DISKPART kinda lets you kind of\ncheat a little bit, if you will, here.\n\n197\n00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:53.500\nSo I could run S-E-L, I wanna show\nyou guys the full command though.\n\n198\n00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.740\nBut if you see me go back and\nforth between S-E-L and select,\n\n199\n00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.200\nthey're the same thing,\nS-E-L is just an abbreviation.\n\n200\n00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.056\nSo we're gonna do select and\nthen we have to do vdisk.\n\n201\n00:11:04.056 --> 00:11:06.800\nAnd there again, we're gonna use\nthis file and we're in DISKPART,\n\n202\n00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.375\ndon't use the colon, use the equals.\n\n203\n00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:10.803\nAnd we're gonna tell\nit where that file is.\n\n204\n00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:15.650\nNow if you remember, it's vhds, or vhd,\n\n205\n00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.760\nexcuse me, 01 and vhdx.\n\n206\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.280\nAll right now, you'll notice that it\nsays that file has been selected.\n\n207\n00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.530\nNow, we can use the file, right?\n\n208\n00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.329\nWell, let's go ahead and\ndo list disk again and see if it shows up.\n\n209\n00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.000\nStill doesn't show up, why?\n\n210\n00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.890\nWe selected it.\n\n211\n00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:37.980\nNow what we have to do, now that it's\nselected, is we have to attach the vdisk.\n\n212\n00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.750\nSo couple of things that I want\nyou to remember for the exam,\n\n213\n00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.940\njust selecting it doesn't\nreally do anything, right?\n\n214\n00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.420\nCreating it doesn't do anything\n[LAUGH] allow you to work with it.\n\n215\n00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.120\nSelecting it doesn't allow\nyou to work with it.\n\n216\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.640\nAnd then finally you attach it.\n\n217\n00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:55.040\nNow if I rerun list disk, all of a sudden\nwe've got an online 40 gig disk.\n\n218\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.620\nNow, are we done?\n\n219\n00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.440\nWell unfortunately not\nbecause we have a blank,\n\n220\n00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.840\nI want you to think of this\neven though it's a file.\n\n221\n00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.845\nI want you think of it as\na blank hard drive, right?\n\n222\n00:12:04.845 --> 00:12:08.670\nDan, what's the first thing, if you were\ngoing to install any operating system?\n\n223\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.550\nYou get a hard drive and it's bare metal,\n\n224\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.730\nwhat do you gotta do to it,\npretty much to put any data on it?\n\n225\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.910\n>> Yeah, you gotta partition it and\nformat it.\n\n226\n00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.540\n>> Absolutely, so\nthat's exactly what we have to do and\n\n227\n00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.750\nthat's what we're gonna do here,\nin those orders.\n\n228\n00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.790\nWe're gonna partition it and then\nwe're gonna apply a file system to it.\n\n229\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.410\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n230\n00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:30.381\nFirst thing that we're gonna do here is\nthe format option, all right so, or no,\n\n231\n00:12:30.381 --> 00:12:31.925\nno, not format option.\n\n232\n00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:33.355\nI'm sorry, create, and\n\n233\n00:12:33.355 --> 00:12:37.390\nhere's where some more of those\nabbreviations are gonna come into play.\n\n234\n00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.940\nRight, I could do create part prime,\nright?\n\n235\n00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.351\nNo not Optimus Prime, sorry guys.\n\n236\n00:12:43.351 --> 00:12:48.598\nBut if I say create part prime,\nthat's actually the shortened\n\n237\n00:12:48.598 --> 00:12:53.160\nversion of saying create\npartition primary, right?\n\n238\n00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.540\nSo I can do either/or and again,\n\n239\n00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.200\nyou'll see the fact that we\ncan use those abbreviations.\n\n240\n00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.590\nSo for your guys' benefit out there,\nthe viewers, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n241\n00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:03.700\nshow you the full one.\n\n242\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.850\nOnce we get into this,\nhaving to do this a couple more times,\n\n243\n00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.933\nyou're probably gonna see me go ahead and\nabbreviate it.\n\n244\n00:13:07.933 --> 00:13:12.547\nSo just keep that in mind for the exam,\nin case they give you either format,\n\n245\n00:13:12.547 --> 00:13:13.804\nyou should be okay.\n\n246\n00:13:13.804 --> 00:13:17.820\nAll right, so\nnow I've got a primary partition, right?\n\n247\n00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.720\nIf I do a list disk, right,\nI still see that it's selected.\n\n248\n00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.780\nI could do a list partition, right, and\n\n249\n00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:31.350\nI could see that we now have a primary\npartition on our 40 gig drive.\n\n250\n00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.450\nVHD file more specifically.\n\n251\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.190\nNow I wanna give this drive a letter,\nright.\n\n252\n00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.020\nSo how do I do that?\n\n253\n00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.470\nWell the first thing I have to do, I have\nto format it with an operating system\n\n254\n00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.000\nbefore I can even turn it into a volume.\n\n255\n00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.790\nSo we're gonna run the format command.\n\n256\n00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.700\nNow, we're gonna go ahead and format this.\n\n257\n00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.280\nAnd it has to be an NTFS format,\nif you will,\n\n258\n00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.090\nto be able to apply an image to it, right?\n\n259\n00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.820\nWe need an operating system on it,\nwe're dealing with Windows so\n\n260\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.470\nwe're gonna be dealing with NTFS here.\n\n261\n00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.095\nSo we're gonna say fs=ntfs.\n\n262\n00:14:02.095 --> 00:14:06.919\nAnd then we're gonna do label=, and\nI do the labels, again, a label is more of\n\n263\n00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:11.687\na variable, it's gonna change according\nto your exam and your environment.\n\n264\n00:14:11.687 --> 00:14:14.360\nSo I don't want you to worry\ntoo much about the label.\n\n265\n00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.697\nKnow that the label option is there,\nbut I'm gonna label this VHD.\n\n266\n00:14:19.697 --> 00:14:23.899\nAnd that just helps me keep track of it\nin this list we can see just above here,\n\n267\n00:14:23.899 --> 00:14:26.320\nI can't really tell which one's which.\n\n268\n00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.490\nYou'll see that change here\nin a second with that label,\n\n269\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.020\nit'll be easier to identify it.\n\n270\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.090\nAnd then I'm gonna do a quick format.\n\n271\n00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.200\nNow you might ask yourselves, what's the\ndifference between doing full format and\n\n272\n00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.605\ndoing a quick format?\n\n273\n00:14:37.605 --> 00:14:39.215\nWell, this is kinda interesting.\n\n274\n00:14:39.215 --> 00:14:41.855\nI've never really had a problem\nwhen I run the quick format.\n\n275\n00:14:41.855 --> 00:14:43.285\nAnd it does exactly what it says,\n\n276\n00:14:43.285 --> 00:14:45.765\nit rifles through that format quicker,\nall right?\n\n277\n00:14:45.765 --> 00:14:46.770\nSo what's the full format?\n\n278\n00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.515\nWell, the for full, full format,\n\n279\n00:14:48.515 --> 00:14:52.095\nif I could say it right, if I could format\nmy words right [LAUGH] Is the fact that it\n\n280\n00:14:52.095 --> 00:14:56.190\nruns a Check Disk over every\nsingle sector of the hard drive.\n\n281\n00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.160\nWell guess what?\n\n282\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.850\nThere isn't a sector on a hard drive here\ncuz [LAUGH] we got a virtual file, so\n\n283\n00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:00.670\nI'm not worried about it.\n\n284\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:04.710\nSo I'm gonna run quick and\nit is pretty quick, right?\n\n285\n00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.260\nSo we now have a format.\n\n286\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.916\nNow, if you'll notice something,\nif I do a list vol here,\n\n287\n00:15:10.916 --> 00:15:16.190\nall right, now I can see all of\nthese different drives, right?\n\n288\n00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:21.575\nAnd I can see that volume 5,\nthat's our hard drive, right?\n\n289\n00:15:21.575 --> 00:15:24.332\nThat's our hard drive\nthat we've just created.\n\n290\n00:15:24.332 --> 00:15:27.010\nBut the problem is it\ndoesn't have a letter on it.\n\n291\n00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:30.650\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead\nand assign a letter to this drive and\n\n292\n00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:33.390\nwe'll go ahead and, since it's a virtual\ndisk, I'm gonna give it the V.\n\n293\n00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.949\nI'm just gonna assign the letter V.\n\n294\n00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:39.355\nNow, again, the letter is more, it varies,\n\n295\n00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:43.752\nbecause whatever they're showing you on\nthe exam, it might be a different letter.\n\n296\n00:15:43.752 --> 00:15:46.090\nAnd that's okay, it's your choice here.\n\n297\n00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.400\nSo I'll assign letter V.\n\n298\n00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.060\nAnd you can see that it's\ngot a mounting point now.\n\n299\n00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.730\nAnd my heads kind of covering it up here.\n\n300\n00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.274\nIt disappeared on us there and\nthat's okay.\n\n301\n00:15:56.274 --> 00:16:00.406\nBut what it's basically saying,\nif I was to go back to the graphical\n\n302\n00:16:00.406 --> 00:16:04.916\nuser interface, all it was saying here\nis that, hey, We have got a disk.\n\n303\n00:16:04.916 --> 00:16:05.760\nIt's ready to go.\n\n304\n00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.639\nYou're ready to use it.\n\n305\n00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:09.591\nI could use this as a storage container,\nunmount it, and\n\n306\n00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:12.730\nthen put it up on the server,\nand then load it into Hyer-V.\n\n307\n00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.950\nAnd that data would be there, right?\n\n308\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.338\nSo very good thing to have.\n\n309\n00:16:16.338 --> 00:16:19.958\nBut we wanna go a little bit\nfarther than that, all right.\n\n310\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:26.925\nNow, let me just double check here, that\nhas our virtual hard disk ready to go.\n\n311\n00:16:26.925 --> 00:16:31.034\nAll right, now, the next thing that we\nhave to do is we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n312\n00:16:31.034 --> 00:16:32.980\nwe're gonna apply an image to this.\n\n313\n00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:38.120\nAnd this is\nthe Deployment Image Servicing Manager.\n\n314\n00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.940\nAll right, so a couple of prerequisites\nthat you have to have, and\n\n315\n00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:42.950\nlet me go ahead and show you this.\n\n316\n00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:44.460\nI've already copied these over.\n\n317\n00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.960\nCuz you guys know what a file\ntransfer [LAUGH] looks like.\n\n318\n00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.220\nAnd you certainly don't have to wait for\nus to transfer this file on camera here.\n\n319\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.820\nBut what I did is I mounted.\n\n320\n00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.750\nLet me go ahead and go into this PC,\nso you guys can see it there then.\n\n321\n00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.020\nI got the installation media, all right.\n\n322\n00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:07.930\nInside of the installation media, if I go\nahead and I open this up, you're gonna see\n\n323\n00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.880\nall the normal files that you would see\non any Windows installation disk, right?\n\n324\n00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.840\nWhat I really want is down here in the\nsources folder, and you could go ahead and\n\n325\n00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.490\ntake all this time to scroll.\n\n326\n00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:24.020\nThe easiest way to find a Windows image is\ngo over here to Size, and change the size.\n\n327\n00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.980\nFilter it by size, and\nyou'll notice right up here at top,\n\n328\n00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.710\nit's the biggest file in\nthe whole entire folder.\n\n329\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:31.450\nSo it's easy to find.\n\n330\n00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.930\nYou don't have to scroll through\nall these files to get to it.\n\n331\n00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:39.380\nAll right, and then all I'm gonna\ndo is I will copy that, and\n\n332\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.170\nthen I'm gonna put this on local disk C.\n\n333\n00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.670\nNow like I said, guys, we went ahead and\nwe put this on local disc C ahead of time,\n\n334\n00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.970\njust so you didn't have to wait for\nall of that to happen.\n\n335\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.194\nSo now what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna take this image, and\n\n336\n00:17:52.194 --> 00:17:56.748\nwe're gonna apply it to the VHD\nthat we have right here, test01.\n\n337\n00:17:56.748 --> 00:18:01.160\nNow, understand that this\nprocess could take a while.\n\n338\n00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.446\nAll right, so depending on how big your\nimage is, if you have a customized image,\n\n339\n00:18:04.446 --> 00:18:06.830\nremember we said one of the things\nthat you could use this for\n\n340\n00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:07.750\nwas image servicing.\n\n341\n00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.230\nYou might have a 60 gig image.\n\n342\n00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.479\nThe default Windows image, right,\n\n343\n00:18:12.479 --> 00:18:16.903\nwhen it is applied by the Deployment\nImage Servicing Manager to the VHD,\n\n344\n00:18:16.903 --> 00:18:22.290\nit's only about 7 gigs, 8 gigs, just under\n8 gigs in size, and it still takes a bit.\n\n345\n00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:26.060\nIf it's a 60 gig image,\nyou might be in for a coffee break.\n\n346\n00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.410\nSo you might have to do what we're about\nto do here, go grab you a cup of coffee,\n\n347\n00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.380\ncome back, and when we come back,\nhopefully it'll be done.\n\n348\n00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.550\nSo what are we doing here?\n\n349\n00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:38.150\nLet's drop down back to our\nPowerShell command prompt.\n\n350\n00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.130\nWorks in both\nDeployment Image Servicing Manager,\n\n351\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.390\nworks in both of those interfaces.\n\n352\n00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:49.569\nAnd we're gonna type dism /apply-image.\n\n353\n00:18:49.569 --> 00:18:52.384\nAnd then we've gotta tell\nit the image file, and\n\n354\n00:18:52.384 --> 00:18:54.994\nyou'll see why my typo's in diskpart here,\n\n355\n00:18:54.994 --> 00:18:59.470\ncuz you'll see [LAUGH] gotta keep in mind\non the exam, some of these switches.\n\n356\n00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.459\nSo, we're gonna say, imagefile, and now,\n\n357\n00:19:01.459 --> 00:19:05.139\nhere's where that :C: I was telling you\ncoming back, it's not an equals, right?\n\n358\n00:19:05.139 --> 00:19:10.470\nSo don't forget that on the exam,\nor you'll get a bunch of red lines.\n\n359\n00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.250\nIt'll say I don't know\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n360\n00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.190\nWe're saying install.wim,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n361\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.050\ntake that, don't need two of those there.\n\n362\n00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.389\nAll right, we'll do install.wim,\n\n363\n00:19:22.389 --> 00:19:26.400\nand another thing to keep in mind,\nif you will, is the fact that a wim\n\n364\n00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.910\nfile is a container that can contain\nmultiple Windows images, right?\n\n365\n00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:35.650\nSo we're gonna tell it index:1 means\nthe default Windows installation image.\n\n366\n00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.290\nAll right, and the next thing we have to\ndo is we have to apply it to the VHD.\n\n367\n00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:44.380\nWell, there was a reason I\nformatted it with MTFS, the VHD,\n\n368\n00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:49.210\nand then applied the volume letter to it,\nthe mounting point, right?\n\n369\n00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:54.508\nSo this is gonna be ApplyDir,\nall right, and then it's gonna be :v:\\,\n\n370\n00:19:54.508 --> 00:19:59.170\nand we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll hit Enter and run that.\n\n371\n00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.641\nAnd now what it does is it looks for\nwhere that image is, right?\n\n372\n00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:06.475\nIt says okay, there's the image, here's\nthe location that you wanna apply it to,\n\n373\n00:20:06.475 --> 00:20:09.619\nand it sees that it's no different\nthan what we see in File Explorer.\n\n374\n00:20:09.619 --> 00:20:12.493\nAnd it says let’s go ahead and\napply that image to it.\n\n375\n00:20:12.493 --> 00:20:16.179\nNow, this could take awhile so\nwhat we're gonna do here, Dan,\n\n376\n00:20:16.179 --> 00:20:21.091\nI think, is use the TV magic, if you will,\nso you don't have to wait for an entire 7,\n\n377\n00:20:21.091 --> 00:20:23.030\n8 gigs to be applied to this VHD.\n\n378\n00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.179\nAnd when it's done, we'll go ahead and\ncome back and show you what it looks like.\n\n379\n00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.890\nWell, it looks like it finished, and\n\n380\n00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.300\nit certainly didn't take too long\nwith the TV time out, right?\n\n381\n00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.350\nSo if we jump back to our computer here,\nyou can see that it applied the image.\n\n382\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.500\nIt says 100% successful.\n\n383\n00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.110\nThat's great.\nSo\n\n384\n00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:41.245\nnow we have that VHD file is ready to go.\n\n385\n00:20:41.245 --> 00:20:45.545\nCouple of things, Dan, and I didn't\nmention this that we should probably do\n\n386\n00:20:45.545 --> 00:20:50.655\nbefore we get the USB drive that we're\ngonna put this virtual hard disk\n\n387\n00:20:50.655 --> 00:20:55.580\non formatted, is we actually have\nto unmount this virtual disk now.\n\n388\n00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.430\nSo just gonna change it up just\na little bit there as a heads up, man.\n\n389\n00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:05.030\nWe're gonna go back into diskpart, and\nwe are gonna select that same vdisk.\n\n390\n00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.510\nAnd remember,\nnow I'm doing my abbreviations, guys.\n\n391\n00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.280\nAgain, so\nwhichever one comes up on the test,\n\n392\n00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.690\nI don't want them to say what is this SEL?\n\n393\n00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:15.310\nWes said it was select,\nor the other way around.\n\n394\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.550\nSo you'll start to see me\nuse those abbreviations now.\n\n395\n00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.500\nSo we're gonna do SEL for select vdisk.\n\n396\n00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.570\nAnd again, remember, now that we're\nin diskpart, it's file=, not file:.\n\n397\n00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:30.180\nAnd we're gonna say, c:\\vhds,\n\n398\n00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:34.270\nand I really wish, it would be nice if\nauto complete would help us on this one.\n\n399\n00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:38.990\nBut unfortunately, I'm expecting a little\ntoo much on that one, all right.\n\n400\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.910\nNow the next thing that we're gonna do,\nis we're gonna go ahead and\n\n401\n00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:43.930\nwe are going to, I'll tell you what.\n\n402\n00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.030\nWe haven't really talked\nabout disk management.\n\n403\n00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.550\nLet me show you how to detach\nthrough disk management as well.\n\n404\n00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:53.230\nKeep in mind disk management might\nbe on the exam, and that's okay.\n\n405\n00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.620\nBut I would almost be willing to bet\nbecause of this that they're probably\n\n406\n00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:02.360\ngonna want you to know\nthe diskpart a little bit more.\n\n407\n00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.294\nAll right, so\nhere's my virtual hard drive.\n\n408\n00:22:06.294 --> 00:22:09.730\nRight, you can see that\nit comes up in the list.\n\n409\n00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.720\nAnd it is good to take a second and\nshow you this, guys.\n\n410\n00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.818\nDan, do you see the difference\nbetween these disk icons right here,\n\n411\n00:22:16.818 --> 00:22:18.260\nthese two right here?\n\n412\n00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.160\nDo you see the only obvious thing?\n\n413\n00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.400\n>> One looks blue.\n\n414\n00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.259\n>> That's right.\n>> One looks blue.\n\n415\n00:22:22.259 --> 00:22:25.005\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now, that might seem absolutely\n\n416\n00:22:25.005 --> 00:22:30.155\ntrivial, but I've seen in the past,\neven in things like practice tests,\n\n417\n00:22:30.155 --> 00:22:35.740\nwhere they give you those two icons,\nand they say, what is this disk?\n\n418\n00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:40.850\nAll right, this disk is a virtual disk,\nand you can tell by that icon.\n\n419\n00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:44.399\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're just going to right click on it.\n\n420\n00:22:44.399 --> 00:22:45.760\nAnd we're gonna choose Detach.\n\n421\n00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.050\nAnd it's gonna ask us,\nis this the disk you wanna detach?\n\n422\n00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.660\nAnd we'll say yes.\n\n423\n00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:58.090\nAll right, so that's got our virtual\nhard disk created and the image applied.\n\n424\n00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:02.140\nNow what we have to do is we\nhave to format our USB drive.\n\n425\n00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:07.180\nNow I've gone ahead, and\nI could go in here and my USB drive,\n\n426\n00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.540\nlet's go ahead, we'll plug it in.\n\n427\n00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.180\nAll right, and\nwe'll connect it to Windows here.\n\n428\n00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.110\nAnd notice I've already\ngot one ready with WinPE.\n\n429\n00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:18.340\nNow, I could just right click on this,\nand I could choose Format.\n\n430\n00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.130\nI highly doubt that's the way they're\ngonna ask you in the exam because that\n\n431\n00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.520\nwould be a little bit too easy.\n\n432\n00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.160\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\ndrop back down to our disk part, and\n\n433\n00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.020\nwe're gonna run the list\ndisk option again.\n\n434\n00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:34.487\nAll right, I can see my 14, oops, could\nsee it, there we go, now you can see it.\n\n435\n00:23:34.487 --> 00:23:38.940\nI can see the 14 gigabytes USB\nthumb drive that I just plugged in.\n\n436\n00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.600\nNow we're gonna go ahead,\nand we're gonna format this.\n\n437\n00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.800\nWhat you have to do is you\nhave to select a disk.\n\n438\n00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.765\nSo we're gonna do sel disk, in this case,\n1, be careful with this, guys,\n\n439\n00:23:47.765 --> 00:23:51.062\nespecially if you're working\nwith a machine that's offline.\n\n440\n00:23:51.062 --> 00:23:54.910\nSelect the right disk before you\nformat it, [LAUGH] just as a heads up.\n\n441\n00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:55.882\nI won't tell you how I know that.\n\n442\n00:23:55.882 --> 00:24:01.153\nSo now that we've selected that disk, And\nwe'll go ahead and we'll choose clean.\n\n443\n00:24:01.153 --> 00:24:05.110\nThat's another option here,\nwe'll say clean, all right?\n\n444\n00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.600\nAccess is denied.\n\n445\n00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.590\nHm, let's find out.\n\n446\n00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.890\nThat's probably because,\ntry one thing here,\n\n447\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.192\ngo to work PowerShell.\n\n448\n00:24:19.192 --> 00:24:23.310\nI think it was already in\nan administrative PowerShell, but\n\n449\n00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.499\nlet's just double check here.\n\n450\n00:24:32.657 --> 00:24:37.311\nAll right, we'll do list disk again.\n\n451\n00:24:37.311 --> 00:24:41.520\nUCL in disk 1.\n\n452\n00:24:43.745 --> 00:24:46.180\nClean, there we go so for\nsome reason it didn't do.\n\n453\n00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.540\nI can almost tell you I think I know what\nthe problem was, but I was pretty sure I\n\n454\n00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.720\nwas already in administrative\ncommand prompt to begin with.\n\n455\n00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.440\nSo for whatever reason Windows said no,\nlet's just make sure.\n\n456\n00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.340\nIt does have to be in\nadministrative command prompt.\n\n457\n00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.570\nBut it should be administrative to\nget into disk part to begin with,\n\n458\n00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.420\nso I'm not exactly what happened there.\n\n459\n00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.960\n>> That's what they\nshould put on the test.\n\n460\n00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.490\nWill Windows randomly ignore the fact\nthat you're an administrator?\n\n461\n00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.440\nTrue or false?\n\n462\n00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.510\n>> Does windows validate its own UAC?\n\n463\n00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.460\nSo There we go.\n\n464\n00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.360\nNow, couple more commands there.\n\n465\n00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.010\nI know Dan's letting me know we're\ngonna have to wrap this one up here.\n\n466\n00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:21.580\nWe're gonna go ahead like we did before\nand I'm gonna use my abbreviation so\n\n467\n00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.320\nyou guys can see it.\n\n468\n00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.870\nWe're gonna create part prime, right?\n\n469\n00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.330\nSo, again, the abbreviations.\n\n470\n00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.940\nNotice that's just create\npartition primary.\n\n471\n00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.930\nAnd then we'll go ahead and\nformat this, all right.\n\n472\n00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:38.875\nAnd we will format the hard\ndrive again with NTFS.\n\n473\n00:25:38.875 --> 00:25:44.556\nN-T, how do you spell NTFS,\nDan, can you help me with that?\n\n474\n00:25:44.556 --> 00:25:46.080\n>> J-X.\n\n475\n00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:51.876\n>> [LAUGH] Perfect, all right, and then\nthe label that we're gonna put on this\n\n476\n00:25:51.876 --> 00:25:58.238\nagain is going to be virtual disk or I'll\ntell you what, I'll just put VHD again.\n\n477\n00:26:01.306 --> 00:26:03.110\nYeah, just put VHD disk.\n\n478\n00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.760\nI know that's a little bit redundant\nthere, but it will help me find it later.\n\n479\n00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.744\nWe'll choose format, we'll choose quick.\n\n480\n00:26:16.117 --> 00:26:17.420\nAll right.\n\n481\n00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.870\nNow we've got our disk formatted.\n\n482\n00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.530\nWe got a couple more things to do, but\n\n483\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.300\nthis at least gets us set up for\nthe next step.\n\n484\n00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.510\n>> Yeah we're definitely running well\nlow on the time clock over there.\n\n485\n00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.050\nBut it sets us up perfectly for\n\n486\n00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:35.230\nanother one of our famous part twos\nthat you guys love and adore so much.\n\n487\n00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:38.160\nSo Wes, will you be so\nkind as to join us in that part?\n\n488\n00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:38.762\n>> Absolutely.\n\n489\n00:26:38.762 --> 00:26:39.610\n>> All right man, thanks a lot.\n\n490\n00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.440\nWe appreciate what you have shown us so\nfar, looking forward to that part two.\n\n491\n00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.650\nHopefully you are as well.\n\n492\n00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:45.240\nBut this one we are going to go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n493\n00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.690\nFor ITPro.TV i've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrey.\n\n494\n00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:48.650\n>> And i'm Wess Bryan.\n\n495\n00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.357\n>> See you next time.\n\n496\n00:26:50.357 --> 00:26:57.970\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another exciting\nepisode Episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.949\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry and\nin today's episode we're coming back with\n\n5\n00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.513\nmore Windows 10, specifically a part\ntwo on the good old VHDs and the-\n\n6\n00:00:25.513 --> 00:00:26.637\n>> Native-boots.\n\n7\n00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:28.180\n>> Native-boots, yes.\n\n8\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.693\nAnd joining us back, the disembodied\nvoice you heard off of camera there,\n\n9\n00:00:31.693 --> 00:00:33.324\nis our good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:34.613\nWelcome back Wes, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:35.787\n>> I'm doing okay.\n\n12\n00:00:35.787 --> 00:00:38.172\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n13\n00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:39.623\nYeah, we had to come back with a part two,\n\n14\n00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:42.539\nbecause well there's a lot more to do\nwhen you're gonna implement native-boot.\n\n15\n00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.323\nSo we'll go ahead, we'll jump right in.\n\n16\n00:00:44.323 --> 00:00:49.311\nOne of the things we're gonna do,\nwe ended the last episode prepping\n\n17\n00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:52.840\nthe drive that we're gonna\ncopy our VHD file to.\n\n18\n00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.760\nNow, couple of more things that we're\ngonna do in this episode as well is well,\n\n19\n00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.670\nif we're gonna deploy a native-boot,\n\n20\n00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.910\nwe have to have\na pre-installation environment.\n\n21\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.291\nSo we're also gonna show you\nhow to make a Win PE disk or\n\n22\n00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:08.138\nin this case it's gonna be USB,\na bootable USB thumb drive.\n\n23\n00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:11.430\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's dive right in to it.\n\n24\n00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.140\nWe got to copy that VHD that we've\ncreated in the previous episode.\n\n25\n00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.336\nIf you're not aware of that go, jump back\nand check that out and then come back and\n\n26\n00:01:19.336 --> 00:01:20.003\njoin us on this.\n\n27\n00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:22.686\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\ntake that VHD that we created,\n\n28\n00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:25.799\nwe applied with deployment image\nservicing manager the image to it,\n\n29\n00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.447\nnow we're gonna copy that over\nto the thumb drive as well.\n\n30\n00:01:28.447 --> 00:01:31.423\nSo let's go ahead,\nI've got my PowerShell pulled up.\n\n31\n00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:33.255\nWe're gonna use the copy command.\n\n32\n00:01:33.255 --> 00:01:34.352\nAnd I will tell you,\n\n33\n00:01:34.352 --> 00:01:38.682\nwe're probably gonna use the magic of TV\non this one because of the things Dan and\n\n34\n00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:42.639\nI were talking about before we started\nis that when use the copy command.\n\n35\n00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:47.249\nYou get absolutely no indication of\nhow far or how much longer it has to\n\n36\n00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:51.320\ngo It just says file copy, so\nit could take a little bit here.\n\n37\n00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.607\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna say copy.\n\n38\n00:01:53.607 --> 00:01:56.478\nAnd if you remember from\nthe previous episode,\n\n39\n00:01:56.478 --> 00:01:58.862\nwe put that VHD file down there in VHDs.\n\n40\n00:01:58.862 --> 00:02:05.432\nAnd then test01.vhdx and we also have,\nbring up the GUI here for a second,\n\n41\n00:02:05.432 --> 00:02:11.170\nremember we have that VHD disk that\nwe created in the last episode.\n\n42\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.370\nSo to finish the copy command, we're just\ngonna go ahead and we're gonna say e.\n\n43\n00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.240\nAnd this is the progress bar that you get,\nyou get the little blinking cursor.\n\n44\n00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.575\nSo what we're gonna do,\nit could take a little bit.\n\n45\n00:02:23.575 --> 00:02:25.735\nThis is just around eight gigs, and\n\n46\n00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:28.841\ntransferring eight gigs\nis nothing spectacular.\n\n47\n00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:31.727\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll use the magic in the TV.\n\n48\n00:02:31.727 --> 00:02:33.839\nAnd when this is finished we'll\ngo ahead and come back and\n\n49\n00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:35.430\nshow you what it looks like.\n\n50\n00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.800\nWe finished copying over\nthe VHD to our USB thumb drive.\n\n51\n00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.290\nNow it's time to plug in another USB\nthumb drive and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n52\n00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.210\nprepare that one.\n\n53\n00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.846\n>> Whoa, there swolled up.\n\n54\n00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:46.926\nDidn't we just do that?\n\n55\n00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:48.414\nWhat do we need two USB thumb drives for?\n\n56\n00:02:48.414 --> 00:02:49.689\n>> That's an interesting thing.\n\n57\n00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.240\nWhen you go to deploy native-boot,\nyou have to use WinPE.\n\n58\n00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.129\nAnd Windows Preinstallation Environment,\n\n59\n00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.223\nit's actually part of\nany installation medium.\n\n60\n00:02:57.223 --> 00:03:00.239\nIt's baked right in, but\nthere is a limitation.\n\n61\n00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.294\n>> What is the limitation?\n\n62\n00:03:01.294 --> 00:03:04.336\n>> Well WinPE uses FAT32.\n\n63\n00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:08.480\nUnfortunately, when you make\na bootable WinPE USB thumb drive,\n\n64\n00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.055\nit doesn't use NTFS, it uses FAT32.\n\n65\n00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:14.573\nAnd because of that, we can only have,\nwhat the four gig limitation.\n\n66\n00:03:14.573 --> 00:03:16.945\nSo your file size is limited to four gigs.\n\n67\n00:03:16.945 --> 00:03:21.340\nAnd the problem is my image or\nin this case, the virtual drive that we're\n\n68\n00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.790\ngonna use is just under eight gigs,\nso it's over double the file limit.\n\n69\n00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.628\nSo unfortunately, and I say\nunfortunately because it could be solved\n\n70\n00:03:30.628 --> 00:03:33.335\nif they would make WinPE just use NTFS.\n\n71\n00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:36.487\nAnd if it uses NTFS,\nwe get around that restriction, and\n\n72\n00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:38.960\nwe could use a single thumb drive.\n\n73\n00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.557\nWe could make a bootable\nWinPE thumb drive and\n\n74\n00:03:41.557 --> 00:03:45.860\nwe actually strip a slip stream the VHD\nfile into that same thumb drive, but\n\n75\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.683\nbecause we have that\nlimitation keep it in mind.\n\n76\n00:03:48.683 --> 00:03:50.614\nIf you're gonna deploy this to a machine,\n\n77\n00:03:50.614 --> 00:03:53.845\nyou're gonna need a separate thumb\ndrive because of that limitation.\n\n78\n00:03:53.845 --> 00:03:58.115\nSo let's go ahead and we're gonna\nprepare that second thumb drive with\n\n79\n00:03:58.115 --> 00:04:00.970\nthe windows pre-installation environment.\n\n80\n00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.200\nNow does require you having the Windows\nassessment deployment kit and\n\n81\n00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.214\nWindows 80K already install.\n\n82\n00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:11.173\nAnd more specifically what you're\ngonna need to do is you need to run\n\n83\n00:04:11.173 --> 00:04:14.171\nthe deployment image and\nservicing environment.\n\n84\n00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:20.727\nNow, we'll go ahead and get out of our\nPowerShell here and let's see here,\n\n85\n00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:25.760\nwe'll go to Start menu and\nthen we'll go to All Programs.\n\n86\n00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.489\nAnd then we're gonna scroll down and\n\n87\n00:04:27.489 --> 00:04:29.894\nyou'll see that there is\nWindows Kits right here.\n\n88\n00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.860\nWe're gonna get into there.\n\n89\n00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.176\nAnd if you scroll down just a little\nbit farther, you're gonna to see this\n\n90\n00:04:35.176 --> 00:04:38.562\nDeployment and Imaging Tools Environment\nand that's where we need to be.\n\n91\n00:04:38.562 --> 00:04:43.083\nAnd let me make this a little easier for\nyou guys to see out there.\n\n92\n00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:44.842\nGo ahead and\nbring up that font just a little bit.\n\n93\n00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:53.995\nAdd screen text,\ngot to always be looking at the matrix.\n\n94\n00:04:53.995 --> 00:04:55.298\nThere we go.\n\n95\n00:04:55.298 --> 00:04:58.121\nNow that little error just says\nthat it's not gonna store these.\n\n96\n00:04:58.121 --> 00:04:59.713\nThese settings aren't gonna be persistent.\n\n97\n00:04:59.713 --> 00:05:03.873\nIt's just warning me about\nthat in the beginning.\n\n98\n00:05:03.873 --> 00:05:06.321\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nstay in this environment.\n\n99\n00:05:06.321 --> 00:05:11.195\nIn the previous episode, I told you that\nif you weren't an administrative command\n\n100\n00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:13.562\nprompt and you started using disk part,\n\n101\n00:05:13.562 --> 00:05:17.337\nit was gonna kick you over to\nan administration command prompt.\n\n102\n00:05:17.337 --> 00:05:19.873\nI believe if I remember right,\nI can show you that from here.\n\n103\n00:05:19.873 --> 00:05:20.841\nThere we go.\n\n104\n00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:23.126\nSo we're gonna start with disk part and\n\n105\n00:05:23.126 --> 00:05:27.351\nthen we're gonna come back to our\ndeployment image servicing manager,\n\n106\n00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:30.744\nbecause that's what we use to\nactually copy the PE disk and\n\n107\n00:05:30.744 --> 00:05:34.850\nfiles over to the technicians computer\nwhich is what I am on right now.\n\n108\n00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.480\n>> May I commend you to the use\nof the keyboard shortcuts?\n\n109\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.564\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:38.564 --> 00:05:39.618\n>> It's right there.\n\n111\n00:05:39.618 --> 00:05:40.457\nWes is like nope.\n>> Yeah.\n\n112\n00:05:40.457 --> 00:05:41.129\n>> It's going.\n\n113\n00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:42.574\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's exactly it.\n\n114\n00:05:42.574 --> 00:05:46.151\nAnd I'll tell you,\nyou do this enough times you kinda know,\n\n115\n00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:49.466\nhere comes that darn UAC again,\nI better just prepare.\n\n116\n00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:51.821\nSo I'm kinda like\na gunslinger with it as I-\n\n117\n00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:53.066\n>> Just closed it.\n\n118\n00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:53.957\n>> As I close it down.\n\n119\n00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:55.083\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So thanks for\n\n120\n00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:56.828\nthe compliment [CROSSTALK]\nairball right there on camera.\n\n121\n00:05:56.828 --> 00:05:57.380\n>> I'm here to help.\n\n122\n00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.252\n[LAUGH]\n>> No,\n\n123\n00:05:58.252 --> 00:05:59.238\nwe'll go ahead and keep that in there.\n\n124\n00:05:59.238 --> 00:06:01.506\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Misery loves company so\n\n125\n00:06:01.506 --> 00:06:02.255\njump in the boat.\n\n126\n00:06:02.255 --> 00:06:03.564\nThere we go.\n\n127\n00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:06.007\nSo disk par, we're gonna have\ntwo of these prompts open.\n\n128\n00:06:06.007 --> 00:06:07.797\nDo you need two of them\nopen at the same time?\n\n129\n00:06:07.797 --> 00:06:10.550\nNo, you don't, but\nit'll make it easier to get back to it.\n\n130\n00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.302\nSo we're in this par, we're gonna\ndo our list disk command again.\n\n131\n00:06:15.302 --> 00:06:18.313\nNow this is interesting, I've got two.\n\n132\n00:06:18.313 --> 00:06:19.487\nTwo thumb drives in here.\n\n133\n00:06:19.487 --> 00:06:20.631\n[LAUGH] Which one is which?\n\n134\n00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:23.795\nAnd this is where I tell you,\nbe very careful which one you format.\n\n135\n00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:27.736\nSince one already has a volume on it and\nI've went ahead and\n\n136\n00:06:27.736 --> 00:06:33.270\ndid the volume label, I should be able\nto identify it by doing a list volume.\n\n137\n00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.401\nNow I'm doing abbreviations here,\nso list vol works.\n\n138\n00:06:36.401 --> 00:06:41.329\nAnd I can see that I have thar\nVHD disk that we created earlier.\n\n139\n00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:42.952\nThat's got my data on it.\n\n140\n00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:45.848\nAnd then I also have one\nhere that's called untitled.\n\n141\n00:06:45.848 --> 00:06:49.014\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do,\n\n142\n00:06:49.014 --> 00:06:53.505\nsince its already got a volume here,\nwe can just format it by doing a SEL or\n\n143\n00:06:53.505 --> 00:06:56.247\nselect if I want,\nI can actually do SEL VOL.\n\n144\n00:06:56.247 --> 00:06:58.559\nQuit being so lazy here and\nI'll spell it out for you guys.\n\n145\n00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:03.580\nSo it's gonna be select volume, and that's\ngonna be volume, and it's kinda cool,\n\n146\n00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.848\nyou can do volume 4 in this case cuz\nthis is the one that I want right here.\n\n147\n00:07:07.848 --> 00:07:10.344\nOr if I wanted I could do\nit by letter volume f and\n\n148\n00:07:10.344 --> 00:07:12.995\nyou noticed it says volume four selected.\n\n149\n00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:16.425\nAnd then I always run a list vol again and\n\n150\n00:07:16.425 --> 00:07:20.655\nthe reason I do that is just to double\ncheck that little asterisk symbol.\n\n151\n00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.376\nWe spent the time copying\nthat VHD over to this disc.\n\n152\n00:07:26.376 --> 00:07:30.130\nIt wouldn't really be good if I\nturned around and formatted it.\n\n153\n00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.010\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nprepare this drive here.\n\n154\n00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.860\nSo we'll go ahead, now that it's selected,\nwe'll do a list disk again.\n\n155\n00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.700\nAnd you should see, now I can tell which\ndisk that is now when they look the same.\n\n156\n00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.500\nSo we'll go ahead and\nsince it's selected we'll type clean, and\n\n157\n00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.940\nit's gonna clean it out of there.\n\n158\n00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:55.604\nNow if I do a list vol again you'll notice\nthat even though the volume is selected,\n\n159\n00:07:55.604 --> 00:07:58.247\nwe don't have any information here.\n\n160\n00:07:58.247 --> 00:08:02.289\nSo the next thing that we'll do after\nwe run our clean option is we're\n\n161\n00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:05.995\ngonna since it is selected we're\ngonna do a create part prime.\n\n162\n00:08:05.995 --> 00:08:08.391\nAgain, that's create a partition primary.\n\n163\n00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:10.433\nWe'll run that and\nwe'll see that it's successful.\n\n164\n00:08:10.433 --> 00:08:14.540\nAnd if we wanted to verify that it was\nsuccessful, we can do a list partition.\n\n165\n00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.640\nSo that if you got multiple\npartitions on it, it'll show it.\n\n166\n00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.800\nWe only got a single partition.\n\n167\n00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.960\nWe said just go ahead and\nuse the whole drive.\n\n168\n00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.060\nNow, we're gonna use our format option.\n\n169\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.899\nWe're gonna do format FS=Fat32.\n\n170\n00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:30.940\nMy label here on this one,\nI'm going to label it.\n\n171\n00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.700\nAgain, labels are important,\nas you can see.\n\n172\n00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.569\nEspecially when you're in and\nout of disk part,\n\n173\n00:08:34.569 --> 00:08:36.722\nyou can't tell the disks until\nyou get into the volume.\n\n174\n00:08:36.722 --> 00:08:40.780\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and just call\nthis WinPE, so I can recognize it.\n\n175\n00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.933\nAnd we'll do a quick format.\n\n176\n00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.945\nNow, like I said, this is something\nthat might vary on the test, so\n\n177\n00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:49.630\nthat might look a little bit different.\n\n178\n00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.620\nThe next thing I'm gonna\ndo is assign it a letter.\n\n179\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.910\nAnd just for my purposes, what I'm gonna\ndo is I'll assign it the letter W, so\n\n180\n00:08:54.910 --> 00:09:00.210\nI can kinda remember that hey,\nthis is gonna be my WinPE volume.\n\n181\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.040\nSo we'll do assign.\n\n182\n00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.200\nMake sure I do that right.\n\n183\n00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.170\nLetter=W.\n\n184\n00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.599\nAll right and then you can see\nit's got a mounting point now.\n\n185\n00:09:08.599 --> 00:09:14.755\nAnd if I do a list of all again,\nwe should be good to go here.\n\n186\n00:09:14.755 --> 00:09:17.505\nAgain, we have the pre-requisites for\nwhat I need.\n\n187\n00:09:17.505 --> 00:09:19.396\nAnd I just kind of want to remind you,\n\n188\n00:09:19.396 --> 00:09:23.375\nthat's one of the reasons you can't\nturn around and just copy this VHD file.\n\n189\n00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:27.170\nIt would be very convenient if we could\ndo that cuz I've got 14 gigs here.\n\n190\n00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.968\nUnfortunately, because of\nthe file limitations of Fat32,\n\n191\n00:09:30.968 --> 00:09:33.913\nI can't just put that VHD file on there,\nright?\n\n192\n00:09:33.913 --> 00:09:35.170\nThat would be great.\n\n193\n00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.590\nOne USB drive hooked into a computer\nthat you wanna do data boot.\n\n194\n00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.380\nUnfortunately, now you have to use two.\n\n195\n00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.710\nAll right, now the next thing.\n\n196\n00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.820\nThis is where our deployment\nimage servicing manager comes in.\n\n197\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.140\nSo we're good with that.\n\n198\n00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.500\nI could exit out or\nI could red exit and we're done here.\n\n199\n00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.560\nNow the next thing that we're gonna do,\nand I want you guys to know this path.\n\n200\n00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.540\nWe've talked about the commands,\nwe've talked about the paths a little bit.\n\n201\n00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.280\nYou might ask yourself, well Wes,\nwhy do I have to know this path?\n\n202\n00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.870\nBecause the deployment image servicing\nmanager puts you in this location of\n\n203\n00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.010\nthe deployment tools.\n\n204\n00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.770\nAnd you might think damn well,\nthat's where you need to be right?\n\n205\n00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.332\nNo, okay, so keep that in mind.\n\n206\n00:10:13.332 --> 00:10:16.749\nThe first thing that we're gonna do here\nis we're gonna do our legendary CD...\n\n207\n00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:18.570\nWe're gonna back out one.\n\n208\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.150\nWe got the assessment and deployment kit.\n\n209\n00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:24.710\nWe'll do a DIR option, so you can see some\nof the different things that are in here.\n\n210\n00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.570\nWhat I really want is this one right here,\n\n211\n00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.370\nthe Preinstallation Environment,\nall right?\n\n212\n00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.850\nThe Preinstallation Environment's\ngonna give me the tools and\n\n213\n00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:33.880\nthe utilities I need.\n\n214\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.778\nSo we'll do a CD, and\nwe'll drop down to that.\n\n215\n00:10:36.778 --> 00:10:43.370\nAll right, and let's go ahead and\nsee if we can drop the font down on there.\n\n216\n00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.790\nActually, it's word wrapping,\nso it'll be easy.\n\n217\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.480\nYou'll have one line here.\n\n218\n00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.030\nNow the next thing that we're\ngonna do is use something.\n\n219\n00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.880\nAnd I'll go ahead and do a DIR cuz\nthis actually an executable in here.\n\n220\n00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.655\nYou'll see it as a command.\n\n221\n00:10:53.655 --> 00:10:58.270\nBut when you do your DIR, there's\nsomething that I'm looking for here.\n\n222\n00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.490\nTwo major commands that I want\nyou to be aware of for the test.\n\n223\n00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.570\nFirst one here is copype.\n\n224\n00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.520\nWhat that does is that takes your\nWindows Preinstallation Environment and\n\n225\n00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.140\ncopies the files from the Preinstallation\nEnvironment down here in Windows to\n\n226\n00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.170\nwhatever location you put it.\n\n227\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:19.970\nAnd that makes it so you can turn around\nafter that and run the MakeWinPE.\n\n228\n00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:24.488\nAll right, and we'll see a couple options\nthere coming up too because there's\n\n229\n00:11:24.488 --> 00:11:28.480\na couple different types of media\nthat you could make if you choose to.\n\n230\n00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.010\nAll right, so that being said, let's go\nahead and we'll clear our screen out.\n\n231\n00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.081\nCLS, that's right,\nwe're not in PowerShell.\n\n232\n00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:43.108\nAll right, so what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna do a copype, all right?\n\n233\n00:11:43.108 --> 00:11:47.327\nAnd we're gonna say amd64\ncuz this is a 64-bit.\n\n234\n00:11:47.327 --> 00:11:49.005\nAnd that's another thing to keep in mind.\n\n235\n00:11:49.005 --> 00:11:52.610\nIf you're in UEFI,\nthat's one of the benefits of the UEFI.\n\n236\n00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:56.060\nYou can make one, no I take that back,\nlet me say that the other way.\n\n237\n00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.382\nIf you're in BIOS,\nI can make a 32-bit WinPE disk for\n\n238\n00:11:59.382 --> 00:12:02.000\nboth 32-bit and 64-bit machines.\n\n239\n00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.600\nOne disk for both architectures\nif it's a BIOS firmware.\n\n240\n00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.800\nIf it's\nthe Unified Extensible Firmware Interface,\n\n241\n00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.760\nthe UEFI platform,\nit doesn't have that ability.\n\n242\n00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.330\nYou need to create two, a 32-bit\narchitecturepe or a 64-bit architecture.\n\n243\n00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.286\nI don't know why that is,\nbut that is the way it is.\n\n244\n00:12:17.286 --> 00:12:18.391\nSo keep that in mind too.\n\n245\n00:12:18.391 --> 00:12:19.942\nThey might ask you on the test.\n\n246\n00:12:19.942 --> 00:12:24.760\nYou have BIOS based systems, how many\nof these disks do you need to create?\n\n247\n00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.960\nWell if I got BIOS, I'll need one, right?\n\n248\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.580\nLeast amount of administrative effort,\nthey like to influence that or\n\n249\n00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.450\nthey like you to know what\nthe least amount of effort is.\n\n250\n00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:39.352\nIf I'm on UEFI systems,\nI need a 32-bit and a 64-bit pe disk.\n\n251\n00:12:39.352 --> 00:12:41.360\nSo we're going to say AMD 64 here.\n\n252\n00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.960\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nsay we're gonna copy it down to C:.\n\n253\n00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.190\nAnd we'll just call it WinPE_AMD64.\n\n254\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.210\nAnd notice it rifles off,\nit's copying all those files, right?\n\n255\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:59.510\nAnd you can see about 157 files copied,\nright?\n\n256\n00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.760\nAnd we're good.\n\n257\n00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:06.640\nNow what we've done is we've taken\nthe WinPE installation files and\n\n258\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.502\nwe've moved them down to this location.\n\n259\n00:13:08.502 --> 00:13:15.110\nIf I open up our File Explorer here and\n\n260\n00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:20.500\nwe drop down to C:, you can see that here\nare all the files to make that media.\n\n261\n00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.293\nNow the next thing that we're\ngonna have to do unfortunately,\n\n262\n00:13:24.293 --> 00:13:25.195\nwell not unfortunately,\n\n263\n00:13:25.195 --> 00:13:27.698\nI say fortunately there's a couple\ndifferent ways that you can do this.\n\n264\n00:13:27.698 --> 00:13:32.626\nIf you're in a deployment\nscenario where you're gonna be\n\n265\n00:13:32.626 --> 00:13:36.046\nrunning Windows Deployment Services,\n\n266\n00:13:36.046 --> 00:13:41.340\nyou have the option to make an ISO\nfile with this next command.\n\n267\n00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:47.140\nI could say for instance,\nif I do a MakeWinPE command and I do a /?,\n\n268\n00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.760\nyou'll see a couple of, oops, you'll\nsee them go right off the screen there.\n\n269\n00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.720\nLet's bring them back to the top there,\nso you can actually see them.\n\n270\n00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:01.710\nAll right, notice that we have UFD,\nall right, and we also have ISO.\n\n271\n00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:06.330\nWhat we're going to do is the USB\nflash drive, hence UFD there.\n\n272\n00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.258\nYou could also make the ISO format too.\n\n273\n00:14:08.258 --> 00:14:11.300\nAnd the good thing about the ISO format,\nit's like any other ISO.\n\n274\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.300\nI can take this Winpe ISO and I can put\nit up on the Windows deployment server.\n\n275\n00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.078\nAnd when our computers do a pixy boot and\nthey need to install an operating system,\n\n276\n00:14:19.078 --> 00:14:20.412\nthey'll reach out across.\n\n277\n00:14:20.412 --> 00:14:23.703\nAnd they'll grab that Winpe disk and\nload it up into RAM and\n\n278\n00:14:23.703 --> 00:14:26.869\nthen point themselves back\nto the image that they need.\n\n279\n00:14:26.869 --> 00:14:29.970\nFor this purpose, for native boot,\nwe're gonna do the UFD.\n\n280\n00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.310\nAll right, now it is important to\nkeep in mind that we went ahead and\n\n281\n00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.320\nformatted our thumb drive ahead of time.\n\n282\n00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.170\nYou got to be careful with this one.\n\n283\n00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:47.330\nI can tell you that if you have data\non that drive, it's gonna be gone.\n\n284\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.440\nSo make sure that you've\nbacked that data up before\n\n285\n00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.960\nyou do this next step that we're gonna do.\n\n286\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.444\nSo we're gonna do the make pe command,\nright?\n\n287\n00:14:54.444 --> 00:14:59.045\nAnd we're gonna give it the /UFD for\n\n288\n00:14:59.045 --> 00:15:05.380\nthe formatted flash drive,\nUSB flash drive.\n\n289\n00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.870\nAnd then we're gonna say,\nwell where's that architecture, right?\n\n290\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:16.187\nThat architecture is in C:\\\\Winpamd64.\n\n291\n00:15:16.187 --> 00:15:21.780\nAnd I'm gonna double check just to make\nsure on the volume letter there, it is w.\n\n292\n00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.630\nI always like to check.\n\n293\n00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.720\nYou don't want to put that in the wrong\nplace or like I said, unfortunately,\n\n294\n00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.490\nyou're gonna format all your information.\n\n295\n00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:32.694\nAnd we'll go ahead, Dan,\nwe already had this problem before, right?\n\n296\n00:15:32.694 --> 00:15:36.110\nThe administrative level command, right?\n\n297\n00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:40.470\nSo it's telling us, you need to\nbe an administrator to do this.\n\n298\n00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.880\nSo guys, let me go ahead and\npractice what I preach here and\n\n299\n00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.124\njump back to our deployment environment.\n\n300\n00:15:48.124 --> 00:15:52.520\nAnd we're gonna right-click on this and\nwe're gonna choose Run as administrator.\n\n301\n00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.106\nI should have done that to begin with.\n\n302\n00:15:54.106 --> 00:15:59.190\nAlways Run as an administrator when you do\nneed to run administrative tasks, right?\n\n303\n00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:05.270\n[LAUGH] Okay and let me make this\na little bit easier real quick to see.\n\n304\n00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.819\nBump that font up a little bit.\n\n305\n00:16:11.819 --> 00:16:13.260\nThere we go.\n\n306\n00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.183\nAll right, so we got the same thing here.\n\n307\n00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:18.245\nNow we're gonna go remember,\nCD back dot, dot, and\n\n308\n00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:23.060\nthen we're gonna do a CD back into\nthe Windows preinstallation environment.\n\n309\n00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.650\nAnd we're right back to\nwhere we were before.\n\n310\n00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:31.810\nMake the PE media command and\nagain forward slash, UFD, space.\n\n311\n00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.660\nAnd then we C colon and\nwe're gonna point it to WINPE.\n\n312\n00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.250\nAnd then the drive letter is W.\n\n313\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.070\nAnd notice what it's telling us here.\n\n314\n00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.880\nIt's telling you hey, it's gonna be lost.\n\n315\n00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.090\nDo you wanna proceed with this?\n\n316\n00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.200\nThis is your last chance to say,\nback up that data.\n\n317\n00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.780\nAnd now what it's gonna do,\nis it's gonna turn around and\n\n318\n00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.930\nit's gonna copy all of the win PE files.\n\n319\n00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.807\nThat we just brought out of\nthe preinstallation environment and\n\n320\n00:16:56.807 --> 00:16:57.612\nput it on C colon.\n\n321\n00:16:57.612 --> 00:17:00.081\nIt's gonna take all of those files and\n\n322\n00:17:00.081 --> 00:17:04.492\nit's gonna convert this USB drive\ninto something that we can boot.\n\n323\n00:17:04.492 --> 00:17:07.664\nSomething that we can put into\nthe machine that has no hard drive, well,\n\n324\n00:17:07.664 --> 00:17:10.526\nit has a hard drive, but\nit has no operating system on that drive.\n\n325\n00:17:10.526 --> 00:17:15.940\nAnd we can use it to then copy\nour VHD file down to the machine.\n\n326\n00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.990\nAll right, so, it says that we are,\nwe have some success here.\n\n327\n00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:26.330\nSo we are now pretty much ready and\nwe are set to implement our native boot.\n\n328\n00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:30.270\nNow, what we're gonna go ahead and\ndo is we're gonna get our machine.\n\n329\n00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:31.620\nI've got a machine off camera here.\n\n330\n00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.751\nWe're gonna go ahead and get that machine\nset up so that we can show you how\n\n331\n00:17:35.751 --> 00:17:39.970\nto finally, after all of these steps,\nimplement a Windows native boot.\n\n332\n00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:41.110\nSo we'll come back here.\n\n333\n00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.370\nJust as soon as we have that setup.\n\n334\n00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.960\nAll right, so we are back.\n\n335\n00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.010\nAnd the next thing that we're gonna do is\nshow you how to implement the native boot.\n\n336\n00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.610\nNow I've got a machine\nhere ready to go for us.\n\n337\n00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.970\nAnd as you see we'll go ahead and\nwe'll boot it up.\n\n338\n00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.480\nAnd it's gonna go into its BIOS phase and\nthe first thing it's gonna let us know is,\n\n339\n00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.360\nwell, there isn't an operating system.\n\n340\n00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.350\nKeep in mind we didn't do\nany magic tricks here.\n\n341\n00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.970\nWe formatted this hard drive and\nthere is not an, or\n\n342\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.510\nthere isn't,\nlet me say that a little bit different.\n\n343\n00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.930\nThere isn't an operating system on it.\n\n344\n00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.090\nSo if you remember,\n\n345\n00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.800\nwhat we did is we created the bootable\nWin PE disk slash USB drive.\n\n346\n00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.280\nSo we're going to go ahead,\n\n347\n00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.350\nand we're going to throw that\ninto the USB port, here.\n\n348\n00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.850\n>> Ever so gently.\n\n349\n00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:18.520\n>> Ever so gently.\n\n350\n00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.627\n>> And keeps it-\n>> And\n\n351\n00:18:19.627 --> 00:18:20.450\nI cannot wait until they go to USB-C.\n\n352\n00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.010\n>> Just right.\n>> I don;t have to worry about which way\n\n353\n00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.370\nis right side up now.\n\n354\n00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.570\nNow if we go back to this computer,\nwe'll go ahead and reboot it.\n\n355\n00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:31.040\nAnd one of the things you'll notice is\nthat it goes passed the BIOS screen and\n\n356\n00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.500\nyou'll see the traditional Windows logo.\n\n357\n00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.880\nNow that Windows logo is really\nthe Windows preinstallation environment.\n\n358\n00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.030\nKeep in mind it really is a memory\nresident operating system.\n\n359\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.160\nWhat's going on here is the USB drive is\n\n360\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.270\nthe light indicator is\njust going like crazy.\n\n361\n00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.750\nAnd it's taking the WinPE disk or\nimage if you will, and\n\n362\n00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.430\nit's throwing it into RAM so that we\ncan start to work with this machine\n\n363\n00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.820\nregardless of whether it\nhas an operating system.\n\n364\n00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.700\nNow, there's a couple of things\nthat we're gonna do here.\n\n365\n00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.010\nAnd I like the fact that WinPE\nactually has the drivers for\n\n366\n00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.060\nthe touch interface in here which is,\nI think, kinda cool.\n\n367\n00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.459\nA lot of times the touch\ninterface here won't work.\n\n368\n00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.539\nIn some machines, but for us,\nit actually works here and\n\n369\n00:19:09.539 --> 00:19:11.340\nwe can kinda bring that up a little bit.\n\n370\n00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.720\nAnd you guys,\ncan see that a little better.\n\n371\n00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.120\nSo, notice this, this says x, and actually\nI moved that a little bit too much there.\n\n372\n00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.770\nThere, here we go.\nNotice that it says x.\n\n373\n00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:19.370\nBut, what is x?\n\n374\n00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.640\nWhat's the x drive?\n\n375\n00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.120\nWell, that's the RAM drive.\n\n376\n00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.510\nThat's it throwing in into RAM here.\n\n377\n00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.940\nNow, that's not all we have to do, right.\n\n378\n00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.320\nWe've got another thumbdrive that\nwe're gonna use here in a second.\n\n379\n00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.940\nBut we gotta go ahead and prep this\ndrive to accept the operating system.\n\n380\n00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.510\nAnd that's where we're going to jump\nback into good old DISKPART here.\n\n381\n00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.690\nSo we'll jump back into DISKPART, and\n\n382\n00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:43.390\nI want you to keep in mind that\nthere's difference for BIOS and UEFI.\n\n383\n00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.880\nWhat we're doing is\nthe BIOS implementation.\n\n384\n00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.090\nGo out there to the tech net and\nyou can find things for your UEFI.\n\n385\n00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.730\nSo it is just a little bit different.\n\n386\n00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:55.246\nWhen you're using BIOS, then what you're\ngonna have to do is create 100 Meg system\n\n387\n00:19:55.246 --> 00:19:57.280\npartition, system partion for\nyour boot files.\n\n388\n00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.060\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll create that one.\n\n389\n00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.940\nAnd in fact, you know what,\nlet's go ahead and do this all the way.\n\n390\n00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.520\nLet's do this, the list disk.\n\n391\n00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.630\nWe have a couple in here,\nyou wanna make sure and\n\n392\n00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.400\nremember you're selecting the right disk.\n\n393\n00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:14.660\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll select sel disk 0 here.\n\n394\n00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.730\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nensure that it's clean.\n\n395\n00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.730\nWe'll wipe it away so\n\n396\n00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.530\nthere's nothing left there even though it\ndidn't have an operating system on it.\n\n397\n00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.740\nAnd now, we're gonna create that\nfirst 100 megabyte system partition.\n\n398\n00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.860\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\ndo create and remember,\n\n399\n00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.910\nI'm gonna do my part prime here,\nthat's partition primary.\n\n400\n00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.900\nYou can spell it out if you want.\n\n401\n00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.410\nNow we're gonna add something that we\nhaven't added in the past that you've seen\n\n402\n00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.740\nso far since we've been\nworking with DISKPART.\n\n403\n00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.160\nWe're gonna tell it what size and\nit gonna be a hundred megabytes and\n\n404\n00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.000\nit'll go ahead and as you can see it\nwill create that partition for us.\n\n405\n00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.200\nNow, we're gonna go ahead, next part, like\nDan said before, we create the partition.\n\n406\n00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.000\nPartition's created,\nnow we have to follow it up with a format.\n\n407\n00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.720\nSo we'll go ahead and\ndo our format option.\n\n408\n00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.290\nAnd it's really no different guys\nfrom what you've seen us do already.\n\n409\n00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:11.820\nSo we'll do file system equals NTFS and\nI'm gonna go ahead and label these.\n\n410\n00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.050\nKeep in mind what I'm labeling them.\n\n411\n00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:18.080\nIt could be a little bit different on\nthe exam for you, so just pay attention.\n\n412\n00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.350\nThis is one of those things that will\nchange depending on the scenario that they\n\n413\n00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.240\nput you in.\n\n414\n00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.550\nAnd most definitely gonna change for\n\n415\n00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.770\nthe scenario that you have\nthere in your company as well.\n\n416\n00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.210\nSo we'll file label=system.\n\n417\n00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.830\nAnd we'll make sure that\nwe do the quick option.\n\n418\n00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:38.620\nNow, the next one, that's got our system\npartition created, but we can't locate it.\n\n419\n00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.600\nRemember, we also have to assign a letter,\nso give it a mounting point.\n\n420\n00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:47.740\nSo what we're gonna do is we'll do assign,\nand we'll do letter=S.\n\n421\n00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:52.030\nJust so I know that's the system partition\nand I can find it a little bit easier.\n\n422\n00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.530\nNow that's got the 100\nmegabit system partition.\n\n423\n00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:57.160\nNow we're gonna let Windows use or\n\n424\n00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.795\nthis VHD use the rest of the hard\ndrive capacity for this VHD.\n\n425\n00:22:01.795 --> 00:22:04.600\nYou could chop this up\na little bit more if you want.\n\n426\n00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:10.320\nI'm just gonna go ahead and leave it\nsimple and format the rest of this drive.\n\n427\n00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.840\nWe'll do our create partition,\nand I won't be so\n\n428\n00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.310\nlazy, maybe it would be good if I'd be\nlazy, I'd be able to spell it easy.\n\n429\n00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.550\nPartition primary, all right and\n\n430\n00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:26.340\nthat just takes the rest of the leftover\nspace and creates partition.\n\n431\n00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.890\nWe've got to format this as well, and this\nis gonna be on an NTFS partition likewise,\n\n432\n00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:34.410\nso this is gonna be fs=ntfs.\n\n433\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.490\nThen label=, and I'm gonna go ahead and\nsay this is main cuz this'll be our main\n\n434\n00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:42.520\npartition where we're gonna\ndrop the VHD once we're done.\n\n435\n00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.120\nWe'll go ahead and run that.\n\n436\n00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.520\nNow because this is a 250 gig drive,\n\n437\n00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.880\nit could take a little\nbit to format this drive.\n\n438\n00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.440\nEven though you put the quick\noperation in there.\n\n439\n00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.020\nRemember that the difference\nbetween quick and\n\n440\n00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:00.100\nnot putting quick is it would also do\na check disc across this entire drive.\n\n441\n00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.120\nSo, depending on the size of the drive,\nit could take a while,\n\n442\n00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.030\nit could take a few minutes, it could take\nan hour, it could take a couple of hours.\n\n443\n00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.080\nAs you can see,\nthis is kinda churning along here.\n\n444\n00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:14.060\nSo what we're gonna do is use the TV magic\nand we'll come back just as soon as this\n\n445\n00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.320\nhas been formatted so\nwe can move on to the next step.\n\n446\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.610\nSo the format is done.\n\n447\n00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.790\nWe've got our main partition.\n\n448\n00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.465\nWe've got the partition created.\n\n449\n00:23:22.465 --> 00:23:24.540\nWe got NTFS applied to it.\n\n450\n00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:28.070\nNow the next thing that we did is took\nthat second USB thumb drive that we had.\n\n451\n00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.110\nAnd I've already plugged\nit into the computer.\n\n452\n00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:34.480\nAnd what we have to do now is take\nthe VHD that we put on that thumb drive.\n\n453\n00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.650\nAnd we're gonna copy it over to\nthe main partition on our machine here.\n\n454\n00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:39.660\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n455\n00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.450\nYou can see right here on the screen\nthis part says that it has completed\n\n456\n00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:44.270\nsuccessfully.\n\n457\n00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.790\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll exit out of this.\n\n458\n00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:47.480\nIn fact, you know what?\n\n459\n00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.680\nLet me get back into DISKPART.\n\n460\n00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.620\nI always like to know which\ndisks we're talking about.\n\n461\n00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:55.470\nEspecially when you're in\na RAM drive like this,\n\n462\n00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:00.500\nbecause you wanna be able to\ntell what the volumes are here.\n\n463\n00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.057\nSo let's go ahead and do a list vol.\n\n464\n00:24:04.057 --> 00:24:07.284\nAnd I can see that the VHD\ndisk is now in there.\n\n465\n00:24:07.284 --> 00:24:11.616\nRemember the one that we named and we put\nthat That virtual hard drive in there, so\n\n466\n00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:14.114\nit is C and\nthat's what we need to keep in mind.\n\n467\n00:24:14.114 --> 00:24:16.780\nIn fact you know what I'm\ngonna go ahead and do?\n\n468\n00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:21.060\nWhile we're back in here I do wanna\nassign a volume letter to both\n\n469\n00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.290\nthe main partition and\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n470\n00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:28.320\njust for my sake here I'm gonna\nchange it up just a little bit.\n\n471\n00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:34.090\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll select volume one here.\n\n472\n00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:38.830\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and assign\nthat a letter, we'll assign it letter M.\n\n473\n00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:44.190\nAgain we'll just keep it consistent,\nand if we do our list vol again,\n\n474\n00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.830\nyou can see there we are ready to go.\n\n475\n00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:55.160\nSo now I'm going to copy the VHD\nfile from C here if you will.\n\n476\n00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.380\nSo we'll go ahead and\ngo to C, whoops try it again.\n\n477\n00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:03.320\nAnd we're gonna do copy and remember that\ntest VHD file and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n478\n00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.800\ncopy it to well M.\n\n479\n00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.410\nNow, this is another one of those\njust like the copy command before.\n\n480\n00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.550\nIt doesn't give us a progress\nreport here at all.\n\n481\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:15.270\nSo we have no clue other than the fact\nthat I can look over and I can see\n\n482\n00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:20.390\non this little 16 gig thumb drive that\nthat activity light is going like crazy.\n\n483\n00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.490\nIts going to take about the same time\nthat it took before to copy it to it\n\n484\n00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.820\nto take it off of there and\nbring it back into this main partition.\n\n485\n00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.060\nSo were going to go ahead and\nuse the magic of TV and\n\n486\n00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.170\nwe'll come back just as soon\nas that copy is finished.\n\n487\n00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:35.780\nSo we've copied the file, the VHD\nfile over to the main partition and\n\n488\n00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.080\nnow the next thing we're gonna have to do\nis we're gonna have to copy the boot files\n\n489\n00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.330\ninside of the VHD but before we can\nuse the VHD we have to attach it.\n\n490\n00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.190\nSo we're gonna jump back to disk part.\n\n491\n00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:48.250\nSo let me go ahead and\nbring up the machine here in disk part.\n\n492\n00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:52.610\nI will tell you that there is one thing\nthat I did forget to do when we were\n\n493\n00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:53.810\ncreating the partitions.\n\n494\n00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:57.050\nRemember we also just created\nthe 100 meg partition and\n\n495\n00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.010\nwe created that main partition?\n\n496\n00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:03.100\nWell, it's very, very important in\nthis that you make sure that you make\n\n497\n00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.510\nthe 100 meg system partition active.\n\n498\n00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.710\nSo let's go ahead and jump back in and\nwe will do that here real quick.\n\n499\n00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.889\nWe're gonna do a list disk.\n\n500\n00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:18.870\nAll right, and I can see that\nI have my 250, 238 gig disk.\n\n501\n00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:23.910\nWe'll go ahead and\ndo a list volume, right?\n\n502\n00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.575\nAnd you'll see that we\nhave that 100MB partition.\n\n503\n00:26:27.575 --> 00:26:30.605\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nwhat I'm gonna do is.\n\n504\n00:26:30.605 --> 00:26:31.885\nOr volume Volume0.\n\n505\n00:26:31.885 --> 00:26:34.415\nThat's our 100MB partition.\n\n506\n00:26:34.415 --> 00:26:37.450\nWe're gonna work with that just\na little bit more cuz I wanna make sure\n\n507\n00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.170\nthat we mark it as active here,\nso we're gonna format it.\n\n508\n00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.490\nAnd we'll format it again with NTFS,\nand again the label you'll see,\n\n509\n00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:51.460\nwe're just gonna rename the label\nsystem again because it is very,\n\n510\n00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:56.500\nvery important that you make sure that you\nmark it as active or it's not gonna boot.\n\n511\n00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.290\nIt's gotta be an active partition.\n\n512\n00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.680\nAll right, and we'll do quick.\n\n513\n00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.740\nAnd the good thing about this one is,\ngotta select the volume first.\n\n514\n00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.180\nI'll do a sel vol 0.\n\n515\n00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.880\nNow should be able to\nre-run that format option.\n\n516\n00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.580\nWe'll run that, happens really quick.\n\n517\n00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:15.450\nAnd here's where a couple of things that,\nwell, one thing that I didn't do.\n\n518\n00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:17.570\nI didn't type active.\n\n519\n00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.070\nIt has to be an active partition.\n\n520\n00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.100\nThat's what it boots from.\n\n521\n00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.910\nBecause if you don't mark that, when you\nreboot the system it's going to say no\n\n522\n00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.020\ndrive found because it has\nto be the active partition.\n\n523\n00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:32.228\nLast thing I'll do is go ahead and\nreassign that letter s there,\n\n524\n00:27:32.228 --> 00:27:34.937\nassign letter s for that volume.\n\n525\n00:27:39.086 --> 00:27:40.730\nAll right, there we go.\n\n526\n00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:45.550\nNow we've got an active partition,\nwe've got it back to the letter s.\n\n527\n00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.530\nNow what we have to do is we have to\nattach our VHD that we moved over to\n\n528\n00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:50.890\nthe main partition so\nthat we can work with it.\n\n529\n00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:56.820\nSo we'll go ahead and\nthat main partition is drive letter e.\n\n530\n00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:02.380\nWe'll go ahead and do a select, sel vdisk.\n\n531\n00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:07.565\nWe'll do file equals and\nit should be an e.\n\n532\n00:28:08.575 --> 00:28:11.015\nAnd we'll do a backslash.\n\n533\n00:28:11.015 --> 00:28:12.505\nTest on one.\n\n534\n00:28:13.555 --> 00:28:16.585\nAnd now keep in mind, if you reboot WINPE,\n\n535\n00:28:16.585 --> 00:28:22.185\nyour drive letters will change so\njust keep that in mind.\n\n536\n00:28:22.185 --> 00:28:28.060\nAnd now it's selected and\nwe will attach that V-Disk,\n\n537\n00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.660\nthe virtual disk that we put\non the main partition there.\n\n538\n00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.760\nIt is attached, it's ready to go.\n\n539\n00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.240\nNext thing that we need to do, is we will\ngo ahead and assign it a mount point.\n\n540\n00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.700\nWe'll say assign letter V.\n\n541\n00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.180\nAgain gotta select it\nbecause you attach it.\n\n542\n00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.360\nAs we have seen doesn't mean that you can\nwork with it yet so we'll go ahead and\n\n543\n00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.320\ndo a select volume three,\nwhich is the VHD that we just attached.\n\n544\n00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.560\nSo we'll do sel vol 3.\n\n545\n00:28:53.560 --> 00:29:00.450\nHit Enter and\nnow we can do our assign letter v.\n\n546\n00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:01.070\nThere we go.\n\n547\n00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.880\nNow we've got a mounting point for it,\nand now, we're pretty much done with this\n\n548\n00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:09.210\npart, and what we have to do is we're\ngonna get into the v drive there, and\n\n549\n00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:13.200\nwe'll do a cd here,\nwe'll do windows\\system 32.\n\n550\n00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.990\nAnd that's where the boot files are.\n\n551\n00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.790\nAll right, so we'll get in here and more\nimportantly that's actually where BCD Boot\n\n552\n00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.040\nis, this utility that we're gonna\nuse to copy the boot files over.\n\n553\n00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.460\nAnd now we can fire up BCD Boot,\nwe can say bcdboot,\n\n554\n00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:34.650\nspace, where do you find those boot files?\n\n555\n00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:35.310\nWindows.\n\n556\n00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.180\nThat's where we want.\n\n557\n00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.570\nAnd the system partition.\n\n558\n00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.065\nThat's this next option.\n\n559\n00:29:39.065 --> 00:29:44.440\n/S says we're going to take the system\npartition and dump those boot files there.\n\n560\n00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.390\nWhere was that at?\n\n561\n00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:50.120\nThe system was, we said the letter S for\nthe volume here.\n\n562\n00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.210\nAnd then the next thing\nis the firmware platform.\n\n563\n00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.150\nWhat firmware platform are we using for\nthis?\n\n564\n00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:58.730\nIn this case, we're doing BIOS so\nFirmware platform is with a switch, f, and\n\n565\n00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:00.630\nthen followed with bios.\n\n566\n00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:02.030\nAnd we'll go ahead and run that.\n\n567\n00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.790\nAnd now, the boot files have\nbeen copied successfully.\n\n568\n00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:09.650\nNow, it's really just\na point as typing exit, and\n\n569\n00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:13.150\nyanking this USB thumb\ndrive when it does exit.\n\n570\n00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.030\nAnd what we'll hope to see here,\nwhen this reboots,\n\n571\n00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:20.070\nis that it's gonna actually boot\ninto a Windows operating system.\n\n572\n00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.870\nNow I can see that it's doing a little\nbit more than what it was before.\n\n573\n00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:25.730\nAnd you can see,\nI've got both of these drives so\n\n574\n00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:29.080\nwe know we're not using any\ntricks of the camera here.\n\n575\n00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.660\nBoth of these drives when p is\nno longer in this machine and\n\n576\n00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:37.300\nwe're now booting from to the operating\nsystem that we've just we if you\n\n577\n00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:42.490\nremember backing up we took VHD file and\nwe slip streamed applied an image to it.\n\n578\n00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:46.900\nWe now then took that VHD file,\nput it on the main partition here,\n\n579\n00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.640\nmade it bootable, and\nwhen we reboot it, that's native boot.\n\n580\n00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.660\nIt's getting it ready, it's loading\nthe operating system in RAM, and\n\n581\n00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.090\nwe're now going to be able to work with\na fully functional Windows 10 machine.\n\n582\n00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:00.390\nWe'll give it a second here, and you're\ngonna see it's gonna go through its OOBE,\n\n583\n00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:04.740\nit's out of box experience, which means\nwe now have a working operating system.\n\n584\n00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.390\nRight now what it's\ndoing in the background,\n\n585\n00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.700\njust like any other first install,\nit's detecting the hardware,\n\n586\n00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.270\nit's making sure that it can communicate,\nany driver that needs to, plug and\n\n587\n00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.780\nplay drivers that need to be loaded up,\nit's loading these up.\n\n588\n00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:20.730\nAnd, when this is all said and done, we're\ngoing to have a working Windows machine\n\n589\n00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:23.850\nwithout a parent operating\nsystem from a formatted drive.\n\n590\n00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.760\n>> Now, Wes, this is obviously\nreally cool stuff, right?\n\n591\n00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:31.720\nI love stuff like this where I'm able\nto kind of extend the capabilities\n\n592\n00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.056\nof my devices and\nWindows giving this opportunity for\n\n593\n00:31:35.056 --> 00:31:38.940\nus to add another operating system\nif we already have one on top of it.\n\n594\n00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.530\nWe've got the USB drives.\n\n595\n00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:44.280\nAll we need to do is walk through Wes's\nsteps and we are able to do that.\n\n596\n00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.590\nWes if I had an operating system on there\nalready would I still be able to do this?\n\n597\n00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:54.530\nAnd if I am, am I able to access\nthe operating system within that?\n\n598\n00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.520\n>> Absolutely yeah that's\none of the great things.\n\n599\n00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:01.309\nWith native boot it works whether you\nhave a parent operating system or\n\n600\n00:32:01.309 --> 00:32:05.948\nyou just have a no operating system\nlike in the case that we did here.\n\n601\n00:32:05.948 --> 00:32:09.201\nAll right let me go ahead and\nmake sure that this thing is booting up.\n\n602\n00:32:09.201 --> 00:32:13.059\nIt might be something to do with the touch\nscreen driver so We'll switch this\n\n603\n00:32:13.059 --> 00:32:16.694\naround here for a second, and let me see,\nit might be the touch screen.\n\n604\n00:32:16.694 --> 00:32:19.657\nYep, there it was, okay, so\nlet's see if we can get that back down and\n\n605\n00:32:19.657 --> 00:32:21.430\nwe can show you that, guys, real quick.\n\n606\n00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.670\nSo for some reason,\nit didn't like the flip.\n\n607\n00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:25.590\nThis is kinda like a hybrid tablet, and\n\n608\n00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.330\nit wanted to flip it back over to\nlike a laptop mode before it would\n\n609\n00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.830\nfinish the installation, so\nit's just hanging up on that.\n\n610\n00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.330\nBut, to answer your question there,\nDan, yes, you can.\n\n611\n00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:37.285\nIf I have a parent Windows Operating\nSystem I can do these same steps that we\n\n612\n00:32:37.285 --> 00:32:41.470\njust did minus the copying\nit over to a blank drive.\n\n613\n00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.600\nI can copy it to a folder inside of my\n\n614\n00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.310\ncurrently online running\nWindows Operating System and\n\n615\n00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:53.150\nthen perform the copying of the boot files\nover to the VHD drive like we did here.\n\n616\n00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.890\nAnd then reboot the machine and when we\nreboot the machine it's gonna give us\n\n617\n00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:01.050\na multi-operating system selection\nscreen just like duel boot would.\n\n618\n00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:03.870\nAnd we can pick which operating\nsystem we want to boot into,\n\n619\n00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.535\nwhether we want to boot into\nthe parent operating system, or\n\n620\n00:33:06.535 --> 00:33:09.755\nwe want to boot into the native\nboot guest operating system.\n\n621\n00:33:09.755 --> 00:33:13.465\nNow do keep in mind a couple of\nthings with the native boot.\n\n622\n00:33:13.465 --> 00:33:16.935\nIf you are inside of the parent operating\nsystem you can't use bit locker.\n\n623\n00:33:16.935 --> 00:33:20.372\nThe other thing is that some of the low\npowered features, like hibernation.\n\n624\n00:33:20.372 --> 00:33:22.262\nYou can't use hibernation,\nyou can use sleep.\n\n625\n00:33:22.262 --> 00:33:25.772\nSo, you do lose some of\nthe full capabilities like,\n\n626\n00:33:25.772 --> 00:33:28.334\nespecially your power\nmanagement that you had before.\n\n627\n00:33:28.334 --> 00:33:32.660\nBut right now I could go through this and\nif I wanted we could go through.\n\n628\n00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.130\nWe could finish the installation.\n\n629\n00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:35.300\nWe could accept the EULA.\n\n630\n00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.370\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nskip connecting to the network here.\n\n631\n00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:43.700\nAnd use our express settings like you seen\nus doing inside of the install when we did\n\n632\n00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.250\na clean installation or\nan upgrade installation.\n\n633\n00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:51.791\nAnd here we go, it's gonna ask\nme who do I want to use this PC.\n\n634\n00:33:51.791 --> 00:33:56.415\nYou can see a couple of the post\ninstallation options that\n\n635\n00:33:56.415 --> 00:34:01.350\nwe've already gone through\nbefore in past episodes there.\n\n636\n00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.560\nAnd here in a second it's gonna\nstart to build the profile.\n\n637\n00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.620\nSo there we have it,\nwe have a Windows native boot\n\n638\n00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.165\nwithout a parent operating system to\nbegin with from a blank hard drive.\n\n639\n00:34:10.165 --> 00:34:12.940\nBut now if we were in a production\nenvironment where we had to service this\n\n640\n00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.990\nimage, we could make our changes to it,\nthen turn around and\n\n641\n00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:18.340\ncopy the VHD right back up to\nthe production environment,\n\n642\n00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.950\nput it back on the Hyper-V server and\nwe're good to go.\n\n643\n00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:22.540\n>> Very cool stuff, Wes.\n\n644\n00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.720\nI know it seems like a lot\nof work to get here, but\n\n645\n00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.460\nsometimes this is exactly\nwhat you're gonna want to do.\n\n646\n00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.480\nMaybe you're troubleshooting and\nyou need to use this type of system to\n\n647\n00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.880\ntroubleshoot a system\nthat you keep offline.\n\n648\n00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.800\nTest beds, you name it,\nalways great cool stuff for\n\n649\n00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.270\nus to be able to do\noffline when we need to.\n\n650\n00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:45.340\nI know viruses, they love to infest\nan area so something like this\n\n651\n00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.700\nwould be perfect for trying to\ntroubleshoot those nasty little buggers.\n\n652\n00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:52.848\nThat being said Wes, it looks like we have\ncome to the end of another great episode.\n\n653\n00:34:52.848 --> 00:34:53.590\n>> That is right.\n\n654\n00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:55.990\n>> Well again it was a long\nroad to get here but\n\n655\n00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.890\nyou learned something really cool.\n\n656\n00:34:56.890 --> 00:34:58.150\nAt least I thought it was really cool.\n\n657\n00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:01.602\nAnd Wes did a great job of explaining\nto us so that we didn't get lost.\n\n658\n00:35:01.602 --> 00:35:02.310\n>> Thank you.\n\n659\n00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:03.630\n>> In all the skullduggery of it.\n\n660\n00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.690\nThat being said we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n661\n00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:08.030\nFor IT Pro TV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowry\n\n662\n00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.730\n>> And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n663\n00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:11.021\n>> And

great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.520\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.600\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with more installing and\n\n6\n00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.710\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n7\n00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.830\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto lend his expertise on that very topic,\n\n8\n00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.150\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.750\nWes, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.260\nSo glad to have you, and\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.200\n>> Man, it's going great, and\nit's always good to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.000\nThat's right,\nwe're coming back with more Windows 10.\n\n13\n00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.010\nJust when you thought there\nwas enough Windows 10.\n\n14\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.280\nIt looks like there's\nstill a little bit more.\n\n15\n00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.730\nIn previous episodes,\n\n16\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.500\none of the things that we looked at was\ninstalling your Windows operating system.\n\n17\n00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.494\nNow our next topic could\nbe pre-installation,\n\n18\n00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:48.870\ncould be post-installation.\n\n19\n00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.740\nEither or.\n\n20\n00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.510\nIt doesn't matter if you do this\nprior to installing Windows or\n\n21\n00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.940\nafter, you're still gonna have to be able\nto do a little bit of driver management.\n\n22\n00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.160\nNow when it comes to installing your\noperating system, I wouldn't wait to think\n\n23\n00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.095\nabout driver management until you're about\nready to install your operating system.\n\n24\n00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:09.335\nSo make sure that you do your research,\none of the things that you can do is,\n\n25\n00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:12.125\nyou can go up to Microsoft,\nthey have something called the TPL,\n\n26\n00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:14.265\nthe Trusted Products List.\n\n27\n00:01:14.265 --> 00:01:17.540\nSome of you guys might have remembered\nback from the Windows 7 days,\n\n28\n00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.640\nit was called the HCL,\nthe hardware compatibility list.\n\n29\n00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.970\nWell, that's just an old technology\nwith a new coat of paint over it.\n\n30\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.516\nThey've changed the name, but it's-\n>> Keep making it a little harder,\n\n31\n00:01:27.516 --> 00:01:28.130\nwhy don't you?\n\n32\n00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.050\n>> That's right, that's right,\nonce you get used to one acronym then they\n\n33\n00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.740\nturn around and they change\nthe acronym up on you again and again.\n\n34\n00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.800\n>> Of course they do.\n\n35\n00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.200\n>> It's just a new coat of paint over\na technology that's been around.\n\n36\n00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.160\nBut it is a place that you can go, you can\ngo up to the Windows compatibility center\n\n37\n00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.390\nand you can check it out to make sure\nthat if you are moving to Windows 10,\n\n38\n00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.950\nthe devices that you\nhave will be supported.\n\n39\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.520\nSo couple of things that\nwe're gonna look at.\n\n40\n00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.850\nI actually got a little diagram\nup here on my computer.\n\n41\n00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.510\nWhen we look at drivers,\n\n42\n00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.020\nthere's a couple things that we\nneed to take into consideration.\n\n43\n00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.250\nFirst of all, before we really even talk\nabout the different types of drivers,\n\n44\n00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.280\nI guess one we need to learn is\nthe architecture, x86 versus x64 drivers.\n\n45\n00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.772\nYou have a 32-bit operating system\nversus a 64-bit operating system,\n\n46\n00:02:13.772 --> 00:02:16.824\nkeep that in mind that,\nthat is going to be crucial.\n\n47\n00:02:16.824 --> 00:02:18.585\n32-bit with 32-bit, 64-bit with 64-bit.\n\n48\n00:02:18.585 --> 00:02:22.970\n>> Wes, what is the issue of proliferation\nbetween the two different architectures?\n\n49\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.660\nAre we still seeing a lot of 32-bit out\nthere or is it basically a 64 world?\n\n50\n00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.830\n>> That's a great question.\n\n51\n00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.060\nI would have told you, probably,\nthat all we have is 64-bit, right?\n\n52\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.810\nYou think about it.\n\n53\n00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.910\nYou want that gazillion gigabytes\nof RAM that it gives you access to,\n\n54\n00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.170\nactually it's not a gazillion,\nbut it is definitely up there.\n\n55\n00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.300\nIt's more than the systems\nwe have right now.\n\n56\n00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.290\nBut we still have some systems that\ndon't have a lot of memory, right?\n\n57\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.400\nWe have smaller tablets, x86 based\ntablets that don't have a lot of RAM,\n\n58\n00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.900\nmaybe only got four gigs of ram.\n\n59\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.670\nSo, there still is the tendency to see\nlike, maybe notebooks and stuff like that.\n\n60\n00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.195\nAnd if you do have some legacy devices\nout there as well that maybe are running\n\n61\n00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:07.510\n32-bit at least gives them an option, so\nunlike back in 2008 when Windows server,\n\n62\n00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.150\nI think that was the last year that\nWindows server, you could get any 32-bit.\n\n63\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.980\nAnd after that, they've been 64-bit.\n\n64\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.471\nYou might see three of the technologies\nthat we really worry about today.\n\n65\n00:03:18.471 --> 00:03:22.852\n32-bit, 64-bit, and ARM, ARM being\nthe tablature, or not the tablet,\n\n66\n00:03:22.852 --> 00:03:26.087\nexcuse me the, I think a guitar\nis here in the back, right?\n\n67\n00:03:26.087 --> 00:03:27.383\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n68\n00:03:27.383 --> 00:03:30.898\n>> But like the Windows RT tablets,\nyeah, you could still see them out\n\n69\n00:03:30.898 --> 00:03:35.092\nthere especially for some of them smaller\ndevices if you will, where they don't\n\n70\n00:03:35.092 --> 00:03:38.690\nwanna go ARM-based but they still\nwant some kind of low energy cost.\n\n71\n00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.950\nYou'll still see them out there.\n\n72\n00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.090\n>> Are all new devices 64-bits?\n\n73\n00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.080\nI wouldn't say yes to\nthat just because one of\n\n74\n00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.450\nthe things that we have, we see a trend\nin is all these different devices, right?\n\n75\n00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.560\nIn the days of just desktops and PCs,\nyou have a traditional tower here,\n\n76\n00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.359\nmaybe you have an all-in-one device I\nwould probably say you'd only see 32-bit\n\n77\n00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.550\nand then 64-bit, but\nthat's not really the case today.\n\n78\n00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.570\nWe have a lot of devices out there, the\ntablets, the surface tablets if you will,\n\n79\n00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.620\nand they come in x86 and x64 as well.\n\n80\n00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.660\nSo really just have to pay attention to\nthe device that you are supporting and\n\n81\n00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.060\nknow beforehand what the architecture is.\n\n82\n00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.870\nIt's very easy to find.\n\n83\n00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.450\nYou can find it in your\nsystem information.\n\n84\n00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.790\nNow, once you know what\nthe architecture is,\n\n85\n00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.450\nyou have to know a little\nbit about the drivers.\n\n86\n00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.080\nNow this is more for exam based.\n\n87\n00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.040\nA lot of times, we don't see this.\n\n88\n00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.020\nI don't know about you Dan, but if you've\ngot a network adapter that you've just\n\n89\n00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.220\nthrown in a machine and\nyou install Windows on it.\n\n90\n00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.630\nA lot of times plug and play will take\ncare of it for us in the background.\n\n91\n00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.564\nAnd if its not really a plug and\nplay device, let's say for instance,\n\n92\n00:04:43.564 --> 00:04:44.771\nlet's say you go up to Dell.\n\n93\n00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:50.828\nDell has a fairly good repository of\ndrivers that you need to download and\n\n94\n00:04:50.828 --> 00:04:52.010\ninstall.\n\n95\n00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.370\nWell they have an executable and\nthe executable,\n\n96\n00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.990\nthe exe, handles the extraction of all the\nfiles and puts it where it needs to be.\n\n97\n00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.020\nAnd a lot of times we don't see it.\n\n98\n00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.120\nBut for the exam,\nit is something that you need to know.\n\n99\n00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.560\nA little bit more about what goes on under\nthe hood when it comes to your drivers and\n\n100\n00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.940\nthat's where we get back\nto this diagram here.\n\n101\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.660\nWe have Kernel Mode Drivers, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.540\nAnd Boot Critical Drivers,\nthese are drivers that when\n\n103\n00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.470\nwe talk about something known\na a digital signature, right?\n\n104\n00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.250\nThat is a certificate, that they take and\n\n105\n00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.210\nthey put their software, they run\na little algorithm across it, right?\n\n106\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.420\nAnd it says okay, we know that\nthe drivers here haven't been altered, we\n\n107\n00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.070\nknow that they are supported, and that we\ncan verify that based on their signature.\n\n108\n00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.730\nWell when you have a Kernel Mode Driver,\nthis is a driver that sits down in memory\n\n109\n00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.730\nand if something happens in that portion\nof memory, down there in the kernel.\n\n110\n00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.540\nAnd what I mean by happening,\na corruption,\n\n111\n00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.730\na driver doesn't use the memory\nthe way it's supposed to,\n\n112\n00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.930\nwe could end up getting\nthe horrible blue screen of death.\n\n113\n00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.842\nAnd today it's the little\nsideways frowny face.\n\n114\n00:05:54.842 --> 00:05:57.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They've changed it a little bit,\n\n115\n00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.272\nmake it a little bit easier to look\nat even though they're still just as\n\n116\n00:06:01.272 --> 00:06:04.370\ndetrimental to your computing experience.\n\n117\n00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.407\nKeeping this in mind though,\n\n118\n00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:10.976\nwhat do we say when we say\nKernel Mode Drivers need to be protected.\n\n119\n00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:14.320\nWell every binary in\na Kernel Mode Driver is signed,\n\n120\n00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.550\nevery individual binary in\nthe driver package is signed.\n\n121\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.420\nAnd it's digitally signed by Microsoft.\n\n122\n00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.960\nAll right, if you are a developer,\nif you manufacturer,\n\n123\n00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.430\nyou gotta go Microsoft's\nhardware quality labs.\n\n124\n00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.310\nWhat they do is, they test your driver,\nthey run it through pretty rigorous tests.\n\n125\n00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.830\nI'm not exactly sure what the tests\nare that they're doing there.\n\n126\n00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.525\nIt's probably Area 51 for all I know.\n\n127\n00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:38.370\n[LAUGH]\n>> Just look at the old video of\n\n128\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.350\nthe the old spacemen, right the-\n>> That's it.\n\n129\n00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.483\n>> First,\nthey were bouncing him in a chair.\n\n130\n00:06:43.483 --> 00:06:45.378\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Shaking him back and forth.\n\n131\n00:06:45.378 --> 00:06:46.198\n>> That's the testing we're talking about.\n\n132\n00:06:46.198 --> 00:06:48.290\n>> Yeah the G-forces,\nwe get your drivers there.\n\n133\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.829\nAnd your face just goes,\nyou know, goldfish on you.\n\n134\n00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:55.648\n[LAUGH] There's a little bit of\na difference though between what's known\n\n135\n00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:57.390\nas plug and play drivers.\n\n136\n00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.840\nNow plug and play drivers,\nlet's understand first and foremost.\n\n137\n00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.690\nAll drivers need to be digitally signed,\nokay.\n\n138\n00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.400\nIt is the amount of signature, amount\nof protection that they put on them and\n\n139\n00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.280\nagain with the kernel mode and the\nembedded drivers here they have embedded\n\n140\n00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.180\nsignatures for\nevery binary in the driver package.\n\n141\n00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:20.350\nOn the other hand, P&P drivers, what they\ndo is they put a digital catalog file.\n\n142\n00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.490\nThat catalog file has a digital\ncertificate that validates\n\n143\n00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.570\nall of the files included in\nwhat's known as an INF file.\n\n144\n00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.795\nAn INF file is your driver file and what\nit does is it it tells the installer this\n\n145\n00:07:31.795 --> 00:07:35.615\nis how you install and these are the files\nyou need to grab to do the installation.\n\n146\n00:07:35.615 --> 00:07:40.015\nWell we've got digital signatures in each\none of those files in fact, let's go and\n\n147\n00:07:40.015 --> 00:07:41.015\ntalk about it a little bit.\n\n148\n00:07:41.015 --> 00:07:44.750\nLet's switch over to my machine here and\nI'll actually show you what we're talking,\n\n149\n00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.700\nwe'll get logged in here.\n\n150\n00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.644\nNow, I have a small, little file here.\n\n151\n00:07:50.644 --> 00:07:54.332\nAll right, and this is a little,\nyou can see this is an executable, right?\n\n152\n00:07:54.332 --> 00:07:58.559\nAnd you could see that it's Dell and\nit's a smart technology driver, right?\n\n153\n00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:00.283\nWell when we install drivers, right,\n\n154\n00:08:00.283 --> 00:08:02.647\na lot of times we don't have\nto do anything with them.\n\n155\n00:08:02.647 --> 00:08:06.140\nIf they're not plug and play, like this\none's gonna get down there in the kernel.\n\n156\n00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.580\nSo it's got an executable, and\n\n157\n00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:13.500\nthey've worked it out with Microsoft on\nhow the installer goes about this process.\n\n158\n00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.720\nBut I'm gonna kinda change\nthis up a little bit.\n\n159\n00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.900\nOne of the things that you could do if\nyou ever wanna see the drivers in here\n\n160\n00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.370\nis notice it has an EXE extension.\n\n161\n00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.750\nWell if I rename this, we'll go ahead and\n\n162\n00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.750\nwe'll put this to another extensions now,\nagain, be careful in modifying these.\n\n163\n00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.420\nSometimes it works, sometimes it\ndoesn't but now what I can do is I can\n\n164\n00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.530\nopen this and I can see all of the files\nthat are inside of this executable.\n\n165\n00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:44.439\nAnd what I really care about all right\nare some of these files right here.\n\n166\n00:08:44.439 --> 00:08:46.042\nYou see this CAT file here.\n\n167\n00:08:46.042 --> 00:08:48.290\nThat's our digital signature.\n\n168\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.030\nYou say, well,\nhow do we know it's a digital signature?\n\n169\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.920\nWell, there's two different kinds and\nyou know,\n\n170\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.930\nit kinda zoomed out there a little\nbit fast but you'll notice one.\n\n171\n00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.590\nWe got one that says 64.\n\n172\n00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.420\nWe got one that doesn't say 64.\n\n173\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.130\nSo Dan would you take a guess\nas to why one has 64 and\n\n174\n00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:05.440\none doesn't have a 64 on it?\n\n175\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.870\n>> I see where you're going there.\n\n176\n00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.155\nCuz he's talking about the architecture,\nright?\n\n177\n00:09:08.155 --> 00:09:08.672\n>> That's right.\n\n178\n00:09:08.672 --> 00:09:09.668\n>> One's for one and one's for the other.\n\n179\n00:09:09.668 --> 00:09:10.528\n>> And that's right.\n\n180\n00:09:10.528 --> 00:09:14.264\nWhen I say that hey we usually\ndon't get involved in this,\n\n181\n00:09:14.264 --> 00:09:18.300\nwe're not kidding and\nI mean also on the architecture level.\n\n182\n00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.360\nAnd you say, well Wes,\nwhat do you mean by that?\n\n183\n00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.240\nWell I want you to look here.\n\n184\n00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.310\nNotice that if I expand this out,\nthis Microsoft installer package.\n\n185\n00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.080\nThis was all in the executable\nby the way right guys?\n\n186\n00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.310\nWhat we did is we kinda\ntricked it a little bit.\n\n187\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.460\nWe said hey this is a ziped file now so\nwe can actually look inside and\n\n188\n00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.030\nsee what's there.\n\n189\n00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.580\nBut it's also the x86 and\nx64 installer and\n\n190\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.300\nin the background that executable\ncould take care of that for us.\n\n191\n00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.434\nBut getting back to the cat file,\nthat's another and it's [INAUDIBLE].\n\n192\n00:09:47.434 --> 00:09:50.220\nSorry about the acronyms guys\nlet's be a little more specific.\n\n193\n00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.111\nYou've got enough acronyms to\ndeal with out there, [LAUGH].\n\n194\n00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:54.110\nThat's the catalog file, right?\n\n195\n00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:58.460\nAnd if I click on this,\nall right, notice what it does.\n\n196\n00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.280\nIt opens up Dan have you ever\nseen a dialogue box where\n\n197\n00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.040\nthe last says catalog or not have you ever\nseen a dialogue box like this before?\n\n198\n00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.020\n>> No I can't say I have.\n\n199\n00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.118\n>> All right well [CROSSTALK]\n[LAUGH] well that's okay.\n\n200\n00:10:08.118 --> 00:10:13.440\nThis is a traditional file that you\nwould see and things like HTTPS right?\n\n201\n00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.930\nWe've seen things like,\n\n202\n00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.950\nlet me see that this website is\nsecure that I'm going to right?\n\n203\n00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.960\nAnd a lot of times it would give you\nan option to view the signature right?\n\n204\n00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.550\nWell let's go ahead and\nlet's view that signature.\n\n205\n00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.950\nLet's see where this driver or\nwhere it was signed by.\n\n206\n00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:34.330\nNow kinda hard to see there, let me\nscroll over just a little bit there and\n\n207\n00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.420\nkinda zoom in there.\n\n208\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:40.360\nNotice it says the Windows Hardware\nCompatibility Publisher, right?\n\n209\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.660\nWell, this is a driver that\nhas been sent to Microsoft,\n\n210\n00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.500\nit's submitted to Microsoft,\nand it's been digitally signed.\n\n211\n00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.250\nRight?\n\n212\n00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.750\nNow how do I know that it's\nbeen digitally signed?\n\n213\n00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.070\nWell I can view the certificate.\n\n214\n00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.200\nAll right, so in this cat file,\nwe also have the digital certificate.\n\n215\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.990\nNow you probably seen one of these once or\n\n216\n00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:04.600\ntwice where again if you go to like\nhttps site, you wanna verify, right?\n\n217\n00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.080\nThat the web server like your\nbanking account information, right?\n\n218\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.120\nIf I go to Bank of America,\n\n219\n00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.040\nI'll be able to verify that that\nwebsite is coming from Bank or America.\n\n220\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.211\nWell that's really not too much different\nwhen you think about something.\n\n221\n00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:21.664\nYou know a component inside your operating\nsystem that's gonna get down in there, and\n\n222\n00:11:21.664 --> 00:11:25.754\nit's gonna, interact with the core\nfunctionality of your operating system.\n\n223\n00:11:25.754 --> 00:11:28.440\nYou probably want to be\nthere to verify that,\n\n224\n00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.710\nwell that actually did come from\nsomebody with a good reputation.\n\n225\n00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.210\nAnd it's not a rootkit\ncuz you think about it.\n\n226\n00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.370\nWhat do drivers do?\n\n227\n00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:40.910\nDrivers intercept calls down from\nthe operating system and translate that\n\n228\n00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:45.270\ninto the low binary language that\nour hardware needs to interact with.\n\n229\n00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.520\nWell, guess what?\n\n230\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.290\nRootkits do the same thing,\nthey intercept calls coming down\n\n231\n00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.392\nfrom the operating system and\nthey basically do whatever they want.\n\n232\n00:11:52.392 --> 00:11:56.450\nSo we wanna make sure that these\nare verified and validated.\n\n233\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:01.510\nNow, I can also see who it was issued to,\nall right.\n\n234\n00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.080\nNow, this is kinda like Microsoft\nsaying why should you trust this?\n\n235\n00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.494\nWell because we told you so.\n\n236\n00:12:05.494 --> 00:12:08.750\n[LAUGH] So keep it mind,\nit's signed by Microsoft.\n\n237\n00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.030\n>> So\nbasically what you're saying is typically,\n\n238\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:16.020\nwe do not go into these settings, and\nlook to see who has trusted or untrusted.\n\n239\n00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.610\nMicrosoft has a list of trusted things,\nand when you go to install it,\n\n240\n00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.400\nit sees that it's trusted and\nallows the installation.\n\n241\n00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.580\nIt's only when we encounter something that\nit doesn't know about, it's like, hey,\n\n242\n00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.720\nwe need to take a look at this.\n\n243\n00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.840\n>> Absolutely,\nthat's a great way to put it.\n\n244\n00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.669\nI mean, just think about you go to\ninstall something that you think's fixing\n\n245\n00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:33.288\nyour computer.\n\n246\n00:12:33.288 --> 00:12:37.392\nAnd you can't validate where it came from,\nwell how do I know that,\n\n247\n00:12:37.392 --> 00:12:39.850\nthat's not virus come lately, right?\n\n248\n00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:44.136\nHack Me Johnny out there has\nslipstreamed into whatever,\n\n249\n00:12:44.136 --> 00:12:48.030\ninto this package,\nsome kind of malicious code.\n\n250\n00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.950\nThe other thing, too, Dan,\n\n251\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:52.910\nthat sometimes is not thought about is\nhow about transmission errors, right?\n\n252\n00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.915\nIf you guys have seen any of our shows and\nif you're aware of network communications,\n\n253\n00:12:56.915 --> 00:12:59.262\nyou know that network\nissues happen all the time.\n\n254\n00:12:59.262 --> 00:13:02.734\nI mean a lot of times that's what's\nkeeps us in with a job, [LAUGH].\n\n255\n00:13:02.734 --> 00:13:05.846\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is that network transmission errors can\n\n256\n00:13:05.846 --> 00:13:06.800\nhappen, right?\n\n257\n00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.180\nWhen you're downloading maybe a piece\nof software that's got a little hashing\n\n258\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.000\nalgorithm that verifies that that software\nis exactly what they put up there.\n\n259\n00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.780\nWell that's kind of what this does too.\n\n260\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.750\nAnd we could see things like\nthe Certification Path.\n\n261\n00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.840\nNow like I said guys you need\nto know this for the exam.\n\n262\n00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.831\nKnow the signatures that know\nthat signatures have to be there.\n\n263\n00:13:27.831 --> 00:13:30.606\nThere's a couple different\nways that you can see this.\n\n264\n00:13:30.606 --> 00:13:33.546\nThat's one of the ways that you\ncan see this and by the way,\n\n265\n00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:35.990\nlet me show you here guys,\nthe thumbprints.\n\n266\n00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.900\nSee the different files that we were\ntalking about, one of the things I\n\n267\n00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:44.050\nmentioned is that the cat file will\nhave a digital signature for every\n\n268\n00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.510\nsingle one of those files that's in there,\nwell, here are your thumbprints, right.\n\n269\n00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:49.260\nYou can see them.\n\n270\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.660\nYou can see the algorithms that\nactually caught that created this and\n\n271\n00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.710\nyou can see the overall\nalgorithm to the file itself.\n\n272\n00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:00.260\nSo, with the plug and play drivers, you\ncan see here that they do go through some\n\n273\n00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:06.750\npretty great lengths to make sure that\nonly legitimate software gets inside of\n\n274\n00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.900\nthe operating system, especially when it\ncomes to communicating with your hardware.\n\n275\n00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.840\nSo that's a little bit\nabout the the cat file,\n\n276\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.170\nthe difference between the kernel mode and\nthe boot critical drivers.\n\n277\n00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:22.960\nI will mention one thing,\nas we'll see in later episodes,\n\n278\n00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:28.330\nthere is another driver that works\nunder the context of security.\n\n279\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.930\nAnd that's called ELAM,\nthat's a Early Launch Anti-Malware driver.\n\n280\n00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:32.940\nNow what does that do?\n\n281\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.920\nThat means when our operating system\nstarts, the first thing that happens is\n\n282\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.570\nthis driver checks the integrity\nof your system drivers.\n\n283\n00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.460\nMake sure cuz where do rootkits go?\n\n284\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.453\nRight?\nRootKits usually get their sales down in\n\n285\n00:14:44.453 --> 00:14:48.881\nthe earliest portions of the boot\nphase and it's very hard to detect.\n\n286\n00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:52.644\nSo, that's another driver that's there and\nI just mentioned that in the context,\n\n287\n00:14:52.644 --> 00:14:53.282\nthe drivers.\n\n288\n00:14:53.282 --> 00:14:57.050\nNow, we've looked at the 32 bits.\n\n289\n00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.290\nNoticed there, like we mentioned that 32\nbit cat file and the 64 bit cat file,\n\n290\n00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.970\nwe viewed a little bit of\ndigital signatures here.\n\n291\n00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.035\nBut let's go a little bit farther.\n\n292\n00:15:06.035 --> 00:15:10.175\nLet's find out a little bit\nmore about whether these\n\n293\n00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:14.925\ndrivers are digitally signed or they\nare not digitally signed by a software,\n\n294\n00:15:14.925 --> 00:15:18.565\na piece of software, little program that\nruns in your computer called sigverif.\n\n295\n00:15:18.565 --> 00:15:22.307\nNow that it's interesting,\nwhen I run Sigverif, it's going to say\n\n296\n00:15:22.307 --> 00:15:25.067\nSignature Verification is what you\nwould think that that utility is,\n\n297\n00:15:25.067 --> 00:15:28.807\nSignature Verification, but it's\nactually File Signature Verification, or\n\n298\n00:15:28.807 --> 00:15:32.240\nwhat files are we looking for\nthe signatures to be verified.\n\n299\n00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.710\nWell we have probably guessed it, there\nare some of those signatures right there.\n\n300\n00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.120\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's pull up our trusty PowerShell here.\n\n301\n00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.685\nAnd here we go,\nmake it a little easier to see and\n\n302\n00:15:45.685 --> 00:15:51.950\nlet's run something known as sigverif,\nthat's S-I-G-V-E-R-I-F.\n\n303\n00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.582\nIt is an executable.\n\n304\n00:15:53.582 --> 00:15:58.400\nPowerShell today and command prompt is\nsmart enough that you don't have to put\n\n305\n00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.029\nthe exe on it if you don't want but\nyou can.\n\n306\n00:16:01.029 --> 00:16:06.800\nNow, when I run this you can see,\nto help maintain the integrity.\n\n307\n00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.657\nAll right, that's one of the things I\nreally haven't mentioned up to this point.\n\n308\n00:16:09.657 --> 00:16:14.280\nI’ve been talking 15 minutes about drivers\nbut why do we want it digitally signed?\n\n309\n00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.340\nWe've mentioned viruses and\nstuff like that but also the integrity.\n\n310\n00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.810\nYou wanna maintain the integrity of\nthe system in these critical files and\n\n311\n00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.580\nwe need to make sure that\nthey're not corrupt, so\n\n312\n00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.610\nthe operating system is\ngonna run effectively.\n\n313\n00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.220\nNow there's a couple other\nthings that we can do.\n\n314\n00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.890\nWe can do some advanced if we want.\n\n315\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.270\nWe can save the file signature\nverification to a log.\n\n316\n00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:37.060\nAll right and\nwe could see the log itself if we want.\n\n317\n00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.011\nBut we'll go ahead, we'll just leave\nthose right there and we'll start this.\n\n318\n00:16:41.011 --> 00:16:44.160\nAnd you're gonna see then it\nreally doesn't take too long.\n\n319\n00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:51.190\nNow, if it happened to find any\nunsigned drivers in here it'd warn us.\n\n320\n00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.184\nNow, I did make mention,\nI said well wait a second,\n\n321\n00:16:54.184 --> 00:16:57.300\nall seven drivers need\nto be digitally signed.\n\n322\n00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.180\nSo, how would they find\nunsigned drivers in here.\n\n323\n00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.020\nWhile there is an advanced startup method\nthat allows you to disable drivers'\n\n324\n00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.470\nsignature enforcement,\nI don't recommend it.\n\n325\n00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.770\nIf you're a developer though,\nyou might need to use it.\n\n326\n00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:14.440\nSo just because we don't recommend\nit here doesn't mean that it doesn't\n\n327\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.770\nhave a suitable purpose.\n\n328\n00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:16.630\nAnd it does.\n\n329\n00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.950\nBecause what if I'm somebody like Dell.\n\n330\n00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:19.869\nWhat if I'm somebody like HP.\n\n331\n00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:23.913\nAnd I need to submit this driver over to\nthat Windows compatibility publisher that\n\n332\n00:17:23.913 --> 00:17:25.580\nwe just looked at.\n\n333\n00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.960\nWell, am I gonna just submit them?\n\n334\n00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.310\nI think it's a driver, I don't know,\nI haven't tested it, right?\n\n335\n00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:32.970\nWell how are you able to test it?\n\n336\n00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.750\nWell, you can boot in\nthe advanced options and\n\n337\n00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.710\nyou can disable driver\nsignature enforcement.\n\n338\n00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.280\nAnd in that case, it would allow\nyou to install an unsigned driver.\n\n339\n00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.100\nAnd I would do it for\nthe purposes of testing.\n\n340\n00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:47.010\nNow if I forgot that I had turned that\non and I ran this we might find some,\n\n341\n00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:52.050\nwe might find the fact that there is\na driver that has not been signed,\n\n342\n00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.520\nyet it has been installed.\n\n343\n00:17:55.058 --> 00:18:00.040\nAll right, now we also get the ability\nif we want to stage drivers.\n\n344\n00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.970\nThese plug and play drivers.\n\n345\n00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.850\nNow why would we want to stage a driver?\n\n346\n00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.110\nThis is part of driver management.\n\n347\n00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.795\nDan calls up and says Wes I need you to\ninstall that driver for that printer.\n\n348\n00:18:10.795 --> 00:18:13.580\nI'm not an administrator, Dan is.\n\n349\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.930\nI'll say, well Dan I'd love to do that for\n\n350\n00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.900\nyou but you gotta give me\nyour credentials to do that.\n\n351\n00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.360\nDan says absolutely not, right?\n\n352\n00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.090\nWe don't do that.\n\n353\n00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:23.900\nSo now Dan has to sneaker net or remote\nin whichever technologies we have and\n\n354\n00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.010\nhe has to install that.\n\n355\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:29.280\nWell what if you know, let's say,\nit's a printer, right?\n\n356\n00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.610\nPrinters we use them all the time,\nusers need to connect to them.\n\n357\n00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.909\nThey need to be able to download and\ninstall those drivers.\n\n358\n00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.330\nWithout administrator privileges.\n\n359\n00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:42.610\nWell, that's where a utility plug called\nplug and play comes in PnP utility allows\n\n360\n00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:47.600\nme to manage these drivers and\nput them in a stage location in order to\n\n361\n00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.190\nallow non-administrators\nthe ability to Install them.\n\n362\n00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.813\nSo a couple of things that we\ncan run when we look at PnP.\n\n363\n00:18:55.813 --> 00:18:57.470\nWe want to look at some of those drivers.\n\n364\n00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.530\nWe could run the PnP util.\n\n365\n00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.670\nAnd one of the great things is\nif you don't know the syntax\n\n366\n00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.200\nremember your forward slash question mark.\n\n367\n00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.267\nRight?\n\n368\n00:19:06.267 --> 00:19:09.660\nIt's really fairly basic, dash A is add.\n\n369\n00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.660\nYou'll see that E is enumerate.\n\n370\n00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:13.970\nLet me zoom in.\n\n371\n00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:18.685\nI would know some of these,\nnot all of them but,\n\n372\n00:19:18.685 --> 00:19:21.165\nI would definitely practice\nthis a couple of times.\n\n373\n00:19:21.165 --> 00:19:24.645\nLook at this command because it\ncould come up they might want you to\n\n374\n00:19:24.645 --> 00:19:30.062\nknow that a -a means add the driver,\n-d delete the driver.\n\n375\n00:19:30.062 --> 00:19:33.432\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's use this, oops,\n\n376\n00:19:33.432 --> 00:19:37.992\nlet's use this here one time and\nshow you what we're talking about.\n\n377\n00:19:37.992 --> 00:19:43.147\nIf I wanna know the drivers that\nare inside of the driver store.\n\n378\n00:19:43.147 --> 00:19:45.823\nAll right, well what's the driver store?\n\n379\n00:19:45.823 --> 00:19:50.176\nWell let's go ahead and pull that up so\n\n380\n00:19:50.176 --> 00:19:54.122\nwe can see in the command prompt and\n\n381\n00:19:54.122 --> 00:19:58.895\nat the same time we can\nsee here in the GUI.\n\n382\n00:19:58.895 --> 00:20:02.080\nAll right and,\nwe should have driver store.\n\n383\n00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:02.850\nAll right.\n\n384\n00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.270\nWell, driver stores\nare protected location.\n\n385\n00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.040\nAnything in the Windows,\n\n386\n00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.400\nespecially the system 32 folders\nare protected location, right.\n\n387\n00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.730\nNow if I wanna know the drivers\nthat are there, I can a pnp.\n\n388\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.530\nIf I can spell util that would be good.\n\n389\n00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.071\npnputil -e.\n\n390\n00:20:16.071 --> 00:20:18.675\nThat's short for enumerate,\nand what that means is,\n\n391\n00:20:18.675 --> 00:20:20.990\nshow me all those drivers\nin the drivers store.\n\n392\n00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.890\nWell, you can see,\nthere are quite a few of them.\n\n393\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.000\nLooks like there's a lot of printers and\nI'm working with virtualization too.\n\n394\n00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.040\nI might as well mention that Dan.\n\n395\n00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.640\nThat's why you see\na couple of VMware here.\n\n396\n00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.150\nBut what I don't see are any of these\n\n397\n00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:40.820\nfunky names we saw here earlier when\nwe looked at that driver before.\n\n398\n00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.950\nSo let me see if I open up.\n\n399\n00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.070\nOpen up another file explorer.\n\n400\n00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.212\nNice and clean here.\n\n401\n00:20:49.364 --> 00:20:53.548\nAll right and I'm into the same\nthing the driver location and\n\n402\n00:20:53.548 --> 00:20:56.843\nlook at all these weird file names,\nall right?\n\n403\n00:20:56.843 --> 00:21:01.428\nAnd if you notice, well, with all those\nweird file names, I only see oem this,\n\n404\n00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:02.050\noem that.\n\n405\n00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:05.240\nWell, when you add a driver to your driver\nstore, for the purposes of what they\n\n406\n00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.980\ncall staging a driver, so\nthat the non-administrator can use it.\n\n407\n00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.070\nIt's gonna rename them and that's another\nthing that I want you to pay attention on\n\n408\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.650\nthe test because on the test\nthey might not ask you that.\n\n409\n00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.320\nThey might say for\ninstance you're gonna stage a driver.\n\n410\n00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.590\nLet's go ahead and do that real quick.\n\n411\n00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.640\nShall we Dan,\nrather than just talk about it?\n\n412\n00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.553\nSo if I do the pnputil and I do a -a,\n\n413\n00:21:26.553 --> 00:21:31.645\nnow I need to name the path, right?\n\n414\n00:21:31.645 --> 00:21:37.875\nSo I could do c:\\Drivers and\nthen I can get in here.\n\n415\n00:21:37.875 --> 00:21:39.335\nAnd I've gotta network adapter.\n\n416\n00:21:39.335 --> 00:21:42.900\nI'll tell you what,\nlet me figure out what I got.\n\n417\n00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.540\nIn there real quick drivers.\n\n418\n00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.260\nI'm going to do a \"dir\" that's an Intel,\nit's what it starts with.\n\n419\n00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.611\nIt helps to remember the path of\nthe utility that your using or\n\n420\n00:21:52.611 --> 00:21:55.100\nto the driver that your using there.\n\n421\n00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:55.740\nThat does help.\n\n422\n00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:03.533\nAll right, so we're gonna do a pnputil -a.\n\n423\n00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:15.630\nAnd let's see here, give me one\nsecond remember what that file was.\n\n424\n00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:21.670\nThat's /driver/ and remember the INF file.\n\n425\n00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:22.920\nOkay?\nAnd that's the other thing.\n\n426\n00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.150\nThe INF file is the driver.\n\n427\n00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:25.460\nThat's what you want to keep in mind.\n\n428\n00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.110\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll stage this driver.\n\n429\n00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:33.270\nAll right, don't stage the CAT file.\n\n430\n00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.925\nThat won't work.\n\n431\n00:22:33.925 --> 00:22:37.340\n[LAUGH] And we'll go ahead and\nwe'll run this command.\n\n432\n00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:42.704\nNow notice that I said pnputil -a,\nfor add.\n\n433\n00:22:42.704 --> 00:22:45.790\nAnd then I pointed it to\nthe driver all right.\n\n434\n00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:50.310\nNow, when I run this,\nlet me go ahead and maximize that,\n\n435\n00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.660\nnotice that it says it happened\nsuccessfully, it's imported it.\n\n436\n00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.430\nSo what did it do?\n\n437\n00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.257\nIt took it out of a location\nthat I had access to,\n\n438\n00:22:59.257 --> 00:23:02.200\nit could be on a stored location as well.\n\n439\n00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.250\nAnd as an administrator like I said,\n\n440\n00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.430\nDan might need to do this if you wanted\nme as an non-administrator, right?\n\n441\n00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.360\nWe just put that into\na protected location.\n\n442\n00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.980\nAll right, well how do I know\nwhat driver I just staged?\n\n443\n00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.770\nWell that's where we need to\nkeep in mind your OEM numbers.\n\n444\n00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:22.180\nSo we're gonna do a pmputil,\n\n445\n00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:28.430\nwe can do a -e for enu.\n\n446\n00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:35.450\nAll right, now we get the lovely\njob of searching through here and\n\n447\n00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.800\nfiguring out which driver is\nthe one that we just staged.\n\n448\n00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.990\nNow the one that makes it\na little bit easier for\n\n449\n00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:46.510\nme is that it's a Dell system,\nthat's a Dell driver.\n\n450\n00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.730\nNow, that is the driver\nthat we just staged.\n\n451\n00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.215\nNotice how the extension changed.\n\n452\n00:23:52.215 --> 00:23:56.351\nOne of the things that they might ask you\non the exam is they might ask you the full\n\n453\n00:23:56.351 --> 00:23:59.494\nstep of staging the process to\ngo through staging a driver.\n\n454\n00:23:59.494 --> 00:24:02.554\nAnd if you remember if\nwe get back here and\n\n455\n00:24:02.554 --> 00:24:07.325\nI show you that inf File again,\nnotice the inf file extension.\n\n456\n00:24:07.325 --> 00:24:11.449\nDon't let the exam trick you up in\nthinking that when you stage the driver\n\n457\n00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:15.570\nwith the inf extension here in this IS,\nthis just happens to be the name of\n\n458\n00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:19.559\nthis driver, it'll be different\nto whichever one you're staging,\n\n459\n00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:22.450\nthat you would delete it the same way.\n\n460\n00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.250\nYou might think well,\nI staged it by that name,\n\n461\n00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.290\nlet me delete it by that name,\nand that's not the case.\n\n462\n00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:33.400\nWhen you stage a driver in that location,\nit renames it to OEM and\n\n463\n00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.840\nthen whatever the next sequential\nnumber is in your driver store.\n\n464\n00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.510\nSo you could also delete this driver but\nagain on the exam,\n\n465\n00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:45.664\npay attention because when you do\ndelete the driver, you can first,\n\n466\n00:24:45.664 --> 00:24:50.023\nuse your pmputil- e for.\n\n467\n00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.790\nScroll back up, and I just happen to\nknow that it's at oem13, be careful.\n\n468\n00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.790\nMake sure that you delete the right\ndriver, and that's what we're gonna do.\n\n469\n00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:04.245\nSo we're gonna just do pmputil -d.\n\n470\n00:25:04.245 --> 00:25:10.946\nAnd I'm gonna do oem13.inf.\n\n471\n00:25:10.946 --> 00:25:16.690\nAnd you'll notice here, shows us that the\ndriver package was successfully deleted.\n\n472\n00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:20.585\nSo you can stage drivers into\nthat protected location so\n\n473\n00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:24.430\nnon-administrators can go ahead and\ninstall those drivers,\n\n474\n00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.530\nmight be something that you do post\ndeployment, you can also slip stream it\n\n475\n00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:33.120\ninto a driver inside of an image.\n\n476\n00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.970\nAnd the image, if you're doing imaging and\n\n477\n00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:38.830\nyou're doing your deployment,\nimage doesn't have to be online, so\n\n478\n00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:43.195\nyou can also make this a little bit easier\nif you're doing image based management.\n\n479\n00:25:43.195 --> 00:25:45.935\nYou don't have to do it on an online which\n\n480\n00:25:45.935 --> 00:25:48.995\nin this case is an operating system\nthat we're currently working with.\n\n481\n00:25:48.995 --> 00:25:51.165\nSo there's a couple different\nways that you can do that, but\n\n482\n00:25:51.165 --> 00:25:55.710\npay attention to what the name\nis of the driver itself.\n\n483\n00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.185\n>> Yeah, important safety tip there.\n\n484\n00:25:57.185 --> 00:25:58.950\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, it really is.\n\n485\n00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.930\nYou don't wanna make the mistake and\nI've done it before,\n\n486\n00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:04.120\nI've make the mistake of actually\nuninstalling the print driver\n\n487\n00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.590\nwhen that's really not\nwhat I wanted to do.\n\n488\n00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.480\nSo we've seen the drivers that are in\nthe driver store, let's go ahead and\n\n489\n00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.200\ntake the time to actually put one of\nthe drivers ourselves into the store.\n\n490\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.960\nSo remember the reason\nthat we're doing this.\n\n491\n00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:23.280\nWe're gonna do this because the standard\nusers can't install drivers.\n\n492\n00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.455\nIt's common that we want them to be\nable to print to printers, right.\n\n493\n00:26:27.455 --> 00:26:31.415\nAnd certainly, Dan doesn't wanna\nhave to sneaker net to 50 to 60, 70,\n\n494\n00:26:31.415 --> 00:26:34.405\n100 different computers, all making sure\nthat because he's got the administrative\n\n495\n00:26:34.405 --> 00:26:37.385\ncredentials, those print\ndrivers get installed.\n\n496\n00:26:37.385 --> 00:26:39.805\n>> Actually that's how I get my\n10,000 steps every day, pedometer.\n\n497\n00:26:39.805 --> 00:26:41.170\n>> That's perfect.\n\n498\n00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.422\nThat's perfect, so\nwe are gonna ruin Dan's workout here,\n\n499\n00:26:44.422 --> 00:26:46.726\nwe are gonna make this\na little bit easier.\n\n500\n00:26:46.726 --> 00:26:48.263\n>> Thanks, I'm not fat enough.\n\n501\n00:26:48.263 --> 00:26:54.380\n[LAUGH] So, when you add a driver it's\nvery easy, remember some of the switches,\n\n502\n00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:58.000\nand really for the exam, you're gonna\nneed to know the some of the switches.\n\n503\n00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.360\nSo, this one is just as easy as a, a for\nadd, d for delete, e for enumerate, we\n\n504\n00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.330\nwere kinda joking around about that one, e\nfor view the drivers, no, it's enumerate.\n\n505\n00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.340\nSo we'll go ahead.\n\n506\n00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.520\nI'll tell you what, let me clear\nthe screen here so you guys can see.\n\n507\n00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.950\nI know it's kinda hard\nto see that out there,\n\n508\n00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:16.500\nthere we go,\nput it up towards the top of the screen.\n\n509\n00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.860\nWe're gonna do a pmputil,\nand we'll do our -a and\n\n510\n00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.980\nwe're gonna do, where I put those drivers.\n\n511\n00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:30.250\nHopefully this is the location, drivers,\n\n512\n00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.830\nand then we've got a couple\nof different files in here.\n\n513\n00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:38.860\nRemember that you want the inf file,\nthe CAD file is what the plug and\n\n514\n00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:43.000\nplay utility is gonna look here and\nsay yeah, that driver is digitally signed,\n\n515\n00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.290\nwe'll go ahead and we'll install,\nwe'll put it into store for you.\n\n516\n00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.340\nSo we don't want the CAD file,\nwe want the inf file.\n\n517\n00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:56.280\nAnd when you run it, you might see here\nthat it really wasn't too bad, right?\n\n518\n00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:01.100\nIt's not too hard,\nmore the path of the driver is the hard\n\n519\n00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.440\npart about this command, the switches,\nthey made it pretty plain and simple.\n\n520\n00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.194\nYou can see processing inf file,\nthe inf file that we named\n\n521\n00:28:09.194 --> 00:28:14.150\nhere in the driver package,\nand it was added successfully.\n\n522\n00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:18.200\nNow notice the published name,\nthis is something that I wanna just\n\n523\n00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:23.230\nmake mentioned because of the fact\nthat on the exam, they might\n\n524\n00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:27.860\ngive you a scenario in which they want you\nto do one of these staging the drivers.\n\n525\n00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:33.900\nAnd you stage the driver by its original\nname, in this case, this one's ISCTD.inf.\n\n526\n00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:38.140\nBut then they want you to delete the file\nand that might be another step that,\n\n527\n00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:42.460\nas they say sometimes in their exams\nrepresents a complete solution, so\n\n528\n00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.070\nnow you need to delete it.\n\n529\n00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.420\nWell, on that exam, I'm not sure if it'll\nhappen, but you could get a delete,\n\n530\n00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.410\nand they give you this file name.\n\n531\n00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:52.870\nThat's not the way the plug and\nplay utility works.\n\n532\n00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.140\nOnce it's staged,\nit goes by its published name.\n\n533\n00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.015\n>> Well that's intuitive.\n\n534\n00:28:57.015 --> 00:28:59.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's exactly it, right.\n\n535\n00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.230\n>> Thanks a lot.\n\n536\n00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.650\n>> If it's supposed to be called,\nI don't know,\n\n537\n00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.945\nnetwork adapter,\nMicrosoft's gonna call it peanut butter.\n\n538\n00:29:05.945 --> 00:29:07.413\n[LAUGH] But, oem13.\n\n539\n00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:08.519\n>> And you have to know that for the test?\n\n540\n00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:09.103\n>> Sadly, yes.\n\n541\n00:29:09.103 --> 00:29:11.775\n[LAUGH] So what we have to do here is,\n\n542\n00:29:11.775 --> 00:29:16.400\nwe have to verify that the driver\nwas staged successfully.\n\n543\n00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.518\nAnd again, this is easy, as well.\n\n544\n00:29:19.518 --> 00:29:24.840\nIt's pnputil -e,\nit's what we used earlier.\n\n545\n00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:29.220\nAnd that what we are looking for\nis that 13 here.\n\n546\n00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.270\nSo we go scroll back through the list and\n\n547\n00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.420\nsure enough I can see\nright there is our driver.\n\n548\n00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.260\nWe can see that it's system devices,\nand remember the CAD\n\n549\n00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.950\nfile that we've been talking about,\nthe signature that's so important here?\n\n550\n00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.240\nWell, guess what.\n\n551\n00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.440\nNotice what the plug and\nplay utility does.\n\n552\n00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:51.610\nIt shows you the driver date and\nthe version that is\n\n553\n00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:57.220\nalso verified by the CAD file that\npossesses the digital signature.\n\n554\n00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.250\nSo we see all of that in\nthe driver package, and\n\n555\n00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.940\nall I did was stage the inf file.\n\n556\n00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.140\nThe inf file contains the entry, says go\nhere, look here, look here, look here,\n\n557\n00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.170\nlook here, this is what you're\nlooking for, and then it stages it.\n\n558\n00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.650\nNow, here's the other thing\nthat I wanted to make mention.\n\n559\n00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:15.520\nRemember when you're deleting a driver\nthe the other step of the process might\n\n560\n00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.140\ntrick you up on the exam.\n\n561\n00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.700\nWe look for that driver, that, in our\ncase, in this example it's oem13.inf, and\n\n562\n00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.460\nthen that's what I want to uninstall.\n\n563\n00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:30.310\nWell, I say uninstall, delete,\nit isn't technically installed yet.\n\n564\n00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:34.940\nWhat would happen is if, Dan had me\nnow connect to a printer it'd say,\n\n565\n00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:40.385\nwe see that printer driver and it wouldn't\neven prompt me to install the driver,\n\n566\n00:30:40.385 --> 00:30:44.690\ncuz I'm a standard user,\nI'm a non-administrative user.\n\n567\n00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:47.380\nSo it's not technically installed,\nI wanna make sure that I'm clear on that.\n\n568\n00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:53.450\nSo now we're gonna do a -d, and\nit's very simply going to be\n\n569\n00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:58.782\noem13 in this case, because that was the\nnext sequential number in the stack here.\n\n570\n00:30:58.782 --> 00:31:02.600\nLet me zoom down in on that so\nyou guys can see that okay.\n\n571\n00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:08.752\nSo just pmputil -d oem13.inf and\nwe hit enter.\n\n572\n00:31:08.752 --> 00:31:13.020\nAnd you'll see here that it tells us\nthat it was successfully deleted.\n\n573\n00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:17.738\nNow, it's always a good thing to go\nback through and if you re-enumerate,\n\n574\n00:31:17.738 --> 00:31:21.980\njust to verify that the process\ndid delete that driver,\n\n575\n00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:28.660\nand if I don't find a 13 in here at all,\nwell, I know that the driver is gone.\n\n576\n00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:33.370\nSo that is a way that you can\nkinda get an idea and a feel for\n\n577\n00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:36.780\nthe drivers, knowing what's kinda\ngoing on behind the scenes and\n\n578\n00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.760\na lot of times we don't used this stuff.\n\n579\n00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.440\nIn fact Dan and\nI were talking about off camera here,\n\n580\n00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.670\nwe were saying well with looking\nat the driver signatures,\n\n581\n00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:49.050\nwhere is place in the field,\nthat you gonna actually see this?\n\n582\n00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:52.232\nWell, the only time you're gonna see\nthis when it's not digitally signed.\n\n583\n00:31:52.232 --> 00:31:57.220\nYour computer's gonna warn you,\nit's gonna say no, you can't install this.\n\n584\n00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.280\nThe good thing is the manufacturers in\nMicrosoft go this behind the scenes.\n\n585\n00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.975\nBut know from an exam perspective\nthis might be something that\n\n586\n00:32:02.975 --> 00:32:04.150\nyou see on the exam.\n\n587\n00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:08.330\nHowever Dan, I will say when it comes\nto drivers, we've got a lot more to do.\n\n588\n00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:10.470\n>> Yeah, we're not quite done\nwith this cookie right here.\n\n589\n00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:14.210\nSo we got a little more baking to do,\nthat means a part two is in our future.\n\n590\n00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.830\nWes, look forward to seeing you on that,\nyou've done a great job so\n\n591\n00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.195\nfar so I guess we'll have him back,\nright people?\n\n592\n00:32:19.195 --> 00:32:21.930\n[LAUGH] That being said, as for\nthis episode, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n593\n00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:22.900\nclose her down.\n\n594\n00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.610\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n595\n00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.340\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n596\n00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.592\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n597\n00:32:28.592 --> 00:32:34.815\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:20.070\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in\ntoday’s episode it's more installing and\n\n4\n00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.110\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n5\n00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.130\nTurning us back in studio again today for\n\n6\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.380\na part two on drivers,\nyour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.290\nWes, welcome back sir.\n\n8\n00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.060\nHow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.230\n>> It's going great and\n\n10\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.750\nthe first part we did a little bit\nin the graphical user interface.\n\n11\n00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.350\nI think we finished it up with a little\nbit of the command line if you will,\n\n12\n00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.690\nlooking at the PMP util but\n\n13\n00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.490\nthere are a couple of things\nthat we still wanna look at.\n\n14\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.130\nAnd there are things that\ncan come up on the exam and\n\n15\n00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.110\none of them that has been\nknown to come up on the exam,\n\n16\n00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.480\nat least it is in the objectives for\nwhat's known as the 76-98 exam is\n\n17\n00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.470\nknown a little bit about something called\nthe deployment image servicing manager.\n\n18\n00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.640\nWhich I will not try to say too many times\nduring this episode as you guys don't\n\n19\n00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.520\nneed to laugh at me but [LAUGH] we're\ngonna call it DISM from here on out and\n\n20\n00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.310\nthis is a great utility, it's so powerful.\n\n21\n00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.900\nMaybe some of you come from like\nback in the days of the Vista and\n\n22\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.290\nWindows 7 ming have remembered\nthat the utility code image X and\n\n23\n00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.180\na lot of the stuff that we're gonna do\nhere we could do in the days with image X\n\n24\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.710\nbut image X is really something that,\nit's kind of still around but\n\n25\n00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.980\nthey kind of park it in down in the\nbasement next to the red stapler, right?\n\n26\n00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.010\nThey don't really want many people\nare using it anymore in favor of the newer\n\n27\n00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.680\ntechnology.\n\n28\n00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.690\nSo when it comes to deployment image\nservicing manager, you're gonna say,\n\n29\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.500\nwell Wes wait a second.\n\n30\n00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.210\nI thought we were talking\nabout drivers and\n\n31\n00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.260\nwhat does imaging have to do with drivers?\n\n32\n00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.890\nWell we are talking about image servicing.\n\n33\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.660\nKeep in mind in the last part where\npart one of these drivers here.\n\n34\n00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.550\nWe were dealing real heavily in\nthe graphical user interface with\n\n35\n00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.890\nan operating system, but\nit had already been installed.\n\n36\n00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.630\nAlright, well you also need to know how to\nprovision driver packages inside of images\n\n37\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.540\nthat are what's known as offline, and then\nyou say, well what do you mean offline?\n\n38\n00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.940\nWell, they're just a file sitting out\nthere somewhere on your file share and\n\n39\n00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.350\nintermedia file store,\nwell, it's a web server,\n\n40\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.220\nmost likely a deployment server if you're\ndoing Windows deployment services.\n\n41\n00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.200\nAnd you may have to from time to\ntime provision a new driver package.\n\n42\n00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.450\nAnd it is something that we want you\nto be prepared for on the exams.\n\n43\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.380\nSo enough talk, I know I've talked already\nabout two or three minutes into this and\n\n44\n00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.230\nwe haven't showed you anything.\n\n45\n00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.680\nSo let's go ahead and dive right in here.\n\n46\n00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.720\nNow there's a couple of prerequisites\nthat you're gonna have to do prior to\n\n47\n00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.340\ndo what we're about to do right here so.\n\n48\n00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.250\nFirst of all,\nyou have to have your installation media.\n\n49\n00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.360\nAnd your installation media,\nif I do our DIR here,\n\n50\n00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.370\nyou're gonna notice that\nthere's an install.wim.\n\n51\n00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.130\nThat is the Windows image file,\nif you will.\n\n52\n00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.370\nAnd it comes off of your\ninstallation media.\n\n53\n00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.370\nNow that's the image that\nwe're gonna be working with.\n\n54\n00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.180\nMost likely if you're doing this with\nyour own standalone images in a corporate\n\n55\n00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.970\nenvironment, you probably got some\nkinda system that you've gone through.\n\n56\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.410\nWith some requirements,\nyou might have a template that you follow.\n\n57\n00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.810\nYour image is probably, for the most part,\n\n58\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.450\ngonna have a different\nname than install.wim.\n\n59\n00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.450\nBut that's the image that we're\ngonna be working with, and\n\n60\n00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.860\nyou can see the size of the file.\n\n61\n00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.500\nIt's a very compressed file, and\n\n62\n00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.390\neven though it's highly compressed\nit's still around 3 and a half gigs.\n\n63\n00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.500\nSo you could say that the operating\nsystems are becoming bigger and\n\n64\n00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.570\nbigger and bigger.\n\n65\n00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.340\nSo that's going to be the image that\nwe're going to be dealing with.\n\n66\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.160\nThe other thing that we need to make\nsure is, what we're going to do is,\n\n67\n00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.410\nsee this is just a file.\n\n68\n00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.360\nIt contains a complete operating system.\n\n69\n00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.940\nAll the packages and components that we\nneed to install the operating system.\n\n70\n00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.830\nIn fact when you go through the basic\ninstallation like we showed\n\n71\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.180\nyou on a previous episode.\n\n72\n00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.790\nThis is what it's using to\ninstall that operating system,\n\n73\n00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.270\nfresh installation on your device for\na fresh installation on Windows 10.\n\n74\n00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.750\nHowever, we can also use that to\ndemonstrate loading up drivers and\n\n75\n00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.430\nthat's what we're gonna do here.\n\n76\n00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.340\nNow the other thing is, since this\nis a file, what we're gonna do, and\n\n77\n00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.720\nto come from some of the other operating\nsystem worlds like Linux and Units.\n\n78\n00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.910\nThat's gonna be yesterday's news to you,\nright?\n\n79\n00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.300\nWindows, when we start getting\ninto the graphical user interface,\n\n80\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.900\npeople are gonna say what do you\nmean we need to mount a file?\n\n81\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.520\nWhat is this mounting you're\ntalking about on this file?\n\n82\n00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.910\nSo some of you guys, if you're\ncoming from other operating systems,\n\n83\n00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.590\nyou already know this.\n\n84\n00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.180\nBut we need to be able to work\nwith that operating system.\n\n85\n00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.630\nWe need to be able to work with a file\nstructure and before it's mounted,\n\n86\n00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.320\nit's just a file sitting there.\n\n87\n00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.660\nRight.\nWe can't really work with it.\n\n88\n00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.490\nSo that's what we're gonna have to do.\n\n89\n00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.570\nAnd as that second prerequisite, you're\ngonna wanna go ahead and make a folder.\n\n90\n00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.390\nSo that you can mount\nthis image to that photo.\n\n91\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.150\nAll right.\n\n92\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.520\n>> That may not be completely\ndevoid of any kind of\n\n93\n00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.260\nmounting when it comes to Windows system.\n\n94\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.520\nWe mount ISOs all the time.\n\n95\n00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.400\nI think it will be just like that, right?\n\n96\n00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.770\nIt's a type of an image that when\nwe show it to the computer and\n\n97\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.290\nwhen we mount it It's able to see as\nmuch like a CD or something like that.\n\n98\n00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.940\n>> No, that's great.\n\n99\n00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.220\nAnd then that's exactly it.\n\n100\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.090\nAnd along that line, is that gives us\nthe ability, it attaches the file system.\n\n101\n00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.730\nAnd gives it a structure that we cannot\nwork with which is exactly what we want\n\n102\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.590\nI'm going to go ahead and,\n\n103\n00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.950\nunderstand that the steps will\nbe unique to you environment.\n\n104\n00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.790\nWell not the steps I should say but the\nnames of the files and the images will be\n\n105\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.740\nunique to your environment however the\nsteps will be the same, and for the most\n\n106\n00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.030\npart, these are gonna be some of the steps\nthat could come up on the exam, too.\n\n107\n00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.560\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\ncreate a folder here.\n\n108\n00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.330\nSince we are in the Windows LAN,\nI'm gonna go ahead and use capitols.\n\n109\n00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.870\nWe don't have to worry about that here.\n\n110\n00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.410\nAnd make sure that that folder,\nI said file,\n\n111\n00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.780\nlet me make sure that we're\ncreating a directory.\n\n112\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.560\nAnd I now have one called Offline.\n\n113\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.860\nAll right.\nNow that's because we're gonna mount\n\n114\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.680\nthis install.win file right to that\nfolders so that we can work with it.\n\n115\n00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.690\nBut before we do that, let's get\na little bit of information about this\n\n116\n00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.330\nimage in general and make sure that it\nis the one that we want to utilize.\n\n117\n00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.310\nSo we're gonna type and I tell you what,\nI'll clear this screen here and\n\n118\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.750\nget this back towards the top so\nyou guys could see it.\n\n119\n00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.720\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna run our dism command,\n\n120\n00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.670\nand the first option or\nif you will parameter that we're\n\n121\n00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.510\ngonna run is Get-ImageInfo and then we\nhave to point it towards the image file.\n\n122\n00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.700\nNow the image file in this example.\n\n123\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.700\nIs at the root, it's on C: here so\nthe next switch that we're going to add is\n\n124\n00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.960\nimage file and it's going to be :C:\\ and\nI know that's kind of confusing but\n\n125\n00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.540\nremember, you're telling it the path.\n\n126\n00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.290\nSo you're saying image\nfile: that's the option.\n\n127\n00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.930\nNow, where's it located and\nit happens to be in C:\\ and\n\n128\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.650\nthen we're just going to type install.wim.\n\n129\n00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.980\nAll right, and this lets me know, well,\nam I working with the right image file?\n\n130\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.740\nBecause far be it from Wes to show\nyou how to mount an image that\n\n131\n00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.290\nmight be a Windows 8.1 operating system.\n\n132\n00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.210\nThat would do you no good\non a Windows 10 exam.\n\n133\n00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.930\nSo we definitely wanna make sure that\nwe have the right image file and\n\n134\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.530\nyou can see right here this is\nWindows 10 Enterprise Edition.\n\n135\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.640\nAll right, so\nwe've verified that it is the right image.\n\n136\n00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.070\nThe next thing that we have to do,\nis we have to actually mount the image so\n\n137\n00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.580\nthat we can,\nlike Dan was saying with the ISO file.\n\n138\n00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.470\nAnd you wanna be able to work with it,\nright?\n\n139\n00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.040\nWell you need to give it some\nkind of folder structure, and\n\n140\n00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.250\nthat's the process of mounting.\n\n141\n00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.610\nIt's gonna allow us\nthe ability to do that.\n\n142\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.560\nNow memorize the commands for\nthe exam guys.\n\n143\n00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.160\nBe able to pick out the components\nthat do certain things without\n\n144\n00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.130\nthe uniqueness of file names changing.\n\n145\n00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.410\nI dont know if that makes sense.\n\n146\n00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.000\nFile names are gonna change but\n\n147\n00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.860\nthe command stay the same so\nas a tip for the exam.\n\n148\n00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.670\nSomething that will help you out.\n\n149\n00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.483\nYou don't have to remember\nthe crazy long path right?\n\n150\n00:07:43.483 --> 00:07:48.650\nIf they've kept there either image file\nin C:/ windows backslash system32 and\n\n151\n00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.724\nthey got this long path,\nyou don't have to worry about the path.\n\n152\n00:07:52.724 --> 00:07:59.226\nJust remember that it's gonna be\nStarting out, dism /Mount-Image.\n\n153\n00:07:59.226 --> 00:08:00.028\nRight?\nOn an exam,\n\n154\n00:08:00.028 --> 00:08:01.792\nthat's gonna be the first thing\nI'm gonna look for, right?\n\n155\n00:08:01.792 --> 00:08:05.810\nI don't care of the crazy\nstring that's gonna follow.\n\n156\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.663\nFor instance, like I say image file.\n\n157\n00:08:08.663 --> 00:08:12.303\nRemember, colon-C-colon\nback,gotta put a c in there.\n\n158\n00:08:12.303 --> 00:08:14.789\nC colon, backslash, right?\n\n159\n00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:18.665\nAnd mine's easy cuz it says install.win,\nall right?\n\n160\n00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:22.725\nI tend to put that on C-colon, especially\nfor demonstrations, because it makes it\n\n161\n00:08:22.725 --> 00:08:26.285\na lot easier to type on camera,\nespecially with Wes' typing abilities.\n\n162\n00:08:26.285 --> 00:08:29.450\nBut on the exam now,\nit might be a little bit different, right?\n\n163\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.720\nOn the exam, they might have a long path.\n\n164\n00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.740\nI don't care about that path.\n\n165\n00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.730\nI want you guys to know that the first\npart of the command is dism space forward\n\n166\n00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.700\nslash Mount-Image and then ImageFile.\n\n167\n00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.270\nAll right.\n\n168\n00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.290\nNow, we've also gotta tell it we're\ngonna mount a directory, right?\n\n169\n00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.700\nFolders and directories, guys,\ndon't get those confused.\n\n170\n00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.935\nThey're the absolute same thing, right?\n\n171\n00:08:48.935 --> 00:08:52.800\nGoes back to the days when we only had\nCLI, the command-line interpreter, and\n\n172\n00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.260\nyou won't hit a directory, right?\n\n173\n00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.640\nWe got a GUI, now we got little\nmanila envelopes, or whatever, so\n\n174\n00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.580\nthey're called folders.\n\n175\n00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.960\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do a forward slash,\n\n176\n00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.410\nand this is gonna be MountDir.\n\n177\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:09.050\nRemember, if you can kinda speak\n\n178\n00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.850\nthe command out in your mind\nit might help you memorize it.\n\n179\n00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.720\nMount directory, MountDir, if you will.\n\n180\n00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.220\nAnd, again, this is gonna be c colon.\n\n181\n00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:21.350\nOr start with a colon first, remember\nthe parameter, colon, and then the path.\n\n182\n00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:28.706\nSo this'll be c:\\, and if you remember,\nwe created that offline folder.\n\n183\n00:09:28.706 --> 00:09:30.911\nAll right.\n\n184\n00:09:30.911 --> 00:09:36.140\nNow, the next parameter might get\na little confusing because you might say,\n\n185\n00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.650\nwell, Wes, if I was to tell you right now,\nif I was to say, okay,\n\n186\n00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.460\nguys, index tells you which image\nin the Win file you need to grab.\n\n187\n00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.965\nWhat?\n\n188\n00:09:45.965 --> 00:09:48.090\nDidn't you just say work with an image?\n\n189\n00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.700\nWell, the Win format is actually\na container that can contain\n\n190\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.320\nmultiple Windows images in it.\n\n191\n00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.872\nIt just happens that this is the basic\ninstall image, so there's only one.\n\n192\n00:09:57.872 --> 00:09:58.420\nAll right?\n\n193\n00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.930\nThe other one being one that we'll\ntalk about in some other episodes.\n\n194\n00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.200\nThat's a boot.win for\ncreating things like WinPE and stuff.\n\n195\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.930\nBut you might remember the days,\nDan, I don't know if you remember.\n\n196\n00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.870\nYou've done Windows 7 install once or\ntwice.\n\n197\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:11.720\n>> Yeah, a couple of times.\n\n198\n00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.160\n>> Sure, so\nwhen you got that installation media,\n\n199\n00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.870\nhow many operating systems\nin those days would you see?\n\n200\n00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.507\nJust give or take, you'd see like four or\nfive operating systems, right?\n\n201\n00:10:19.507 --> 00:10:22.205\nAnd you'd have to pick which one and\nsay, yes,\n\n202\n00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.920\nI chose the one I have a product key for,\nright?\n\n203\n00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.980\nWell, what do you mean?\n\n204\n00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.510\nFour or five operating systems.\n\n205\n00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.200\nEach one of those operating systems, and\n\n206\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.230\nVista was the same way, would have\nprofessional on there, it would have home,\n\n207\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.500\nhome premium, enterprise, well,\nnot enterprise, it would have ultimate.\n\n208\n00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.020\nAnd you would have to check off which\none that you were gonna install.\n\n209\n00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.480\nWell, that's because it's a win file\ncontaining multiple windows images.\n\n210\n00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.980\nWe don't have to worry about it too much,\nbut\n\n211\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.860\nI do want you to know the index parameter,\nespecially on the exam.\n\n212\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.620\nIf you're pointing to a specific\nWIM file that has multiple images,\n\n213\n00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.720\nyou have to have the index number so\nyou're telling Windows, or\n\n214\n00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.520\nin this case Dizum, which one to mount,\nand that's what we're doing here.\n\n215\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.190\nAll right.\n\n216\n00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.740\nLet me double-check that real quick and\nmake sure that we got it right,\n\n217\n00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.890\nwe'll go ahead and run that command and\nsee what we got here.\n\n218\n00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:13.701\nNow, when you're mounting an image\nit could take a little bit.\n\n219\n00:11:13.701 --> 00:11:17.770\nAnd remember what the purpose is.\n\n220\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.410\nWe've got to be able to work with\nthis in a hierarchical fashion, and\n\n221\n00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.880\nthat's what the mounting process does.\n\n222\n00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.470\nDoesn't look like it's\ngonna take too long here.\n\n223\n00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.940\nAnd then what we can do,\nis this would be essentially,\n\n224\n00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.780\nlet's say we didn't have Dizum.\n\n225\n00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.770\nLet's step back for a second, so\n\n226\n00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.460\nwe can figure out the heck\nwe actually using this for.\n\n227\n00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:41.160\nWell if we didn't have Dizum, then if I\nwanted to update a driver package inside\n\n228\n00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.710\nof an image file, what would I have to do?\n\n229\n00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.610\nI'd have to deploy it down to the machine,\ninstall it.\n\n230\n00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.320\nInstall then,\nthe drivers that I need, right?\n\n231\n00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.410\nAnd then I'd have to CIS prep the machine,\nlike we do all this stuff for deployment.\n\n232\n00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.090\nWe'd have to capture that image file.\n\n233\n00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.550\nAnd then we'd have to put that image\nfile back up on the deployment server.\n\n234\n00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.060\nBoy, isn't that a pain?\n\n235\n00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.945\n>> And that's typically how\nit's done actually, right?\n\n236\n00:12:01.945 --> 00:12:03.407\n[CROSSTALK] It's very common.\n\n237\n00:12:03.407 --> 00:12:04.120\n>> It can be.\n\n238\n00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.990\nAnd in small environments,\nI would say, yes.\n\n239\n00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.700\nIf you've got four or five computers,\nmaybe, yeah, probably.\n\n240\n00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.443\nOnce you start to get 10,\n20, 30, 40 computers, well,\n\n241\n00:12:13.443 --> 00:12:16.508\nit really boils down to image management.\n\n242\n00:12:16.508 --> 00:12:17.596\nNot so much the computers,\n\n243\n00:12:17.596 --> 00:12:20.210\ncuz I guess you're gonna deploy\nthe image down to the computers.\n\n244\n00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.290\nBut, yeah,\nthat is one way that they would do it.\n\n245\n00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.240\nThat's called an online servicing.\n\n246\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.630\nAnd I'm glad you asked that, too.\n\n247\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.300\nWhat we're doing is an offline servicing,\nso thank you for asking that, too.\n\n248\n00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:33.460\nOnline servicing is, Dan says, hey,\nWes, driver update just came out.\n\n249\n00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.390\nHe's doing patch management,\nmaybe he's in charge of it,\n\n250\n00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.850\nsays I need you to update image A,\nwhatever image A might be.\n\n251\n00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.730\nSo I pull it down to the machine,\nI install it on the hard drive, I update\n\n252\n00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.450\nthe driver package for whatever the new\ndriver is and then go through process of\n\n253\n00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.154\nsys prepping it, capturing the image and\nputting it back on the deployment server.\n\n254\n00:12:50.154 --> 00:12:54.140\nWell, wouldn't it be nice to not have to\ndo all those steps and connect to that\n\n255\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.900\nimage, lets say, stored on my deployment\nserver, WDS server out there, and\n\n256\n00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.090\nactually modify the file right there and\nnot have to pull it down,\n\n257\n00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.765\nnot have to install it, not have to\nturn around and Sysprep the image.\n\n258\n00:13:04.765 --> 00:13:06.150\nThere's another thing.\n\n259\n00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.980\nYou can only Sysprep an image three\ntimes before it's no longer good.\n\n260\n00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.180\nYou have to throw it out and start over.\n\n261\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.141\nI dont know where you throw it.\n\n262\n00:13:12.141 --> 00:13:14.620\n[LAUGH] You got to throw it out and\nstart over again.\n\n263\n00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.522\nSo, looks like our image mounting,\nlooks like it is finished here.\n\n264\n00:13:19.522 --> 00:13:21.420\nAll right, so what are we seeing?\n\n265\n00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:21.940\nAll right.\n\n266\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.650\nWell, if I do a dir, keep in mind that,\njust your dir command here,\n\n267\n00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.950\nI'm looking at the directory\nof my Windows install, right?\n\n268\n00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.820\nWe're talking about the Windows here\nthat's in the background when we say our\n\n269\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.140\nWindows install.\n\n270\n00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:37.850\nBut notice that it's this offline\nfolder here, directory that we have.\n\n271\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:45.030\nAnd if I do a change location\ninto offline, and now do a dir.\n\n272\n00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.240\nOops, dir, there we go.\n\n273\n00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.080\nAnd notice what I see.\n\n274\n00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.710\nI see the same folder structure\non installation of Windows.\n\n275\n00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:56.850\nWhy?\nBecause now we've taken this image and\n\n276\n00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:01.570\nwe've attached it to that folder and\nif I get down here, that's a command line\n\n277\n00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:06.340\ninterface, but if I get into\nthe graphical user interface and\n\n278\n00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:11.410\ndrill down into offline, almost looks\nlike a mirror image here, right?\n\n279\n00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.510\nI got program files out here,\nusers, and Windows.\n\n280\n00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:17.510\nThis is my local\ninstallation that's online.\n\n281\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:23.655\nMy offline folder, or directory, is now\nhosting the attached Windows image, right?\n\n282\n00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:25.685\nAnd I can go down in here.\n\n283\n00:14:25.685 --> 00:14:28.005\nFor instance, System32, if I want.\n\n284\n00:14:28.005 --> 00:14:30.934\nRemember we did this in the first episode,\nand we looked at the drivers and\n\n285\n00:14:30.934 --> 00:14:31.745\nthe drivers store.\n\n286\n00:14:31.745 --> 00:14:33.435\nI could see all that information.\n\n287\n00:14:33.435 --> 00:14:34.945\nAll that information's right here,\n\n288\n00:14:34.945 --> 00:14:39.960\nand it's the information that's\nin the install.wim image.\n\n289\n00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.800\nNow, that being said,\n\n290\n00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:48.030\nthat gets us ready to slipstream\na driver into this image, right?\n\n291\n00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:53.570\nAnd again,\nthis is called offline image servicing.\n\n292\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.600\nSo let's go ahead,\nland let's check that out.\n\n293\n00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.960\nAll right.\nSo now that I've got it attached, I can\n\n294\n00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.940\nnow say, hey, I wanna go ahead and what\nI wanna do is I wanna add that driver.\n\n295\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.030\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll use our Dizum option.\n\n296\n00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.060\nI tell you, Dan,\nI'm gonna get off the beaten path here,\n\n297\n00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.400\nbecause I do look at\nsome of my notes here and\n\n298\n00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.380\nI noticed that I didn't change\nthe path in some of the notes, so\n\n299\n00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.365\nthat might throw you off there,\nhere you might say where is he going here.\n\n300\n00:15:17.365 --> 00:15:18.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'll\n\n301\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.890\nget you back to the beaten\npath here in a second.\n\n302\n00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.874\nSo we gotta point to where the image is,\nall right?\n\n303\n00:15:23.874 --> 00:15:29.170\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe'll do forward slash image.\n\n304\n00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.520\nAll right.\nNow, a little bit different here.\n\n305\n00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.760\nNotice I didn't put an image file, and\n\n306\n00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.030\nthat might catch you on\nthe steps on the exam.\n\n307\n00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.115\nI'm gonna say offline, right?\n\n308\n00:15:37.115 --> 00:15:39.830\nCuz that's where the image\nis that it's mounted to.\n\n309\n00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:40.862\nAll right.\n\n310\n00:15:40.862 --> 00:15:42.755\nI tell you what,\nI'm gonna jump the gun here.\n\n311\n00:15:42.755 --> 00:15:45.835\nHow about we look at\nthe drivers that are currently,\n\n312\n00:15:45.835 --> 00:15:50.595\nbefore we even figure out if we need to\ninstall a driver, that's one of the things\n\n313\n00:15:50.595 --> 00:15:54.316\nI I love deployment image servicing\nmanagement, it is so fun.\n\n314\n00:15:54.316 --> 00:15:58.836\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna do a DISM here and\nwhile Dan ties a couple of\n\n315\n00:15:58.836 --> 00:16:03.055\ncinder blocks to my feet to slow\nme down a little bit there.\n\n316\n00:16:03.055 --> 00:16:05.540\n[LAUGH] Offline and you can do it.\n\n317\n00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.080\nGet drivers is what I meant to show\nbefore we actually start adding drivers.\n\n318\n00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.750\n>> So this is gonna show us all\nthe drivers we have available?\n\n319\n00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.960\n>> That's right because and\nagain kind of back to that scenario.\n\n320\n00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.110\nDan said, hey Wes, I need you to\nslipstream this driver package in\n\n321\n00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.510\nthere and maybe we're in the process\nof doing that to multiple images.\n\n322\n00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.490\nSo maybe we've already\ndone it to one image and\n\n323\n00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.830\nhe just says hey, image D now needs stats.\n\n324\n00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.890\nAnd well, I need to figure out,\ndid somebody get to it before I did?\n\n325\n00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.350\nAnd that's what this can do.\n\n326\n00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.380\nIt takes a second and\nthen what it does is it says okay,\n\n327\n00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:39.240\nI know we've mounted to that offline\nfolder, here's your drivers.\n\n328\n00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.317\nHere are the drivers that are there.\n\n329\n00:16:41.317 --> 00:16:45.283\nYou can see just like we showed you\nin the first part of this episode,\n\n330\n00:16:45.283 --> 00:16:47.560\nyou can see you OEMs, right?\n\n331\n00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.385\nThe publish names,\nI can see the provider, class.\n\n332\n00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:51.734\nThis goes by a good, so\n\n333\n00:16:51.734 --> 00:16:55.998\nif you ever to appoint from a group\npolicy you can always get this good and\n\n334\n00:16:55.998 --> 00:17:00.359\nattach it to like a group policy to\nidentify it as the type of driver it is.\n\n335\n00:17:00.359 --> 00:17:04.840\nSo we could say, yes, we already have\nsome drivers here in the driver store.\n\n336\n00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:09.290\nBut now we wanna add more, and then\nthat's where our next command comes in.\n\n337\n00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.200\nSo now that we'll do is we'll go ahead and\n\n338\n00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.700\nwe'll rerun the one that\nwe were working on before.\n\n339\n00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.990\nSo again that's dsm/image.\n\n340\n00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:20.805\nThis is gonna be :c:\\offline.\n\n341\n00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:24.070\nAnd again, because we have to tell it,\n\n342\n00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:28.100\nthis is where that image is that image\nis that we've mounted, all right.\n\n343\n00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:34.520\nAnd then we'll go ahead and\ndo our add-driver.\n\n344\n00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.030\nAnd then it's gonna ask me, well,\nwhere's the driver at that you wanna add?\n\n345\n00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:44.930\nSo we will say driver here and again this\nis for me, remember the password change\n\n346\n00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:49.000\nespecially on the exam that's something\nthat important to know, all right.\n\n347\n00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.400\nAnd we'll do intel and\n\n348\n00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.000\nI don't think it's gonna let me autofill,\nwhich would be nice.\n\n349\n00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.045\nNo autofill here.\n\n350\n00:17:56.045 --> 00:17:58.297\nSo we'll do intel-network-adapter.\n\n351\n00:18:02.397 --> 00:18:05.364\nAll right and then driver.\n\n352\n00:18:05.364 --> 00:18:09.767\nYour guys are gonna see this is the same\ndriver that we've been working with over\n\n353\n00:18:09.767 --> 00:18:11.286\nthe first part of the show.\n\n354\n00:18:11.286 --> 00:18:16.506\nAnd we'll do isctd.inf.\n\n355\n00:18:16.506 --> 00:18:18.440\nAll right,\nlet me just double check that real quick.\n\n356\n00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:25.540\nAgain dism,\nwe've got /image:c:\\offline /add-driver.\n\n357\n00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.562\nRolls right off the tongue, right?\n\n358\n00:18:26.562 --> 00:18:27.398\n/driver.\n\n359\n00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:31.040\nWe've told it where the driver is and\nwe're gonna go ahead and run that command.\n\n360\n00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.310\nNow when we run that command,\nit's going to look, it knows.\n\n361\n00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:40.090\nAnd it doesn't like my driver path,\nlet me just make sure.\n\n362\n00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.450\nVerify the files are located.\n\n363\n00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.370\nThis is one that we're gonna go ahead and\nkeep in the episode,\n\n364\n00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.300\nno TV time outs on this one for\na second here.\n\n365\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.750\nLets see why that didn't work.\n\n366\n00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:56.050\nIt's probably a typo, and\nI think, yeah, it is a typo, okay.\n\n367\n00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:00.587\nSo if you look here at the path here\nthat I've got Intel network adapter and\n\n368\n00:19:00.587 --> 00:19:04.320\nI can show you right\naway what the problem is.\n\n369\n00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.800\nNotice the driver path versus\nthe driver path that I told it.\n\n370\n00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.240\nSo I forgot directory.\n\n371\n00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.580\nLet's go ahead and\nwe'll try to type that the right way.\n\n372\n00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.620\n>> How about a WBE right?\n\n373\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.148\n>> That's right.\n\n374\n00:19:16.148 --> 00:19:16.683\n>> West Bryan.\n\n375\n00:19:16.683 --> 00:19:19.497\n>> That's a West Bryan, E-special [LAUGH].\n\n376\n00:19:19.497 --> 00:19:27.080\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so now it does help\nif you point it to the right driver.\n\n377\n00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:32.569\nNow let me double check here and\nmake sure that I get this path right,\n\n378\n00:19:35.019 --> 00:19:38.760\nOr, of course, it's not gonna work.\n\n379\n00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.600\nAll right, so we'll try that again and\n\n380\n00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.710\nwe'll see if the deployment\nimage servicing manager does\n\n381\n00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:51.410\na little better when you point\nit to the right driver location.\n\n382\n00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.839\nNow the great thing is, you should get it.\n\n383\n00:19:54.839 --> 00:19:59.799\nYeah, it's funny that I said, no edits\nhere on this one, no TV time-outs and\n\n384\n00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:03.250\nunfortunately yes,\nthere was a TV edit there.\n\n385\n00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.412\nNow, why was that?\n\n386\n00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:05.325\n>> Because you're a fat liar [LAUGH]?\n\n387\n00:20:05.325 --> 00:20:08.750\n>> That's right,\nit was all lies, I tell you.\n\n388\n00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.534\nOne of the reasons was, well, I tell you,\nif you're going to tell DISM where\n\n389\n00:20:12.534 --> 00:20:14.994\nthe driver is,\nmake sure you type the path right.\n\n390\n00:20:14.994 --> 00:20:17.305\nIn fact, I just went ahead and\nleft the error on the screen, so\n\n391\n00:20:17.305 --> 00:20:18.243\nyou guys can see it here.\n\n392\n00:20:18.243 --> 00:20:21.164\nAnd it says cannot find\nthe specified file.\n\n393\n00:20:21.164 --> 00:20:23.166\nAnd if we zoom in here, you can see why.\n\n394\n00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:25.651\nBecause I told you that\nthese driver files, right?\n\n395\n00:20:25.651 --> 00:20:31.456\nThey're .inf files and apparently,\nyou don't spell .inf with an r in it.\n\n396\n00:20:31.456 --> 00:20:34.398\nSo that didn't work and that's why it's\ntelling me that the path isn't right.\n\n397\n00:20:34.398 --> 00:20:36.176\n>> But-\n>> The f and the r create a diphthong,\n\n398\n00:20:36.176 --> 00:20:36.720\nsee [LAUGH].\n\n399\n00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.292\n>> That's right, and it is silent.\n\n400\n00:20:38.292 --> 00:20:40.660\n[LAUGH] So if I take off the silent r and\n\n401\n00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.710\nwe actually spell the path right,\nwe go ahead and hit enter here.\n\n402\n00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.310\nThen what it does is it looks and\nit finds that driver and\n\n403\n00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:51.480\nit says okay, lets go ahead,\nmake sure that it is digitally signed and\n\n404\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.530\nlets go slipstream it into the image.\n\n405\n00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:57.990\nNow if it wasn't digitally signed, one\nof the options that I could add here is,\n\n406\n00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.115\nand it's gonna to wrap, but\nit would be false unsigned.\n\n407\n00:21:01.115 --> 00:21:04.555\nAnd that will help me to get\naround that if I needed to.\n\n408\n00:21:04.555 --> 00:21:09.505\nNow we also have the ability while\nwe're connected to this image to\n\n409\n00:21:09.505 --> 00:21:12.195\nsee those drivers that\nhave been installed.\n\n410\n00:21:12.195 --> 00:21:15.945\nRemember, this was an Intel network\nadapter and we did the good drivers first,\n\n411\n00:21:15.945 --> 00:21:17.145\nwe only had a couple of drivers.\n\n412\n00:21:17.145 --> 00:21:20.725\nSo it should be fairly\neasy to see this driver.\n\n413\n00:21:20.725 --> 00:21:26.840\nNow In this one, we're gonna go ahead and\nsay dism /, and we're not\n\n414\n00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:31.060\ngonna use the image file, because we're\nactually already connected to the image.\n\n415\n00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:36.050\nSo we're just gonna say image:c:\nwhere we have it mounted,\n\n416\n00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.580\nand we're gonna say \\offline.\n\n417\n00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.460\nAll right, and\nthen we're gonna type a /, and\n\n418\n00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.252\nthen it is gonna be all\none command get drivers.\n\n419\n00:21:45.252 --> 00:21:47.830\nAll right, and\nwe will go ahead and run that.\n\n420\n00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.806\nAnd again what it does is it looks\ndown into that image and is says okay,\n\n421\n00:21:53.806 --> 00:21:56.888\nI see that there are some\ndrivers that are here.\n\n422\n00:21:56.888 --> 00:22:01.738\nAnd you will notice here we've\nnow added a third driver, right?\n\n423\n00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:03.483\nWe've got oem2.\n\n424\n00:22:03.483 --> 00:22:05.058\nNow you might say what do\nyou mean third driver?\n\n425\n00:22:05.058 --> 00:22:09.820\nIt's just 2, 0 accounts remember in\ncomputing so there's an oem0 as well.\n\n426\n00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:15.500\nNow what do we have to do to make sure\nthat this driver stays within our image,\n\n427\n00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.290\nwell we have unmount the image.\n\n428\n00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.770\nAnd this is important to remember this.\n\n429\n00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:24.380\nYou must commit the changes for\nthem to stay, all right?\n\n430\n00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:32.329\nSo what we're gonna do here is we're\ngonna say dism /unmount-image.\n\n431\n00:22:32.329 --> 00:22:35.430\nAll right and\nwe're gonna do a forward slash here.\n\n432\n00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:40.067\nWe've got our mount DIR option and\nwe're gonna say C:\\.\n\n433\n00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:46.921\nRemember that's offline and\nthen we gonna say /commit.\n\n434\n00:22:46.921 --> 00:22:52.068\nRemember when you're unmounting the image,\nyou want to run that /commit option.\n\n435\n00:22:52.068 --> 00:22:55.594\nIf you don't,\nthat's gonna discard the changes, so\n\n436\n00:22:55.594 --> 00:22:57.900\nyou do keep that in mind on the exam.\n\n437\n00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:04.135\nIf they ask you, how do you make sure or\nwhat is the third step in the process\n\n438\n00:23:04.135 --> 00:23:10.384\nif you will to making sure that the driver\nitself has stayed in that image?\n\n439\n00:23:10.384 --> 00:23:12.164\nMake sure that you run the commit option.\n\n440\n00:23:12.164 --> 00:23:15.126\nNow Dan,\nI could tell you this could take a bit for\n\n441\n00:23:15.126 --> 00:23:17.520\nthe actual committing of the changes.\n\n442\n00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.393\nBecause if you think,\njust like any file here in the background,\n\n443\n00:23:20.393 --> 00:23:22.652\nit's saving all these\nintricate little changes.\n\n444\n00:23:22.652 --> 00:23:26.285\nIt needs to update the metadata\nin the image package itself,\n\n445\n00:23:26.285 --> 00:23:29.429\nbut after a bit,\nyou'll see it'll run through it.\n\n446\n00:23:29.429 --> 00:23:30.891\nActually, it's going pretty fast.\n\n447\n00:23:30.891 --> 00:23:33.865\nDepending on the amount of changes you do,\nlike if you're adding a feature,\n\n448\n00:23:33.865 --> 00:23:34.754\nwhich you can also do.\n\n449\n00:23:34.754 --> 00:23:37.543\nWe'll show that a little bit\nlater in some other deployment\n\n450\n00:23:37.543 --> 00:23:39.119\nepisodes that we're gonna run.\n\n451\n00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:42.675\nIt could take awhile if you're\nadding a a language pack.\n\n452\n00:23:42.675 --> 00:23:45.639\nIf you let's say turning on, i don't know,\n\n453\n00:23:45.639 --> 00:23:50.720\nSMMP as a feature that's not enabled\nby default, it could take a little bit.\n\n454\n00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.665\nAnd then, once it saves it,\nit commits the changes.\n\n455\n00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:56.344\nThe next thing it does is it runs\nthrough the unmounting process, and\n\n456\n00:23:56.344 --> 00:23:57.093\nthen there you go.\n\n457\n00:23:57.093 --> 00:23:59.378\nYou could see it's starting now and\nreally,\n\n458\n00:23:59.378 --> 00:24:03.542\nagain the unmanning of the image shouldn't\nbe that, shouldn't take that long.\n\n459\n00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:07.441\nI would say watch the saving the image,\nthis might not be something that you wanna\n\n460\n00:24:07.441 --> 00:24:10.264\nstart at 5 o'clock and\nyou get out on 5:30 on Friday.\n\n461\n00:24:10.264 --> 00:24:13.906\nMight be something that you wanna start\nin the morning here, but that's it.\n\n462\n00:24:13.906 --> 00:24:18.400\nYou can see we've showed you how a little\nbit about the drivers themselves under\n\n463\n00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.701\nthe hood what you can see as\nfar as the digital signatures.\n\n464\n00:24:21.701 --> 00:24:22.708\nWhy it's important?\n\n465\n00:24:22.708 --> 00:24:25.882\nRemember a lot of time we don't\ninteract with this stuff, but\n\n466\n00:24:25.882 --> 00:24:30.045\nit is something from an exam purpose that\nyou might actually need to be able to do.\n\n467\n00:24:30.045 --> 00:24:33.589\nIf you wanna stage drivers, we've\nshowed you the plug and play utility,\n\n468\n00:24:33.589 --> 00:24:37.306\nhow you could stage that driver's\nnon-administrators if it is a driver that\n\n469\n00:24:37.306 --> 00:24:38.753\nis verified and you trust it.\n\n470\n00:24:38.753 --> 00:24:40.131\nThey can go ahead and install it.\n\n471\n00:24:40.131 --> 00:24:42.314\nWe don't have to get Dan\nwalking down sneakernet,\n\n472\n00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:44.307\nputting in his administrative credentials.\n\n473\n00:24:44.307 --> 00:24:46.560\nAnd then we've also shown you, well,\n\n474\n00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.154\nhow do I add a manage drivers if the image\nitself, if it is uninstalled, right?\n\n475\n00:24:51.154 --> 00:24:56.185\nAnd what we did is an offline\nimage servicing with DISM here and\n\n476\n00:24:56.185 --> 00:25:01.338\nyou can see now that looks like\ncould not be completely, okay?\n\n477\n00:25:01.338 --> 00:25:05.130\nSo might be some applications that still\nhave files open within the mounted\n\n478\n00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.390\ndirectory and then you could try\nto unmount process again here.\n\n479\n00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:13.091\nKeep in mind that the more you add to this\nfile, the longer the save could take.\n\n480\n00:25:13.091 --> 00:25:16.448\nBut for the most part,\nwe've shown you how to manage and\n\n481\n00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:19.673\nmodify the drivers inside\nof your operating system.\n\n482\n00:25:19.673 --> 00:25:21.870\nSo hopefully, you'll be a little\nbit more prepared for the exam.\n\n483\n00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.679\n>> Well Wes, I have learned more\nabout drivers and Windows than,\n\n484\n00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:27.233\nthis is Windows 10,\nthan I ever thought was possible.\n\n485\n00:25:27.233 --> 00:25:31.732\nSo thank you for increasing my depth and\nbreadth of Windows 10 and\n\n486\n00:25:31.732 --> 00:25:33.550\ndriver installation.\n\n487\n00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.890\nWhen it comes to that, hopefully you\nguys got the same thing as I did.\n\n488\n00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.947\nBut that being said, we have come to\nthe end of another very good episode.\n\n489\n00:25:39.947 --> 00:25:43.600\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off, ITPro\nTV, I've been your host Daniel Lowrie\n\n490\n00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.440\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n491\n00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.552\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n492\n00:25:46.552 --> 00:25:55.060\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.221 --> 00:00:10.221\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:13.624\nAll right, greetings everyone.\n\n3\n00:00:13.624 --> 00:00:16.730\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.010\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n5\n00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.910\nwe're continuing on with more Windows 10.\n\n6\n00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.680\nAnd leading the charge forward is\nour good friend, Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.210\nWes, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.510\nWe're so glad to have you today.\n\n9\n00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.550\n>> Thank you, and it's great to\nbe here as always with ITProTV.\n\n10\n00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.430\nThat's right, we are moving\nforward in our 70-698 series,\n\n11\n00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.950\nthe second exam for\nthe MCSA in Windows 10.\n\n12\n00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.170\nAnd in some previous episodes,\nwe showed you how to implement Windows,\n\n13\n00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.210\ninstall Windows.\n\n14\n00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.950\nAnd what we're going to be\nlooking at in today's episode is\n\n15\n00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.660\npost installation options.\n\n16\n00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.683\nAnd pretty much going to be walking\nyou around the interface, and some of\n\n17\n00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:55.670\nthe things that have changed from Windows\n8 and 8.1, that are relatively new.\n\n18\n00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.920\nWell, they are new to Windows 10.\n\n19\n00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.853\nSo that you guys will be\nfamiliar with the interface and\n\n20\n00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:03.112\nany questions that might come up on them.\n\n21\n00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:06.045\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nwe'll jump right in.\n\n22\n00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:09.310\nNow, one of the first things that\nthey call out is customization and\n\n23\n00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.550\nconfiguration, if you will.\n\n24\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.820\nAnd the first thing they talk\nabout is the Start menu.\n\n25\n00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.810\nSo we’re gonna go ahead, and we’ll start\nfrom the outside and work our way in.\n\n26\n00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.170\nWhen you look at the Start menu,\nI've got a Windows 10 machine here and\n\n27\n00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.200\nwe’re post install.\n\n28\n00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.687\nSome of the things that have been left\naround, you might have seen this in\n\n29\n00:01:25.687 --> 00:01:30.637\nWindows 8 and 8.1, is something known\nas the Administrative Quick Links.\n\n30\n00:01:30.637 --> 00:01:32.225\nAnd I actually like this feature.\n\n31\n00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:33.645\nI think it was a great feature,\n\n32\n00:01:33.645 --> 00:01:36.700\nespecially if you have to\nadminister to Windows machines.\n\n33\n00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.822\nYou can get to some of these things\nright on the desktop without having to\n\n34\n00:01:39.822 --> 00:01:43.262\nopen a door, that takes you to a door,\nthat leads you to another door, and\n\n35\n00:01:43.262 --> 00:01:45.557\nfinally you find\nthe utility that you need.\n\n36\n00:01:45.557 --> 00:01:50.420\nSo common things that we can open up,\nyou can see Programs and Features.\n\n37\n00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.870\nAnd we're not really going to look\nat each individual option here.\n\n38\n00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.920\nBut I would be aware of the fact\nthat you can launch a lot\n\n39\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.640\nof the common, core administrative\nfunctionality like Disk Management and\n\n40\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.170\nComputer Management,\nthose are two big things right there.\n\n41\n00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.590\nAnd Event Viewer is over here, but I like\nthings like System and Device Manager.\n\n42\n00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.590\nAnd that is good to be\naware of where those are.\n\n43\n00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.020\nNow the other thing that's relatively,\nwell, I say new.\n\n44\n00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.380\nIt's been around for\nabout 20 years with Windows, and\n\n45\n00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.180\nthen in Windows 8 they took it out.\n\n46\n00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.770\nAnd that's something call the Start menu.\n\n47\n00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.510\nWell, the Start menu, yes, is back.\n\n48\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.305\n>> Praise be the maker.\n\n49\n00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:31.060\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n50\n00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.748\n>> I missed the Start menu a lot.\n\n51\n00:02:32.748 --> 00:02:35.205\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, and that's the interesting thing,\n\n52\n00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:38.430\nI don't know if Microsoft\nwas really thinking.\n\n53\n00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.724\nI don't know exactly what they\nwere thinking when they took away\n\n54\n00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:41.322\nthe Start menu.\n\n55\n00:02:41.322 --> 00:02:44.386\nBut it's kinda like something\nyou get used to for 20 years.\n\n56\n00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:48.080\nAnd then all of a sudden, they released\nan operating system and it's gone.\n\n57\n00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.380\nAnd it kinda shell-shocked people,\nthey're not exactly where everything is.\n\n58\n00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.861\nSo I'm kinda glad to see it.\n\n59\n00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:57.338\nAnd I'm sure a lot of people out there,\nlike Dan, you can see him in\n\n60\n00:02:57.338 --> 00:03:01.331\nthe background as well [LAUGH] that,\nwe're glad to have the Start menu back.\n\n61\n00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:06.340\nNow, I will tell you that the Start menu\ntoday is kinda like a hybrid Start menu.\n\n62\n00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.100\nIt's a cross between what you\nwould have seen in Windows 8.1 and\n\n63\n00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.780\nin the previous editions, Windows 7,\n\n64\n00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.100\ngoing all the way back to Windows 95\nwhich is I think when it first started.\n\n65\n00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.374\n>> Yeah, Wes, I'm actually seeing\nsome tiles there on the screen,\n\n66\n00:03:21.374 --> 00:03:23.150\nremnants of Windows 8.1.\n\n67\n00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.890\nBut we also have the lovely, like I\nlike it, the actual Start menu area,\n\n68\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.920\nthe little squared-off area\nover to the left-hand side.\n\n69\n00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.670\nI like that a lot.\n\n70\n00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.940\n>> Absolutely, and it's a lot easier\nto work with your applications.\n\n71\n00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.560\nNow, Dan's mentioning these what\nthey originally called the Metro,\n\n72\n00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.360\nand then they changed it to the modern UI,\nWindows 8.1 apps.\n\n73\n00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.585\nAnd this is something that I\nactually [LAUGH] really like.\n\n74\n00:03:46.585 --> 00:03:50.580\nAnd one of the reasons I say that is\nbecause you might remember in Windows 8.1,\n\n75\n00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.560\nif you launch one of these Metro UI apps\nor modern UI apps, it would fullscreen.\n\n76\n00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.150\nAnd then your fullscreen is\ngoing to be just using this app.\n\n77\n00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.050\nWell, these are actually tiled,\n\n78\n00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.890\nthey look like a tile interface\njust like Windows 8.1.\n\n79\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.860\nBut if we launch one of these up,\nnotice that they,\n\n80\n00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.700\nI've got the ability to\nopen multiple of those.\n\n81\n00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.420\nThey call it the WinRT API, if you will.\n\n82\n00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.960\nBut I can open multiples of these today.\n\n83\n00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.490\nAnd they don't have to fullscreen and take\nup all the real estate on your desktop.\n\n84\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.480\nAnd you can get in and\nout of them fairly quickly.\n\n85\n00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.750\nYou can minimize them here,\nI'm gonna go ahead and close these.\n\n86\n00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.910\nBut just to show you again,\nyou can make them fullscreen if you want.\n\n87\n00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.570\nBut this is one of the things\nthat was kind of a big complaint\n\n88\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.741\nwhen Windows 8 came out,\nand then on in Windows 8.1.\n\n89\n00:04:38.741 --> 00:04:42.380\nAnd like Dan mentioned here too,\nyou can see some recently used items,\n\n90\n00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.550\nyou can also see the Admin.\n\n91\n00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.850\nIf you go ahead and\n\n92\n00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.870\nyou click on the Admin there, you'll\nget to things like the user profile.\n\n93\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.190\nIf we scroll down and go all the way\ndown to the All Apps down here,\n\n94\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.670\nyou'll see some common\nsettings like Power,\n\n95\n00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.440\nwhere you can shut your computer down,\nand then general Settings.\n\n96\n00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.230\nWe'll get into the Settings\na little bit more,\n\n97\n00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.080\nbecause I want to show you\nthe new Action Center.\n\n98\n00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.200\nBut you can see that they're\nin alphabetical order here.\n\n99\n00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.850\nAnd we can scroll through them, your\nWindows accessories, some of the things\n\n100\n00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.690\nthat have been in Windows for awhile,\nInternet Explorer there, Remote Desktop.\n\n101\n00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.340\nSo it has a new look to it, if you will.\n\n102\n00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.424\nBut it has some of the classic\nfeatures that we're used to,\n\n103\n00:05:28.424 --> 00:05:33.245\nwith a combination of still using\nsome of the more modern Windows Store\n\n104\n00:05:33.245 --> 00:05:36.366\ntype applications on the right-hand side.\n\n105\n00:05:36.366 --> 00:05:43.190\nSo pretty straight forward when it comes\nto getting to your Start menu today.\n\n106\n00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.030\nNow that being said, when we look at\nthe desktop, pretty much every bit of\n\n107\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.780\nthe desktop is configurable,\nmost to all aspects of the desktop.\n\n108\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.770\nIf we do a little what they call\nhover-to-discover here, we can see\n\n109\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.760\nthat the desktop tells us, just by\nhovering, what certain things can be done.\n\n110\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.530\nAnd some of the other\nthings that we can do,\n\n111\n00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.670\nwe can do our right-click\non our desktop here.\n\n112\n00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.960\nWe do our right-click, I'm gonna go\nthorough a couple of these things.\n\n113\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.200\nNow, for some of you guys,\nthis might be very, very basic.\n\n114\n00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.791\nYou might've been working with Windows for\n\n115\n00:06:11.791 --> 00:06:13.690\na long time and you say,\nWes, yeah, we know these.\n\n116\n00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.600\nBut keep in mind that somebody\nmight be tackling this exam.\n\n117\n00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.568\nThis might be their first client exam,\n\n118\n00:06:18.568 --> 00:06:21.440\nmaybe they're familiar with\nother operating systems.\n\n119\n00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.632\nSo that's one of the reasons\nwe're trying to get everybody on\n\n120\n00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:24.654\nan even playing field here.\n\n121\n00:06:24.654 --> 00:06:28.752\nEven if some of you out there watching\nprobably think this is some of the basics,\n\n122\n00:06:28.752 --> 00:06:31.160\nit really helps everybody here.\n\n123\n00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.290\nSo we can View by, and\nyou can see large and small icons here.\n\n124\n00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.610\nIf I scroll back out,\nyou'll see the Recycle Bin, right?\n\n125\n00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.240\nIf I turn around and choose a View by,\nchoose Large Icons, people like me that\n\n126\n00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.835\nhave four eyes, makes it a little bit\neasier to see the desktop if you want.\n\n127\n00:06:47.835 --> 00:06:52.360\nNow again, keeping along that same line\nhere, if we look a little bit more,\n\n128\n00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.340\nyou can do the Sort by.\n\n129\n00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.300\nAnd you can see exactly that\nsorting by the Name, Size, Type.\n\n130\n00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.160\nAs well as being able,\n\n131\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.280\nif you've got something in the clipboard,\nyou can paste it to the desktop.\n\n132\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.969\nThe New option, we'll go ahead and\n\n133\n00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:08.724\ncome back to that Sort option\nhere in just a second here, so\n\n134\n00:07:08.724 --> 00:07:11.838\nwe can show you just some of the basic\nstuff that you can do with it.\n\n135\n00:07:11.838 --> 00:07:14.036\nNow when it comes to the New option,\n\n136\n00:07:14.036 --> 00:07:19.360\nyou can see some of the different things\nthat we can create here, different files.\n\n137\n00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.940\nI can create a bitmap, and\nI'm going to call this a for now.\n\n138\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.810\nI can create, I'm not going to\ncreate a contact in this one,\n\n139\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.390\nbecause you've got a whole bunch of\nstuff you need to fill out for that.\n\n140\n00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.660\nSo I could create a journal.\n\n141\n00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.290\nAnd if we come over here and do New again,\n\n142\n00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.200\nkind of scroll over a little bit,\nmake it easier to see.\n\n143\n00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.070\nI could also, for instance,\ncreate a text document.\n\n144\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.300\nWe'll type and call that b.\n\n145\n00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.515\nNow going back to the Sort by here,\nI can sort this, like we said.\n\n146\n00:07:49.515 --> 00:07:51.340\nI can do this by Name.\n\n147\n00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.025\nAnd if i do it by name here,\nyou can see, sure enough, a, b, c, d.\n\n148\n00:07:55.025 --> 00:07:57.785\nIt sorts it alphabetically by its name.\n\n149\n00:07:57.785 --> 00:08:01.178\nSo some of the things you can do\nwhen it comes to creating new files.\n\n150\n00:08:01.178 --> 00:08:04.489\nYou also have your option to\ndo Display settings, too.\n\n151\n00:08:04.489 --> 00:08:07.131\nSo from here,\nwe can launch our Display settings.\n\n152\n00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:10.056\nSettings and\nif we need to configure display settings,\n\n153\n00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:14.227\nwe're gonna talk a little bit more about\nthis new settings menu coming up when we\n\n154\n00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:16.210\ndive into the action center.\n\n155\n00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.310\nBut when you're configuring your settings\nif you haven't been here before,\n\n156\n00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.000\nthis is a little bit different than\nwhat it's been like in say Windows 7.\n\n157\n00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.472\nIt may be something your familiar with\nbecause one of the things that you lose or\n\n158\n00:08:27.472 --> 00:08:31.088\ndon't even see here is your\nability to adjust the resolution.\n\n159\n00:08:31.088 --> 00:08:35.927\nYou say, wait a second I remember being\nable to right click on Windows 7 box chose\n\n160\n00:08:35.927 --> 00:08:38.419\ndisplay setting right it goes right in and\n\n161\n00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.940\nit allows me to modify you\nknow what the resolution is.\n\n162\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.510\nThey actually put that away\nunder advanced display settings.\n\n163\n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.775\nYou notice that we've got this\nlittle hyperlink down here.\n\n164\n00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:53.680\nMind if I choose that hyperlink, now all\nof a sudden we get our drop down menu,\n\n165\n00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.378\nand we get the ability if we want,\nwe can scroll through and\n\n166\n00:08:57.378 --> 00:09:01.183\nwe can change the various\nresolutions that are available.\n\n167\n00:09:01.183 --> 00:09:06.712\nAgain these numbers these resolutions\nare contingent on you know not only what\n\n168\n00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:12.340\ndisplay you have but more appropriately\ntoo is what graphics adapter you have.\n\n169\n00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.230\nSo they work kind of hand in hand.\n\n170\n00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.230\nSome of the other things that you\ncould do here, color calibration.\n\n171\n00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.450\nAdvance sizing of the text and\nother items.\n\n172\n00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.250\nI know here at ITProTV we\nhave to deal with this one.\n\n173\n00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.030\nOnce in a while, cuz when we're working\nfor virtualization, the virtualized driver\n\n174\n00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.020\nlikes to get in there and likes to adjust\nthis, and you have to turn around and come\n\n175\n00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.410\nback and say, [LAUGH] no that's okay, we\ngot it, we'll do our own display settings.\n\n176\n00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.940\nAnd it's not a bad thing, but\nthat's just how it's built.\n\n177\n00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:41.630\n>> I've actually run into different\nissues with that specific option as well\n\n178\n00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.830\nin a corporate environment.\n\n179\n00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.450\nYou have third party\napplications out there,\n\n180\n00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.000\nremember people are gonna be\ninstalling programs on their computer.\n\n181\n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.628\nAnd they might not be 100% nice\nto play with when it comes to\n\n182\n00:09:52.628 --> 00:09:57.796\nWindows that I had a lady,\nshe's like my word's not working right.\n\n183\n00:09:57.796 --> 00:09:59.800\nI'm looking at the screen,\nit's not looking right.\n\n184\n00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.210\nWe tried everything, I was changing\nresolutions, we tried different monitors\n\n185\n00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:07.210\nand it ended up being that she had changed\nthat option right there to be 200%.\n\n186\n00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.030\nAnd that was messing up our application.\n\n187\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.050\nSo just keep that in mind when\nit comes to third party apps.\n\n188\n00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.380\nIt might not work well with them.\n\n189\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.610\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n190\n00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.990\nAnd if it wasn't Windows 10 that you're\nworking on that's kind of changed too.\n\n191\n00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.710\nBecause in those days it was just called\nthe advanced scaling options, right?\n\n192\n00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.920\nAnd here they just say adjust\nthe sizing of text and other items.\n\n193\n00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.120\nIf we click on that link you'll see\nexactly what Dan was talking about.\n\n194\n00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.800\nNotice it says change the items here.\n\n195\n00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.044\nCustom scaling level.\n\n196\n00:10:31.044 --> 00:10:34.220\nNow this is what Dan was talking about,\nhe would have been having to deal with.\n\n197\n00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.260\nJust notice that we're kind of\nworking with the new interface but\n\n198\n00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.470\nthey're still tucked underneath the hood.\n\n199\n00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.900\nThat old control panel\nthat we're familiar with.\n\n200\n00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.870\nSo it is good to know both, right?\n\n201\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.230\nBecause from an exam perspective,\nthis is a new feature.\n\n202\n00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.360\nAnd Windows exams, especially on\nthe clients and the server exams,\n\n203\n00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.080\nthey like to test on new features.\n\n204\n00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.710\nSo be aware of that.\n\n205\n00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.820\nAnd when you see it again,\nwe can just modify the text.\n\n206\n00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.220\nNow, I'm not gonna modify the text.\n\n207\n00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.830\nDo keep in mind though,\nif you do adjust the scaling\n\n208\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.320\nthat is a setting that's stored on\nthe registry under the user profile.\n\n209\n00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.150\nSo, if I was to do this, in fact I’ll go\nahead and do this I just won't log off,\n\n210\n00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:14.493\nif I was to say maybe change this to 125,\nsay OK and then here apply.\n\n211\n00:11:14.493 --> 00:11:18.244\nNotice that it tells me, You must sign out\nof your computer to apply these changes\n\n212\n00:11:18.244 --> 00:11:22.048\nbecause, that's a setting that's stored\nin the registry of the user profile and\n\n213\n00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:25.687\nthey want you to log off, right and\nthen when you log back on, it'll basically\n\n214\n00:11:25.687 --> 00:11:29.492\nquery the registry, the sub tree here and\napply those settings to the desktop so,\n\n215\n00:11:29.492 --> 00:11:32.460\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust say sign out later.\n\n216\n00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.140\nAnd in fact if you don't wanna do that,\nyou can actually change it back and\n\n217\n00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.550\nit won't require you to sign out.\n\n218\n00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.250\nSo couple of things you\ncan do right there, and\n\n219\n00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:44.120\nin fact, like I said,\nwe're gonna look more at the action panel.\n\n220\n00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.090\nThis is this new interface here,\nwe'll come back,\n\n221\n00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.910\nyou'll see some of these\nsettings come up over again.\n\n222\n00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.770\nSo, desktop, Dan, it's fairly easy, right?\n\n223\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:57.390\nYou can You can drag and drop things,\nbring them up to the Recycle Bin.\n\n224\n00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.830\nLike I said, guys, I know that some of\nthis might seem a little bit elementary.\n\n225\n00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.080\nYou can right click and\nclear your Recycle Bin.\n\n226\n00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.730\nNow, let's look at some\nother options that we have.\n\n227\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.850\nSome of the other options we have is\nthe configuration of the task bar, right?\n\n228\n00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.458\nThe task bars been around for\n\n229\n00:12:12.458 --> 00:12:16.156\na while I don't know what I would\ndo if they got rid of the task bar.\n\n230\n00:12:16.156 --> 00:12:17.317\nIf you get rid of the task bar and\n\n231\n00:12:17.317 --> 00:12:20.107\nthe start menu and I'm not going to\nknow how to work with Windows anymore.\n\n232\n00:12:20.107 --> 00:12:23.940\nSo let's look at some of the elements\nwe have on the task bar.\n\n233\n00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.360\nAgain, you can right\nclick on the task bar and\n\n234\n00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.500\nyou get a series of options here as well.\n\n235\n00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.330\nGives you the option to do\nsome basic configuration.\n\n236\n00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.910\nFor instance, toolbars,\nI can add things to the toolbars.\n\n237\n00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.530\nFor instance, if I want address,\nI can zoom out here.\n\n238\n00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:45.478\nI can now search the internet, if I want.\n\n239\n00:12:45.478 --> 00:12:48.960\nAnd it'll open, it'll ask me,\nhey do you wanna open this up in Edge?\n\n240\n00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.260\nOr do you wanna open up\nin Internet Explorer?\n\n241\n00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.700\nAnd we're just gonna click off of it.\n\n242\n00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.190\nI'm not actually gonna go\nout to the internet, but\n\n243\n00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:58.180\nit does show you that you\nhave the ability to do that.\n\n244\n00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.000\nAll right, so\na little bit more on the toolbars here.\n\n245\n00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.460\nWe've also got links and the show desktop.\n\n246\n00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.620\nNow believe it or not with the show\ndesktop you really don't need this\n\n247\n00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.060\nfeature, I mean you can cuz I'm gonna show\nyou a couple of ways that you can see your\n\n248\n00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:17.510\ndesktop regardless, like for\ninstance right here show desktop.\n\n249\n00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.490\nSo you got quite a few different ways\nthat you can do some of these things.\n\n250\n00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.740\nThe search functionality,\nnow I want you to see.\n\n251\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.740\nAnd I tell you what, let me go ahead and\ntake the address off there.\n\n252\n00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.610\nAll right, we have the search window here.\n\n253\n00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.670\nNow we do have the ability,\nwe'll look at Cortana coming up.\n\n254\n00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.620\nWe'll just leave her out to the side for\nnow.\n\n255\n00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.170\nBut you do have the ability that\nyou could modify this if you want.\n\n256\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:45.720\nLike for instance,\nif I right click and I choose Search.\n\n257\n00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.870\nClose that down there, make it\na little easier for you guys to see.\n\n258\n00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.400\nAnd I choose Search.\n\n259\n00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.590\nNotice, oops, I'll get there eventually.\n\n260\n00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:55.680\nThere we go.\n\n261\n00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.190\nClicking all over the place here.\n\n262\n00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.050\nI can turn that off.\n\n263\n00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.440\nI can actually show the search\nicon if I want, and\n\n264\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.240\nI get this little magnifying glass here.\n\n265\n00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.810\nDoes the same thing brings up\nthe Katana or the Cortanna window.\n\n266\n00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.520\n>> Gives you a little more\nreal estate on your taskbar\n\n267\n00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.840\n>> It does yeah,\n\n268\n00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.320\nabsolutely and\nit depends on how often you use, or\n\n269\n00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.540\nhow dedicated you are or\nhow much you really rely on the taskbar.\n\n270\n00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.460\nAnd when we could say hidden, right?\n\n271\n00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.990\nAnd like Dan says,\nnow we got a lot more real estate.\n\n272\n00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.400\nWe've hidden all those search options.\n\n273\n00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.890\nOne of the new features that,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n274\n00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:36.440\nbring those back up here, search icon and\n\n275\n00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.290\nagain notice that you have to\nmake sure where you're clicking.\n\n276\n00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.340\nIf you are clicking anywhere else\nother than the taskbar you get those\n\n277\n00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.870\nsame right clicked options for\nthe desktop that we were talking about.\n\n278\n00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:53.350\nNow we do have let me see here.\n\n279\n00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.080\nThere we go.\n\n280\n00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.670\nWe've got this new Task View button.\n\n281\n00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.270\nNow, if you're familiar with some\nother operating systems like Linux,\n\n282\n00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.930\nthey've had this kind of option up for\na very long time.\n\n283\n00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.530\nThis isn't anything new, right?\n\n284\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:11.170\nThe ability to bring up let's\nsay a couple of windows.\n\n285\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.670\nAnd I'm not going to fill these out or\nanything here guys.\n\n286\n00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.420\nAnd then I decide I want\nto add a new desktop.\n\n287\n00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.100\nRight?\nI add a new desktop.\n\n288\n00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.030\nNow I've got a clear desktop and\nif I want to get back to it I can\n\n289\n00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.490\nalways switch back to those open and\nactive windows.\n\n290\n00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.610\nNow I said, this isn't anything\nnew it's just relative.\n\n291\n00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.610\nIt's new in the Windows environment,\nthat you can have multiple desktops.\n\n292\n00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.600\nNow, when we say multiple\ndesktops you'll notice that\n\n293\n00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.790\nthe icons didn't change\non my desktop right.\n\n294\n00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.270\nIt was basically just active windows.\n\n295\n00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:42.480\nSome of the other options, too, here.\n\n296\n00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.330\nIf you do have multiple windows open,\nlet's see,\n\n297\n00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:49.890\nlet's get back to the primary desktop\nhere, and maybe just open a few.\n\n298\n00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:53.860\nGive me a second here.\n\n299\n00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.657\nWanna create just a couple of\ndocuments and open them up.\n\n300\n00:16:02.817 --> 00:16:05.350\nAnd I'm getting one more.\n\n301\n00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:06.499\nWe'll open that up.\n\n302\n00:16:06.499 --> 00:16:10.001\nNow, I also have the ability\nthat if I want, and\n\n303\n00:16:10.001 --> 00:16:14.206\nI've got a couple of windows\nopen- I can tell Windows via\n\n304\n00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:18.480\nthe taskbar how I want them to\nbe arranged on the desktop.\n\n305\n00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:24.460\nSo for instance I can say if I want\nto cascade the windows, right?\n\n306\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:31.270\nSo come down here, we'll say cascade\nthe windows and it does exactly that.\n\n307\n00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.380\nWe could also show them stacked.\n\n308\n00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.530\nAnd we can also show them side by side,\nall right.\n\n309\n00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.240\nSo just different ways that\nyou could instantly arrange.\n\n310\n00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.510\nIf you're one of these ones,\nthat I've seen many people that\n\n311\n00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.430\nI don't know how they could find anything\non their desktop cuz they got just\n\n312\n00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:51.320\na hundred icons across their desktop, and\nthey've got 15 to 20 open windows and\n\n313\n00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.190\nyou want to be able to see them side\nby side like that you can do that.\n\n314\n00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.510\nNow I will just take a second here.\n\n315\n00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.180\nYou guys, some of you might be\nfamiliar with this feature,\n\n316\n00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.085\nsomething called the Window Snap.\n\n317\n00:17:02.085 --> 00:17:04.895\nRight, that's something that's\nbeen in Windows since Windows 7.\n\n318\n00:17:04.895 --> 00:17:08.725\nHowever, it is a little different here.\n\n319\n00:17:08.725 --> 00:17:12.091\nWhen you talk about showing\nthe Windows stack, cascading them,\n\n320\n00:17:12.091 --> 00:17:16.160\nshowing them side-by-side,\nwe'll just kind of throw this one in here.\n\n321\n00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.740\nThe fact that we now have a four way\n\n322\n00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.900\nstacking that we can\ndo with these windows.\n\n323\n00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.990\nSo let me go ahead and\nsee if open up another one here.\n\n324\n00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:33.250\nRight so notice that if I take one of\nthese and I drop it down to the corner,\n\n325\n00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.240\nit's going to ask me, okay, well we\njust made half of the desktop that.\n\n326\n00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.810\nBut you still have some\nopen windows back here.\n\n327\n00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.740\nI know my head's kind of\ncovering it up there, but\n\n328\n00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.840\nnotice that it has these two, because\nthere's only going to be up to four, and\n\n329\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.480\nI can pick and say okay, I want that one.\n\n330\n00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:46.980\nSo.\n\n331\n00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.730\nNice little way that you can kind of\narrange your windows if you need to.\n\n332\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.410\nNow remember one of the things\nthat I also showed you is that,\n\n333\n00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.170\nif you need to see your desktop, and\nyou wanna go right through to the desktop,\n\n334\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:03.320\nyou can choose the show desktop\noption does exactly that.\n\n335\n00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.130\nAnd then you can also turn around and\nopen all the windows here.\n\n336\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.060\nNow I don't,\nagain it is personal computing.\n\n337\n00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.280\nI personally don't use this\nover on the lower right hand\n\n338\n00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.080\nscreen just above where my head's at.\n\n339\n00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.440\nThere's actually this button\nthat people kinda forgot about.\n\n340\n00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.710\nI know you've been around working\nwith Windows for a while, Dan.\n\n341\n00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.850\nRemember back in the days of XP\nthat had a little desktop icon,\n\n342\n00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.530\nlittle square icon, right?\n\n343\n00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:33.660\nWell, when Vista came out, they made\nthat a, it might have been Windows 7.\n\n344\n00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.010\nIn fact, I think this was a translucent,\ntransparent icon that is still there.\n\n345\n00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.380\nBut a lot of people don't use it.\n\n346\n00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.560\nSo let me go ahead and show you here, down\non the lower right hand corner, again,\n\n347\n00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.290\nit's a button that many\npeople don't know is there.\n\n348\n00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:49.280\nRight, that is also a show desktop icon\nand some of the people that have been\n\n349\n00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.490\nworking in Windows for awhile\nremember when XP when that was there.\n\n350\n00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.410\nSo, I'm doing the same thing and\nyou really can't even see it.\n\n351\n00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.770\nI mean it's way down here in that\n\n352\n00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.020\nlittle sliver of a line is\nwhat I'm actually pushing.\n\n353\n00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.440\nSo, that to me is very good,\n\n354\n00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.000\nespecially if I've got duo\nmonitors that I'm looking away.\n\n355\n00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.760\nI just have to slide the cursor all the\nway down to the lowest right hand portion\n\n356\n00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.610\nof the screen and I can get all those\nWindows really good, really easy.\n\n357\n00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:19.170\nNow, the other one that we\nhave is the task manager.\n\n358\n00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:20.990\nWe can also launch the task manager.\n\n359\n00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.490\nLet me go ahead and close windows,\nspeaking of people with icons all over\n\n360\n00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:29.255\ntheir desktop, I'm becoming I'm\nbecoming the ones I don't like.\n\n361\n00:19:29.255 --> 00:19:33.120\n[LAUGH] So,\nwe gotta close this one here too.\n\n362\n00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.830\nThere we go,\nnow we can delete all of these.\n\n363\n00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.160\nAnd, so the other one's the task manager.\n\n364\n00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:45.530\nAll right, when it comes to configurations\nin task manager, task manager looks\n\n365\n00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:49.720\na little bit different than maybe\nyou remember it from Windows 7.\n\n366\n00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:54.070\nAnd Windows 8 and 8.1, it got a really\ngood face lift, and it looks really good.\n\n367\n00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.170\nNow you might be saying, well that\nreally doesn't look like anything.\n\n368\n00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.250\n>> It looks like a whole lot of nothing.\n\n369\n00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.490\n>> Like a blank box, that's right.\n\n370\n00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.600\nAnd that's because for\nthe average end user,\n\n371\n00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.100\nthey don't really think you need\nto know much of this information.\n\n372\n00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.720\nBut for those of you that\nare administrating you can choose.\n\n373\n00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.345\n>> How condescending.\n\n374\n00:20:07.345 --> 00:20:08.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n375\n00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:09.960\nYou simpleton.\n\n376\n00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.840\nSo you've got the task manager and\n\n377\n00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.420\nif you show more details here,\nI know I did that kind of quick.\n\n378\n00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.885\nI'll slow down so you guys can\nactually see what I'm doing here.\n\n379\n00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:20.860\n[LAUGH] Click more details.\n\n380\n00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.710\nAll right, and this is pretty much\nthe same task manager that you know with\n\n381\n00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.130\na new code of pain over it.\n\n382\n00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.710\nYou could see your processes and\nperformance.\n\n383\n00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.550\nI really like the performance tab\non this today versus the old one,\n\n384\n00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.800\nthe old traditional one\njust very basic text.\n\n385\n00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.960\nFor me, it's nice and shiny now.\n\n386\n00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.510\nGot different colors now and everything.\n\n387\n00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.660\nAnd it gives you this live read out.\n\n388\n00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.250\n>> Very modern looking.\n\n389\n00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.820\n>> It is.\n\n390\n00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:49.350\nCompared to the old buttons and\nbasic tab information that we had before.\n\n391\n00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.730\nAnd you can see your app history,\nstart-up.\n\n392\n00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.540\nYou can change start-up from here.\n\n393\n00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.370\nDo remember on the exam,\nthat that's changed.\n\n394\n00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.970\nFor the longest time, we actually\nwould manage that Inside of MS Config.\n\n395\n00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:05.690\nToday we actually manage our startup\napplications here right from this tab and\n\n396\n00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:10.130\nthen some user information,\nusers that are logged in, every single\n\n397\n00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:15.050\nprocess that is running on this machine\nin a lot of detailed information.\n\n398\n00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.720\nHence the tab name detail.\n\n399\n00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.450\nAnd then just your various services.\n\n400\n00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:23.410\nSo, back to the task bar, we can\nalso launch task manager right there\n\n401\n00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:27.020\nwe get the ability if we want,\nwe can choose properties,\n\n402\n00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.230\nnow there is couple of different\nways I could show this too.\n\n403\n00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.050\nI could right click on task bar and\nchoose properties and\n\n404\n00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.690\nthis brings up this menu here.\n\n405\n00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.500\nThere are a couple of different\nways that you can do this.\n\n406\n00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.210\nFrom as far as the settings go,\n\n407\n00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.220\nthis is one of the best ways to do it,\nfrom the task bar on the desktop itself.\n\n408\n00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.782\nNow in the task bar and\nstart menu properties,\n\n409\n00:21:49.782 --> 00:21:53.400\nwe got a few options when\nit comes to the task bar.\n\n410\n00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.000\nWe'll go ahead and\n\n411\n00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.830\nlook at these just in case just in case\nthey throw them to you on the exam.\n\n412\n00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.930\nNow you might get in the future,\nin your IT endeavors,\n\n413\n00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.220\nyou might get a call that says\nI can't find my task bar.\n\n414\n00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.910\nI've heard people doing this before and\nthey don't realize that\n\n415\n00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:16.107\nthey got very bored and started clicking\nall over the place, and unfortunately,\n\n416\n00:22:16.107 --> 00:22:21.830\nthey clicked OK, and\nnow their task bar disappears.\n\n417\n00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.900\nSo you do have the ability to customize\nthe task bar a little bit more by\n\n418\n00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.250\nhiding it.\n\n419\n00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.600\nPersonally, again,\nI don't like this setting at all.\n\n420\n00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.340\nThe only time I've ever used this\nsetting is If I needed real estate for\n\n421\n00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.270\nlike a movie [LAUGH] I'd\nget it out of the way.\n\n422\n00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.460\nBut I'll tell you what,\nonce the movie's gone I'd turn it back.\n\n423\n00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.890\nCuz I really do use that taskbar a lot.\n\n424\n00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.710\nAnd then it's just a simple\nhovering over it to bring it back.\n\n425\n00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.570\nBut we'll go ahead and undo that setting.\n\n426\n00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.630\nAnd we'll choose Apply.\n\n427\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:52.788\nNow this next one, couple should be\nreally, really simple here, guys, right?\n\n428\n00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:56.820\nSmall task bar buttons, again, gives you\na ability that you can load it down with\n\n429\n00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.880\nsome more Quick Launch\nicons if you want to.\n\n430\n00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.120\n>> I've seen some crazy\ntaskbars in my time.\n\n431\n00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.460\nJust, like, a billion different\ntask bar buttons on there, but\n\n432\n00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.460\nthey make them so, so\nsmall so they all fit.\n\n433\n00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.820\n>> What's the most layers you've seen?\n\n434\n00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.890\nHow many layers deep lines?\n\n435\n00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:11.872\n>> Three?\n>> I've seen three, yeah.\n\n436\n00:23:11.872 --> 00:23:15.578\n[LAUGH] Once they get three,\nthree lines is what he's saying deep,\n\n437\n00:23:15.578 --> 00:23:17.720\nthat's a lot of Quick Launch icons.\n\n438\n00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.790\nAt that point,\n\n439\n00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.423\nyou basically just outputted\nthe entire Start menu to the task bar.\n\n440\n00:23:22.423 --> 00:23:23.452\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, one of the start menu.\n\n441\n00:23:23.452 --> 00:23:24.580\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n442\n00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.340\nTask bar location on the screen.\n\n443\n00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.760\nAnother one that's simple\nhere if I do left here and\n\n444\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.030\nI apply it, it's gonna just\nreposition it across the desktop, but\n\n445\n00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:37.950\nagain I'm just gonna leave\nit here on the bottom.\n\n446\n00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:43.080\nAll right, we'll choose okay to that and\nI should have chosen apply.\n\n447\n00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.510\nNow, this one is the notification area,\nthe notification area some of you guys\n\n448\n00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:51.300\nhave remembered it for the longest\ntime as the system tray, sys tray and\n\n449\n00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.580\nit's I know my big head is covering\nit up over here, but this tell me,\n\n450\n00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.970\nbasically, some of the icons.\n\n451\n00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.790\nI can see over here the notification.\n\n452\n00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:00.760\nThat's really all that's doing for me.\n\n453\n00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.610\n>> Your Windows 10 is a Mac.\n\n454\n00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.762\n>> [LAUGH] It is,\nthat's right, that's right.\n\n455\n00:24:03.762 --> 00:24:05.792\nAnd we'll choose Customize here.\n\n456\n00:24:05.792 --> 00:24:10.675\nAnd when we choose Customize, it takes\nus into the new Settings panel that\n\n457\n00:24:10.675 --> 00:24:15.794\nwe'll see, and again you can choose\nwhich icons, your quick action icons,\n\n458\n00:24:15.794 --> 00:24:19.770\nand I can select through\nthe various ones if I want, right?\n\n459\n00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.223\nI can select which icons appear\non the taskbar if I wanted.\n\n460\n00:24:23.223 --> 00:24:29.731\nI could turn these off or on, so there\nagain, just more customization, right?\n\n461\n00:24:29.731 --> 00:24:32.761\nI could show application notifications,\nright?\n\n462\n00:24:32.761 --> 00:24:38.490\nI could turn app notifications on, same\nthing, lock screen, alarms and reminders.\n\n463\n00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.890\nAnd then,\nHide notifications while presenting.\n\n464\n00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:45.354\nIf you're in the middle of a PowerPoint\npresentation, you might not want\n\n465\n00:24:45.354 --> 00:24:49.818\na notification going off on the\nbottom-lower portion of your screen, so\n\n466\n00:24:49.818 --> 00:24:53.346\nthis does give you the ability\nto not only turn icons off but\n\n467\n00:24:53.346 --> 00:24:56.442\nalso hide notifications\nwhen you are presenting.\n\n468\n00:24:56.442 --> 00:25:01.874\nThen you can get specific applications,\nspecific application notifications here.\n\n469\n00:25:01.874 --> 00:25:05.600\nWe can turn those on or off as well.\n\n470\n00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.230\nNow, you'll notice that it keeps\nlaunching the same location.\n\n471\n00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:13.890\nNow let me show you another\nway to get here as well.\n\n472\n00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:19.680\nI just basically used it from\nthe taskbar and start menu properties.\n\n473\n00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.120\nThere is a new icon, and\nthis is new to Windows 10,\n\n474\n00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.210\ndown here in the lower right-hand corner.\n\n475\n00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.097\nYou'll see this,\n\n476\n00:25:26.097 --> 00:25:29.660\nit looks like a little thought bubble\nalmost with the instructions on it.\n\n477\n00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.470\nWell, it's a notification,\nas you can see, notification icon.\n\n478\n00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:36.840\nAnd that notification panel\nthat we have here will show you\n\n479\n00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.990\ndifferent notifications.\n\n480\n00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:43.150\nFor instance, I wonder if I can\ngenerate one here real quick.\n\n481\n00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:47.720\nSo, let's do services.msc,\n\n482\n00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.500\nand we'll turn our Windows Firewall\noff just for a second here,\n\n483\n00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.530\nbecause that's always safe and\nsecure, right?\n\n484\n00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.290\nLet me turn the firewall off,\nstop that service.\n\n485\n00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:01.280\nAnd here's the notification,\nmy head's kind of covering it up there.\n\n486\n00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.560\nNotice the little notification.\n\n487\n00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.500\nWell, that notification actually goes\nin the action center right here now,\n\n488\n00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.835\nas this heads up panel.\n\n489\n00:26:07.835 --> 00:26:11.860\nAnd we'll go ahead, we won't leave that\nturned off, we'll turn that back on.\n\n490\n00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.040\nBut I just wanted to generate one so\nyou could see kinda what's going on here.\n\n491\n00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.300\nBut now more important for\nour episode here,\n\n492\n00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.190\nare some of the settings\nthat you can see here.\n\n493\n00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:23.310\nNotice that I got Tablet mode,\nI don't wanna go into tablet mode,\n\n494\n00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:27.450\nit kinda turns it back into Windows\n8.1 and well, that's not too fun.\n\n495\n00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.562\nLocation awareness, VPN and Bluetooth, but\n\n496\n00:26:29.562 --> 00:26:32.172\nwhat I'm really looking at\nis this All settings button.\n\n497\n00:26:32.172 --> 00:26:35.051\nThat's the one that's very\nimportant to me, all right?\n\n498\n00:26:35.051 --> 00:26:40.648\nThis is the new system menu versus what\nwe remember as our classic Control Panel,\n\n499\n00:26:40.648 --> 00:26:44.036\nso you can see that it's\nkind of different here.\n\n500\n00:26:44.036 --> 00:26:48.903\nKinda got a basic interface here, and I'm\ngoing to System > Notification & actions\n\n501\n00:26:48.903 --> 00:26:53.580\nhere, so basically you can see it takes us\nright back to where we were, all right?\n\n502\n00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:58.079\nSo that is, I know that we've\ngot a little bit more here, Dan.\n\n503\n00:26:58.079 --> 00:27:01.931\nSome of the things that they do call out\non the exam is configuring accessibility\n\n504\n00:27:01.931 --> 00:27:06.074\noptions, because there's times when we're\ngonna have to support people that might\n\n505\n00:27:06.074 --> 00:27:10.000\nhave a hearing impairment,\nmight have some kind of visual impairment.\n\n506\n00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.250\nAnd we need to help assist them as well.\n\n507\n00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:13.980\nSo they do call that out on the exam,\n\n508\n00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.645\nbut I can see that Dan's telling me we\nmight have to save that for part two.\n\n509\n00:27:17.645 --> 00:27:19.090\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n510\n00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:23.200\n>> [LAUGH] I was trying to do this to him\nover here, the clock is running down.\n\n511\n00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.820\nBut he does have a lot, great more\ninformation that we need to cover.\n\n512\n00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.890\nSo, looks like a part\ntwo in our future Wes,\n\n513\n00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.550\nI'm looking forward to seeing you there.\n\n514\n00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:32.470\nLooking forward to seeing\nyou there as well.\n\n515\n00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.990\nAs for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n516\n00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.440\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n517\n00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.034\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n518\n00:27:37.034 --> 00:27:39.050\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n519\n00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:46.730\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTv.\n\n3\n00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:18.680\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode.\n\n4\n00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.781\nWell, you know what it is.\n\n5\n00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:21.071\nIt's more Windows 10.\n\n6\n00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:25.516\nAnd joining us back in the studio for\na part two on post-installation\n\n7\n00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:29.380\nconfigurations and set-ups that is\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.631\nWes, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.260\nWe're so glad to have you back.\n\n10\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.039\nHow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:34.352\n>> It's going great thanks for\nhaving me here.\n\n12\n00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:37.519\nThat's right a part two on post\ninstallation configurations.\n\n13\n00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.646\nIn the first episode we\nlooked at the start menu and\n\n14\n00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:44.680\nsome things that are new about that and\nwe looked at the task bar.\n\n15\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.431\nNow continuing on in some of the\nobjectives that you'll have to know for\n\n16\n00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:51.756\nthe 76, 98 exam are configuring\naccessibility options.\n\n17\n00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:55.433\nNow, this is also good to know just for\na non-examined environment as well.\n\n18\n00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:58.740\nBecause you might work with somebody\nthat maybe has a vision impairment.\n\n19\n00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.680\nMaybe somebody's got a hearing impairment.\n\n20\n00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.290\nAnd these things can come in handy\nwhen it comes to assisting people that\n\n21\n00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.130\nmight need accessibility options,\nwhich is where we're going.\n\n22\n00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.920\nIt says configure accessibility options.\n\n23\n00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.700\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe won't waste any time.\n\n24\n00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.690\nLet's dive right in here and\nlet's show you on how to configure those.\n\n25\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.900\nNow, couple of different\nways that you can do this.\n\n26\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.120\nI know my head's covering\nup the first way there.\n\n27\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.660\nThat little icon, that little notification\narea there that brings up our action\n\n28\n00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.140\ncenter side pane, panel if you will.\n\n29\n00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.259\nThen we go to All Settings.\n\n30\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.470\nAll right, and\nwe have this Ease of Access.\n\n31\n00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.220\nWell, that's one way that you can do that.\n\n32\n00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.120\nWe're gonna look at it from this\naspect here in a second, but\n\n33\n00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.680\nI want you to also know that we have the\ntraditional Control Panel just by using\n\n34\n00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.850\nthose Administrative quick links that\nwe talked about on the first episode.\n\n35\n00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.130\nWe can also choose Control Panel here and\n\n36\n00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.390\nyou'll have well,\nEase of Access right there.\n\n37\n00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.100\nSo, couple different ways and\nyou're gonna see that some of the links.\n\n38\n00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.567\nEven in the new interface,\ntake us right back here.\n\n39\n00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:03.146\nSo, wanted you to do both ways in\ncase they ask you on the exam.\n\n40\n00:02:03.146 --> 00:02:04.190\nYou're gonna be ready for it.\n\n41\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.990\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclose down the traditional Control Panel.\n\n42\n00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.830\nIf I could say that right, and\n\n43\n00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.820\nwe'll get into the Ease of Access here and\nlaunch this up.\n\n44\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.610\nNow, one of the first things\nyou'll see is the Narrator.\n\n45\n00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.029\nThe Narrator is exactly\nwhat it sounds like.\n\n46\n00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.459\nIf somebody has a vision impairment and\nmaybe they need,\n\n47\n00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.189\nas you hover over certain sections of\nthe interface you can have it read to you.\n\n48\n00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.960\nSo that you're audibly aware on the,\n\n49\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.845\nwhere the mouse is if you will.\n\n50\n00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:41.000\nWhere the cursor is, and the different\nelements that are on the screen.\n\n51\n00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.060\nNow if I turn this on.\n\n52\n00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.830\nI'm gonna be careful here and\nhopefully it won't blur us out here.\n\n53\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.970\nNotice that it kinda\nhighlights where you're at.\n\n54\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.600\nAll right.\n\n55\n00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.380\nAnd you can see the speed and\nthe pitch and the sounds you hear.\n\n56\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.410\nYou can start to modify some of\nthese individual settings as well.\n\n57\n00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.610\nCharacters when you type them.\n\n58\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.920\nYou can see the various cursors and keys.\n\n59\n00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.920\nSo that's a little bit about the Narrator.\n\n60\n00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.600\nThe next thing that we have and I'm gonna\ngo ahead and turn the narrator off.\n\n61\n00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.101\nAgain if you turned it on,\n\n62\n00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:13.830\nyou might want to turn the setting on that\nsays start the narrator automatically.\n\n63\n00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.937\nAnd this would be for\n\n64\n00:03:14.937 --> 00:03:18.522\nsomebody that you need to help\nassist them in their computer, and\n\n65\n00:03:18.522 --> 00:03:22.640\nyou certainly can't be there every time\nthey need to turn on the narrator.\n\n66\n00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.662\nSo you could also make it start\nautomatically if you wanted to, all right?\n\n67\n00:03:27.662 --> 00:03:30.598\nNow, for\npeople that maybe have vision impairment.\n\n68\n00:03:30.598 --> 00:03:32.650\nYou also have the magnifier, all right.\n\n69\n00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.750\nWhen you turn the magnifier on, you can\nsee different options here as well.\n\n70\n00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.266\nI'm gonna go and turn that off for\n\n71\n00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:40.364\nnow because we can always magnify\nif we need to, but I tell you what?\n\n72\n00:03:40.364 --> 00:03:42.389\nWe'll go ahead and\nleave it on just for a second here.\n\n73\n00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.269\nAnd you can see right here that we have\nthings like Tracking, Follow the keyboard\n\n74\n00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.800\nfocus, Follow the mouse cursor,\nand we can turn that on and off.\n\n75\n00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.100\nAgain, I'm gonna go ahead and just kinda\nmove up and turn the magnifier off and\n\n76\n00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.770\nas you can see it does that.\n\n77\n00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.690\nIt brings a specific part of\nyour desktop into focus and\n\n78\n00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.410\nyou can see that the default\nwas to magnify it by 200%.\n\n79\n00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.170\nAnd again for somebody that maybe\nhas a deteriorating vision,\n\n80\n00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.650\nglaucoma if you will.\n\n81\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.280\nAnd some of these impairments\nthat affect their vision.\n\n82\n00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.040\nThis might help them when it\ncomes to using their computer.\n\n83\n00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.807\n>> That's right we don't\nto leave them out right.\n\n84\n00:04:19.807 --> 00:04:22.116\nThey enjoy using their computers\nas much as anybody else.\n\n85\n00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:23.485\nAnd that will just make it\na little easier for them.\n\n86\n00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:25.120\nSo they can have that full experience.\n\n87\n00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.910\n>> Absolutely.\n\n88\n00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.910\nEverybody deserves the right, if they're\ngonna use their computer to use it\n\n89\n00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.190\nmore efficiently in a manner\nthat makes them comfortable.\n\n90\n00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.160\nSo we do have those options.\n\n91\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.987\nNow, if you have somebody that maybe\ndoesn't see colors the right way.\n\n92\n00:04:39.987 --> 00:04:44.770\nYou have the ability that if you want\nyou can change it to high contrast.\n\n93\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.840\nIf I do change it.\n\n94\n00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.860\nThen I get the ability to modify what the\ntext looks like, and the hyperlinks, and\n\n95\n00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.140\nthe background, button text and\nstuff like that.\n\n96\n00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.830\nAnd we'll go and turn that off, but\nyou also have the high contrast.\n\n97\n00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.270\nClosed caption options, again you\nhave exactly what it sounds like.\n\n98\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.864\nI'm sure some of you probably\nwatched a movie before right?\n\n99\n00:05:01.864 --> 00:05:03.004\nAnd the closed captions there.\n\n100\n00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:07.154\nSo, if I can't hear what they're saying\nand I'm not an expert lip reader.\n\n101\n00:05:07.154 --> 00:05:09.512\nThen I can just read the captions\nthere and we can do that.\n\n102\n00:05:09.512 --> 00:05:12.211\nWe could do things like transparency and\nstuff, the style.\n\n103\n00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:16.806\nSo you can have the different fonts\nthat you want, caption size, effects.\n\n104\n00:05:16.806 --> 00:05:19.736\nAnd then again,\njust different aspects of background and\n\n105\n00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.684\nwindow and the various options\nthat you can change there.\n\n106\n00:05:22.684 --> 00:05:25.487\nNow, how about making the keyboard\na little bit easier to use.\n\n107\n00:05:25.487 --> 00:05:31.039\nIf you have somebody that has maybe\nproblems you know, what is it.\n\n108\n00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.681\n>> Dexterity.\n>> Muscular dystrophy,\n\n109\n00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:35.910\nrheumatoid arthritis,\nthings like that you know.\n\n110\n00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.600\n>> Maybe somebody is\nsuffering from that and\n\n111\n00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.430\nit might help using\nthe on-screen keyboard.\n\n112\n00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.590\nThis makes it to where if I\ncan't type on the keyboard, and\n\n113\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.670\nI do have the ability to maybe\npush a mouse around the keyboard.\n\n114\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.820\nI can do that.\n\n115\n00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.270\nSo we have the ability to\nuse that on screen keyboard.\n\n116\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.390\nIt's kind of interesting.\n\n117\n00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.110\nI've actually used this from\na completely different reason.\n\n118\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.870\nThe hyper visor,\nI lost communication with a hyper visor.\n\n119\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.990\nSo the keyboard wasn't working in\nthe virtual machine that I was using and\n\n120\n00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.250\nI was like I've still got this\nvirtualized keyboard in here, and\n\n121\n00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.600\nit isn't going through hyper visor.\n\n122\n00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.510\nIt's talking directly to\nthe operating system.\n\n123\n00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.380\nSo when I lost the ability in the hyper\nvisor to communicate between the guest\n\n124\n00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.800\noperating system and the machine itself.\n\n125\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.440\nI just turned the on screen\nkeyboard on and I got around that.\n\n126\n00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.187\nAnd I was able to reboot the machine and\n\n127\n00:06:19.187 --> 00:06:21.590\nwe know in Windows reboots fix well,\njust about everything.\n\n128\n00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.260\n>> That's out thinking\nthe problem right there Wes.\n\n129\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.000\n>> That's right.\n\n130\n00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.730\nThat's right.\n\n131\n00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.550\nSo, I gave more than just the use for\nthe on-screen keyboard as it\n\n132\n00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.130\npertains to accessibility options\n>> Sticky keys.\n\n133\n00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.930\nAgain, do you wanna press\na key at a time for shortcuts?\n\n134\n00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.130\nToggle keys,\nyou could see some filter keys.\n\n135\n00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.660\nIf you're like me, when I have a little\nbit too much coffee in the morning,\n\n136\n00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.070\na little bit of shakes.\n\n137\n00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.040\nBut if you're somebody that has a nervous\ndisorder with your nervous system.\n\n138\n00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.280\nIt can ignore things like repeated\nkeystrokes and can help out a lot.\n\n139\n00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.260\nAnd then they give you some, just various\nother settings that you can configure.\n\n140\n00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.530\nWarning message when things\nare turning on and stuff.\n\n141\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.550\nAnd also audible sounds when you're\nturning the setting on and off.\n\n142\n00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.483\nI don't know if you ever hit\nthe Shift key five times and\n\n143\n00:07:08.483 --> 00:07:09.503\nyou here this little [SOUND].\n\n144\n00:07:09.503 --> 00:07:13.490\nAnd it gives you a little warning that\nsays, do you wanna enable sticky keys?\n\n145\n00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.500\nSo stuff like that.\n\n146\n00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.840\nSo you could be aware of it.\n\n147\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.800\nWhy are these dialog boxes\nrandomly appearing on my desktop?\n\n148\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.250\nHopefully I don't have malware.\n\n149\n00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.830\nDon't worry about it.\n\n150\n00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.120\nIt's just Windows warning you that\nthese things are being turned on.\n\n151\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.524\nThe mouse, same thing.\n\n152\n00:07:27.524 --> 00:07:31.368\nMouse cursor speed and stuff,\nnumeric keyboard, keypad.\n\n153\n00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:35.884\nAgain, if you're on a laptop [LAUGH]\njust not might be too beneficial.\n\n154\n00:07:35.884 --> 00:07:38.657\nCuz then you're gonna have to\nfind your function keys and\n\n155\n00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:40.230\nfind out where the numbers are.\n\n156\n00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:45.590\nSo, you can do that too holding down\nthe Ctrl key to speed your shift up and\n\n157\n00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.400\ndown or slow it down.\n\n158\n00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.638\nAnd then some just visual options,\nplay animations in the windows.\n\n159\n00:07:50.638 --> 00:07:55.663\nYou can see show the windows background,\nnotifications and the thickness\n\n160\n00:07:55.663 --> 00:08:00.782\nof the cursor depending on you know how\nvisually impaired a person might be.\n\n161\n00:08:00.782 --> 00:08:04.525\nNow, that's walking\nthrough the new settings.\n\n162\n00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:05.344\nAll right.\n\n163\n00:08:05.344 --> 00:08:07.429\nLet's go back to the control panel.\n\n164\n00:08:07.429 --> 00:08:12.130\nLet's go to the traditional control\npanel cuz that was a lot of information.\n\n165\n00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.830\nWhen it comes to Ease of Access Center,\nbut we also have,\n\n166\n00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:23.200\nin the traditional control panel, we have\nthe Ease of Access Center, as it's called.\n\n167\n00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.070\nAnd I wanna show you\nsomething kind of cool.\n\n168\n00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.110\nMaybe you don't really know what\nsettings you want to modify.\n\n169\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.060\nWell, they make it kind of easy for you.\n\n170\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.590\nAnd let me show you this.\n\n171\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.108\nYou can actually let Windows\nmake the suggestions for you.\n\n172\n00:08:36.108 --> 00:08:38.950\nSo, notice, we're in Control Panel,\nI know, it did that kind of quick there,\n\n173\n00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.440\nDan, so\nlet me slow down here a little bit.\n\n174\n00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.480\nIn Control Panel, then Ease of Access.\n\n175\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.368\nNow, you might say, well,\nWes, we've seen you do that.\n\n176\n00:08:45.368 --> 00:08:47.210\nWhy are you slowing down on the path?\n\n177\n00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.380\nRemember text based answers on\nthe question don't show you any\n\n178\n00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:55.520\nkind of exhibit and if you haven't\nmemorized these paths, you know, Start,\n\n179\n00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.630\nControl Panel, Ease of Access, and\nthen whatever the hyperlink might be,\n\n180\n00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.590\nyou'll get that answer wrong on the exam,\nand it's been known to happen.\n\n181\n00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.230\nBut I really like this little task link.\n\n182\n00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.010\nIt says, let Windows suggest the settings.\n\n183\n00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.680\nWhy not?\nI'll let Windows do the work for\n\n184\n00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.190\nus if they are, all right?\n\n185\n00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.470\nSo now it gives you a five step option.\n\n186\n00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:20.310\nBasically, the Major categories here are,\neye sight, dexterity, hearing, and speech.\n\n187\n00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.140\nSo, you could see eye sight right here,\nis first, it says images on the text.\n\n188\n00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.590\nAnd text on TV are difficult to see\neven when I'm wearing glasses, right.\n\n189\n00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.520\nAnd I could always go, Next.\n\n190\n00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.100\nAnd then dexterity, pens and\npencils are difficult to use.\n\n191\n00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.090\nAnd, again, remember I told you,\nwrists and arms and stuff like that.\n\n192\n00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.540\nI've got a friend that's got\nrheumatoid arthritis and\n\n193\n00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.020\nI think maybe even tendonitis.\n\n194\n00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.130\nI mean,\nhis hands aren't doing really well.\n\n195\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:47.350\nSo this does come in handy, and coupled\nwith the vision as well, all right.\n\n196\n00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.770\nI do not use my keyboard, again.\n\n197\n00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.760\nAnd, then, the third,\nhearing, like I said.\n\n198\n00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.490\nAgain, conversations can\nbe difficult to hear.\n\n199\n00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.660\nAnd they're kinda probing you with this\nlittle, almost like a survey, right..\n\n200\n00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.997\nThey kinda wanna gather some information,\nso, they're going through it and\n\n201\n00:10:02.997 --> 00:10:05.660\nthey'll adjust the settings\nin the background.\n\n202\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.990\nAll right, I might say hey I'm deaf,\nif I will.\n\n203\n00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.460\nMy wife would definitely\nagree with that one.\n\n204\n00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.310\n>> You listen to way too much metal Wes.\n\n205\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:13.714\nIt's done its damage.\n\n206\n00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:15.842\n[LAUGH]\n>> I was gonna say,\n\n207\n00:10:15.842 --> 00:10:20.503\nears up to the full stacks doesn't\ndo really good to your hearing.\n\n208\n00:10:20.503 --> 00:10:21.360\n>> What?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.310\n>> So, the last one is Speech.\n\n210\n00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.930\nAnd, again,\nif you have somebody that has difficulty\n\n211\n00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.370\nunderstanding you when they're speaking\nand it's not due to an accent.\n\n212\n00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.640\nMaybe it's like, you know,\ncommunication just based on accent.\n\n213\n00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.270\nIf you've got somebody, for instance,\nit has a very hard stuttering problem,\n\n214\n00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.520\nI have a speech impairment,\nagain we can set those.\n\n215\n00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.465\nAnd last, but not least, is Reasoning.\n\n216\n00:10:46.465 --> 00:10:50.250\n[LAUGH] All right like I said,\n5, not 4 here.\n\n217\n00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.470\nBut Rasoning, difficult for\nme to concentrate, difficult for\n\n218\n00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.490\nme to remember things, dyslexia,\nseeing things backwards or\n\n219\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.310\ninterpreting them backwards,\nit can also help.\n\n220\n00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.677\nSo what I like about this little survey,\n\n221\n00:11:01.677 --> 00:11:04.100\nis that you can let Windows\ndo the work for you.\n\n222\n00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.190\nMaybe you can tell somebody, okay,\nI don't know how to peak and\n\n223\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.765\ntweak these settings exactly, cuz I\ncan listen on what you are saying, but\n\n224\n00:11:12.765 --> 00:11:14.295\nI'm not really experiencing it.\n\n225\n00:11:14.295 --> 00:11:17.925\nSo you can help somebody, walk them\nthrough this, and even answer it for\n\n226\n00:11:17.925 --> 00:11:20.405\nthem, you know,\nas you're asking them the questions.\n\n227\n00:11:20.405 --> 00:11:23.325\nAnd then once you choose done,\nit'll come back and\n\n228\n00:11:23.325 --> 00:11:24.835\nit'll say the recommended settings.\n\n229\n00:11:24.835 --> 00:11:27.745\nNow remember,\nvisual warnings, none, right,\n\n230\n00:11:27.745 --> 00:11:31.215\ncuz I didn't say anything about vision,\nI just said maybe my hearing, right.\n\n231\n00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:34.035\nSo it didn't really do much for me.\n\n232\n00:11:34.035 --> 00:11:37.165\nText captions for\nspoken dialog, all right.\n\n233\n00:11:37.165 --> 00:11:40.450\nSo, just kind of walk through that, but\nthis is the main Ease of Access Center\n\n234\n00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.250\nthat I want you guys to see and you can\nreally get granular here if you want.\n\n235\n00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.380\nAgain some of the basics\nstarting the magnifier, I've\n\n236\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.447\ngot the volume muted for a reason,\ncuz always read this section aloud.\n\n237\n00:11:53.447 --> 00:11:56.940\nAnd that's one of the things that\nalways annoyed me about this and again,\n\n238\n00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.325\nit's just because I didn't really need it.\n\n239\n00:11:59.325 --> 00:12:00.465\nIt does exactly that and\n\n240\n00:12:00.465 --> 00:12:03.965\nyou can't really hear it but it's\nnarrating in the background as we speak.\n\n241\n00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.920\nAll right so again, these are some of the\naccessibility options that you can set,\n\n242\n00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.340\nand again, you've got these hyperlinks\nhere, if you will, little task links.\n\n243\n00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.710\nAnd they basically break it down a lot\nlike we've seen in the new interface here.\n\n244\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.790\nSo, we won't spend too much time in here.\n\n245\n00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.830\nBut I would be aware of these for\nthe exam, right?\n\n246\n00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.410\nComputer without a display,\n\n247\n00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.610\ncomputer making it easier to see things\nlike your high contrast and stuff.\n\n248\n00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.450\nUsing it without a keyboard or a mouse.\n\n249\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.800\nAll the things we've seen in the new\ninterface you can also do here and\n\n250\n00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.810\nhave been able to do here for a while.\n\n251\n00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.540\nNow, keep in mind,\nthat you also have this jump link.\n\n252\n00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.010\nYou're not stuck in the woods if you will,\n\n253\n00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.780\nif you forgot to let\nWindows make suggestions.\n\n254\n00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.667\nGet recommendation to make your\ncomputer easy and if you notice,\n\n255\n00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:52.249\nit takes us right back to that wizard\nagain, so a couple of different locations.\n\n256\n00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.290\nBasically taking you\nback to the same spot.\n\n257\n00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.750\nAll right, now, this is kinda interesting\nbecause this is newer feature in Windows,\n\n258\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.840\nand this is something known as Cortana.\n\n259\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.380\nNow, they do call this out,\nconfiguring Cortana, and\n\n260\n00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.730\nyou can see right here it says hi,\nI'm Cortana.\n\n261\n00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:14.140\nSo, first thing we do is, we launch\nthe little taskbar search, all right?\n\n262\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.870\nAnd it says would you, and I know that's\nkind of happening kind of quick there.\n\n263\n00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.950\nLet me go ahead and say, not interested,\n\n264\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:26.210\nsee if we can start that over again,\nand home.\n\n265\n00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:29.900\nAnd there we go.\n\n266\n00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.050\nNow, notice I said not interested.\n\n267\n00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.050\nMaybe at first you say exactly that.\n\n268\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.930\nRight, you say no, Cortana,\nI don't really want to configure this.\n\n269\n00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.520\nYou see this not interested versus next,\nall right.\n\n270\n00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.110\nWell if you say I'm sure,\nwell she goes away.\n\n271\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.060\nShe disappears.\n\n272\n00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.170\nBut you can bring her back.\n\n273\n00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.470\nThis little circle icon right down here.\n\n274\n00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.790\nYou can say, I can bring it back and\nstart the configuration.\n\n275\n00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.215\nAll right, now when you configure Cortana,\nthis is up to you.\n\n276\n00:13:56.215 --> 00:14:00.265\nIt can also be controlled through a GPO,\ninside a group policy that says,\n\n277\n00:14:00.265 --> 00:14:01.825\ndon't allow Cortana.\n\n278\n00:14:01.825 --> 00:14:03.655\nIf your company is in\na security environment,\n\n279\n00:14:03.655 --> 00:14:06.860\nwhere you don't want to enable things,\nlike location services.\n\n280\n00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.450\n>> You don't want these\nthings to be in cached and\n\n281\n00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.400\nyou don't want them being\nsynchronized up to the cloud.\n\n282\n00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.020\nYou can also disable Cortana as\nwell through a group policy.\n\n283\n00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.610\nAll right, but\nif I say next, all right so,\n\n284\n00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.060\nbefore we get started I'll\nneed some info all right.\n\n285\n00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.560\nShe's so polite and\nthen there's a privacy statement.\n\n286\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.950\nDon't worry we won't test you on that one,\nDan.\n\n287\n00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.670\n>> And it says use Cortana, right.\n\n288\n00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.030\nSo we're gonna say nickname.\n\n289\n00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:32.965\nAll right, I'm gonna be, I was telling\nDan, I'm gonna be Scott Summers today,\n\n290\n00:14:32.965 --> 00:14:35.340\nall right, now, one last thing.\n\n291\n00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.420\nI'm gonna need you to sign in\nwith your Microsoft account.\n\n292\n00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.630\nNow, if you wanna synchronize\nthis information,\n\n293\n00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.150\nyou do have to sign in\nwith a Microsoft account.\n\n294\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.570\nAnd this is important because this\nis post-installation configuration,\n\n295\n00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.950\nit's not something you're doing, right,\nas you install your operating system.\n\n296\n00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.370\nSo we wanna kinda walk you\nthrough this process so\n\n297\n00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.630\nyou're also aware of this as well,\nall right?\n\n298\n00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.820\nSo it says, go ahead and\nsign in with your email or your phone.\n\n299\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.572\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and we'll\nsign in with a account that I created.\n\n300\n00:15:08.956 --> 00:15:11.740\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nget signed in right there.\n\n301\n00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.660\nNow most likely.\n\n302\n00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.310\nLet's see if I typed my password right.\n\n303\n00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:25.160\nNow, in order to do this you have to be\na local administrator on the machine.\n\n304\n00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.920\nYou got to be part of a local\nadministrative group and\n\n305\n00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.500\nyou will have to type in\nyour prior Windows password.\n\n306\n00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.090\nSo we'll go ahead and open that.\n\n307\n00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.970\nWe'll type our super\nsecret Microsoft password.\n\n308\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.060\nAll right, and then it reaches\nout to the Cloud and it says,\n\n309\n00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.190\ndo you wanna set up a PIN?\n\n310\n00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.010\nWe could set up a PIN.\n\n311\n00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.290\nAnd they say they are more\nsecure than a password.\n\n312\n00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.010\nType in some, a PIN.\n\n313\n00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.460\nI'm not gonna set that up,\nI prefer a password.\n\n314\n00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.970\nI prefer complexity when\nit comes to security.\n\n315\n00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.100\nBut that's a debate for another day.\n\n316\n00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.123\nWe'll go ahead and choose skip.\n\n317\n00:15:56.123 --> 00:16:01.782\nAll right, now it says,\nwhat is it that you want to do?\n\n318\n00:16:01.782 --> 00:16:04.841\nWhat is it that you want her help with and\nyou can see Tips and\n\n319\n00:16:04.841 --> 00:16:06.227\ntricks that it gives you.\n\n320\n00:16:06.227 --> 00:16:10.402\nAnd you also have this little ellipse,\nI believe that is, and\n\n321\n00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:13.390\nyou can say, hide tips and tricks, right?\n\n322\n00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:17.040\nSo it does give you\nthe ability to do that.\n\n323\n00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:23.270\nAll right now we go ahead and\njust hide this.\n\n324\n00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:27.190\nYeah, high tips and tricks for\nnow because what I want to do here\n\n325\n00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.080\nis show you this little side bar here.\n\n326\n00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.940\nAll right this little\nside bar gives you well,\n\n327\n00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.380\nthat's your home option right there and\nshe can give you current location.\n\n328\n00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.100\nAgain this is why for\n\n329\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.920\nprivacy considerations,\nyour company might want this disabled.\n\n330\n00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.480\nAll right.\nWe also have the option the Notebook icon.\n\n331\n00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.680\nThe Notebook icon is kind of cool,\nyou know with connected accounts,\n\n332\n00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.820\ndifferent settings that you can configure.\n\n333\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.560\nAll right.\nNow,\n\n334\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.720\nwhen we choose things\nlike the settings here,\n\n335\n00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.540\nnotice that it says Cortana will give you\nsettings, ideas, reminders, and alerts.\n\n336\n00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.530\nHey Cortana.\n\n337\n00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:00.990\nWell, what is the hey Cortana?\n\n338\n00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.710\nWell if you got a microphone and\nmost of these, like if you have a laptop,\n\n339\n00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.570\nmost of them have microphones built in.\n\n340\n00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:06.870\nI can say.\n\n341\n00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:07.430\nHello Cortona.\n\n342\n00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.530\nSome of you guys might remember Star Trek,\nhello computer.\n\n343\n00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.370\nThat's right we are here and\nnow it's Cortona though.\n\n344\n00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:15.950\nAnd I can do that and she'll wake up and\n\n345\n00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:20.400\nhey I'm ready to help you\nfind the best flight today.\n\n346\n00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.240\nAnd again it says find flights and more.\n\n347\n00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:26.190\nAnd you can see task bar tidbits and\nagain just some other options there.\n\n348\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.600\n>> So works a lot like\na little Personal assistant.\n\n349\n00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.120\n>> That's exactly what it is Dan.\n\n350\n00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.600\nIt's Microsoft's personal digital\nassistant like some of the other ones like\n\n351\n00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.870\nyou'll see like Apple has their Siri and\nthere's one in Android,\n\n352\n00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.510\nI'm not sure exactly what\nthe name of that one is.\n\n353\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.860\nBut just like you seeing some\nof the other operating systems.\n\n354\n00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.112\nAgain sliders.\n\n355\n00:17:45.112 --> 00:17:46.820\nVery easy,\nno I don't want that information,\n\n356\n00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.970\nno I don't want that information so\nnot very complex there.\n\n357\n00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.280\nBut it is good to know\nwhere to configure this and\n\n358\n00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.430\nknow a little bit about this icons here.\n\n359\n00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:00.410\nAgain, because this is\na new feature Microsoft\n\n360\n00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.450\nlikes their new features\non their exams right.\n\n361\n00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:07.510\nThey might test you and say some of you\nguys maybe are coming from Windows XP,\n\n362\n00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.680\nWindows Vista, Windows 7, 8, nate.\n\n363\n00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.390\nWell, no now 8 nate one.\n\n364\n00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.860\nCause, it change the 8 nate 1,\n\n365\n00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.230\nhave known MS config is where we\nconfigures start up options right?\n\n366\n00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.660\nAnd we do that in task manager today and\nit's a new feature.\n\n367\n00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.650\nSo they might test you\non something like that.\n\n368\n00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.610\nCortona, new feature inside of Windows 10.\n\n369\n00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:28.190\nMight expect one question,\nmaybe two questions on there.\n\n370\n00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.860\nSo anything we can do to help you.\n\n371\n00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.380\nNo worry pass this exam but\nknock it up to the ball park will help.\n\n372\n00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:34.890\nAll right.\n\n373\n00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:39.600\nSo, and then you could see various\ncategory settings again all time, place.\n\n374\n00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.690\nAgain these are just different\nreminder icons that you can set.\n\n375\n00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.335\nAll right.\nAnd if we want we can always add them,\n\n376\n00:18:46.335 --> 00:18:48.510\nwith a little plus button, right.\n\n377\n00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.890\nSo if I choose time, and\nI can choose the plus button, right.\n\n378\n00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.780\nWell what time do you wanna be remembered,\nor reminded, right?\n\n379\n00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.010\nSo you can do that as well.\n\n380\n00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:03.720\nIf we come back here to same thing,\nagain place I can add this.\n\n381\n00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:08.250\nI also have history and again if I\nwanna add a place I can do that.\n\n382\n00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.973\nSo.\n>> Once that we have the add places and\n\n383\n00:19:09.973 --> 00:19:13.148\nthings of that the nature before\nwe're able to voice activate them?\n\n384\n00:19:13.148 --> 00:19:17.756\n>> I don't believe you have to\nadd them first because it hate\n\n385\n00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:20.547\nCortana if I could say that right.\n\n386\n00:19:20.547 --> 00:19:21.102\n>> All right.\n\n387\n00:19:21.102 --> 00:19:25.050\n>> They hate Cortana option But\nI'm really not sure about that one.\n\n388\n00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.540\nSo I'll just have to say I'm not sure\non that I have to look a little bit\n\n389\n00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.750\nmore into it.\n\n390\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.550\nBut we also have things like for\ninstance the history.\n\n391\n00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.100\nIf you've been setting, if you've been\nusing Cortona and you've been looking\n\n392\n00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.430\nthrough different things again you can\ngo back through the history as well.\n\n393\n00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.580\nAll right so\na little bit about Cortona there.\n\n394\n00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:46.020\nRight, and if you want to provide things\nlike feedback, again it's up to you.\n\n395\n00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:50.884\nIt's much like bug reports, if you're\nsending that anonymous information out\n\n396\n00:19:50.884 --> 00:19:55.676\nto Microsoft or your customer experience\nimprovement programs that they use,\n\n397\n00:19:55.676 --> 00:19:57.730\nagain that's up to you.\n\n398\n00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.220\nYou can always choose cancel keep in mind\nthat it does do things like send screen\n\n399\n00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.680\nshots.\n\n400\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.530\nAnd that's a screenshot of your desktop,\nor whatever application.\n\n401\n00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:08.360\nSo keep that in mind again just for\nprivacy concerns.\n\n402\n00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.840\n>> That might be\nan interesting job to have.\n\n403\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.930\nLet's look at all the screenshots that\ncome in and see what the problem is.\n\n404\n00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:12.903\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> All right.\n\n405\n00:20:12.903 --> 00:20:13.411\n>> Whoa.\n\n406\n00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:15.280\n[LAUGH]\n>> Maybe we didn't wanna see that.\n\n407\n00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.729\n>> I've never seen a shaved bear before.\n\n408\n00:20:16.729 --> 00:20:19.066\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is a scary thing.\n\n409\n00:20:19.066 --> 00:20:20.184\nIt's crazy looking.\n\n410\n00:20:20.184 --> 00:20:21.677\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n411\n00:20:21.677 --> 00:20:23.648\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n412\n00:20:23.648 --> 00:20:29.050\nAll right, now the next thing we get into\nis everybody's favorite new browser,\n\n413\n00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.248\nMicrosoft Edge.\n\n414\n00:20:30.248 --> 00:20:30.981\n[LAUGH].\n\n415\n00:20:30.981 --> 00:20:32.915\nAnd again this is a newer feature.\n\n416\n00:20:32.915 --> 00:20:35.520\n>> Do I sense some facetiousness\nin your voice there Wes?\n\n417\n00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.080\n>> Maybe just a little.\n\n418\n00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.875\n>> Just a hair.\n>> Yeah just a little.\n\n419\n00:20:37.875 --> 00:20:41.545\nSo another thing that they call\nout are both of the browsers.\n\n420\n00:20:41.545 --> 00:20:44.535\nConfiguring, at least knowing\na little bit about those browsers.\n\n421\n00:20:44.535 --> 00:20:48.105\nSo we're gonna take you through\nthe Microsoft Edge as well\n\n422\n00:20:48.105 --> 00:20:49.525\nas Internet Explorer.\n\n423\n00:20:49.525 --> 00:20:51.775\nBut let's go ahead and\nstart out with Microsoft Edge.\n\n424\n00:20:51.775 --> 00:20:52.469\nNow.\n\n425\n00:20:52.469 --> 00:20:58.500\nThey do a very good job of not\nhooking you to use Internet Explorer.\n\n426\n00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.500\nLet's see this one, still does it.\n\n427\n00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.190\nIf I type in IE, it's actually coming up.\n\n428\n00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:08.100\nBut sometimes I can get Internet Explorer\nto come up on the screen, saved my life.\n\n429\n00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.330\nAnd that's because they want you\nto start moving to Edge browser.\n\n430\n00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.660\nAnd as it gets more support,\n\n431\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.780\nmore plugins and stuff,\nwe'll probably see it in use more.\n\n432\n00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:23.030\nSo if we launch Microsoft Edge,\nall right, and I want to make sure\n\n433\n00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:28.390\nthat we got some pretty clean pages here,\nbecause I want to show you, you know.\n\n434\n00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.050\nThe different locations that we\nhave in here that you can go to.\n\n435\n00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:36.530\nNow, the first thing that we have is\nwhat is known as the hub, all right?\n\n436\n00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:39.200\nAnd the hub, you can see these\nlittle lines, not the ellipse here.\n\n437\n00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.250\nBut, you can see the hub and if we choose\nthat, you can see things like your\n\n438\n00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:49.630\nfavorites, your reading list,\nhistory and downloads, right?\n\n439\n00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.660\nSome of this stuff you're probably\nfamiliar with in Explorer,\n\n440\n00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.690\nit's kind of buried under the hood if\nyou had to use this browser here, so\n\n441\n00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:01.290\ndo open it up once in a while for,\nif nothing else, if you don't use it,\n\n442\n00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:05.070\nat least for the exam purposes so you\ncan get these answers right on the exam.\n\n443\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.720\nAll right now, this is kind of\na new feature is the Web Note.\n\n444\n00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:16.290\nThe ability, if I wanted to, to be able to\ndraw on a Web page or add text if I want.\n\n445\n00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:21.310\nI know many times here at ITProTV if\nwe're studying something, I might wanna\n\n446\n00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:25.360\nsay okay yeah, this little note right\nthere, and I can save that if I want.\n\n447\n00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.220\n>> Just persistent.\n\n448\n00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.090\nEvery time I come back to the site,\nit'll show back up?\n\n449\n00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.870\n>> Absolutely, and that's nice.\n\n450\n00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:33.370\nIf you wanna add your notes, if you're\nlike a college student doing research,\n\n451\n00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.320\nyou go to a paper or a Web page right,\nyou're like yeah I really want that point.\n\n452\n00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.646\nI don't know if you've done this Dan.\n\n453\n00:22:38.646 --> 00:22:41.202\nThere's been times where I've\nwent back to my bookmarks and\n\n454\n00:22:41.202 --> 00:22:43.669\nI'm like what the heck did I\nbookmark that page for right?\n\n455\n00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:44.204\n>> Yeah.\n\n456\n00:22:44.204 --> 00:22:46.530\n>> It's that one little line\nall the way down at the bottom.\n\n457\n00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.200\nWell this gives you\nthe ability to say okay,\n\n458\n00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.150\nwell I'm gonna go in there and\nI'm gonna highlight it.\n\n459\n00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:55.650\nNow I can remember all of a sudden what\nit is that I was going to this page for.\n\n460\n00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:56.960\nAnd you can also share it too.\n\n461\n00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.190\nWe're gonna go ahead and\njust exit out of that.\n\n462\n00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.690\nBut that is very nice\nfeature being able to draw.\n\n463\n00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.980\nAnd then you got the share option to and\n\n464\n00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.830\nthe share option you can\nshare with one node.\n\n465\n00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:10.455\nYou can see, that kinda cool to the fact\nit pipes right down in the one node if\n\n466\n00:23:10.455 --> 00:23:13.882\nyou're using one node and\nthey will synchronize and interact.\n\n467\n00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.420\nNow that being said.\n\n468\n00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.280\nWe have, you know we think about the\nconfiguration settings that we need to set\n\n469\n00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.210\ntypically in different Web browsers,\nwell where are those?\n\n470\n00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.980\nWell that's where the ellipse\ncomes in up here.\n\n471\n00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.380\nIf we click on that,\n\n472\n00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.650\nhere's where you're gonna see some\nof the different settings, right?\n\n473\n00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:34.020\nYou have for instance developer\ntools which is kind of interesting.\n\n474\n00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.780\nNew window, new in private window,\nkeep in mind in private window doesn't\n\n475\n00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:43.640\nstore locally things like your cookies,\nif you will.\n\n476\n00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.460\nDoesn't store like your history,\nif you will.\n\n477\n00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.970\nAnd you can use that likewise.\n\n478\n00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.130\nFind on page zoom.\n\n479\n00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:55.610\nSome of these are you guys may\nhave seen these before already.\n\n480\n00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.580\nDeveloper Tools is kinda interesting.\n\n481\n00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:02.140\nI kinda like this,\nbecause when you look at Developer Tools,\n\n482\n00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.840\nall right, I'm not a developer.\n\n483\n00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.340\nI didn't understand any of that just\njumbled bit of developer text up here.\n\n484\n00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.064\n>> It looks cool, though.\n\n485\n00:24:09.064 --> 00:24:10.003\n>> [LAUGH] It really does.\n\n486\n00:24:10.003 --> 00:24:10.706\nIt really does.\n\n487\n00:24:10.706 --> 00:24:14.518\nIt kinda looks like a road map or\nsomething, you know, to a foreign country.\n\n488\n00:24:14.518 --> 00:24:20.240\n[LAUGH] But what I really like about this\nis they got a Performance tab in here.\n\n489\n00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.080\nAnd have you ever wondered how your\nweb browser's doing when you're\n\n490\n00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:28.410\nvisiting a site and why it's maybe\nnot acting the way it should?\n\n491\n00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.180\nWell, we can generate a profile.\n\n492\n00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.990\nAnd it can start to perform\na baseline of the performance\n\n493\n00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.230\nof the web browser when\nyou're visiting a website.\n\n494\n00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:38.178\nI don't know exactly how\nlong that's gonna take here,\n\n495\n00:24:38.178 --> 00:24:40.673\nhopefully we can just minimize it,\nwe'll come back to it once it does.\n\n496\n00:24:40.673 --> 00:24:41.786\n>> It's only a six hour process.\n\n497\n00:24:41.786 --> 00:24:43.049\n>> Yeah, that right, that's right.\n\n498\n00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:45.413\n[LAUGH] So\nthe performance of the Performance tab,\n\n499\n00:24:45.413 --> 00:24:46.770\nwe're gonna test that out.\n\n500\n00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.760\nSo that's kinda of a really\ncool thing too, but\n\n501\n00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.040\nhow about some of the more\nadvanced settings?\n\n502\n00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.840\nWell, that's where we can scroll down\nto the Settings feature, but I do wanna\n\n503\n00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:59.040\nmake mention, they do give you this\noption right here, if you guys can see.\n\n504\n00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:04.570\nOpen in Internet Explorer,\nbecause Edge is relatively new and\n\n505\n00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:09.490\nthey're kind of tip-toeing on how they\nintegrate things like add-ins because\n\n506\n00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:14.000\nthey want it to be more secure than\nhistorically Internet Explorer has been.\n\n507\n00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.700\nHowever, some sites,\nthey might not open up.\n\n508\n00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.232\nSo you can always come in here and\nsay open it up with Internet Explorer, and\n\n509\n00:25:19.232 --> 00:25:22.530\nit just takes that website and\nthrows it into Internet Explorer for\n\n510\n00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.820\nany compatibility problems\nthat might be happening.\n\n511\n00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.289\nAll right, so settings.\n\n512\n00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.250\nAll right,\nwe've got a basic set of settings.\n\n513\n00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.582\nThat's redundant there.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n514\n00:25:34.582 --> 00:25:36.651\n>> But we've got the theme, light, dark,\n\n515\n00:25:36.651 --> 00:25:37.310\nif you will.\n\n516\n00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:43.189\nFavorites bar, if we wanna show that\nwe can show that and start open with.\n\n517\n00:25:43.189 --> 00:25:45.900\nI wanna show you some of the things\nthat are more, I would say,\n\n518\n00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.472\nimportant to more of like\na business environment as well.\n\n519\n00:25:48.472 --> 00:25:50.750\nClear Browsing Data.\n\n520\n00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:55.030\nYou might remember this in Internet\nExplorer, obviously looking a little bit\n\n521\n00:25:55.030 --> 00:26:00.330\ndifferent but for the most part still\nasking you what you want to delete.\n\n522\n00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:05.106\nI will tell you it goes a lot farther than\nInternet Explorer does because it can\n\n523\n00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:09.812\nalso clear out things like location\npermissions, right, media license,\n\n524\n00:26:09.812 --> 00:26:13.431\nfull screen permissions,\ncompatibility permissions.\n\n525\n00:26:13.431 --> 00:26:17.481\nThey've really done a good job as to what\nyou can clear out of your browser if\n\n526\n00:26:17.481 --> 00:26:21.279\nyou're worried about these different\nthings being stored locally on\n\n527\n00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:22.450\nyour machine.\n\n528\n00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.330\nAnd it's just a simple as clicking Clear.\n\n529\n00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.680\nNow at any time,\nyou can hit the back arrow.\n\n530\n00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.810\nAnd we can go back into the settings.\n\n531\n00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:33.680\nNow these again,\nare just some of the basic settings, guys.\n\n532\n00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.489\nBut how about all the other cool\nthings that we like to configure,\n\n533\n00:26:37.489 --> 00:26:39.712\nsometimes need to configure more so.\n\n534\n00:26:39.712 --> 00:26:41.936\nAnd that's View Advanced Settings,\nright here.\n\n535\n00:26:41.936 --> 00:26:46.399\nAnd when we click this, this is where we\nget a lot of additional stuff, right?\n\n536\n00:26:46.399 --> 00:26:49.745\nYour pop-up blocker,\nwhether you wanna use Flash Player.\n\n537\n00:26:49.745 --> 00:26:51.633\nYou have the ability to turn it off,\nright?\n\n538\n00:26:51.633 --> 00:26:55.169\nIt's embedded, you don't need\nto go out to Adobe anymore and\n\n539\n00:26:55.169 --> 00:26:58.645\ndownload the Flash Player extension or\nanything like that.\n\n540\n00:26:58.645 --> 00:27:02.383\nAnd even though it's built in,\nyou can say no, I don't want Flash, right?\n\n541\n00:27:02.383 --> 00:27:03.620\nThis is a secure environment.\n\n542\n00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.510\nWe can't afford Flash,\ngo ahead and turn it off.\n\n543\n00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:08.500\nSo you also have that too.\n\n544\n00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.490\nA couple of the other ones here.\n\n545\n00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.700\nDo not track request, have Cortona\nassist me in Microsoft Edge, and then,\n\n546\n00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.830\nyour default search engine.\n\n547\n00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:21.680\nCookies, we can define it right here,\nas well.\n\n548\n00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.330\nMedia license, and then you can see\nhelp me protect from malicious sites.\n\n549\n00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.400\nThis is another one I\nwould always keep on.\n\n550\n00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.120\nThis is your SmartScreen Filter.\n\n551\n00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.105\nSmartScreen Filter has been in Windows for\nawhile.\n\n552\n00:27:32.105 --> 00:27:33.921\nIt's not a new technology certainly.\n\n553\n00:27:33.921 --> 00:27:38.258\nCertainly not new to Microsoft's Edge\nhere, but it does filter for\n\n554\n00:27:38.258 --> 00:27:43.207\nmalicious websites that are known to\npropagate things like phishing scams,\n\n555\n00:27:43.207 --> 00:27:47.033\nmalware, if you will,\nransomware, and stuff like that.\n\n556\n00:27:47.033 --> 00:27:51.674\nAs well as any applications, by the way,\nthat don't fall on a reputation list,\n\n557\n00:27:51.674 --> 00:27:56.319\nthat are unidentified by Windows, it will\nblock those from being downloaded and\n\n558\n00:27:56.319 --> 00:28:00.760\nrun on your computer,\nwhich is a pretty good security feature.\n\n559\n00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.360\nAll right so, that's pretty\nmuch our Microsoft Edge again.\n\n560\n00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.460\nThere's much more that you can do with it,\nbut I would know some of the settings.\n\n561\n00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.960\nAnd I would get in here and\nmess around with it.\n\n562\n00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.230\nGet in here and figure out,\nclick through some of the buttons, right?\n\n563\n00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:19.360\nNow, next thing we go to is\nnone other than everybody's\n\n564\n00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.090\nfavorite web browser and\nthat is Internet Explorer.\n\n565\n00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:22.850\n>> Old faithful.\n\n566\n00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:23.720\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n567\n00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.514\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So a couple of different ways, let me\n\n568\n00:28:26.514 --> 00:28:30.240\ngo ahead, I love the search functionality,\nI'm kind of leaning on it a little bit\n\n569\n00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.912\nhere cuz I love it so much, but let me\nshow you where Internet Explorer is.\n\n570\n00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:37.590\nAgain, just for those long drawn out\ntext based answers they might give you.\n\n571\n00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:41.300\nAll Apps, go ahead and\nscroll all the way to the bottom.\n\n572\n00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:45.780\nIf you go to Windows Accessories, Internet\nExplorer is right there at the top.\n\n573\n00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.120\nI'm gonna go ahead and-\n>> Pin that to Start.\n\n574\n00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.047\n[LAUGH]\n>> Pin that to\n\n575\n00:28:48.047 --> 00:28:48.751\nthe Start, and that's a good point.\n\n576\n00:28:48.751 --> 00:28:53.391\nThat's one thing I didn't show anybody on\nthe first one when we were talking about\n\n577\n00:28:53.391 --> 00:28:54.230\nthe taskbar.\n\n578\n00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:58.330\nAny one of these icons, I can right-click\non it and I can pin it to the taskbar or\n\n579\n00:28:58.330 --> 00:28:59.510\npin it to the Start.\n\n580\n00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:04.298\nAnd if I pin it to the Start,\nIt certainly doesn't pin it to the Start.\n\n581\n00:29:04.298 --> 00:29:05.732\n>> It did, it shows, right there.\n\n582\n00:29:05.732 --> 00:29:06.253\n>> Did I miss it?\n\n583\n00:29:06.253 --> 00:29:08.426\n>> It's on your right-hand side,\nin the tile right there.\n\n584\n00:29:08.426 --> 00:29:12.069\n>> There it is, right there on\nthe modern UI Apps tile there.\n\n585\n00:29:12.069 --> 00:29:15.254\nNow when we launched this,\n\n586\n00:29:15.254 --> 00:29:19.970\nlet me go ahead and close this down here.\n\n587\n00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:24.632\nAll right, and\nit's gotta do its first initial launch up\n\n588\n00:29:24.632 --> 00:29:27.660\ngoing to go.microsoft.com here.\n\n589\n00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.360\nSo we'll go ahead and\ngive that a chance to open up, and\n\n590\n00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.060\nI tell you, says it's not responding.\n\n591\n00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.400\nLet's see if we can get\nback to that performance.\n\n592\n00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.360\nI don't know if.\n\n593\n00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.800\n>> If that's causing any issues.\n\n594\n00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.200\n>> It might be because right\nnow it might be looking at it.\n\n595\n00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.500\nLet me go ahead and just take\na second here and close these down.\n\n596\n00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:47.780\nCuz I know that Internet Explorer's in\nthe middle of setting itself up for\n\n597\n00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:48.390\nthe first time.\n\n598\n00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:50.370\nSo this kinda bogs us\ndown a little bit there.\n\n599\n00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.790\nAll right, just give that a second there,\nit still says it's not responding,\n\n600\n00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:59.470\nI might just go ahead and\nkill the task here for a second.\n\n601\n00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:01.900\nThere we go.\n\n602\n00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:07.160\nAgain, the initial set up on Internet\nExplorer, it's gonna ask you to follow\n\n603\n00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:11.805\nthe recommended settings or ask me later,\nI wish it would have just asked me later.\n\n604\n00:30:11.805 --> 00:30:13.283\nCuz it's certainly taking a bit here.\n\n605\n00:30:15.827 --> 00:30:17.388\nThere we go.\n\n606\n00:30:17.388 --> 00:30:20.315\nAll right, this is kinda what\nI wanted to show you here.\n\n607\n00:30:20.315 --> 00:30:25.214\nLet me go ahead and\nuse recommended settings,\n\n608\n00:30:25.214 --> 00:30:28.610\nwe'll say OK, and there we go.\n\n609\n00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:31.321\nSo, with Internet Explorer,\n\n610\n00:30:31.321 --> 00:30:36.335\nit really hasn’t changed\ntoo much across 10 and 11.\n\n611\n00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:39.030\nSo if you're familiar with some of\nthe older ones, for the most part,\n\n612\n00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.680\nyou should be familiar with these.\n\n613\n00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.440\nBut we will take a second here and go\nthrough some of these settings likewise.\n\n614\n00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.060\nNow, when you go to the settings icon,\nit's a gear icon,\n\n615\n00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.060\ntools icon over here in\nthe upper right-hand corner,\n\n616\n00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.810\nyou will see that when you press this,\nyou have a series of options.\n\n617\n00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:56.740\nAll right, especially Internet options.\n\n618\n00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:01.130\nNow Internet options is one where they\ncould test you a good little bit.\n\n619\n00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:04.318\nFor your benefit though, I wanna show you\nthere's more than one way to do this.\n\n620\n00:31:04.318 --> 00:31:08.065\nIf I right-click on this blank area\nI can also choose, maybe some of you\n\n621\n00:31:08.065 --> 00:31:12.124\nguys remember this all the way back,\nI wanna say Internet Explorer 7 and 6,\n\n622\n00:31:12.124 --> 00:31:15.319\nthe traditional menu bar that\nused to be across the top here.\n\n623\n00:31:15.319 --> 00:31:16.206\n>> I love that thing.\n\n624\n00:31:16.206 --> 00:31:17.526\n>> I do too, I do too.\n\n625\n00:31:17.526 --> 00:31:20.490\nSo again, I configure this because\nI can just drop right down here to\n\n626\n00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.374\nInternet Options.\n\n627\n00:31:21.374 --> 00:31:26.810\nAnd I get a lot more than\nthe simplified gear icon.\n\n628\n00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:31.990\nBut since your default user maybe\nwon't change this setting for\n\n629\n00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:37.160\nthe exam, think of it as a user\nthat is using the defaults.\n\n630\n00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.680\nBut all different things\nthat you can do here.\n\n631\n00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.000\nSafety, I'll just spend a real\nquick second here in Safety.\n\n632\n00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.730\nDeleting your browsing history,\nit's just like what we looked at.\n\n633\n00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.035\nInterface is a little bit different.\n\n634\n00:31:48.035 --> 00:31:52.366\nInPrivate Browsing, Tracking Protection,\nand then SmartScreen Filter.\n\n635\n00:31:52.366 --> 00:31:57.410\nIt'll show you the traditional graphical\nuser interface for SmartScreen Filter.\n\n636\n00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.660\nNotice it says, Turn off.\n\n637\n00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.350\nI go ahead and\nturn it on as a recommended setting.\n\n638\n00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.950\nAnd it's, hopefully, protecting me.\n\n639\n00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.576\nBut now I wanna go down\nto Internet options, and\n\n640\n00:32:06.576 --> 00:32:09.804\nthis is where we're gonna spend\na little bit more time in.\n\n641\n00:32:09.804 --> 00:32:13.680\nCuz I did want you to be aware of this for\nthe exam, cuz if you are supporting people\n\n642\n00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.511\nin a Windows environment, a lot of times\nthey're using their native browser.\n\n643\n00:32:17.511 --> 00:32:21.617\nAnd it could be important general tabs,\nsome of the things that we can do,\n\n644\n00:32:21.617 --> 00:32:23.030\nHomepage.\n\n645\n00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.478\nWe can do Startup, right?\n\n646\n00:32:24.478 --> 00:32:26.532\nSome of the things that we've said,\nand delete our browsing history.\n\n647\n00:32:26.532 --> 00:32:31.290\nNow, if we delete our browsing history,\nit looks pretty, it's close to the same.\n\n648\n00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:34.050\nEdge does give you a little\nbit more control over what\n\n649\n00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:35.490\ncan be cleared out of the browser.\n\n650\n00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.080\nAll right, we'll choose Cancel to that.\n\n651\n00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.190\nAnd then we also have Appearance, right?\n\n652\n00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.200\nWe can change things like color,\nlanguage, fonts, and\n\n653\n00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.470\nsome of the accessibility as well.\n\n654\n00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:51.420\nNow the next tab's very, very important\nand I would know about this next tab.\n\n655\n00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:55.500\nAll right, just because this has to do\nwith some of the security features that\n\n656\n00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.950\nare inside of Internet Explorer,\nall right.\n\n657\n00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:02.500\nWhen you look at these, what are known\nas security zones, security settings\n\n658\n00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:07.530\nare gonna be applied based on the security\nzone that your website falls under.\n\n659\n00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:12.260\nNow by default, all Internet websites\nfall under well, the Internet zone.\n\n660\n00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.979\nAnd you can see that the security is\nmedium-high, and it says appropriate for\n\n661\n00:33:16.979 --> 00:33:18.494\nmost websites, right?\n\n662\n00:33:18.494 --> 00:33:22.020\nUnsigned ActiveX controls will\nnot be downloaded, right?\n\n663\n00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.200\nSo if an ActiveX control\ngoes to try to download,\n\n664\n00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.470\nthey're gonna check that\ndigital signature on it.\n\n665\n00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.100\nThey don't recognize it, or\nit doesn't have a digital signature,\n\n666\n00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.090\nit's gonna block it, right?\n\n667\n00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:35.307\nBut we could, put this slider up here,\nall right, and\n\n668\n00:33:35.307 --> 00:33:38.710\nthis again, is gonna be more restrictive.\n\n669\n00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:42.110\nYou might find that websites don't\nreally work as you expected.\n\n670\n00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:47.470\nSo that's up to you whether\nyou turn that up or down.\n\n671\n00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:51.512\nThis Protected Mode, I know, Dan,\nyou work with other operating systems.\n\n672\n00:33:51.512 --> 00:33:54.810\nYou probably heard of that,\nno execute bit, where basically,\n\n673\n00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:56.360\njust a quarantined portion of memory,\n\n674\n00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.520\nwe say, go ahead, software, put your code\nin there, but you're not gonna execute.\n\n675\n00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.970\nSo that's one of the things that,\n\n676\n00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:04.550\nI think that came out in Window, or\nInternet Explorer 7 where they said, okay,\n\n677\n00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:08.420\nwe're gonna use that data execution\nprotection, is what Microsoft calls it.\n\n678\n00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.591\nIt's all based on the no execute bit.\n\n679\n00:34:10.591 --> 00:34:16.080\nAnd then we can always just customize\nthese and get very granular, if you want.\n\n680\n00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.420\nLocal Internet,\nLocal Internet is typically for\n\n681\n00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:23.470\nbusiness websites and\nyour company's website where you trust it.\n\n682\n00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:26.720\nYou can see that for this it's medium-low.\n\n683\n00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.000\nBe careful with trusted sites, right?\n\n684\n00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.900\nBecause trusted sites are ones that you're\n\n685\n00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.840\nabsolutely sure are not gonna\ncause damage to your computers.\n\n686\n00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:42.340\nI know we had, for a company that I worked\nfor, we had about 10 to 15 employees\n\n687\n00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:48.190\ncoming in, and they were doing training\nvia a US government website and\n\n688\n00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.020\nthey needed to be able to access\nthat website without any problems.\n\n689\n00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.270\nSo we went ahead and\nwe put it in the Trusted Site, and\n\n690\n00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:56.100\nthey were able to use the full\nfunctionality of the website, not having\n\n691\n00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:00.530\nto worry about different aspects of their\nuser experience being restrictive, and\n\n692\n00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:02.130\nthey couldn't do what they wanted to do.\n\n693\n00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:06.700\nHowever, make sure that if you put\na site in here, you truly trust it, and\n\n694\n00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.780\nwhen you add a site and\nclick this button, and\n\n695\n00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:14.850\nby default it wants to add the HTTPS\nextension until you uncheck that.\n\n696\n00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:19.680\nSo you can add websites to the trusted\nlocation that don’t necessarily have\n\n697\n00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.360\nan SSL certificate attached to them,\nand I've had to do that a bunch.\n\n698\n00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:28.820\nAll right, last one is probably\npretty self-explanatory.\n\n699\n00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.000\nThis is the Restricted sites.\n\n700\n00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.430\nBasically, there's an easier\nway with the Restricted sites.\n\n701\n00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.282\nDon't visit them.\n\n702\n00:35:35.282 --> 00:35:36.844\n>> [LAUGH] Just don't go there.\n\n703\n00:35:36.844 --> 00:35:42.660\n>> I mean, just don't visit them,\nbut there might be maybe a reason.\n\n704\n00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.037\nI can't think of one\noff the top of my head,\n\n705\n00:35:44.037 --> 00:35:46.047\nthat you might want to put\nsomething in the Restricted sites.\n\n706\n00:35:46.047 --> 00:35:50.258\nBut understand that it is really gonna\nreduce the functionality of the website\n\n707\n00:35:50.258 --> 00:35:53.590\nbecause we consider that it might\nbe harmful to our computer.\n\n708\n00:35:55.020 --> 00:36:00.310\nAll right, last one here that I kinda\nwanna talk about are the privacy settings.\n\n709\n00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:05.120\nThis is really how cookies\nare gonna be handled, right?\n\n710\n00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.320\nThird party cookies,\ndo we wanna allow them?\n\n711\n00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.750\nDo we not wanna allow them?\n\n712\n00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:12.549\nAgain, we can go into the Advanced here\nand we can say, okay, First-party Cookies,\n\n713\n00:36:12.549 --> 00:36:13.300\nwe'll Accept.\n\n714\n00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.051\nMaybe Third-party Cookies we'll Block.\n\n715\n00:36:17.051 --> 00:36:19.404\nOr maybe we're not real restrictive and\nwe just say hey,\n\n716\n00:36:19.404 --> 00:36:22.720\nI just want to be aware of it when\na third party cookie is being used.\n\n717\n00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.150\nAll right, and\nwe can say always allow session, right?\n\n718\n00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:29.360\nThe other thing here,\nlocation, location, location.\n\n719\n00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.230\nIt says, never allow websites to\nrequest your physical location.\n\n720\n00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:37.015\nThat's good from a security standpoint\nwhen you talk about a managed environment.\n\n721\n00:36:37.015 --> 00:36:39.130\nPop-up Blocker, guys,\nyou guys are smart out there,\n\n722\n00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.368\nthat's as simple as turning\nthe Pop-up Blocker on and off.\n\n723\n00:36:41.368 --> 00:36:43.500\nAnd then In-Private browsing,\n\n724\n00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:48.320\nthis is more of a little bit more\nsecurity when you're in private browsing.\n\n725\n00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.930\nIt says don't even allow the toolbars or\nextensions like your search providers or\n\n726\n00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:56.000\nanything to run inside of\nthe in-private browser.\n\n727\n00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.950\nAll right, and Dan, I'm gonna kinda\ngo off the beaten path here just talk\n\n728\n00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.560\nreal briefly about these last ones.\n\n729\n00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:08.440\nContent certificates, if you have them\nstored, user certificates autocomplete.\n\n730\n00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.210\nYou have some of the different\nvarious feeds and websites.\n\n731\n00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.080\nI'll show you the autocomplete\nhere real quick.\n\n732\n00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:17.327\nWe could say what do we want\nto use autocomplete for?\n\n733\n00:37:17.327 --> 00:37:18.271\nMaybe in a security environment.\n\n734\n00:37:18.271 --> 00:37:20.018\nI know I've had to uncheck\nthis one right here.\n\n735\n00:37:20.018 --> 00:37:21.350\nWe don't wanna store user names and\n\n736\n00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:24.490\npasswords on forums and\nask me before saving.\n\n737\n00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:27.030\nI could uncheck that and\nthen I could manage or\n\n738\n00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:31.140\nI could even delete\nthe autocomplete settings.\n\n739\n00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:35.580\nConnections, VPN communications,\nwe can set up VPNs here if we want.\n\n740\n00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.020\nPrograms, we can define how\nprograms interact with the browser.\n\n741\n00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.640\nAnd last but not least,\nlike I was telling you,\n\n742\n00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:46.280\nyou can get very, very granular\ncontrol over the Advanced tab.\n\n743\n00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.197\nAnd I will tell you, if you have somebody\nthat messes around with the browser and\n\n744\n00:37:50.197 --> 00:37:54.467\ndoesn't know exactly what they've changed\nand they can't figure out how to change it\n\n745\n00:37:54.467 --> 00:37:57.294\nback, well,\nthat's where the good old Reset comes in.\n\n746\n00:37:57.294 --> 00:38:00.581\nAnd there's been times where I've\nhad malware get into the browser and\n\n747\n00:38:00.581 --> 00:38:04.510\nstart to configure it, and you can't\nfigure out why it's not working well.\n\n748\n00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:07.550\nYou hit the Reset button,\nyou can also delete the personal settings.\n\n749\n00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:11.960\nYou hit the Reset, it goes through its\nprocess, and it tells you it requires\n\n750\n00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.470\na restart for Internet Explorer,\nthese settings to take effect.\n\n751\n00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:18.560\nYou shut the browser down, you relaunch\nit, it's back to the default settings.\n\n752\n00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.100\nAnd hopefully, with a little bit of\nantivirus software, you can get the virus\n\n753\n00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.900\noff of there and restore your\nbrowser to the original state.\n\n754\n00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.340\nBut Dan, that, in a nutshell,\n\n755\n00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.580\nhelps us with some of our\npost-installation options.\n\n756\n00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:29.850\n>> Awesome stuff, Wes.\n\n757\n00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:34.290\nWe now have a better idea, right,\na better picture of what we're doing,\n\n758\n00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.990\ngetting us out of our browsers,\nusing all the different bells and\n\n759\n00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.810\nwhistles that we can turn and\ntweak and have a lot of fun with.\n\n760\n00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:43.700\nAnd if you're a knob turner, if you're\na button flipper like probably Wes and\n\n761\n00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.450\nI are, you're gonna love this, cuz\nthere's plenty of stuff to go through and\n\n762\n00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.530\nfigure out what does this do,\nhow's that work.\n\n763\n00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:51.120\nAnd Wes, you've done a great job\nof walking us through a lot of\n\n764\n00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.040\nthose features.\n\n765\n00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.950\nBut there's definitely plenty more that\nyou guys can go through yourselves and\n\n766\n00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.040\nfigure out how they work on your own time.\n\n767\n00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.800\nThat being said, speaking of time, we\nhave fully run out of it on this episode.\n\n768\n00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.500\nSo we're gonna go ahead and shut her down.\n\n769\n00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.430\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n770\n00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:06.280\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n771\n00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.261\n>> But we'll see you next time.\n\n772\n00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:14.408\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:18.331\nI am your host, Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:21.861\nIn today's episode,\nwe are continuing on with more Windows 10.\n\n5\n00:00:21.861 --> 00:00:24.724\nAnd joining us back in the studio again,\nour mentor,\n\n6\n00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:27.670\nour guiding star on this journey,\nour Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.520\nWes, welcome to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.347\nSir, how's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:29.347 --> 00:00:30.198\n>> Man, it's going great.\n\n10\n00:00:30.198 --> 00:00:34.552\nThat's right, we get to dive in to some\nmore of the enterprise level stuff today,\n\n11\n00:00:34.552 --> 00:00:37.139\nand we're moving through our Windows 10,\nand\n\n12\n00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:40.566\nthat is the second Windows 10\nexam unit for the MCSA 7698.\n\n13\n00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.600\nAnd today we're going to be\nlooking at provisioning packages.\n\n14\n00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.990\nThat's one of the things that they\ncall out as far as the objectives go.\n\n15\n00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.987\nBut the way that they want you to\nprovision packages is with a newer\n\n16\n00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:55.390\ntechnology called\nthe Windows Image Configuration Designer.\n\n17\n00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.840\nAnd this one is new to Windows 10,\n\n18\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.500\nso you can probably expect to see\nsomething on the exam about it.\n\n19\n00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.120\nSo we wanna try and make sure that you're\naware of what you can do with it, and\n\n20\n00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.680\nas well,\nshow you little bit about how to use it.\n\n21\n00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.450\nNow, and from here on out,\nguys, image, configuration,\n\n22\n00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.010\ndesigner, I'm just gonna call it ICD,\nguys.\n\n23\n00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.700\nSo I'm gonna hit you with an acronym for\nthe rest of this episode, so\n\n24\n00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.300\njust be aware of that.\n\n25\n00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.310\nIt's part of what's known as\nthe Windows Assessment and\n\n26\n00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.270\nDeployment Kit, Windows ADK.\n\n27\n00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.530\nSo let's kinda talk a little bit\nabout what this allows us to do.\n\n28\n00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.293\nThis allows us to prepare images.\n\n29\n00:01:32.293 --> 00:01:35.521\nYou might have remembered in\nearlier editions of Windows,\n\n30\n00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:39.210\nyou would use something known as\nthe Windows System Image Manager.\n\n31\n00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.150\nAnd what was WinSIM?\n\n32\n00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.350\nWinSIM was a way to\ncreate an answer file so\n\n33\n00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.950\nthat if you are doing image deployment,\nyou could automate the process, and\n\n34\n00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.350\nthen we wouldn't have to sit down at the\ncomputer here and answer these questions.\n\n35\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.050\nWhat is the first user?\n\n36\n00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.350\nType in the username and the password,\nall the keyboard arrangement.\n\n37\n00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.752\nEven for that matter, join the domain.\n\n38\n00:01:57.752 --> 00:01:59.519\nWe could just create an answer file,\n\n39\n00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.780\nwhich like we talked about when we\nmentioned in a previous episode.\n\n40\n00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.370\nLike for instance, USMT,\nit uses XML-based configuration.\n\n41\n00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.880\nSo what would happen is when you\nconnect to the deployment server,\n\n42\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.320\nfirst thing you do is you pull down WinPE,\nand\n\n43\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.050\nthe next thing you would do\nis you pull down your image.\n\n44\n00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.691\nNow, as a part of the image, as these\nconfiguration passes go, it would also\n\n45\n00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:22.052\nlook back to the deployment server and\nwould pull down the answer file,\n\n46\n00:02:22.052 --> 00:02:26.197\ntypically called an unattended file,and it\nwould answer all these questions for you,\n\n47\n00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:27.490\nautomating the process.\n\n48\n00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.089\nWell, with the Windows 10,\n\n49\n00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.717\nwe have something that allows us to\ndo pretty much that same thing, but\n\n50\n00:02:32.717 --> 00:02:36.110\nwe can also baking things like\nwhat they call deployment assets.\n\n51\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.070\nSo, if I have drivers that I wanna go\na little bit further and not just entering\n\n52\n00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.230\nthe runtime configuration, but we wanna\nbake in things like Windows updates and\n\n53\n00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.120\ndrivers and language packages,\nwe can do that.\n\n54\n00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.610\nAnd what we can do is turn around and\n\n55\n00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.670\nbundle the whole thing\nup into one package.\n\n56\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.200\nAnd then like we've shown you with\nthe Deployment Image Servicing Manager,\n\n57\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.030\nif I've got that image\nsitting up on the server, and\n\n58\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.240\nI need to to do offline servicing,\nno problem.\n\n59\n00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.370\nWe can mount that image, slipstream the\npackage in, and then when we deploy it out\n\n60\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.590\nto our computers, well,\nwe've got the configurations that we need.\n\n61\n00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.412\nSo that's a little bit about\nwhat the Windows, or ICD is,\n\n62\n00:03:11.412 --> 00:03:14.230\nI'm gonna get that wrong if I keep trying.\n\n63\n00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.880\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n64\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.970\n>> ICD does for us, so let's go ahead,\nand let's jump right in here.\n\n65\n00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.890\nI've got a Windows machine here\nalready ready to go for us, and\n\n66\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.095\nthis is in the same location.\n\n67\n00:03:26.095 --> 00:03:28.470\nJust look at some of these\ndeployment tools again, so\n\n68\n00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.760\nyou're aware of where they are.\n\n69\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.308\nWe're gonna dive down in\nhere to our C: here, and\n\n70\n00:03:34.308 --> 00:03:40.407\nthen we'll jump into Program Files x86,\nthen we're gonna be in the Windows Kits.\n\n71\n00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:43.484\nAnd for me,\nWindows Kits are only gonna be 10.\n\n72\n00:03:43.484 --> 00:03:44.912\nYou could see 8.1 here.\n\n73\n00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:48.147\nYou could, if you're still\nmaybe doing configurations for\n\n74\n00:03:48.147 --> 00:03:50.693\n8.1, you can have more\nthan one kit in here.\n\n75\n00:03:50.693 --> 00:03:54.362\nSo you wanna go with the one that says 10,\nbecause hence, Windows 10.\n\n76\n00:03:54.362 --> 00:03:57.825\nAnd then on top of that, we're gonna dive\ndown in here into the assessment and\n\n77\n00:03:57.825 --> 00:03:58.855\ndeployment toolkit.\n\n78\n00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:01.736\nRemember, this is ADK, and a part of ADK,\n\n79\n00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:06.882\nyou could see here is the Imaging and\nConfiguration Designer, right?\n\n80\n00:04:06.882 --> 00:04:11.670\nSo just know where that path is\njust in case they ask you about it.\n\n81\n00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.490\nNow, to launch this, we don't launch\nit from inside of this location.\n\n82\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.300\nThank goodness, we've got our start\nmenu that, yes, has returned.\n\n83\n00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.110\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ngo to our start menu.\n\n84\n00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.970\nWe'll go to the all apps option and\nscroll all the way down, and\n\n85\n00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.310\naround the area of our Windows accessories\nand administrative functionality,\n\n86\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.630\nif you happen to have RSAT installed,\nyou will see Windows Kits.\n\n87\n00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.140\nAnd in Windows Kits, you'll notice,\n\n88\n00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.200\ndon't worry about these new options,\nit just means recently installed.\n\n89\n00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.340\nYou could see that the Windows\nSystem Image Manager, it's still\n\n90\n00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.460\npart of the deployment kits where we\ncould create those unattend files,\n\n91\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.300\nbut again, new to Windows 10,\n\n92\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.030\nwe now have the Windows Imaging and\nConfiguration Designer, or ICD.\n\n93\n00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.540\nNotice that this does\nrequire local administrative\n\n94\n00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.290\nprivileges in order to run it,\nhence the UAC triggering, all right?\n\n95\n00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.690\nAnd man, I tell you, looks like a lot\nof stuff here, doesn't it, Dan?\n\n96\n00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.315\n>> Yeah, very, very overwhelming.\n\n97\n00:05:12.315 --> 00:05:12.988\nThat's right.\n\n98\n00:05:12.988 --> 00:05:13.742\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n99\n00:05:13.742 --> 00:05:15.738\nThey've made it a little\nbit more simplistic.\n\n100\n00:05:15.738 --> 00:05:20.110\nAnd the one reason that I say that is that\nby comparison, if you were to start to\n\n101\n00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.885\nopen up, like for instance, the Windows\nSystem Image Manager, when it opened up,\n\n102\n00:05:24.885 --> 00:05:28.115\nand you would load in your\nimage to start the answer file,\n\n103\n00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:30.234\nyou'd have a lot of confusing text.\n\n104\n00:05:30.234 --> 00:05:33.822\nSo they've actually made this interface\nsimplistic and more tile-based,\n\n105\n00:05:33.822 --> 00:05:36.912\nlike pretty much everything else,\nas in Windows products today,\n\n106\n00:05:36.912 --> 00:05:40.290\nwhether it's server or\nwhether that's the client side.\n\n107\n00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.560\nNow, the first thing that we have to do,\n\n108\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.770\nwe'll look at a couple\nof different things.\n\n109\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.040\nIf I've already got a project ready to go,\nI can open it, and\n\n110\n00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.170\nI can modify it from here.\n\n111\n00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.580\nSo that's a good thing, so you can always,\nIf you already got your package created,\n\n112\n00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.740\nyou just point this to that, or\npoint this software to that package, and\n\n113\n00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.300\nthen you could make further modifications,\nwhich is nice, and which is really nice.\n\n114\n00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.462\nHere's that Windows image\ncustomization as well, but again,\n\n115\n00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:05.987\nwhat they call out on the exam is\nprovisioning packages there with ICD.\n\n116\n00:06:05.987 --> 00:06:08.692\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nand we're gonna create.\n\n117\n00:06:08.692 --> 00:06:12.430\nHere you can see a new\nprovisioning package, all right?\n\n118\n00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.680\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nclick that tile.\n\n119\n00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.450\nNow, there's a couple of things that\nit's gonna do once we launched it.\n\n120\n00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.990\nIt's gonna ask us to enter a name.\n\n121\n00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.175\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead,\nI'll just keep Project 1 here,\n\n122\n00:06:21.175 --> 00:06:22.935\nI'll just leave the defaults.\n\n123\n00:06:22.935 --> 00:06:28.403\nNow, I will tell you,\nlook at this crazy long path, all right.\n\n124\n00:06:28.403 --> 00:06:30.920\nYou could see that's in the user profile,\nin this case Admin.\n\n125\n00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.790\nI'm logged in documents, and man, look\nat that long name, Windows Imaging and\n\n126\n00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.869\nConfiguration Designer.\n\n127\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.880\nIf you worked with a command prompt,\nyou'll know that that's\n\n128\n00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.403\nactually a very bad pain to try to type\nin every time, because all those spaces.\n\n129\n00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:46.689\nSo I'll tell you to make it a little\nbit easier when I'm working with it.\n\n130\n00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:49.870\nThis is just a personal\npreference here guys,\n\n131\n00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.710\nI don't think it's gonna\nbother you either way.\n\n132\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.009\nI would know this path, though, so you can\nknow that it gets stored in the admin or\n\n133\n00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:02.649\nthe current user that's logged in their\nprofile when you're making these projects.\n\n134\n00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:07.361\nBut for me, I like to make this\na little bit more simplistic, and\n\n135\n00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:08.686\nI will go down to.\n\n136\n00:07:08.686 --> 00:07:11.080\nAnd this is for the purposes of\nbeing in the command prompt.\n\n137\n00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.518\nI don't like to have to type those big,\nlong paths, and\n\n138\n00:07:14.518 --> 00:07:18.486\nanybody that's seen [LAUGH] some\nof my typing knows why for sure.\n\n139\n00:07:18.486 --> 00:07:20.855\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna select local disk C.\n\n140\n00:07:20.855 --> 00:07:25.766\nI'm gonna make a new folder,\nand I'm gonna call it WICD, and\n\n141\n00:07:25.766 --> 00:07:30.027\nwe are going to put our projects in there,\nall right?\n\n142\n00:07:30.027 --> 00:07:32.781\nNow, again, know the path that\nwe just showed you for the exam,\n\n143\n00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:34.120\ncuz it might come up.\n\n144\n00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.820\nHowever, in really real-life land, I would\nmake that a little bit easier to type for\n\n145\n00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.380\nyou, and that's one of\nthe ways that you could do it.\n\n146\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.560\nAll right, so you can use your description\nif you want, we could put a description.\n\n147\n00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.396\nWe'll say, this is\n\n148\n00:07:51.396 --> 00:07:57.945\nITProTV's test package.\n\n149\n00:07:57.945 --> 00:08:02.119\nAll right, so we'll go ahead,\nand we'll choose next on that.\n\n150\n00:08:02.119 --> 00:08:05.496\nNow this is what, this is another thing\nthat's really, really cool about that.\n\n151\n00:08:05.496 --> 00:08:08.780\nWhat settings do you want\nstart working with, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:15.550\nNow, here's where ICD starts\nto I'd say outshine winSIM.\n\n153\n00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.120\nRight, in some of it's limited\nabilities because winSIM you\n\n154\n00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.769\nhave to have your image.\n\n155\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.430\nLoad up your image and\n\n156\n00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:25.740\nthe settings are that, that are provided\ninside of the image you've loaded up.\n\n157\n00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.950\nI haven't loaded an image and\n\n158\n00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.510\nnotice that it gives me the ability to\nchoose what settings I wanna view and\n\n159\n00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.300\nwhat settings we're gonna be applying and\nconfiguring, right?\n\n160\n00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.280\nI've got something that's\ncommon to all Windows editions.\n\n161\n00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.270\nYou can see right here Desktop editions,\nmobile editions, right.\n\n162\n00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:48.010\nIf we're Windows 10 Mobile or Windows 10\nMobile Enterprise, or even the arm base.\n\n163\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.980\nRemember we said back in our implementing\nWindows that we now have IoT,\n\n164\n00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.380\nInternet of things, and you can put that\non a raspberry pi, well, there you go.\n\n165\n00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.710\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\njust do common to all Windows editions.\n\n166\n00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.230\nAnd then from here we just choose next.\n\n167\n00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.400\nNow if you already have\na provision package, right,\n\n168\n00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.490\nyou can slip stream it in and load it up.\n\n169\n00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.770\nIt's optional,\nif you wanna do that you can.\n\n170\n00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:19.280\nWe haven't created a package yet\nso we don't have that option and\n\n171\n00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.490\nwe'll choose finish.\n\n172\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.070\nAnd then you can see right here\nit starts to load those settings.\n\n173\n00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.990\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n174\n00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.870\nAnd that's where maybe some of\nyou guys have seen the Windows\n\n175\n00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.670\nsystem image manager,\nthis does a lot better.\n\n176\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.490\nIt's got those settings, already.\n\n177\n00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.540\nI don't need to say, Hey Dan do you\nremember where we put that ISO?\n\n178\n00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.934\nDan says, well let me look through my\nfolders on my desktop, I'm not finding it.\n\n179\n00:09:38.934 --> 00:09:42.160\nWe don't have to just launch the ICD and\nthose settings are there.\n\n180\n00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.270\nAnd here we are we're starting\nto work with the package.\n\n181\n00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:51.280\nNow there are a couple of different\nthings that we need to be\n\n182\n00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.170\naware of when it comes to\nprovisioning packages okay.\n\n183\n00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.950\nWe're gonna come back\nto deployment assets.\n\n184\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.231\nFirst we're gonna start with\nsome run time settings so\n\n185\n00:10:00.231 --> 00:10:02.078\nwe're gonna set a couple of user accounts.\n\n186\n00:10:02.078 --> 00:10:06.362\nNow the deployment assets and this is\nanother thing you can bake in images to\n\n187\n00:10:06.362 --> 00:10:10.520\nyour project, your provisioning\npackage that you're creating here.\n\n188\n00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.380\nAnd we're going to actually do that.\n\n189\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.100\nI have a Windows update\nthat we're going to show.\n\n190\n00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.700\nAnd we're actually going to slip stream\na Windows update into this package,\n\n191\n00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.440\nbut we'll come back and do that.\n\n192\n00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.150\nFirst thing that we're going to do\nis look at the run time settings.\n\n193\n00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.840\nAnd with the run time settings.\n\n194\n00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.290\nThis is where you start to get\nyour configurations, right?\n\n195\n00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.040\nDo I want a user account created?\n\n196\n00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.360\nDo I want it to be joined to the domain?\n\n197\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.015\nDo I want Windows Defender to do certain\nthings to some of the components inside of\n\n198\n00:10:34.015 --> 00:10:35.020\nyour operating system?\n\n199\n00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.309\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're going to expand this out.\n\n200\n00:10:40.852 --> 00:10:43.605\nAll right, now, when we expand it out,\nyou're gonna see that there\n\n201\n00:10:43.605 --> 00:10:48.500\nare a series of settings and\na whole laundry list of them, right?\n\n202\n00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.910\nWe're gonna ahead and\nstart with accounts up here at the top so\n\n203\n00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.630\nyou kind of get an idea as to what it is\nthat we're really doing with this thing.\n\n204\n00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.830\nAll right, when I expand out accounts,\n\n205\n00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:01.260\nwe can create a computer account,\nwe can create a user account.\n\n206\n00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.830\nHow and\nwhat you do is up to your environment.\n\n207\n00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.330\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna select users.\n\n208\n00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.890\nAll right and here, it's very easy,\nthey say well, guess what.\n\n209\n00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.320\nJust enter the user name.\n\n210\n00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.510\nIn WinSim you'd have to go\nover to the properties and\n\n211\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.480\nyou'd modify the properties of\nthe object and it wouldn't be this easy.\n\n212\n00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.520\nYou'd have to know what\nvalues to set true or false.\n\n213\n00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.840\nHere I just type Admin.\n\n214\n00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.110\nMaybe I want Admin slipstreamed\ninto this computer.\n\n215\n00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.970\nIn fact, because I've used\nAdmin on some of these images,\n\n216\n00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.710\nI'll probably just put Admin03 to\nmake sure there's no conflict.\n\n217\n00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.140\nBut either way,\nthe principle's still the same.\n\n218\n00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:41.530\nAll right now, next thing we'll do\nis we'll go ahead and choose Add.\n\n219\n00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.562\nAnd this is kind of cool, again, compared\nback to the Windows system image manager,\n\n220\n00:11:45.562 --> 00:11:47.192\nyou used to put these settings in.\n\n221\n00:11:47.192 --> 00:11:49.812\nAnd then, you would validate\nyour answer file at the end,\n\n222\n00:11:49.812 --> 00:11:52.350\nto make sure that the settings were valid.\n\n223\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.910\nWell, this tells you are right way,\n\n224\n00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.180\nyou don't have to go though a validation\nprocess, if I can say that right?\n\n225\n00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.805\nI don't know how to\nvalidate my words here.\n\n226\n00:11:59.805 --> 00:12:01.950\nIf you go through the validation process,\n\n227\n00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.130\nyou don't have to do this at the end,\nbecause it's letting you know,\n\n228\n00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.190\nhey there is something you need\nto take a look at right away.\n\n229\n00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.890\nWell what is that?\n\n230\n00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.680\n>> So it's evaluating it in real time so\nthat you don't have to go through and\n\n231\n00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.360\ngo well is that red?\n\n232\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.880\nI don't know.\nIt's sometimes hard to read and\n\n233\n00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.930\ngo through a file even though you\nknow you put those answers in.\n\n234\n00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:20.965\nIt can be kind of a pain.\n\n235\n00:12:20.965 --> 00:12:25.011\n[CROSSTALK] Most definitely because\nthink about it this way Danny,\n\n236\n00:12:25.011 --> 00:12:27.550\nif you're doing your research, right?\n\n237\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.700\nAnd you've got your build list,\nwhatever your build list might be,\n\n238\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.220\nyou have to use Winzip.\n\n239\n00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.180\nI have to go through maybe an hour or\n\n240\n00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.610\nmaybe hours of configuring\nthe components that I want.\n\n241\n00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.100\nOnly to validate it at the end and\nhave four or\n\n242\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.350\nfive of those settings that you'd been\nworking on for the last hour, two hours.\n\n243\n00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.010\n>> Wrong.\n>> Tell you that's wrong, right?\n\n244\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.400\nHere it lets you know just\nlike Dan said in real time.\n\n245\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.630\nSo I know that there's something\nright away that I have to address.\n\n246\n00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:51.940\nAnd it's letting me know.\n\n247\n00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.680\nNotice that it's under accounts, right and\nI just follow the breadcrumb trail here.\n\n248\n00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.700\nI know its password, right?\n\n249\n00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.500\nI got a password that I have to set and\nthat's what it's telling me.\n\n250\n00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.440\nNotice the validation errors, right?\n\n251\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.819\nReal time validation,\nnot waiting until the end.\n\n252\n00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:13.590\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll put in a super secret password.\n\n253\n00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.530\nAll right now,\nI don't have to hit anything.\n\n254\n00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:16.930\nI really don't have to hit enter.\n\n255\n00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.190\nBut you'll notice that guess what,\nall the warnings are gone.\n\n256\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.440\nIt says you got a password now,\nreal-time validation, you're good.\n\n257\n00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.860\nMove on to whatever the next might be.\n\n258\n00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.870\nSo for us the next might be,\nwe're gonna create a standard user.\n\n259\n00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.520\nAll right, and you know what?\n\n260\n00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.870\nWhile we're here, let me go ahead and\njust finish the configuration,\n\n261\n00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.690\nrather than doing them separate.\n\n262\n00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.670\nWe're going to go to user group.\n\n263\n00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.980\nAnd notice that the user\ngroup isn't configured.\n\n264\n00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.650\nIf I choose this drop down list, Dan,\n\n265\n00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:47.010\ngot any idea which group\nI might attach admin to.\n\n266\n00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.210\nI mean, it's really tough here.\n\n267\n00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.660\n>> I know, it's a 50/50 shot so\nI'm probably gonna get it wrong.\n\n268\n00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.770\n>> Wanna go with administrator?\n\n269\n00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.250\n>> Yes, you're right, you're right.\n\n270\n00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.039\nWe'll have some parting gifts at the door\nfor you on the way out, that's for sure.\n\n271\n00:13:57.039 --> 00:13:59.934\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The ITPRO.TV home game, right?\n\n272\n00:13:59.934 --> 00:14:01.327\n>> That's right.\n\n273\n00:14:01.327 --> 00:14:03.835\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's just as easy as that,\n\n274\n00:14:03.835 --> 00:14:06.470\nnon-administrator or administrator.\n\n275\n00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.930\nIn this case, Windows language,\nstandard user administrator.\n\n276\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.290\nAll right, so\nthat's got our first account.\n\n277\n00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.697\nWe're gonna make another account too.\n\n278\n00:14:13.697 --> 00:14:17.475\nAll right so we're gonna go back up\nto users, and again, just as easy\n\n279\n00:14:17.475 --> 00:14:21.924\nas we're gonna say, all right, this is\nuser, and I'm using just threes here.\n\n280\n00:14:21.924 --> 00:14:25.378\nJust in case I'm baked in that image\nbecause we've been working with that image\n\n281\n00:14:25.378 --> 00:14:27.610\nfor a while now,\nI just don't want any conflicts.\n\n282\n00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.460\nAll right and here again notice\nthe moment I add it, it lets me know.\n\n283\n00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.080\nWell, we've got a little bit of an issue.\n\n284\n00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.560\nFollow the warnings.\n\n285\n00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.660\nAll right and\nthen we see password again and\n\n286\n00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:47.240\nit's saying you have to have a password or\nthis package will not be validated.\n\n287\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.790\nOnce we validate it notice that,\n\n288\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:54.250\nor once we enter that password it reruns\nit basically again and it is validated.\n\n289\n00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:59.420\nAll right, so\nthat's got some of our user accounts but\n\n290\n00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.240\nhow about some configurations\nof the computers themselves?\n\n291\n00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.610\nWell, we can also do that too.\n\n292\n00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:10.210\nSo the first thing that\nwe're going to do is,\n\n293\n00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.700\nmaybe I want a background picture, right?\n\n294\n00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.630\nI want somebody to have the company\nlogo as far as their desktop goes.\n\n295\n00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:23.262\nWell, I can go down to our\nbackground colors, all right?\n\n296\n00:15:23.262 --> 00:15:25.370\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna select that.\n\n297\n00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:31.077\nWell one of the things that I haven't\nshown you which I really like that's a lot\n\n298\n00:15:31.077 --> 00:15:34.580\ndifferent than the Windows\nsystem image manager\n\n299\n00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:39.150\nis notice that when I say deploy\nbackground file, all right.\n\n300\n00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:43.460\nOnce you select these, you're going to\nstart to see that this box down here,\n\n301\n00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:50.520\nthis preview pane, actually connects\nright to the MSN hardware dev center.\n\n302\n00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.660\nYou don't know what these settings do,\nor how to configure them.\n\n303\n00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.370\nYou just go ahead and click on them.\n\n304\n00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.347\nAnd this one doesn't seem to be doing it,\nbut you'll see a couple more that will.\n\n305\n00:15:58.347 --> 00:16:02.327\nAnd you in real time can also find out\nwhat those settings are unlike Windows\n\n306\n00:16:02.327 --> 00:16:05.627\nsystem image manager,\nwhich you have to go out to detect net.\n\n307\n00:16:05.627 --> 00:16:08.311\nYou'd have to figure out what\nis the configuration pass,\n\n308\n00:16:08.311 --> 00:16:09.570\nand what is the parameter or\n\n309\n00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.730\nvalue that I have to put in order to\nmake that configuration pass work.\n\n310\n00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:17.740\nAll right now, we'll go ahead and\nchoose Browse, and\n\n311\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.640\nlet me see here,\nI might not have copied one down.\n\n312\n00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.850\nI tell you what,\ngive me one moment here and\n\n313\n00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:28.140\nlet's get a file on\nthe desktop here real quick.\n\n314\n00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.205\nAll right, here we go.\n\n315\n00:16:35.205 --> 00:16:41.385\nOkay, so we're going to pull\na file down to our computer here.\n\n316\n00:16:41.385 --> 00:16:45.185\nThere we go, we got a png right there,\nnow we can browse to that.\n\n317\n00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.700\nAll right, and\n\n318\n00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:53.440\nmake sure that you sort by the appropriate\nfile type there or you won't find it.\n\n319\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.210\nYou should see that now our\nimage is right there, and\n\n320\n00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:00.400\nthat we've now slip streamed\nthat into our answers here.\n\n321\n00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.283\nAll right so, that's a desktop\nconfiguration that we can do.\n\n322\n00:17:04.283 --> 00:17:06.590\nHow about device form factor?\n\n323\n00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:10.702\nNow, we've already said, show us the\nsettings that are for the Windows desktop,\n\n324\n00:17:10.702 --> 00:17:11.299\nall right.\n\n325\n00:17:11.299 --> 00:17:14.227\nWell I can actually do a device\nform factor if I want,\n\n326\n00:17:14.227 --> 00:17:17.490\nand it's right under\ndesktop background colors.\n\n327\n00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.890\nAnd I can expand this out, and\nI could say DeviceForm, all right.\n\n328\n00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.100\nNow with DeviceForm, maybe I don't\nknow what I'm supposed to set.\n\n329\n00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.730\nWell, remember guys,\nremember what I told you.\n\n330\n00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:26.830\nSee this list down here?\n\n331\n00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.230\nSo you can actually this\none's showing rather quickly.\n\n332\n00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.370\nIt tells you the values and\nwhat they mean.\n\n333\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.870\nAll right, I'm gonna choose the drop-down\nlist and there are a bunch of them,\n\n334\n00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.560\nwhich I think is really cool,\nlike for instance, kiosks, right?\n\n335\n00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.710\nWe typically configure\nkiosks different than we do\n\n336\n00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.870\nthe computers that are on\nour internal domain.\n\n337\n00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.082\nFor me, I'm just gonna go ahead, and\n\n338\n00:17:47.082 --> 00:17:50.207\nI believe there should be\ndesktop in here somewhere.\n\n339\n00:17:51.963 --> 00:17:53.145\nPhone, Banking.\n\n340\n00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.280\nYep, there it is,\nthey're not in alphabetical order there.\n\n341\n00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.092\n>> Well that's ridiculous.\n\n342\n00:18:00.092 --> 00:18:02.590\n>> Yeah that would have\nmade it way too easy.\n\n343\n00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.600\nAll right so\nnow I've got a device form factor and\n\n344\n00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.260\nI'm telling it that hey\nthese are desktop settings.\n\n345\n00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:11.940\nAll right, so\nmaybe I want to for instance,\n\n346\n00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.780\nmaybe I want to increase the bandwidth\non my network all right?\n\n347\n00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.470\nSo maybe I don't want\nWindows defender checking\n\n348\n00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:23.140\neight hours as far as their signature\ndefinitions for whatever reason.\n\n349\n00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.350\nWell, guess what?\n\n350\n00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:28.010\nThey have a big section in\nhere called policies, and\n\n351\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:32.020\nthere are a ton of things that\nyou can configure, right.\n\n352\n00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.320\nAccounts, you can see blue tooth, bit\nlocker, and a whole bunch of stuff, but\n\n353\n00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.680\nwhat I'm looking at right now is defender.\n\n354\n00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.541\nRight maybe I want to, for instance, there\nis a signature update interval, all right.\n\n355\n00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.880\nNow the signature update\ninterval is in hours right, and\n\n356\n00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.870\nby default if I don't configure this,\n\n357\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.023\nI know it's kinda hard to see here,\nthe default is every eight hours, right.\n\n358\n00:18:53.095 --> 00:18:55.635\nWell, maybe I want to sure\nthat everybody's gone home for\n\n359\n00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:59.185\nthe day before it starts to check\nsignatures and updates them.\n\n360\n00:18:59.185 --> 00:19:00.355\nWell, we can do that, right?\n\n361\n00:19:00.355 --> 00:19:03.661\nWe can say, well I want to put nine,\nall right, and that becomes my value,\n\n362\n00:19:03.661 --> 00:19:04.195\nall right.\n\n363\n00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:07.594\nNext thing, maybe for\n\n364\n00:19:07.594 --> 00:19:11.635\ninstance, maybe we don't want to allow for\ninstance Cortana, right.\n\n365\n00:19:11.635 --> 00:19:16.550\nMaybe there is for\nsome reason a security, whatever,\n\n366\n00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:20.650\nwe've gotta pay attention to some kind\nof security setting, maybe a policy, or\n\n367\n00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.230\nmaybe we don't want to allow Cortana.\n\n368\n00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:28.350\nSo we can go just a little bit farther\ndown, and we can go to experience, right?\n\n369\n00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:33.200\nExperience, notice it says,\nAllowCortana, right, and I say,\n\n370\n00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.920\nsorry Cortana, we don't really need your\nhelp today, in fact, we need security.\n\n371\n00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.710\nWe don't need you ruining our security.\n\n372\n00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.450\nAnd maybe with device discovery,\nall right,\n\n373\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:46.310\nmaybe with device discovery, I don't wanna\nallow a device that gets put into my\n\n374\n00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.220\nnetwork right away doing device\ndiscovery on my network.\n\n375\n00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.666\nWell, my default one says allow,\nright now we're down in the binary, right.\n\n376\n00:19:53.666 --> 00:19:57.040\nOne means allow, yes, right true,\nwe're gonna say zero.\n\n377\n00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:01.415\nAgain if you don't know what the values\nare guys don't let that worry you on\n\n378\n00:20:01.415 --> 00:20:02.048\nthe exam.\n\n379\n00:20:02.048 --> 00:20:04.827\nThey're not gonna expect you to know\nevery single value, but what they\n\n380\n00:20:04.827 --> 00:20:08.040\nare gonna probably expect you to know is\nthe process that we're explaining here.\n\n381\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:14.047\nSo individual minutia's I\nwouldn't worry about too much.\n\n382\n00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:15.120\nAll right.\n\n383\n00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.630\nSo that has us set up so\nfar with our settings.\n\n384\n00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.280\nNow, what if we need to add,\n\n385\n00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.042\nmake sure that I've got all\nof those configured right.\n\n386\n00:20:27.042 --> 00:20:33.015\nAll right, now, the next thing that we're\ngonna do is we're gonna add to deployment\n\n387\n00:20:33.015 --> 00:20:37.780\nassets, we're gonna deploy something known\nas, well, just a Windows update here.\n\n388\n00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.205\nNow, you have to make sure\nthat it’s not an executable.\n\n389\n00:20:41.205 --> 00:20:44.925\nAll right,\nthat’s important on this one guys,\n\n390\n00:20:44.925 --> 00:20:50.770\nbecause what it’s looking for\nis the Microsoft update format, all right.\n\n391\n00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:56.273\nSome of these drivers, if you will, that\nyou might find might have executables,\n\n392\n00:20:56.273 --> 00:21:00.282\nand unfortunately they’re not looking for\nexecutables.\n\n393\n00:21:00.282 --> 00:21:00.900\nAll right.\n\n394\n00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.171\nSo we're gonna go up to deployment assets,\nand we're gonna go ahead and\n\n395\n00:21:04.171 --> 00:21:07.076\nwhat we're gonna do is slip stream\ninto this on Windows update.\n\n396\n00:21:07.076 --> 00:21:07.686\nAll right.\n\n397\n00:21:07.686 --> 00:21:12.060\nNow when we choose Windows update,\nit's gonna ask us where's the update path?\n\n398\n00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.513\nWe're gonna go ahead and browse for that,\n\n399\n00:21:14.513 --> 00:21:19.297\nyou'll see I just pulled that down to the\ndesktop, and I can select it, all right.\n\n400\n00:21:19.297 --> 00:21:23.404\nAnd then if I want to choose a name,\nI can say this is hotfix.\n\n401\n00:21:23.404 --> 00:21:28.291\nAll right, and we're gonna put\na hotfix number on this and\n\n402\n00:21:28.291 --> 00:21:35.898\nI'll use my Hollywood numbers there,\n555-1212, cuz that makes it authentic.\n\n403\n00:21:35.898 --> 00:21:37.405\nAll right and we'll choose add.\n\n404\n00:21:37.405 --> 00:21:43.590\nNow, so far right,\nnow our package is ready.\n\n405\n00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:48.473\nRight, all the configurations that we\nwant to do, and again, there's hundreds\n\n406\n00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:52.460\nif not a thousand of these in here,\nso you can really get granular.\n\n407\n00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.560\nWe're just showing you some of\nthe high level overview and\n\n408\n00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.910\nsome of the different\nthings that you can do,\n\n409\n00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:00.470\nremember we configure the deployment\nassets and then the Run Time Settings.\n\n410\n00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:04.050\nNow, the next thing that we\nhave to do is deploy, right,\n\n411\n00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:07.080\nI can deploy this right to\nremovable media, right.\n\n412\n00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.345\nI can put a USB thumb drive in here, and\n\n413\n00:22:09.345 --> 00:22:14.265\nI can deploy it that way as well,\nbut that would be a little too easy.\n\n414\n00:22:14.265 --> 00:22:16.025\nFor the exam,\nI want you to remember that, yes,\n\n415\n00:22:16.025 --> 00:22:19.205\nyou can deploy it to removable media,\nUSB drive and an optical disk.\n\n416\n00:22:19.205 --> 00:22:22.415\nBut when it comes to deployment in\nan Enterprise environment that's\n\n417\n00:22:22.415 --> 00:22:25.584\nvery decentralized and\nthere's no way we're gonna do it that way.\n\n418\n00:22:25.584 --> 00:22:28.340\nWell I can't say no like Dan said before,\nhe's corrected me,\n\n419\n00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.056\nnever say never in computing, right?\n\n420\n00:22:30.056 --> 00:22:32.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because the one computer you might have\n\n421\n00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.660\nin a test lab in which you\ndo need to deploy it, or\n\n422\n00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.400\nin a case where it's very secure and\nyour between firewalls and you can't have\n\n423\n00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.840\nnetwork communication travelling outbound,\nyou still might use that so.\n\n424\n00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.660\n>> I will say that this is probably\nnot the method you're going to use\n\n425\n00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.870\nin a large deployment.\n\n426\n00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:47.820\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That's right, that's right, and\n\n427\n00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.420\nwell said.\n\n428\n00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.530\nSo what would we use in\na larger deployment?\n\n429\n00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.960\nWell what we would do is export\nthis package out completely and\n\n430\n00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.960\nthat's part of the episode, right?\n\n431\n00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.550\nProvisioning a package with ICD and\nthat's probably gonna be one of the ways\n\n432\n00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.460\nthat they're gonna want you\nto do this on the exam.\n\n433\n00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.260\nSo now we start by\nprovisioning the package.\n\n434\n00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.220\nFirst thing that we have to do in\nthe describing the provisioned package,\n\n435\n00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.740\nI'm gonna keep the name where it is.\n\n436\n00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.601\nNow it is nice that you have these\nversioning numbers, all right.\n\n437\n00:23:16.601 --> 00:23:18.020\nWhat's up with the versioning numbers?\n\n438\n00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:22.010\nWell, if I update this I might want\nthis to turn around and be 1.0.1.\n\n439\n00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.260\n>> That's a pretty nice\nfeature to be honest with you.\n\n440\n00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:23.925\n>> It is.\n\n441\n00:23:23.925 --> 00:23:26.290\n>> Cuz I can't say how many\ntimes I've created images.\n\n442\n00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.380\nI've worked with a lot of different\ntypes of third party, you name it,\n\n443\n00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:34.520\nyou do this kinda thing in an Enterprise\nenvironments and you have to put in when\n\n444\n00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.870\nyou created the package, what the updates\nto it were, so that you can see a history.\n\n445\n00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.354\nIf you ever need to go back,\nyou can jump right to that,\n\n446\n00:23:41.354 --> 00:23:42.872\nwell which version is this have?\n\n447\n00:23:42.872 --> 00:23:46.807\nYou can see what that is, without this it,\nit becomes I have no idea and\n\n448\n00:23:46.807 --> 00:23:50.300\nthat's not what we're wanna be\ninside of our environments.\n\n449\n00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.230\nWe wanna know everything\nabout those systems.\n\n450\n00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.878\n>> It really does.\nI mean, in other systems,\n\n451\n00:23:53.878 --> 00:23:57.568\nthey already have minor and major formats\nlike look in some operating systems, other\n\n452\n00:23:57.568 --> 00:24:01.279\noperating systems that when they release,\nit's always a minor and a major version.\n\n453\n00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:05.531\nSo, it does keep you in check\nwhen you are doing some updates.\n\n454\n00:24:05.531 --> 00:24:12.840\nNow, I wanna kinda talk about this next\noption here a little bit, all right?\n\n455\n00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.750\nThese are settings precedences, okay.\n\n456\n00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.810\nNow, when we talk about things\nlike Active Directory, we say,\n\n457\n00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:21.930\nokay, what is the last\npolicy that applied, right?\n\n458\n00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:25.803\nYou guys probably seen, if not,\nActive Directory, local site domain OU,\n\n459\n00:24:25.803 --> 00:24:28.422\nlast one that applies has\nthe highest precedence.\n\n460\n00:24:28.422 --> 00:24:31.670\nThose are the settings that\nare gonna apply in any conflicts.\n\n461\n00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.560\nI want you to know this for\n\n462\n00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.310\nthe exam, Microsoft has\nthe lowest precedence, all right?\n\n463\n00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.870\nTo the highest precedence, which means if\nwe have multiples of these packages and\n\n464\n00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.985\nthere's conflicting settings, all right?\n\n465\n00:24:43.985 --> 00:24:47.050\nWhichever one processes last,\nthe settings apply.\n\n466\n00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.800\nRight, so keep that in mind on the exam.\n\n467\n00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.920\nLowest precedence is Microsoft, highest\nprecedence is IT Admin in this case.\n\n468\n00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.830\nNow, what's up with this rank number here?\n\n469\n00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:02.407\nOkay, well, let me tell you where this\nrank number comes into play for us.\n\n470\n00:25:02.407 --> 00:25:07.780\nImagine, all right, if Dan configures\none of these provisioning packages and\n\n471\n00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.610\nhis is set to IT Admin,\nI configure one of these packages,\n\n472\n00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.140\nand mine is set to IT Admin.\n\n473\n00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.220\nHowever, the settings within\nthese packages conflict.\n\n474\n00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.590\nWell, now what wins?\n\n475\n00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:25.410\nBoth packages, as far as the owner,\nhave the same precedence value.\n\n476\n00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.070\nAnd that's when the rank is determined.\n\n477\n00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.780\n>> So that's the deciding vote, the let's\nhit no, this is the winner of this film.\n\n478\n00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:31.900\n>> Rock, paper, scissors.\n\n479\n00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.010\n>> Yeah.\n>> This is the rock, paper,\n\n480\n00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:33.710\nscissors, right?\n\n481\n00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.340\nSo Dan says, I'm the senior admin.\n\n482\n00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:41.020\nI'm going to whatever, the security\npolicy that we need to set in place.\n\n483\n00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.100\nHe puts the lowest, 0 to 1,\nif you want, right?\n\n484\n00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.459\nAgain, remember, this is the tie breaker.\n\n485\n00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:54.785\nNow, once that's set, and I'll tell\nyou what, what we're gonna do is we're\n\n486\n00:25:54.785 --> 00:25:59.628\njust gonna do 0, and for me, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and just leave it IT Admin.\n\n487\n00:25:59.628 --> 00:26:01.011\n>> I'm gonna put -1 on mine.\n\n488\n00:26:01.011 --> 00:26:02.961\n>> -1, there we go, there we go.\n\n489\n00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:05.256\n[LAUGH] So, we'll choose Next.\n\n490\n00:26:05.256 --> 00:26:10.092\nNow, couple of things that you\nhave to be careful with on this,\n\n491\n00:26:10.092 --> 00:26:13.030\nencrypting the package, all right?\n\n492\n00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:22.450\nIf you plan to slip stream this into\nan image, this will fail, okay?\n\n493\n00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.570\nIf you encrypt it, it will not\nallow you to slip stream it in, so\n\n494\n00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.440\nkeep that in mind, all right?\n\n495\n00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.360\nFor the purposes of this demonstration,\nI'm gonna unencrypt this.\n\n496\n00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:36.080\nNow, please keep in mind, I don't really\ncare because I might have a domain\n\n497\n00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:41.260\npolicy that says the user, first time they\nlog in, has to change their password.\n\n498\n00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.410\nIt's the only reason.\n\n499\n00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:46.930\nHowever, if somebody knows, [LAUGH] all\nright, what your default passwords are,\n\n500\n00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.480\nwhich is still a security vulnerability\nin general, they could cause problems.\n\n501\n00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.230\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n502\n00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.280\nIt's for the purposes of\nthe lab demonstration, not for\n\n503\n00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.010\nthe purposes of a production environment.\n\n504\n00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:58.570\n>> And it does say you also can,\n\n505\n00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:02.881\nthe signature on the surface verification\nthere [CROSSTALK] hadn’t changed.\n\n506\n00:27:02.881 --> 00:27:06.721\n>> And I was gonna say, I’m glad you\npointed that out cuz that’s actually\n\n507\n00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:10.823\nprobably even more safe, or safer if\nyou will, than the encryption, why?\n\n508\n00:27:10.823 --> 00:27:15.012\nBecause now, if we've got an internal PKI,\nright, we just digitally sign it, and\n\n509\n00:27:15.012 --> 00:27:18.919\nnow the signatures have to match or\nthe whole package is gonna be invalidated.\n\n510\n00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:22.390\nAll right, so\nwe'll go ahead and choose Next.\n\n511\n00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.310\nAnd then it's gonna ask,\nwhere are you gonna put this?\n\n512\n00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.820\nNow, remember I changed the path.\n\n513\n00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.800\nThis actually goes in the user profile,\nin their documents,\n\n514\n00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:35.780\nin that big long Windows imaging and\nconfiguration designer, parenthesis icd.\n\n515\n00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:39.060\nAll right, I can't really stand\ntyping that in the command prompt, so\n\n516\n00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.990\nI've changed it, cuz we also wanna show\nyou not just provisioning a package shape.\n\n517\n00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:44.130\nWe provision the package, right?\n\n518\n00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:44.660\nI choose Next.\n\n519\n00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:49.150\nAnd I choose Build, and it's done.\n\n520\n00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.410\nEpisode over, no, just kidding.\n\n521\n00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.440\nWe do have a little bit more.\n\n522\n00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.690\nBecause I don't wanna\njust show you how to,\n\n523\n00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.000\nit does say provision the package,\nall right.\n\n524\n00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.238\nObjective says provision,\nit doesn't say build a package.\n\n525\n00:28:02.238 --> 00:28:03.790\nUnfortunately, Dan's letting me know,\n\n526\n00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.770\nI don't know if we have enough\ntime in this episode for that.\n\n527\n00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:10.450\n>> That could take a little more time than\nwe have left on the clock, which is very,\n\n528\n00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.045\nvery short.\n\n529\n00:28:11.045 --> 00:28:16.180\n[LAUGH] So it looks like we are headed yet\ninto another one of our famous part twos.\n\n530\n00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.610\nWes, I look forwarding\nto seeing you there.\n\n531\n00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:21.050\nGreat explanation so far,\non the edge of our seats, Im sure.\n\n532\n00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.770\nBut like we said, we have little time,\nso we'll have to go to that part two.\n\n533\n00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.330\nHopefully, we'll see you there as well.\n\n534\n00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.510\nAs for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n535\n00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.990\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n536\n00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.888\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n537\n00:28:30.888 --> 00:28:32.289\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n538\n00:28:32.289 -->

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.170\nI am your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.570\nin this episode we continue on with\nmore on our Windows 10 series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.240\nJoining us back in\nthe studio again today for\n\n6\n00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.320\npart two in the ICD,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.400\nWes, welcome back, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.250\nWe kinda left the audience there with a\nlittle bit of a cliffhanger at the end of\n\n9\n00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.240\nthe last episode.\n\n10\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.110\nHere we are in part two,\nlet's pick up the ball where we continue.\n\n11\n00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.980\n>> That's right, so in the last episode,\nkeep in mind what we did.\n\n12\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.070\nWe started using our imaging and\nconfiguration designer a little bit.\n\n13\n00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.975\nIt's new to Windows 10 and\nI don't want to say it replaces\n\n14\n00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:48.035\nWindows System Image Manager\ncuz it is still there.\n\n15\n00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:50.225\nBut it's definitely a little\nbit more versatile and\n\n16\n00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:53.855\nit's strictly focused in\non Windows 10 devices.\n\n17\n00:00:53.855 --> 00:00:57.265\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's jump right back to my computer here.\n\n18\n00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:00.175\nThe last thing that we did is we\nprovisioned the package, right?\n\n19\n00:01:00.175 --> 00:01:03.955\nWe exported it out and\nI'm gonna go ahead and close down our ICD,\n\n20\n00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:07.395\nthis is where we left off and I'm gonna\ngo ahead and just save all the projects.\n\n21\n00:01:07.395 --> 00:01:08.765\nWe did save it before and\n\n22\n00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:12.210\nif we drop down, well we're not going\nto drop down to the Windows Store.\n\n23\n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.260\nIf we drop down to where\nI change that location,\n\n24\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.120\nyou can see that we've got\na couple of files here.\n\n25\n00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.730\nNow, let me go ahead, I'll tell you what,\nand modify this view.\n\n26\n00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.480\nCuz there are two, when we decide to\ndeploy this in our slipstream and\n\n27\n00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.100\ninto our image, there's a couple of file\nextensions that I want you to be aware of.\n\n28\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.970\nSo we need to see those, all right, and\n\n29\n00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.370\nthis is the package that we created,\nright.\n\n30\n00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.580\nYou can see the run time\nprovisioning package here and\n\n31\n00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.720\nthen you can see the Security\ncatalog that goes along with this.\n\n32\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.370\nNow with any CAT file, keep in mind,\n\n33\n00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.350\nif you're gonna slip stream\nthis into a Windows image then\n\n34\n00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.860\nit's gonna need to trust it so\nit does have this security catalog.\n\n35\n00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.150\nThat is here information\njust like you would see for\n\n36\n00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.350\ninstance in some of your drivers,\nhaving that cat file there.\n\n37\n00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.380\nSo keep in mind that you\nare going to need to locate\n\n38\n00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.900\nthose two files when you go to\nslipstream into your image now.\n\n39\n00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.380\nSo like we've been doing\nlike in a prior episode,\n\n40\n00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.200\nremember we used a pointed\nimage servicing manager.\n\n41\n00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.650\nTo take a driver and\nslipstream it into the image and\n\n42\n00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.710\nthen we turned around and we viewed\nthe fact that the driver was there.\n\n43\n00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.470\nWell, we're going to take a package and\n\n44\n00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.030\nwe're actually going to slipstream it\ninto this image we've been working with.\n\n45\n00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.738\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n46\n00:02:27.738 --> 00:02:32.750\nWe're gonna drop down to our power shell,\nand you guys\n\n47\n00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.860\nyou can do this is in command prompts, you\ncan do it in the PowerShell if you want.\n\n48\n00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.440\nIt is up to you,\nI prefer just to open up PowerShell today.\n\n49\n00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.330\nAnd the reason I say that is\nbecause well pretty much anything\n\n50\n00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.300\nthat you can do in command prompts\nyou can also do in PowerShell.\n\n51\n00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.570\nSo I just like to,\nwhy not just have one interface open and\n\n52\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.540\nthen if I do need to anything in command\nprompt then I can just jump back\n\n53\n00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.190\nto it if i want and\nthen jump out of it if I need to.\n\n54\n00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.110\nSo, we,\njust a personal preference on that one.\n\n55\n00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.850\nSo, couple of things that\nwe are going to need to do,\n\n56\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.610\nI'm going to drop down to a C: here and\nwe'll go ahead and do our dir option.\n\n57\n00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.780\nIf you happen to be in\nPowerShell you want to do.\n\n58\n00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.410\nGet child item there, so\nit does the same thing,\n\n59\n00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.420\njust a couple of different\ncommands to do that.\n\n60\n00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.376\n>> Dir seems to be easier.\n\n61\n00:03:16.376 --> 00:03:18.610\n[LAUGH]\n>> It really does, it really does.\n\n62\n00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.830\nI will tell you, though, I will tell you,\nin one defense, dir, a lot of the commands\n\n63\n00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.700\nthat we do, if I do a get dash child, I\ncan not, and if I can actually type that.\n\n64\n00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.380\nI can actually tab and it autofills.\n\n65\n00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.570\nSo dir is shorter but\nI like the PowerShell's autofill.\n\n66\n00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.471\n>> I hear that Windows 10 is coming\nout with a POSIX compliance.\n\n67\n00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:38.217\n>> Yeah.\n\n68\n00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:42.000\n>> Like a Cygwin baked into Windows 10.\n\n69\n00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.630\n>> Yeah, apparently they want\nsome collaboration there so\n\n70\n00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.200\nthere is going to be collaboration\nwith things like Linux as well too.\n\n71\n00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.560\nSo it took a while for them to hold and\nshake hands but apparently they are.\n\n72\n00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.676\nAnd we'll see what\nthe future entails on that.\n\n73\n00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:55.680\n>> You see easier tensions\nin the Middle East.\n\n74\n00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.181\n>> Yes.\n\n75\n00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:57.463\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n76\n00:03:57.463 --> 00:03:58.330\n>> That's right.\n\n77\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330\nSo a couple of things that we're gonna do.\n\n78\n00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.700\nWe have to mount our image,\nactually you can't really see it here.\n\n79\n00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.420\nActually let's do a set location here.\n\n80\n00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.520\nAnd once we do our set location,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n81\n00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.310\ndo that to the Wim directory,\nand again, we'll do our DIR.\n\n82\n00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.770\nAnd you can see that we have our\ninstall.wim that we've been working with.\n\n83\n00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.520\nIt is there, one of the things you have to\ndo to be able to mount this image though,\n\n84\n00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.790\nis you need to have\na directory to mount it to.\n\n85\n00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.000\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna make a directory here.\n\n86\n00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.970\nWe'll do md here and\nI'll just go ahead and call this Offline.\n\n87\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.800\nAll right, just make sure that it's there.\n\n88\n00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.510\nAnd you can see that we have\nthat directory right there for\n\n89\n00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.770\nus Offline, ready to go.\n\n90\n00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.290\nAll right, so that being said.\n\n91\n00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.750\nNow the next thing that we have to do,\nand let me full size that and\n\n92\n00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.880\nthen clear this screen, make it a little\nbit easier for you guys to see there.\n\n93\n00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.160\nAll right, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna mount this image.\n\n94\n00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.210\nSo we're gonna do our dism, again,\ndeployment image servicing manager.\n\n95\n00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.850\nWe just a lot of times say dism,\nall right.\n\n96\n00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.280\nAnd the first thing I'm going to do is\nget a little bit of info on this image.\n\n97\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.594\nSo we'll do Get-imageinfo.\n\n98\n00:05:10.916 --> 00:05:14.219\nAnd we're going to tell it\nwhere the image file is.\n\n99\n00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.620\nAnd I'm doing that, again, to confirm\nthat this is the image I want to use.\n\n100\n00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.311\nThat location is C:\\wim\\install.\n\n101\n00:05:28.311 --> 00:05:32.086\nNow at any point if you\nguys are practicing this,\n\n102\n00:05:32.086 --> 00:05:37.780\ndon't hesitate to just pause the video,\npractice, rewind the video.\n\n103\n00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.330\nI mean it's the easiest way to\nget familiar with some of these\n\n104\n00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.460\ncommands, right?\n\n105\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.470\nAnd you can see that this is\nour Windows 10 Enterprise.\n\n106\n00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.600\nAnd you can see that it's the size\non file is about 12 gigs because,\n\n107\n00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.220\nlike I said,\nwe have been working with it a little bit.\n\n108\n00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.310\nSo we'll go ahead and clear that out and\nlet's go ahead and mount this image up.\n\n109\n00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.014\nSo we'll do our dism/ and\nwe're going to do Mount-Image,\n\n110\n00:06:02.014 --> 00:06:09.820\nspace and then another / and then again\nwe've got to point it to the image file.\n\n111\n00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.777\nSo we'll go ahead and do /ImageFile:c:\\\nand we're going to point it to that image,\n\n112\n00:06:15.777 --> 00:06:20.860\nand that'll be,\nif I can spell there, Install.wim.\n\n113\n00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.110\nAll right, and then remember\nthat a WIM file is a container.\n\n114\n00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.400\nKeep in mind it could have\nmultiple Windows images,\n\n115\n00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.660\nsome of you guys that have been installing\nWindows 7 and you don't remember back.\n\n116\n00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.880\nLike for instance Windows Vista would\nhave multiple additions in a single\n\n117\n00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.780\ninstallation media.\n\n118\n00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.330\nSo what we're going to do is,\nwe're going to say a /index:1 and\n\n119\n00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.890\nthat points it to the specific\nimage that we want.\n\n120\n00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.120\nThen we're gonna say, /, all right,\n\n121\n00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.120\nthis is gonna be a MountDir:c:\\ and\nfor us it's gonna be Offline.\n\n122\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.410\nThat'll be the Ffolder that\nwe just created there.\n\n123\n00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.640\nAnd here's something to keep in mind.\n\n124\n00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.620\nI thought I was in an administrative\ncommand prompt, right?\n\n125\n00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.373\nBut, unfortunately am I not.\n\n126\n00:07:05.373 --> 00:07:07.267\n>> Yeah,\nwell don't believe everything you think.\n\n127\n00:07:07.267 --> 00:07:07.991\n>> Yes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n128\n00:07:07.991 --> 00:07:10.078\n>> Even though it does say administrator\n\n129\n00:07:10.078 --> 00:07:13.870\nPowerShell, we won't believe it and\nwe'll try this one more time.\n\n130\n00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.205\n>> It loves to lie to us about that,\ndoesn't it?\n\n131\n00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:17.380\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n132\n00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.720\nSo let me go ahead and double check.\n\n133\n00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.140\nAnd, again, like I said, should be\nan administrative command prompt.\n\n134\n00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.260\nBut you never know the good\nthing is we can rerun that and,\n\n135\n00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.702\nstill getting that problem.\n\n136\n00:07:29.702 --> 00:07:34.050\nAll right, so we decided to leave\nthat error in, because I wanna show\n\n137\n00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.550\nyou something that you might,\nan error that you might face, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:39.390\nLet me go ahead and show you.\n\n139\n00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:43.050\nIt talks about here, it says you do\nnot have the permissions to modify or\n\n140\n00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.560\nmount this image, and\nverify that the read write permissions.\n\n141\n00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.060\nAnd just talks about a permissions issue,\nright?\n\n142\n00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.730\nIf I open up file explorer here,\n\n143\n00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.790\none of the things that I'm gonna notice\non these two files that I'm dealing with.\n\n144\n00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.630\nOne that have my image file,\nthat's your WIM file.\n\n145\n00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.538\nAnd then the Offline file that we're\ngonna mount this directory to.\n\n146\n00:07:58.538 --> 00:08:02.370\nIf I right-click on this, let me back out\njust a little bit and choose Properties.\n\n147\n00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.989\nOne of the things you're gonna notice\nhere is that it has the Read-Only\n\n148\n00:08:04.989 --> 00:08:06.050\nattribute file.\n\n149\n00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.710\nNow in another episode we're\ngonna talk about storage and\n\n150\n00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.880\ntalk a little bit more about what\nthese attributes mean for us.\n\n151\n00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.820\nBut you can see right away\nwhat this one means for us.\n\n152\n00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.960\nIt's marking it as Read-Only so\nI can't manipulate it.\n\n153\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.720\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'll uncheck that and\n\n154\n00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.150\nit's gonna ask me do you wanna\napply this to everything below it?\n\n155\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.050\nWell we're dealing with a WIM file,\nso we need to apply that.\n\n156\n00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:29.330\nWe'll go ahead, choose OK, says we\nneed administrative privileges here.\n\n157\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.330\nWe're gonna do the same thing if I\nopen up the properties of this file.\n\n158\n00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.570\nI also see Read-Only right?\n\n159\n00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:38.279\nAnd that includes anything that we might\n\n160\n00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:42.870\nbe trying to put in that\nOffline folder location.\n\n161\n00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.456\nSo now if we rerun this\nyou're gonna see that our\n\n162\n00:08:45.456 --> 00:08:48.700\nDeployment Image Servicing Manger,\nno problem, right?\n\n163\n00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.610\nIt starts to run right away and\nthat's what we want.\n\n164\n00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:56.700\nSo now what it's gonna do is it's gonna go\nthrough the process of taking this image\n\n165\n00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.120\nthat we're gonna be working with.\n\n166\n00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.640\nAnd we're gonna slipstream\ninto this image,\n\n167\n00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.780\nthat provision package that we just made.\n\n168\n00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.360\nCould take a little bit here,\nwe'll see how long it takes here,\n\n169\n00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.000\nshouldn't be too long.\n\n170\n00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.550\nSo, once it gets mounted up,\n\n171\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.858\nand then what we can do is we can run\nour Deployment Image Servicing Manager\n\n172\n00:09:15.858 --> 00:09:18.710\ncommands in order just to\nslip stream that image in.\n\n173\n00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.800\nAnd then we'll have those settings and\nthat provision of package ready to go.\n\n174\n00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.290\nLooks like it's about 40% here so\nnot too bad here.\n\n175\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.338\nBut while we're waiting for that just keep\nthat in mind if you do get that error.\n\n176\n00:09:28.338 --> 00:09:31.632\nWhen you're trying to\nprovision these packages,\n\n177\n00:09:31.632 --> 00:09:34.771\nlike I said,\nthe solution to that was just paying\n\n178\n00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:39.975\nattention to the attributes that\nwere placed on those folders, right?\n\n179\n00:09:39.975 --> 00:09:42.505\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nlet that keep running.\n\n180\n00:09:42.505 --> 00:09:46.375\nLooks like we are up to about 78% so,\nnot bad.\n\n181\n00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:48.115\nDoesn't take really too long,\n\n182\n00:09:48.115 --> 00:09:52.170\nI will tell you that when we go to\nsave this image that's been mounted.\n\n183\n00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.000\nWe're gonna use a little\nbit of TV magic here,\n\n184\n00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.520\nbecause it goes through\na couple of processes here.\n\n185\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.910\nIt's gonna go through first of all,\nit's gonna go through the saving process,\n\n186\n00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.100\ncommitting the changes of applying\nthe provision package to it.\n\n187\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.440\nOnce it's saved,\nthen it goes through the unmount process.\n\n188\n00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.020\nAnd unfortunately, that's gonna take\na little bit, and we certainly don't want\n\n189\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.330\nyou to have to wait around five or\nten minutes for that to happen.\n\n190\n00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.670\nSo we're at about 99% almost complete.\n\n191\n00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.390\nJust wait for it,\nyou gotta love those progress bars.\n\n192\n00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.810\nIt's like you lie.\n\n193\n00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.780\n>> I like how 99% is taking longer than\nthe other 98% it took to get there.\n\n194\n00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n195\n00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.540\nI've always thought that's funny.\n\n196\n00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.858\nYou're waiting and you're waiting and\nyou're waiting and it's.\n\n197\n00:10:27.858 --> 00:10:32.220\nYeah, the 99% is, definitely,\nthat 1% has got to be a really huge file.\n\n198\n00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I swear it really is.\n\n199\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.710\nSo, looks like our\noperation is successful and\n\n200\n00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.920\nI wanna show you kind of what happened\nthere if you're not familiar with it.\n\n201\n00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.020\nIf you're already familiar with\nother like nick space systems,\n\n202\n00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:45.920\nyou do this all the time.\n\n203\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.040\nJust to be able to work with\nthings like your optical drive,\n\n204\n00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.950\nso this is nothing new to you guys for\nsure.\n\n205\n00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.850\nSo do dir here real quick.\n\n206\n00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.970\nWe'll go ahead and\nchange to the offline folder and\n\n207\n00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.740\nI just wanna show you guys real\nquick what that looks like.\n\n208\n00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:03.710\nAnd then we're gonna get into actually\nslipstreaming that package in there.\n\n209\n00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.130\nSo we'll go ahead and\ndo offline and if I do a dir,\n\n210\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:12.090\nI now have what looks just like\nthe Windows directory right?\n\n211\n00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.340\nYou say well it pretty much is,\njust like C: here.\n\n212\n00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.320\nThis is not C: though, this is that image.\n\n213\n00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.380\nIf I drop back down to the root\nyou can see same thing here, so\n\n214\n00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.870\nthey look very, very similar.\n\n215\n00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.710\nNow, next thing that we have to do,\n\n216\n00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:32.440\nwe have to go down to the applying\nthe provision package, right?\n\n217\n00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.660\nSo now that this is mounted.\n\n218\n00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.300\nAll right we're gonna type and\ntell you know what let me go ahead and\n\n219\n00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.910\nclear this screen guys.\n\n220\n00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.630\nGet this back up on the top\nmake it a little bit easier for\n\n221\n00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.380\nyou guys to see that there.\n\n222\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.240\nAll right so we're going to type dism,\nthis is a command that I will tell you\n\n223\n00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.880\njust rolls off the tongue here and\nnot difficult in any way, all right.\n\n224\n00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.330\nYou're gonna see, it's actually,\nI hate typing this one honestly, but\n\n225\n00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:02.240\nI wouldn't try to memorize\nevery individual piece of this.\n\n226\n00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.540\nThe reason I say that is because well,\n\n227\n00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.740\nit's going to change depending\non your environment.\n\n228\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:15.760\nBut I would pay attention to the switches\nthat we are going to add here.\n\n229\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.631\nAll right, so\nthis is provisioning package,\n\n230\n00:12:20.631 --> 00:12:26.780\nall right, and then we have to\ntell it where the package is,\n\n231\n00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.910\nso we'll do package path :C:\\.\n\n232\n00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.436\nRemember, that is in the WICD folder.\n\n233\n00:12:37.436 --> 00:12:43.120\nAnd that is our,\n\n234\n00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:50.840\nand let me just double check on my file,\nmake sure I named that right.\n\n235\n00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.767\nYeah, Project One Package,\n\n236\n00:12:54.767 --> 00:12:59.799\nthere we go so Project_01.ppkg.\n\n237\n00:12:59.799 --> 00:13:04.720\nAnd again, I'm just gonna double check on\nthat real quick cuz you do wanna make sure\n\n238\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.040\nthat you have these names right,\nor it isn't going to pick that up.\n\n239\n00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.180\nAll right, so\nthat's the package, all right?\n\n240\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.490\nBut we need a little bit more, right?\n\n241\n00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:17.690\nWhat we do need to do is make sure\nthat it also points to the catalog.\n\n242\n00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:22.950\nSo that's the other one that's,\nagain, it's going to be / and\n\n243\n00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.910\nwe'll type CatalogPath on this one.\n\n244\n00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.070\nIt's not case sensitive, or\nit isn't case sensitive, I should say,\n\n245\n00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.735\nso don't worry about that.\n\n246\n00:13:32.735 --> 00:13:39.170\nWICD\\ and this is gonna be Project_01.\n\n247\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.760\nAnd that is a .cat file all right?\n\n248\n00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.640\nAnd then we can run this all right and\n\n249\n00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.390\nwhat we should see here hopefully\nwe don't get any errors here.\n\n250\n00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.600\nIf you get any errors they in\nfact we're gonna get an error.\n\n251\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.760\nLet me go ahead real quick and\nshow you this log while I'm at it here.\n\n252\n00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.280\nAnd then we'll get back and\nwe'll troubleshoot that error real quick.\n\n253\n00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.520\nAll right so we got Windows and then logs\n\n254\n00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.680\nall right, and we got this one in here,\nand if we wanted to.\n\n255\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.820\nIf we were really, really had the time,\nwe could go through this log and\n\n256\n00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.305\ntry to find the failure.\n\n257\n00:14:14.305 --> 00:14:17.420\nTthe good thing is it gives\nus a little bit of an idea.\n\n258\n00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.470\nIt says cannot find the file specified.\n\n259\n00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:32.210\nSo let me just double-check my\nspelling here, project cat.\n\n260\n00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:37.500\nGonna do a little troubleshooting\nhere right on camera, ICD.\n\n261\n00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.100\n>> No pressure, Wes.\n\n262\n00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.600\n>> No pressure, no pressure at all.\n\n263\n00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.888\nProject underscore one.\n\n264\n00:14:43.888 --> 00:14:50.590\nSo, you can usually find\na little bit of a typo.\n\n265\n00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.650\nAnd sure enough I find\nthat error right there.\n\n266\n00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:01.260\nNotice I'm saying Project_01,\n0 seems to be the problem.\n\n267\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:06.770\nSo let's go ahead and what we'll do is and\nwe'll take the zero out, right?\n\n268\n00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:07.530\n>> Just one.\n\n269\n00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.980\n>> Just one, right.\n\n270\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.640\nSo, we'll take that zero out.\n\n271\n00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.170\nAnd we'll, go ahead,\nand try to rerun this.\n\n272\n00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.520\nAnd we'll see if the imaging and\nthere it goes.\n\n273\n00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.770\nAnd notice how fast that was.\n\n274\n00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.380\nThe package, itself,\nisn't that big, right?\n\n275\n00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.920\nSo it took longer to mount the image,\nactually provision\n\n276\n00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.510\nthe package inside of this image so\nlast thing that we needed to do.\n\n277\n00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.860\nNow that we've got that package provision\nthat we need to actually go ahead and\n\n278\n00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.500\nwe're gonna unmount the image.\n\n279\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.504\nNow, when we unmount the image again it's\ngonna be just another this uncommand here.\n\n280\n00:15:40.504 --> 00:15:43.960\nThis could take a little bit though,\nyou can see it certainly isn't going\n\n281\n00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.545\nto be as long as how long it took to\nprovision the package in the image itself.\n\n282\n00:15:47.545 --> 00:15:48.995\nSo we're going to go ahead, and\n\n283\n00:15:48.995 --> 00:15:52.059\nwhat we'll do is we'll show you\nexactly how to unmount the image and\n\n284\n00:15:52.059 --> 00:15:55.034\ncommit the changes to that image so\nthat they're not discarded.\n\n285\n00:15:55.034 --> 00:15:56.635\nAnd then once that's done,\n\n286\n00:15:56.635 --> 00:16:00.850\nwe'll come back once the image has\nbeen finished saving and unmounting.\n\n287\n00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.470\nSo what is our command?\n\n288\n00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:08.592\nIt's gonna be dism /unmount-image\n\n289\n00:16:08.592 --> 00:16:13.876\n/MountDir:c:\\offline, that's\n\n290\n00:16:13.876 --> 00:16:19.637\nwhere we put that and we'll do a /commit,\n\n291\n00:16:19.637 --> 00:16:24.590\nand we'll go ahead and run that.\n\n292\n00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:30.960\nNow, again, usually what does happen\nhere is it happens in two stages.\n\n293\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:36.930\nFirst it goes through the 0 to 100%\non saving the changes to the image,\n\n294\n00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.480\nso committing the changes.\n\n295\n00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.470\nAnd then the last thing that it does\n\n296\n00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.470\nis it unmounts the image after\nit's committed those changes.\n\n297\n00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:48.080\nSo you can see, it takes a little bit\nhere, cuz it is going through a process of\n\n298\n00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.290\nlooking at that image,\ninspecting the metadata.\n\n299\n00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.144\nAnd you could see here,\n\n300\n00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:54.240\nactually saving the image is going\npretty pretty fairly quickly.\n\n301\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.520\nSo, we might be able to keep this in here.\n\n302\n00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.927\nI tell you, though, I really think,\nonce we get to the unmounting process.\n\n303\n00:16:59.927 --> 00:17:03.760\nYou're going to see,\nit's certainly not going to move so fast.\n\n304\n00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.970\nSo what we'll go ahead and do,\nis we'll use the magic of TV and\n\n305\n00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.180\nwe'll come back when this is finished.\n\n306\n00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.250\nAnd you'll see those two\nprogress bars complete.\n\n307\n00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.330\nSo 30% of all your IT career won't be\nsitting waiting on a progress bar.\n\n308\n00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.830\nSo it looks like it has finished.\n\n309\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:23.240\nYou can see we've got here on the desktop,\nwe've got a couple of progress bars.\n\n310\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.390\nFirst thing it did was it saved the image.\n\n311\n00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.300\nThe next thing it did was\nit unmounted the image.\n\n312\n00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:32.380\nSo now, we have an image that has not\nonly had in some of the past episodes,\n\n313\n00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.750\ndrivers added to it.\n\n314\n00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:39.080\nIt has also had a package provision to it\nwith settings, runtime settings included.\n\n315\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.130\nDeployment assets like we could have\nslip streamed some drivers in there if\n\n316\n00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:42.630\nwe needed to.\n\n317\n00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:46.090\nIn this case, we just took a stand\nalone hot fix or a Windows update, and\n\n318\n00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.660\nwe slip streamed it into that image.\n\n319\n00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.740\nAnd we committed the changes,\n\n320\n00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:53.000\nwhich is the first progress, saving those\nchanges to the image then it unmounts it.\n\n321\n00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.910\nNow at this point, if we wanted, we could\nturn around and take that WIM file.\n\n322\n00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.920\nPut it on our WDS server,\nWindows Deployment Server.\n\n323\n00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.690\nAnd we could deploy it\nout to the computers.\n\n324\n00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.690\nAnd it would have that\npackage already installed.\n\n325\n00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:06.290\nSo for the most part the image\nconfiguration designer,\n\n326\n00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.130\nDan's got a decent interface,\nit's not too complex,\n\n327\n00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.510\nonce you know some of the commands in\nthe background it makes it a lot easier.\n\n328\n00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.020\nAnd you can deploy this to many computers\nrather than having a sneaker net in\n\n329\n00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.510\na decentralized method.\n\n330\n00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:18.480\n>> Yeah, pretty straight forward.\n\n331\n00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.480\nThere's a few commands you got\nto know in the PowerShell or\n\n332\n00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.230\nthe command prompt as it were.\n\n333\n00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.885\nBut you get those things down and of\ncourse you type them correctly right Wes?\n\n334\n00:18:26.885 --> 00:18:28.840\n[LAUGH] If you learn\nanything from Wes Bryan,\n\n335\n00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.800\nit's always check your typing, rIght?\n\n336\n00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.118\nBecause that's what get's us every time.\n\n337\n00:18:32.118 --> 00:18:33.630\nYou're like, what, this isn't working?\n\n338\n00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:37.629\nAnd it's just the stupid little zero that\nyou added when you're going through these\n\n339\n00:18:37.629 --> 00:18:38.200\ncommands.\n\n340\n00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.120\nSo be very specific,\nespecially when you're in the exam booth.\n\n341\n00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.380\nThey'll probably, they might even try\nto hammer you with something like that.\n\n342\n00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.480\nWhere the command is just off, even\nthough it looks right from first glance.\n\n343\n00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.297\nWes, anything else we need to know\nabout this before we close her down?\n\n344\n00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:53.554\n>> No, watch your command syntax or\n\n345\n00:18:53.554 --> 00:18:58.452\nyou could go from hero to zero real quick,\nand the zero's do matter.\n\n346\n00:18:58.452 --> 00:19:01.290\n>> All right well you're a hero to us and\nwe appreciate you stopping by.\n\n347\n00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.596\nShow us how we can implement the ICD for\nour own environment.\n\n348\n00:19:04.596 --> 00:19:07.464\nSo with that being said, we're gonna\ngo ahead a close down the show,\n\n349\n00:19:07.464 --> 00:19:08.680\nsigning off for ITPro.TV.\n\n350\n00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.210\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n351\n00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.200\n>> And

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:18.280\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.390\nwe continue on with more Windows 10.\n\n5\n00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.150\nAnd in that series, the guy that's joining\nus today in this here studio to lend\n\n6\n00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.780\nthe way, is our good friend Mr. Wes Brian.\n\n7\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.010\nWes, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.690\nHow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.090\n>> Man, it's going great as always.\n\n10\n00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.410\nGreat to be here with ITProTV.\n\n11\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.560\nThat's right, we're jumping back in\nmore of that Windows 10, the 7698 exam.\n\n12\n00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.000\nAnd the next topic that we are going\nto demonstrating is one that, well,\n\n13\n00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.735\nhey, we really can't demonstrate.\n\n14\n00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:45.040\n[LAUGH] And that is something\nknown as volume activation.\n\n15\n00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.040\nIt's something that you are going to have\nto do inside of an enterprise environment.\n\n16\n00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.680\nAnd I have to tell you guys,\ngoing out the gate,\n\n17\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.810\nI would love to show you guys step\nby step how to implement this,\n\n18\n00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.090\nimplement volume activation service\nwithin your servers and implement KMS.\n\n19\n00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.680\nUnfortunately though, to get things like\nwhat we'll talk about, the KMS host key,\n\n20\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.850\nyou do have to be a volume licensed\nsubscriber, if you will, to a Microsoft\n\n21\n00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.790\ncontract or you can't really get access\nto a key in order to implement this.\n\n22\n00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.755\n>> So is it a hard thing to do Wes,\ncome on.\n\n23\n00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:18.430\n[LAUGH]\n>> It only takes several\n\n24\n00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.010\nhundreds of thousands of dollars I'm sure\nbecause remember one of the things you\n\n25\n00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.610\nhave to prove in volume licensing\nis that you have for instance,\n\n26\n00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.770\nthere is a few different technologies.\n\n27\n00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.730\nLet's go ahead and\nbreak them down real quick.\n\n28\n00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.620\nThere's a couple of them\nthat are oldies but goodies.\n\n29\n00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.900\nThey've been around as a volume\nlicensing model for a while now.\n\n30\n00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.090\nAnd the first one is called a multiple\nactivation key, MAK, all right?\n\n31\n00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.700\nNow we're not gonna spend too\nmuch time on the MAK key,\n\n32\n00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.770\nbecause it's a very simplistic process.\n\n33\n00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.760\nAnd if you've ever done an installation\nand then an activation of Windows,\n\n34\n00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.790\nit's really no different than what\nyou would do in the consumer side.\n\n35\n00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.102\nWhat is it?\nWell it's a 25 character if you will\n\n36\n00:01:53.102 --> 00:01:56.981\nproduct key just like you would find\non the optical media if you went and\n\n37\n00:01:56.981 --> 00:01:59.840\npurchased one from a third party reseller.\n\n38\n00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.260\nBut the difference here is that\nkey doesn't typically come\n\n39\n00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.330\non an individual if you will\ninstallation of Windows.\n\n40\n00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.960\nIt's called a multiple application key\nbecause when you join into a volume\n\n41\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.310\nlicense subscription with Microsoft, they\ngive you this key, and they say, okay,\n\n42\n00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.955\naccording to your subscription,\nyou purchased 250 activations.\n\n43\n00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:21.080\nAll right, so you use that key,\nthat one key,\n\n44\n00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.290\nand it activates 250 instances of\nWindows 10 inside your environment.\n\n45\n00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.290\nOr more,\ndepending on how big a company you are.\n\n46\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.010\nSimplistic.\n\n47\n00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.190\nThat one's easy to understand.\n\n48\n00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.694\nThe other one that's been around for a\nwhile is maybe not so easy to understand,\n\n49\n00:02:33.694 --> 00:02:34.488\nand that's KMS.\n\n50\n00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:38.638\nAnd this is the one, again, where you need\nis a certain key in order to demonstrate\n\n51\n00:02:38.638 --> 00:02:41.340\nit but, KMS is the key management service.\n\n52\n00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.270\nNow, key management service is\ndifferent in MAK in the fact that\n\n53\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.870\nyou have a centrally managed host.\n\n54\n00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.240\nThat host like a proxy does the\nactivations on behalf of all the clients.\n\n55\n00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.130\nNow you might say, well why would I use\nthis over something light that seems\n\n56\n00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.500\nsimplistic like the multiple\nactivation key?\n\n57\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.310\nWell, in an environment where you're\ncompletely managed and controlled and\n\n58\n00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.780\nyou don't want your clients\nreaching out to Windows update.\n\n59\n00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.660\nWell, you don't wanna use a MAK\nbecause KMS, the KMS host internally,\n\n60\n00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.490\ncan activate on behalf of all\nthe internal KMS clients,\n\n61\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.810\nand the KMS hosts only\nneeds to activate once.\n\n62\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.820\nRight.\nWhen you install the KMS host key,\n\n63\n00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.162\nwhich is the key we can't get access to\nreally, unless you had that subscription,\n\n64\n00:03:23.162 --> 00:03:28.830\nis installed in the KMS host and then it\ngoes out to Microsoft, activates one side.\n\n65\n00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.800\nAnd then from there on out, your machines\ninternally will just talk to the host, and\n\n66\n00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.790\nthere's no more internet connection,\ncommunication really needed.\n\n67\n00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.190\nSo that's why you might\nimplement something like KMS.\n\n68\n00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.460\nNow, some of the facts that you might\nneed to know about KMS on the exam, and\n\n69\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.210\nthat's one of the reasons\nwe want to go into this,\n\n70\n00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.180\nbecause we want you to be prepared for\nthe certification exam.\n\n71\n00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.340\nWhen you go and sit down and\nyou're in that hot seat,\n\n72\n00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.760\nwe want you to get some\nof those questions right.\n\n73\n00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.920\nSo let's go ahead and,\nI've got a diagram here on my desktop, and\n\n74\n00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.510\nwe can kinda run through\nsome of the facts and\n\n75\n00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.530\nthen we can talk a little bit\nmore about how this works.\n\n76\n00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.680\nAll right, a KMS host is\nthe centrally managed server,\n\n77\n00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.210\nit doesn't really have to be a server.\n\n78\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.260\nIt can actually be a work\nstation if you want.\n\n79\n00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.230\nBut it's the centrally managed\ndevice that all of the clients,\n\n80\n00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.780\nKMS clients are these Windows 10\nmachines that need activation.\n\n81\n00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.830\nAll right,\nwell what they do is contact the KMS host.\n\n82\n00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.850\nAll right, now the KMS host will return\n\n83\n00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.030\nan answer back to the kms client\nwith an activation count.\n\n84\n00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.100\nSo there's an activation threshold\nthat needs to be met before\n\n85\n00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.210\nthese machines will even activate.\n\n86\n00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.530\nAnd that's kind of Count of 25.\n\n87\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.520\nAll right.\n\n88\n00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.080\nSo if my first computer connects,\nit's gonna receive an activation count.\n\n89\n00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.600\nIf it's the 25th computer or\nabove, activation occurs.\n\n90\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.540\nAll right now, the host activates,\nwe talked about the 25 computer threshold.\n\n91\n00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.780\nThat's for Windows clients.\n\n92\n00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.620\nI'm not sure that on the client exam, the\nMCSA, they're gonna ask you this question.\n\n93\n00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.730\nBut we're gonna throw that here just for\nyou, just in case.\n\n94\n00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.090\nIf it's a server,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n95\n00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.890\nThe threshold is a lot lower, it's five.\n\n96\n00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.860\nIt waits till five serves have\nrequested activation internally and\n\n97\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.720\nthen it activates.\n\n98\n00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.610\nAgain, I'm not sure if that one's\ngoing to be on the test but\n\n99\n00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.480\nif it is,\nyou'll have your bases covered for it.\n\n100\n00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.130\nNow, so the client sends an activation\nrequest to the KMS host for validation.\n\n101\n00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.740\nAll right, if the threshold counter,\nthat count comes back to the client and\n\n102\n00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.890\nit's not the 25th computer\nIt's not gonna activate.\n\n103\n00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.880\nAnd then it's gonna retry every two hours.\n\n104\n00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.430\nIt's gonna try to contact that host.\n\n105\n00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.720\nAnd then finally when the activation count\nis met, all of the computers activate.\n\n106\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.400\nAll right.\n\n107\n00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.360\nNow, this next one here that\nI want to kind of look at\n\n108\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.090\nis the activation is valid for 180 days.\n\n109\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.510\nSo if, let's say Dan's got a KMS Host and\n\n110\n00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.890\nmy client connects to it, receives\nits validation, and it's activated.\n\n111\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.590\nAll right?\n\n112\n00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.940\nThen let's say for whatever reason I lose\nconnectivity to the network for 180 days,\n\n113\n00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.590\nor maybe the KMS host goes offline for\nwhatever reason.\n\n114\n00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.330\nThat 181st day, my activation is stripped,\nit's removed and I'm no longer activated.\n\n115\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.760\nSo, you have to maintain a communication\nwith the KMS host in order to stay\n\n116\n00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.770\nactivated.\n\n117\n00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.450\nNow, the reason I want\nto stop there just for\n\n118\n00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.020\na second is because that is the same thing\nin Active Directory based activation.\n\n119\n00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.020\nNow you say, well, wait a second.\n\n120\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.870\nWhat is Active Directory based activation?\n\n121\n00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.550\nWell, we'll get to it,\nInto that here in a second.\n\n122\n00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.940\nBut that's the third multiple\nactivation of volume activation,\n\n123\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.500\nand it's relatively new to\nthe Windows environment.\n\n124\n00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.870\nThis means that if a computer\nis joined to your domain,\n\n125\n00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.380\nyou have the volume activation services\ninstalled within the domain, it could\n\n126\n00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.720\nreach out to the domain controller and\nit could say, hey, here I am.\n\n127\n00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.550\nAnd the activation remains.\n\n128\n00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.130\nNow, in active directory,\n\n129\n00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.830\nif your computer doesn't talk to\nthe domain controller within 180 days,\n\n130\n00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.410\nit loses that trust relationship and\nit's kicked off the domain.\n\n131\n00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.080\nWhen it's kicked off the domain\ncuz it can't contact the domain\n\n132\n00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.920\ncontroller, guess what.\n\n133\n00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.170\nNot only does it lose\nits trust relationship,\n\n134\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.630\nactivation is stripped\noff the machine as well.\n\n135\n00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.980\nSo these numbers kind of\ncoincide with each other and\n\n136\n00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.020\nmight help you out on\nthe exam to remember them.\n\n137\n00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.140\nKMS Host is no different.\n\n138\n00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.715\nAfter 180 days, if I don't communicate\nwith it, activation is removed.\n\n139\n00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.835\nNow, you're going to say wait a second,\nit waits every 180 days?\n\n140\n00:07:06.835 --> 00:07:07.665\nNo, it does not.\n\n141\n00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:10.815\nIt tries every week,\njust to say hey, I'm still here.\n\n142\n00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:11.665\nThat's all it needs to do.\n\n143\n00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:13.919\nIf it talks to the KMS host,\nsays hey, I'm still here,\n\n144\n00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:17.327\nit maintains it's activation and\nthen that account renews itself.\n\n145\n00:07:17.327 --> 00:07:19.097\nSo it's constantly trying\nto renew this account.\n\n146\n00:07:19.097 --> 00:07:22.647\nI don't want you to think it's\ninefficient in any way, but\n\n147\n00:07:22.647 --> 00:07:23.815\nthat's the maximum threshold.\n\n148\n00:07:23.815 --> 00:07:27.440\nNow, firewall issues, all right.\n\n149\n00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.730\nThe next one I'd like to bring up\nis the fact of this KMS traffic.\n\n150\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.180\nAll right there's\na service on your machine.\n\n151\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.240\nIt's called a KMS traffic service.\n\n152\n00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.158\nAll right, if the firewall is set\nthat service with an exception then\n\n153\n00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:40.310\na communication is going to happen.\n\n154\n00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:45.174\nAll right but remember we're not always\njust talking directly to another machine\n\n155\n00:07:45.174 --> 00:07:47.158\nthat might be on the same subnet.\n\n156\n00:07:47.158 --> 00:07:49.443\nWhat if this KMS host is\non another subnet, and\n\n157\n00:07:49.443 --> 00:07:53.020\nwe typically are implementing some\nkind of ACL between the two subnets,\n\n158\n00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.672\nmaybe with a firewall,\nmaybe with a rule on a router.\n\n159\n00:07:55.672 --> 00:07:57.247\nWe have to make an exemption.\n\n160\n00:07:57.247 --> 00:08:02.455\nTo make sure that that traffic happens,\nthat traffic traverses over port 1688.\n\n161\n00:08:02.455 --> 00:08:03.773\nRemember that for the exam.\n\n162\n00:08:03.773 --> 00:08:07.849\nIf they give you a diagram or something\nand they say, you're not communicating on\n\n163\n00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:11.110\nthis subnet with a KMS host,\nwhat could possibly be the problem?\n\n164\n00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.390\nIf there's a firewall exemption\non the list and it's 1688,\n\n165\n00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.030\nit's probably gonna be the right answer.\n\n166\n00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.970\nNow, one of the other things\nI'd like to talk about\n\n167\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:26.090\nis an event viewer error that\nmight come up on the exam as well.\n\n168\n00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.420\nBecause it's common to kms, and\nthat's when their network goes down.\n\n169\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.882\nThis is a error, what is it?\n\n170\n00:08:30.882 --> 00:08:34.938\nIt's 12,289,\nI know that's kind of a weird number here,\n\n171\n00:08:34.938 --> 00:08:37.530\nbut I want you to remember it for\nthe exam.\n\n172\n00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.270\nWhat is it about that error\nthat's gonna cause problems?\n\n173\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.880\nWith a client, if you go in and\nyou check the event in your logs, and\n\n174\n00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.633\nyou got 12,2089 there.\n\n175\n00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:50.395\nThen what happens is, your network\nis down, DNS can't resolve names or\n\n176\n00:08:50.395 --> 00:08:52.808\nyou have some kind of\ncommunication problem.\n\n177\n00:08:52.808 --> 00:08:56.099\nMaybe a firewall,\nit kind of blends itself all together.\n\n178\n00:08:56.099 --> 00:09:00.679\nThat's why keeping in mind\nwith the TCP 1688 port.\n\n179\n00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:03.973\nYou should be good with some\ntroubleshooting that they might ask you\n\n180\n00:09:03.973 --> 00:09:04.968\nfor KMS on the exam.\n\n181\n00:09:04.968 --> 00:09:07.180\nThat's one of the reasons we\nwant to touch base with that.\n\n182\n00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.887\nNow that being said,\nlet's look at the process.\n\n183\n00:09:10.887 --> 00:09:13.747\nSo on my diagram here,\nI've got kind of a process,\n\n184\n00:09:13.747 --> 00:09:18.350\nwhen the KMS client goes to activate,\nthere's a four step process that happens.\n\n185\n00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.664\nAnd you might say maybe a pseudo fifth\nstep if it doesn't actually activate, but\n\n186\n00:09:22.664 --> 00:09:24.660\nlet's look what's going on here.\n\n187\n00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.800\nIn the first step,\nwhat's gonna happen here is\n\n188\n00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:33.210\nthe client is going to check with DNS.\n\n189\n00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.704\nSo many services that we have\ninside of a corporate environment\n\n190\n00:09:37.704 --> 00:09:41.369\nare reliant upon DNS to be\nable to find the machine.\n\n191\n00:09:41.369 --> 00:09:42.575\nLook at your domain controller.\n\n192\n00:09:42.575 --> 00:09:44.950\nWhen the computer needs to find\na domain controller what does it do?\n\n193\n00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.841\nIt queries DNS and says,\nI need an SRV record,\n\n194\n00:09:47.841 --> 00:09:51.937\nservice locator record to find\nwhere's the domain controller.\n\n195\n00:09:51.937 --> 00:09:54.180\nWell that's really no different here.\n\n196\n00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.660\nWe need to find the KMS host and\nthe client doesn't know where the host is.\n\n197\n00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.490\nSo the first thing it does\nis it checks in with DNS.\n\n198\n00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:03.690\nIt says hey, DNS server,\n\n199\n00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:09.370\ndo you own where this KMS host is that\nthey're telling me I need to contact?\n\n200\n00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.350\nAnd DNS looks at its little zone file,\n\n201\n00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:16.000\nlittle database with all those entries in\nit and says, yeah, here is the KMS host.\n\n202\n00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.010\nSo that response there is the second step.\n\n203\n00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.090\nThe DNS server responds\nback to the client and\n\n204\n00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.510\nsays, you can find the KMS\nserver with this IP address.\n\n205\n00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.297\nThe whole name resolution process.\n\n206\n00:10:25.297 --> 00:10:30.040\nIn this case that's a service to\nan IP address and it says third step.\n\n207\n00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.537\nLet me send an activation\nrequest over to the KMSO.\n\n208\n00:10:33.537 --> 00:10:38.320\nSo the client's now talking to the KMSOs\nand saying, I need to activate.\n\n209\n00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.870\nNow on the fourth step, the KMS host,\nwho's doing the activation on behalf of\n\n210\n00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.890\nthe client, contacts the KMS c lient and\nsays okay, here's the activation count.\n\n211\n00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:53.180\nNow, if this is the first KMS client\nto communicate with the KMS host,\n\n212\n00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.850\nthen there's gonna be that pseudo fifth\nstep that I was telling you about.\n\n213\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.876\nBecause what's gonna happen is the KMS\nhost talks back to the client and\n\n214\n00:10:59.876 --> 00:11:01.027\nsays computer one.\n\n215\n00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:05.570\nWell computer one isn't the 25th computer,\nso there's not gonna be an activation.\n\n216\n00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:10.490\nNow if I was to throw maybe a client\nII in here, what would happen?\n\n217\n00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.128\nWell the client II would go without\nredrawing all these errors.\n\n218\n00:11:13.128 --> 00:11:15.801\nThe client II would go\nthrough the same process and\n\n219\n00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:19.108\nwhen it decide it was gonna do\nit activation with the KMS host,\n\n220\n00:11:19.108 --> 00:11:23.518\nit's gonna see the activation count comes\nback and says, you're computer two.\n\n221\n00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:28.671\nAnd then this just cyclic process keeps\nhappening up until they check every\n\n222\n00:11:28.671 --> 00:11:33.738\ntwo hours and the KMS host finally says,\nokay, computer 1 or client 1 or\n\n223\n00:11:33.738 --> 00:11:39.510\nclient 2, you are now the 25th\ncomputer then all clients activate.\n\n224\n00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:43.120\nSo in a nutshell that's essentially\nwhat the key management service is\n\n225\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.880\ndoing for us.\n\n226\n00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.370\nUnderstand, it does require\na volume license contract.\n\n227\n00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:53.314\nNow that being said, there's another\none that we wanna talk about,\n\n228\n00:11:53.314 --> 00:11:54.859\nand we'll go ahead.\n\n229\n00:11:54.859 --> 00:11:58.226\nLet's talk about some Active Directory,\nI don't see it in my notes here.\n\n230\n00:11:58.226 --> 00:12:01.570\nLet's talk a little bit about\nsome Active Directory activation.\n\n231\n00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:07.570\nNow with Active Directory activation it\nrelies, a lot like KMS on having that key\n\n232\n00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.900\navailable, which you could only basically\nhave in that subscription to Microsoft.\n\n233\n00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:16.410\nYou install that on your domain control\nand then what happens is the computers\n\n234\n00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:20.320\ntalk to the domain controllers and\nthey say, hey, I'm a domain member.\n\n235\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.150\nYou're a domain member,\nwell when we installed that volume\n\n236\n00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.240\nactivation key it created an object\ninside of active directory.\n\n237\n00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.710\nAnd says, hey, let me apply that to you,\nyou're now activated.\n\n238\n00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:34.053\nNow this process happens pretty close to\nthe same way that KMS does in the fact\n\n239\n00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:38.074\nthat it's gonna contact every seven\ndays just to try to keep that updated.\n\n240\n00:12:38.074 --> 00:12:41.244\nAnd every time it communicates with\nthe domain controller even on things like\n\n241\n00:12:41.244 --> 00:12:41.790\nGP updates.\n\n242\n00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.972\nSo if I'm doing a group policy update,\n\n243\n00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.756\nthat might actually\ntrigger the communication.\n\n244\n00:12:46.756 --> 00:12:52.010\nSo the computer maintains its activation\nwhile it's a part of the domain.\n\n245\n00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.340\nWhen it's kicked off of the domain or\n\n246\n00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.650\nwhen it loses its trust relationship,\nguess what?\n\n247\n00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.540\nJust like I said before,\nthat activation is removed.\n\n248\n00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:03.370\nSo this is a good way to manage\nthe activation on multiple machines in\n\n249\n00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.690\nan environment that you're already gonna\nhave existing within your Enterprise,\n\n250\n00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.710\nlike domain controllers and\nwith just a couple extra steps.\n\n251\n00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.820\nNow, the next thing we have to look\nat a little bit about is how to\n\n252\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.890\nfind out licensing states\ninside of Windows.\n\n253\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.290\nAnd that's where something known as\nthe software licensing manager comes in.\n\n254\n00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:29.225\nAnd there are quite a few\ndifferent commands that I want you\n\n255\n00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.447\nto be aware of on the exam.\n\n256\n00:13:31.447 --> 00:13:37.514\nThe software licensing manager\nis essentially a VBScript.\n\n257\n00:13:37.514 --> 00:13:41.521\nNow, when it runs,\nwhat it allows you to do is query and\n\n258\n00:13:41.521 --> 00:13:46.740\nconfigure the activation states\nthrough the command line.\n\n259\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.100\nThere's a few parameters that\nI want you to be aware of.\n\n260\n00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.840\nSo I'm gonna essentially,\n\n261\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.220\nlet me show you how this would look\nif I was gonna enter the command.\n\n262\n00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.740\nIt's called the software licensing\nmanager, but it's actually slmgr.\n\n263\n00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.610\nAnd it's implied you don't really\nhave to put the .vbs anymore,\n\n264\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.670\nyou can just run slmgr and\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n265\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.090\nBut then I'm gonna put these\ndifferent switches on it.\n\n266\n00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.553\nAnd I really want you to know\nthese different switches and\n\n267\n00:14:11.553 --> 00:14:12.791\nthese are just a few of them.\n\n268\n00:14:12.791 --> 00:14:16.482\nAgain if you ever drop into command\nline in fact, I'll tell you what?\n\n269\n00:14:16.482 --> 00:14:17.846\nI'll go ahead and show you that.\n\n270\n00:14:17.846 --> 00:14:20.570\nLet me log in here to this machine.\n\n271\n00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.982\nSo you can practice this part\non your Windows 10 clients,\n\n272\n00:14:23.982 --> 00:14:26.995\non your server clients as well,\neither or it works.\n\n273\n00:14:26.995 --> 00:14:30.095\nSo at least a good thing that\nwe can kind of demonstrate here.\n\n274\n00:14:30.095 --> 00:14:35.041\nIf I drop down to my PowerShell\ncommand prompt, whichever one you use.\n\n275\n00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:38.498\nI prefer to use PowerShell because\nI can use both at the same time and\n\n276\n00:14:38.498 --> 00:14:42.222\nI don't have to open two CLIs,\nwhich is kind of goofy in and off itself.\n\n277\n00:14:42.222 --> 00:14:45.332\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe'll clear this screen.\n\n278\n00:14:45.332 --> 00:14:48.410\nMaybe clear this screen\nif Wes can spell right.\n\n279\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.200\nWe'll try that one more time,\nthree strikes you're out.\n\n280\n00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.813\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna run slmgr.\n\n281\n00:14:54.813 --> 00:15:02.290\nNow when I do, you can see right here that\nit says running a Windows Script Host.\n\n282\n00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.850\nNotice it's saying,\nInvalid combination of command parameters.\n\n283\n00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.278\nI didn't put a parameter in it.\n\n284\n00:15:06.278 --> 00:15:09.939\nWell the visual basic scripting\nhost says that's a VBScript.\n\n285\n00:15:09.939 --> 00:15:11.109\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n286\n00:15:11.109 --> 00:15:14.692\nput up this Visual Basic box with\nsome of the information on this.\n\n287\n00:15:14.692 --> 00:15:17.059\nAnd you can go through these differnt, and\n\n288\n00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:20.030\nyou can see there's a lot\nof information here.\n\n289\n00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:24.355\nBut I wanna kinda just go through some\nof them to help make you aware of it.\n\n290\n00:15:24.355 --> 00:15:28.053\nSo you can see, I can get this\ninformation, software licensing manager is\n\n291\n00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:32.239\nright there, and it goes through quite a\nfew of these different activation states.\n\n292\n00:15:32.239 --> 00:15:38.267\nIf you did a forward slash question mark\non it, it's gonna open up the same thing.\n\n293\n00:15:38.267 --> 00:15:42.485\nSo just a way that if you guys are\npracticing this at home you can kinda look\n\n294\n00:15:42.485 --> 00:15:44.985\nthrough some of these different options.\n\n295\n00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:48.266\nI've actually installed product keys\nwith a software licensing manager and\n\n296\n00:15:48.266 --> 00:15:50.850\nthat's really one of the first\nones we wanna look at, that.\n\n297\n00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.013\nIPK option.\n\n298\n00:15:52.013 --> 00:15:54.014\nThat's install product key.\n\n299\n00:15:54.014 --> 00:15:56.380\nFor your exam,\nI want you to remember something.\n\n300\n00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:05.020\nGive you a tip that I've done in the past\nis when I see for instance, an acronym or\n\n301\n00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.580\nI see a command that's got a parameter\nthat I need to try to remember for\n\n302\n00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:12.430\nthe exam, I try to sound it off in my\nhead as to what it might be doing.\n\n303\n00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.855\nWell this one's actually kinda easy.\n\n304\n00:16:13.855 --> 00:16:15.770\nIpk, install product key.\n\n305\n00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.340\nSo what I would do is I would\nturn around after the fact and\n\n306\n00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.320\nyou guys have probably seen\nyour product keys, right?\n\n307\n00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.175\nIt would be something like,\noops, I'm gonna try that again.\n\n308\n00:16:25.175 --> 00:16:26.500\nIt'd be something like this.\n\n309\n00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.970\nI know we've all seen, or maybe you\nhaven't, and that's why you're here.\n\n310\n00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:38.010\nIf not, you'd turn around and you would\nput that product key there, right?\n\n311\n00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:42.470\nNow, what that's gonna do is\nthat's gonna take the product key,\n\n312\n00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.550\ninstall it on a local machine.\n\n313\n00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.020\nBut it doesn't necessarily activate it.\n\n314\n00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:47.880\nKeep that in mind.\n\n315\n00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.580\nThat doesn't activate the machine.\n\n316\n00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.900\nAll right, now there's another one that\n\n317\n00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.710\nI didn't put on the list that I'm\ngonna kinda throw here in the middle.\n\n318\n00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:57.780\nAnd I think you should know it.\n\n319\n00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.990\nIt's not on my diagram here,\nbut that's okay.\n\n320\n00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.290\nNow we can update that diagram\nreal quick and now it's there.\n\n321\n00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.630\nAnd that's upk, all right?\n\n322\n00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:09.148\nSo Dan, if I is install product key,\nwhat do you think upk might be?\n\n323\n00:17:09.148 --> 00:17:10.570\nWhat do you think that u stands for?\n\n324\n00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:11.070\n>> Underwear.\n>> That's right.\n\n325\n00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:11.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n326\n00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.028\n>> That's exactly what it stands,\n\n327\n00:17:14.028 --> 00:17:16.720\nno just kidding.\n[LAUGH] It's uninstall product key,\n\n328\n00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.150\nright?\nSo there's a couple and like I said,\n\n329\n00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.430\nI didn't put it in the diagram.\nBut you turn around and you would have now\n\n330\n00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:27.660\nto implement or to use an ActivationID.\nSo this one's a little bit\n\n331\n00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:32.955\ndifferent because understanding how\nactivation works is kind of important.\n\n332\n00:17:32.955 --> 00:17:37.395\nThis wouldn't be necessarily\na 25 character product key.\n\n333\n00:17:37.395 --> 00:17:40.680\nThis would be what they\ncall the ActivationID.\n\n334\n00:17:42.285 --> 00:17:44.203\nNow what is that ActivationID mean for us?\n\n335\n00:17:44.203 --> 00:17:47.270\nWell the ActivationID is what Microsoft\n\n336\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:52.250\nstores in the registry upon\na successful activation.\n\n337\n00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.580\nNow, boy isn't that confusing?\n\n338\n00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.596\nSo what does that mean?\n\n339\n00:17:54.596 --> 00:17:57.330\nAll right [LAUGH] well\nlet's kind of step back and\n\n340\n00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.110\ntell you what's going on when\nyou activate, all right?\n\n341\n00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:04.210\nWhen you install your operating system,\nit creates and stores in the registry,\n\n342\n00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.800\nthe H-Key local machine, something\nknown as a hardware identifier, right.\n\n343\n00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.510\nAnd then with your product\nkey you get that, excuse me,\n\n344\n00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:18.560\nwith your media, you get a product key\nthat license the installation, all right?\n\n345\n00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:24.450\nWhen you activate, you're setting the\nhardware identifier and the product ID,\n\n346\n00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:29.080\nwhich is basically made\nfrom your product key.\n\n347\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.110\nYou're sending both of them over\nto Microsoft's activation servers.\n\n348\n00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.965\nNow what they do is they know, they're\naware of the product identifiers that they\n\n349\n00:18:36.965 --> 00:18:38.055\nhave, they're the ones that issue them.\n\n350\n00:18:38.055 --> 00:18:42.205\nSo they've got a database of all the\nlicensed copies of Windows that are out\n\n351\n00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:43.125\nthere, in this case Windows 10.\n\n352\n00:18:43.125 --> 00:18:46.125\nAnd they also keep track of\nthe hardware identifiers.\n\n353\n00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.920\nSo first thing they do is they say,\nis that a valid product ID?\n\n354\n00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.460\nOkay, that's a valid product ID.\n\n355\n00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.980\nIt's ours, it's legitimate,\nauthorized, licensed software.\n\n356\n00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.600\nNow let's look through our list and\n\n357\n00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.140\nsee if we can find it associated\nwith a hardware identifier.\n\n358\n00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.680\nNow if they can,\nthat means it's been activated and\n\n359\n00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.830\ntied to a machine beforehand and\nactivation's gonna fail.\n\n360\n00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:05.590\nWe're not worried about that.\n\n361\n00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:07.440\nWe're saying this is\nthe first time you activate.\n\n362\n00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.009\nWhen you do that, they take that product\nidentifier of their software and\n\n363\n00:19:12.009 --> 00:19:15.113\nyour hardware ID and\nthey marry the two together.\n\n364\n00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:18.323\nAnd the result is an ActivationID\nthat gets sent back to you and\n\n365\n00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:20.090\nstored in the registry.\n\n366\n00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:25.180\nAll right, so\nyou need your ActivationID to uninstall,\n\n367\n00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.590\nif you will, a product key, all right?\n\n368\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.720\nThen we got ato, all right?\n\n369\n00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.250\nNow what does ato mean?\n\n370\n00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:38.480\nAll right, if I do an ipk and\nI install a product key, all right?\n\n371\n00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:43.270\nAto, activate, force the activation\nonline, that's what it does.\n\n372\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.200\nIt performs an online activation.\n\n373\n00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.125\nNow is this only for retail?\n\n374\n00:19:50.125 --> 00:19:54.090\nNo, three different types can be\nactivated this way if you want.\n\n375\n00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:57.930\nIf you force an online activation,\nyou can even do it with KMS, right.\n\n376\n00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.540\nRemember the purpose of KMS is I\ndon't wanna go out to the Internet.\n\n377\n00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.699\nWell if am having a hard reason, for\nwhatever reason, I might want to\n\n378\n00:20:04.699 --> 00:20:08.418\ntroubleshooting or something, I can force\nan activation of a KMS key, client.\n\n379\n00:20:08.418 --> 00:20:11.670\nCould also do it with Mac and\nyou can also do it with retail.\n\n380\n00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:16.546\nSo there's three different\ntypes of activations.\n\n381\n00:20:16.546 --> 00:20:21.563\nNow, the next one we'll actually\nkind of demonstrate here is dli,\n\n382\n00:20:21.563 --> 00:20:23.858\ndisplay license, what is it?\n\n383\n00:20:23.858 --> 00:20:25.622\nDisplay license information.\n\n384\n00:20:25.622 --> 00:20:30.160\nAll right, I'm working with a machine\nright now that is a lab machine.\n\n385\n00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.380\nI haven't activated, right?\n\n386\n00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.720\nI'm gonna turn around and probably\ngonna blow it away after we're done.\n\n387\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.920\nSo if I wanna find out,\nall I have to do is SL Mgr space,\n\n388\n00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.360\nand I can do a dash and I can do dli.\n\n389\n00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.300\nAll right, now notice when I do that,\nnotice what comes up.\n\n390\n00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.485\nRemember that scripting host and notice\nthat I did not type in .vbs, all right?\n\n391\n00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:54.990\nYou just don't have to.\n\n392\n00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:59.864\nNotice volume license client channel,\nall right, PartialProductKey,\n\n393\n00:20:59.864 --> 00:21:02.376\nLicense Status Notification.\n\n394\n00:21:02.376 --> 00:21:05.740\nWell what does\nthe License Status Notification mean?\n\n395\n00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:10.030\nWell I want you to see this little\nnotification down here in the bottom.\n\n396\n00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.190\nNotice it says, Activate Windows.\n\n397\n00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.415\nThat's what they mean, notification.\n\n398\n00:21:13.415 --> 00:21:21.060\nAll right, now notice here\nwe can use ato to activate.\n\n399\n00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.060\nSo this kind of steps us in to that\nato that I was just telling you.\n\n400\n00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.657\nI can force an online\nactivation if I want, but\n\n401\n00:21:26.657 --> 00:21:29.360\nthis tells me what the license state is.\n\n402\n00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:37.100\nAll right, so that is the display license.\n\n403\n00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:45.130\nNow the next one is the expiration\ndate for the current license state.\n\n404\n00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:49.570\nSo if I do xpr, I can find out\nwhat's the expiration date for\n\n405\n00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:50.670\nthe current license state.\n\n406\n00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.016\nNow you say well wait a second,\nWes, if you've activated,\n\n407\n00:21:54.016 --> 00:21:56.455\nwhy am I worried about\nan activation state?\n\n408\n00:21:56.455 --> 00:22:01.426\nWell remember KMS only stays activated\nas long as it can contact the KMS host.\n\n409\n00:22:01.426 --> 00:22:05.186\nAll right, so\nthat is important to remember, right?\n\n410\n00:22:05.186 --> 00:22:10.470\nSo you might wanna know that you have\n150 days left to talk to the KMS host.\n\n411\n00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:14.530\nOr within seven days, maybe you still\nhaven't contacted the KMS host.\n\n412\n00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:20.250\nYou come in here and you find that\nyour activation state is 173 days.\n\n413\n00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:24.910\nWell, it should have connected after\nseven and tried to renew that state.\n\n414\n00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.190\nSo now I gotta find out why I'm not\ncommunicating with my KMS host.\n\n415\n00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.760\nSo there is a valid reason for that one.\n\n416\n00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.070\nThat's just as an example.\n\n417\n00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.090\nAll right, there's another one that\nI wanna throw in here that's not on\n\n418\n00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.480\nthe slide, as well.\n\n419\n00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.970\nAnd that is, I'll go ahead and\njust talk about it real quick.\n\n420\n00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.240\nAnd that's sri, all right?\n\n421\n00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.003\nSri sets the renew interval for\nyour client.\n\n422\n00:22:45.003 --> 00:22:45.811\n>> I thought that was an Apple product.\n\n423\n00:22:45.811 --> 00:22:49.110\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, wrong sri.\n\n424\n00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:52.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what this does is this digitally\n\n425\n00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.330\nassists your computers in\nrenewing their interval, right?\n\n426\n00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:02.150\nSo if I know that one's coming to the end\nof its life or its license status and\n\n427\n00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:06.090\nit needs to renew, maybe I've been doing\nsome testing with the KMS host, and\n\n428\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.660\nI know that I want this\nto renew the interval.\n\n429\n00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.230\nWell we can do that too with sri.\n\n430\n00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:16.680\nAll right, last but not the least is\nwhat's known as the good old rearm.\n\n431\n00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.312\nAnd if anybody has had to do Windows\nimaging and provide for instance,\n\n432\n00:23:21.312 --> 00:23:24.296\na generalized image to\na deployment server,\n\n433\n00:23:24.296 --> 00:23:26.980\nyou've probably seen this one before.\n\n434\n00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.150\nAnd you didn't even know\nthat it was happening.\n\n435\n00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:33.155\nAll right, rearm resets the grace period,\nall right?\n\n436\n00:23:33.155 --> 00:23:36.820\nYou got 30 days grace periods\nto activate your machines.\n\n437\n00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.350\nAnd at a certain point it's\ngonna start saying hey,\n\n438\n00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.980\nthis isn't a genuine copy, right?\n\n439\n00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.422\nIt's gonna eventually\nreduce its functionality.\n\n440\n00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:46.964\nWell if you need to\nreset that grace period,\n\n441\n00:23:46.964 --> 00:23:51.079\nall you have to do is step\nback to your machine here,\n\n442\n00:23:51.079 --> 00:23:54.937\nSlmgr /rearm And\nyou can rearm it, all right?\n\n443\n00:23:54.937 --> 00:23:59.478\nNow, I can turn around, and I can,\nnotice it says completed the command,\n\n444\n00:23:59.478 --> 00:24:03.410\nrestart the system in order for\nthe changes to take affect.\n\n445\n00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.130\nAll right, now when I restart the machine,\nwhat's gonna\n\n446\n00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:11.050\nend up happening is that 30 day grace\nperiod is gonna be reset to 30 days.\n\n447\n00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:16.030\nNow, when you do, and just by association,\nI just mention it real briefly,\n\n448\n00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:20.149\nwhen you're doing deployments of your\noperating systems, when you run a Sysprep\n\n449\n00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:26.690\nspace /generalize, and it pulls out\nthe SID, it pulls out any unique drivers,\n\n450\n00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:30.810\nany machine specific updates,\nand generalizes the image.\n\n451\n00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.350\nBelieve it or not,\nit also invokes the SLI, or excuse me,\n\n452\n00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:39.120\nnot SLI, slmgr rearm operation.\n\n453\n00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.780\nSo they can kind of work hand in hand,\nall right.\n\n454\n00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.440\nThere's a reason you can only\nSysprep a machine three times, and\n\n455\n00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.580\nyou have reinstall your operating\nsystem and rebuild the image.\n\n456\n00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.720\nBecause every time you generalize it, or\n\n457\n00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:57.550\nyou're running the rearm option,\nslmgr rearm.\n\n458\n00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:02.010\nYou can only rearm the grace\nperiod three times.\n\n459\n00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:06.172\nAnd then you have to activate or\nreinstall the operating system.\n\n460\n00:25:06.172 --> 00:25:09.624\nSo that's kind of a way that\nthey get around saying,\n\n461\n00:25:09.624 --> 00:25:13.162\nI need to rearm, or\nI need to update the grace period.\n\n462\n00:25:13.162 --> 00:25:15.127\nWell, I'll just sit there and\ndo that 20 times, and\n\n463\n00:25:15.127 --> 00:25:17.030\nI'll never have to purchase\nthe operating system.\n\n464\n00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:21.806\nSo they do put a limit on it, and I'm\nsure that's to ensure [LAUGH] that they\n\n465\n00:25:21.806 --> 00:25:25.057\ndon't have pirates,\npiracy in their software.\n\n466\n00:25:25.057 --> 00:25:26.769\n>> They know us all to well, don't they?\n\n467\n00:25:26.769 --> 00:25:28.940\n>> They do, absolutely.\n\n468\n00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.457\nNow, one of the last things that\nthey call out as far as managing in\n\n469\n00:25:33.457 --> 00:25:38.655\nan enterprise environment is really\na little bit about your group policy.\n\n470\n00:25:38.655 --> 00:25:42.120\nYour group policy,\nif you guys really need to know and\n\n471\n00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.663\nwanna know the server side of group\npolicy, we do have some 2012,\n\n472\n00:25:46.663 --> 00:25:50.950\n2016 shows that really goes\nin depth about group policy.\n\n473\n00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.030\nBut there are a couple of\nthings that I want you to know.\n\n474\n00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.813\nAt least from the client side,\n\n475\n00:25:54.813 --> 00:25:58.379\nwhen it comes to something known\nas the user account control,\n\n476\n00:25:58.379 --> 00:26:03.263\ncuz they really call this out configuring\nand optimizing the user account control.\n\n477\n00:26:03.263 --> 00:26:04.272\nSo we're gonna do this.\n\n478\n00:26:04.272 --> 00:26:06.426\nSo we're gonna do two of\nthese at the same time.\n\n479\n00:26:06.426 --> 00:26:08.350\nWe're gonna do this from\nthe server side here, and\n\n480\n00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.040\nwe're gonna jump into our server.\n\n481\n00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.427\nAnd what I'm gonna do is\nopen up our Server Manager.\n\n482\n00:26:14.427 --> 00:26:16.080\nAll right,\nwe're gonna go into our Tools here.\n\n483\n00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:23.252\nWe're gonna launch up group policy, and\nwe'll go ahead and expand our forest out.\n\n484\n00:26:23.252 --> 00:26:26.732\nWe have our lab.ITPro.TV domain.\n\n485\n00:26:26.732 --> 00:26:31.132\nAll right now, when we look at group\npolicy, all right, group policy is just\n\n486\n00:26:31.132 --> 00:26:35.872\na suite of settings that are applied to\nmachines to control their configurations,\n\n487\n00:26:35.872 --> 00:26:40.052\nwhether it be computer configurations or\nuser configurations.\n\n488\n00:26:40.052 --> 00:26:43.320\nAll right,\nthere is a process on how these apply.\n\n489\n00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.340\nAll right, and understand that the last\npolicy that applies has the highest\n\n490\n00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.910\nprecedent, and\nit dictates what the settings are.\n\n491\n00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.500\nGroup policies can be applied\nat a few different levels.\n\n492\n00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.450\nThey can be applied at the local level.\n\n493\n00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:59.700\nThey can be applied at the site level.\n\n494\n00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.780\nThey can be applied at\nthe domain level and\n\n495\n00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.870\nthen they can be applied at the OU\nlevel or organizational unit.\n\n496\n00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.010\nAll right,\nI want you to remember that for the exam.\n\n497\n00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.383\nIf they ask you that you have\nconflicting settings and\n\n498\n00:27:09.383 --> 00:27:13.243\ntwo policies have the same divine setting,\nwhich ones are gonna apply to the machine?\n\n499\n00:27:13.243 --> 00:27:16.016\nI want you to remember local,\nsite, domain, OU.\n\n500\n00:27:16.016 --> 00:27:18.931\nIf I have a policy set up at site\nlevel and then at the domain level,\n\n501\n00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:20.735\nit'll have a conflicting setting, and\n\n502\n00:27:20.735 --> 00:27:23.280\nthat domain level policy is\nthe last one that'll apply,\n\n503\n00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.702\nbe sure to remember that the settings\nin the domain level apply, all right?\n\n504\n00:27:26.702 --> 00:27:30.637\nSo again, if you want a lot of in-depth\nknowledge about Active Directory,\n\n505\n00:27:30.637 --> 00:27:33.648\nnot which I think you're gonna\nhave to know for this exam,\n\n506\n00:27:33.648 --> 00:27:37.340\njump on over to our server courses,\nand they explain it in depth.\n\n507\n00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:41.282\nHowever, I do wanna to look from the\nclient's side a little bit more about what\n\n508\n00:27:41.282 --> 00:27:44.988\nthey're talking about when they say\nwe need to implement the user account\n\n509\n00:27:44.988 --> 00:27:45.543\ncontrol.\n\n510\n00:27:45.543 --> 00:27:47.760\nAll right, so we're gonna go here,\nwe're gonna expand out.\n\n511\n00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.130\nActually, not expand out, we don't want\nour default domain control policy.\n\n512\n00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.040\nWe're gonna expand down, and\nyou know what, let's do good practices,\n\n513\n00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.440\nI'm not gonna modify\nthe default domain policy.\n\n514\n00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.247\nIn fact, we go in here, and we'll create a\nnew policy by right-clicking on your group\n\n515\n00:28:01.247 --> 00:28:02.040\npolicy objects.\n\n516\n00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.360\nWe'll choose New, and we'll just call\nthis our user account control policy.\n\n517\n00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.920\nAll right, and\nthen we'll get in here in a second, and\n\n518\n00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.170\nwe will look at some of those settings.\n\n519\n00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.430\nNow, before we start modifying\nthe user account control,\n\n520\n00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.670\nI wanna kinda talk a little bit\nabout what it is, all right?\n\n521\n00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.480\nIf we jump back over to my slides,\n\n522\n00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.848\nI have a slide here that kind\nof shows what's going on.\n\n523\n00:28:24.848 --> 00:28:26.050\nAnd I wanna go ahead and\n\n524\n00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:29.658\nthrow these in the same context,\nnot just an admin account.\n\n525\n00:28:29.658 --> 00:28:33.420\nI also wanna go ahead and throw in here\nthat this could be a standard user\n\n526\n00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.160\naccount, and\nwe'll compare the differences, all right.\n\n527\n00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.019\nNow, Windows,\nway back in the days of Vista,\n\n528\n00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:45.141\nwhich I know people absolutely loved.\n\n529\n00:28:45.141 --> 00:28:50.133\nThere was a new security\nmodel that came out\n\n530\n00:28:50.133 --> 00:28:55.409\nthat differed from the XP model,\nall right.\n\n531\n00:28:55.409 --> 00:28:58.697\nAnd the XP model typically everyone\nwas running as an administrator,\n\n532\n00:28:58.697 --> 00:29:02.645\nwhich means for security purposes,\nwe know that shouldn't happen.\n\n533\n00:29:02.645 --> 00:29:08.040\nSo when the Vista came out, they said\nokay, we're gonna make it so that if you\n\n534\n00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:13.530\nwanna run certain tasks, you have to be\nan administrator to do it, all right.\n\n535\n00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:16.909\nAnd we're gonna keep your principle\nto least privilege, even if you\n\n536\n00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:20.770\nare an administrator, we're gonna run\nyou in as a standard user, all right.\n\n537\n00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:22.544\nAnd it's not until you\nneed those privileges,\n\n538\n00:29:22.544 --> 00:29:24.810\nthat if you are an administrator,\nwe are gonna warn you.\n\n539\n00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:28.140\nAnd we are gonna let you know that\nyou are about to have a privilege\n\n540\n00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.620\nescalation, all right?\n\n541\n00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.450\nSo what goes on here with the user\naccount control when you create a user,\n\n542\n00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:37.080\nwhether it's an admin user or\nwhether it's a standard user,\n\n543\n00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.650\nall right, the standard user has\na single standard user access token.\n\n544\n00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:45.300\nInside of that access token is the user's\nsecurity identifier that identifies\n\n545\n00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.980\nthe user to the system.\n\n546\n00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.300\nAny groups that they're a part of,\nif they're a part of multiple groups,\n\n547\n00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.180\nyou'll have multiple group SIDs and\nthen their privileges.\n\n548\n00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:58.311\nAll right, but what a standard user\nlacks is what we see right here,\n\n549\n00:29:58.311 --> 00:30:02.831\nan admin SID and\nadministrative level privileges, okay?\n\n550\n00:30:02.831 --> 00:30:07.603\nNow, when you go to perform some kind of\naction that requires administrative level\n\n551\n00:30:07.603 --> 00:30:11.896\naccess, this is where the user account\ncontrol steps in, the user account\n\n552\n00:30:11.896 --> 00:30:15.734\ncontrol steps in and says, okay,\nI see what you're trying to do.\n\n553\n00:30:15.734 --> 00:30:19.678\nAnd whatever it is that you're trying to\nconfigure, change the system date, and\n\n554\n00:30:19.678 --> 00:30:22.598\ntime, it requires administrative\nlevel privileges.\n\n555\n00:30:22.598 --> 00:30:27.426\nSo it kinda puts you on hold here, and\nit blocks you, says nope, we're not gonna\n\n556\n00:30:27.426 --> 00:30:32.121\nlet you do this until you provide the user\ncredentials for your admin account.\n\n557\n00:30:32.121 --> 00:30:36.056\nAnd then when you do, that token is\ngonna get applied to your machine, or\n\n558\n00:30:36.056 --> 00:30:37.733\nyour account, excuse me, and\n\n559\n00:30:37.733 --> 00:30:41.624\nthen you're gonna be able to perform\nwhatever it is that you need to do.\n\n560\n00:30:41.624 --> 00:30:47.866\nIf you're a standard user, you're gonna\nget prompted, and you're gonna get offered\n\n561\n00:30:47.866 --> 00:30:53.363\nwhat's known as just an administrative\nuser name and dialogue box, right?\n\n562\n00:30:53.363 --> 00:30:57.410\nGonna have to put in an administrative\nuser name and credentials, all right?\n\n563\n00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.320\nIf you don't, then the action\nis gonna be completely blocked.\n\n564\n00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.721\nSo that's a little bit about the UAC,\nit prevents these privilege escalation and\n\n565\n00:31:04.721 --> 00:31:08.996\nprograms and stuff just having access to\nthe deeper parts of core functionality\n\n566\n00:31:08.996 --> 00:31:12.532\nof your operating system and\nthose administrative level tasks.\n\n567\n00:31:12.532 --> 00:31:16.866\n>> Yeah, Wes, correct me if I'm wrong,\nbut they created UAC program actually to\n\n568\n00:31:16.866 --> 00:31:20.685\naddress the fears of people because\nprograms were able to, everybody\n\n569\n00:31:20.685 --> 00:31:24.722\nwas running as like an administrative\nlevel or some sort of system level.\n\n570\n00:31:24.722 --> 00:31:27.320\nAnd that's how malware was\ngetting the machines cuz they\n\n571\n00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.174\njust had full reign of the machines for\nwhoever was logged in.\n\n572\n00:31:30.174 --> 00:31:34.936\n>> Yeah, definitely, and when they did\nmost of their research, they realized that\n\n573\n00:31:34.936 --> 00:31:38.938\nvery fact, that in the days of XP,\nmany of your people were running as\n\n574\n00:31:38.938 --> 00:31:43.564\nadministrators, and the majority of\nthe day-to-day operations didn't and\n\n575\n00:31:43.564 --> 00:31:46.762\ndoesn't now need administrative\nlevel privileges.\n\n576\n00:31:46.762 --> 00:31:48.858\nSo if you download a program or a virus,\n\n577\n00:31:48.858 --> 00:31:51.853\nit's also running in the context\nof an administrator.\n\n578\n00:31:51.853 --> 00:31:53.879\nAll right, so-\n>> At least you should be getting some\n\n579\n00:31:53.879 --> 00:31:56.851\nsort of prompt, right, that's So\nthat you know something is happening.\n\n580\n00:31:56.851 --> 00:31:59.073\nI used to tell my users this all the time.\n\n581\n00:31:59.073 --> 00:32:01.120\nI said, did you see a prompt?\n\n582\n00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.190\nWell, yeah.\n\n583\n00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.610\nDid you click yes?\n\n584\n00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:04.120\nYes.\n\n585\n00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.380\nWell were you trying to\ninstall software at the time?\n\n586\n00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.510\nNo.\n\n587\n00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.264\nThat is letting you know that it's\ntrying to install software, and\n\n588\n00:32:10.264 --> 00:32:13.085\nif you're not trying to do that\nthen you shouldn't be clicking yes.\n\n589\n00:32:13.085 --> 00:32:16.541\nThat is your warning that something is\nhappening without your knowledge and\n\n590\n00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:19.943\nnow you can interfere, you can intercede\nand say all right we're not going\n\n591\n00:32:19.943 --> 00:32:22.984\nto allow that to happen,\nI'm not trying to install any software.\n\n592\n00:32:22.984 --> 00:32:23.764\nClick no here.\n\n593\n00:32:23.764 --> 00:32:27.947\n>> That's right, yes absolutely and\nit prevents those privileged escalations\n\n594\n00:32:27.947 --> 00:32:30.810\ngoing on in the back ground\nwith out you ever knowing.\n\n595\n00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:34.650\nSo It's a good thing that we have and even\nmore so on when it prompts you it does\n\n596\n00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:37.650\nwhat's known as secure desktop\nbecause it's very easy for\n\n597\n00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:39.570\nsomebody to ride a hacker if you will or\n\n598\n00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:43.552\nif you're attacker to ride a pop up that\nlook just like the UAC and you click it.\n\n599\n00:32:43.552 --> 00:32:46.466\nOr you put in your credentials and\nit's key-logger and\n\n600\n00:32:46.466 --> 00:32:50.130\nit outputs whatever your password\nis to somebody that's listening.\n\n601\n00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.830\nSo what they do is they put it\non top a secure desktop and\n\n602\n00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.208\nit goes to almost like\nan instant safe mode.\n\n603\n00:32:55.208 --> 00:32:59.350\nAnd it blocks writable access to\nthe registry until you interact\n\n604\n00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:02.200\nwith that dialog box.\n\n605\n00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.040\nSo that being said that kind\nof sets you the stage for\n\n606\n00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.270\nwhat the UAC is doing in\nthe background and under the hood.\n\n607\n00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:10.231\nLet's go ahead and talk about some of\nthe settings I want you to be aware of in\n\n608\n00:33:10.231 --> 00:33:13.148\nthe group policies when it comes to\noptimizing the user account control.\n\n609\n00:33:13.148 --> 00:33:15.580\nLet me switch back over to my server here.\n\n610\n00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:18.170\nAnd I just went ahead and\nthrew together a quick policy here.\n\n611\n00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:19.340\nWe haven't linked it anywhere.\n\n612\n00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.720\nI'm going to right click and\nI'm going to choose edit.\n\n613\n00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.270\nAll right now the good thing about\nthis are the settings are the same\n\n614\n00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.870\neven if you're in your local machine\ndealing with your local policy.\n\n615\n00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:32.320\nAnd I'll just kinda show you that to recap\nafter we look at some of these settings.\n\n616\n00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.130\nNow, when we are looking at\nthe user account control,\n\n617\n00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:37.090\nwe're gonna be under policies.\n\n618\n00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:40.090\nAll right.\nYou're gonna be under the Windows settings\n\n619\n00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:40.860\nand security.\n\n620\n00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:46.660\nIf on the exam they ask\nyou a question about\n\n621\n00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:52.570\nthe local policy, one thing that\ndiffers is it doesn't say policy.\n\n622\n00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.980\nAll you get are software settings, Windows\nsettings and administrative templates.\n\n623\n00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.110\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n624\n00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.250\nThey're trying to figure out,\n\n625\n00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:02.560\nlike I said we'll show you this coming up,\nthat you know the difference.\n\n626\n00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.990\nAll right, so\nwe're going to be under local policies.\n\n627\n00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.570\nAll right, security options.\n\n628\n00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:10.920\nAnd if you want to get to\nthese a little bit easier.\n\n629\n00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:16.020\nI always do the alphabetized and I reverse\nthe alphabetic order right cuz u-a-c,\n\n630\n00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.040\nit's the last nine settings\nI believe in the list here.\n\n631\n00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.990\nSo, and I always get this wrong,\none of these days I'll memorize it.\n\n632\n00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:26.945\nLet's say one, two, three, four,\nfive, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\n\n633\n00:34:26.945 --> 00:34:28.470\nAw, just a bit outside ball one.\n\n634\n00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:30.080\nSo ten settings here.\n\n635\n00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.770\nA couple of the ones that I'd\nlike you to be aware of, and\n\n636\n00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:36.710\nthis is switch to secure desktop,\nright here at the top, all right.\n\n637\n00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:41.490\nWhen prompting for elevation, right?\n\n638\n00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:44.640\nYou can't, and\nit's enabled by default, so.\n\n639\n00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.780\nA policy that you don't define is already\nenables essentially, that's what it's\n\n640\n00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:52.930\ndoing by default, but if you disable it\nkeep in mind now software can spoof that\n\n641\n00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:57.190\nuser account control dialogue box and\nit's no longer put on a secure desktop.\n\n642\n00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:58.980\nThis really isn't something\nthat's optimizing.\n\n643\n00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.270\nIt's actually a security risk.\n\n644\n00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:01.870\nSo I just make mention of it.\n\n645\n00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:04.180\nDon't disable it.\n\n646\n00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:08.190\nAll right, couple others ones\nthat might come up are this one,\n\n647\n00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:11.740\nRun all administrators\nin Admin Approval Mode.\n\n648\n00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:12.350\nAll right, and\n\n649\n00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:16.140\nif you don't understand what these\nsettings do, just hit the Explain tab.\n\n650\n00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.092\nRight.\n\n651\n00:35:17.092 --> 00:35:20.400\nEnabled, disabled you really\ndon't want to disable this.\n\n652\n00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.090\nIf you disable this it'll slow it,\nyour security center.\n\n653\n00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:27.040\nYou'll get a little warning that says the\noverall security of your computer has been\n\n654\n00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:27.950\ndiminished.\n\n655\n00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.860\nSo you certainly don't want to do that.\n\n656\n00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.110\nA couple more are the, and\n\n657\n00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.320\nagain I mention these two because\nthey can get a little confusing,\n\n658\n00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:41.200\nnotice behavior of the elevation prompt\nfor administrator and admin approval mode.\n\n659\n00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.990\nThese are two that\nare a little bit different.\n\n660\n00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:49.025\nThis is do you run all administrators\nin admin approval mode and\n\n661\n00:35:49.025 --> 00:35:52.066\nthis effects the prompt that you see.\n\n662\n00:35:52.066 --> 00:35:55.167\nSo if I double click this and\nI define this policy setting,\n\n663\n00:35:55.167 --> 00:35:58.600\nyou'll see that there are a few\ndifferent ones in here, right?\n\n664\n00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.120\nPrompt for credentials on secure desktop,\n\n665\n00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.040\nwhat's the difference between\ncredentials or consent.\n\n666\n00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.220\nAll right if Dan's an administrator,\nall right,\n\n667\n00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:09.740\nhe's gonna get a consent button that\nsays yes or no, that's consent.\n\n668\n00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:12.770\nCredentials says, if I turn this on and\n\n669\n00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:17.420\nDan needs administrative privileges,\nhe doesn't get a consent option.\n\n670\n00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.190\nHe's gotta put in his username and\npassword.\n\n671\n00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:22.344\nSo this increases the security\nof the prompt, if you want.\n\n672\n00:36:22.344 --> 00:36:25.010\nAnd then you could see some of\nthe other ones here as well.\n\n673\n00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:29.610\nI'm not, prompt for credentials, again\nI would say just if you want it to be\n\n674\n00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:33.500\nmore secure you could also prompt\nyour admins for credentials as well.\n\n675\n00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.117\nBut that really is up to you.\n\n676\n00:36:35.117 --> 00:36:39.883\nNow the other one I want you to be aware\nof is the behavior of the elevation\n\n677\n00:36:39.883 --> 00:36:42.270\nproper for standard users.\n\n678\n00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.470\nYou can also define this setting.\n\n679\n00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.141\nElevation request, if we're in a secure\nenvironment we say no we don't want our\n\n680\n00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:52.305\nstandard users doing any configuration.\n\n681\n00:36:52.305 --> 00:36:54.955\nWe could just say automatically\ndeny elevation request.\n\n682\n00:36:54.955 --> 00:36:57.495\nDon't even let them see the prompt.\n\n683\n00:36:57.495 --> 00:36:59.625\nAll right.\nPrompt for credentials on secure desktop,\n\n684\n00:36:59.625 --> 00:37:01.265\nor prompt for credentials.\n\n685\n00:37:01.265 --> 00:37:04.000\nNotice you don't get the option\nto say prompt for consent.\n\n686\n00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.440\nWhy?\nThis is a standard user.\n\n687\n00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.830\nRemember I told you,\nit's looking for that admin SID.\n\n688\n00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.630\nSo you have to put credentials in.\n\n689\n00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:12.090\nThat's why they don't give you\nan option to just prompt for consent.\n\n690\n00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:18.070\nAll right, Dan, so those are a couple of\nthings about the User Account Control now.\n\n691\n00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:21.390\nIf we wanted to implement this all\nwe'd have to do is go in here,\n\n692\n00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:25.690\ncreate as an organizational unit and apply\nthat policy to the organizational unit and\n\n693\n00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:29.240\nthen any of the computers that are in\nthat organizational unit will now have it\n\n694\n00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.250\ndeployed out to them.\n\n695\n00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:36.030\nAgain, as recap just on group policy,\nguys, I would remember that local site,\n\n696\n00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.220\ndomain ou, processing order.\n\n697\n00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.830\nIf you need to know if you want more about\nactive directory by all means jump over\n\n698\n00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:47.570\nto our windows server series as they\nwill definitely go really in depth\n\n699\n00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.762\non the group policy.\n\n700\n00:37:49.762 --> 00:37:53.090\nI do have one more thing that I do wanna\nshow you guys cuz I told you I would and\n\n701\n00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:56.150\nI didn't do it here going back to my\ncomputer remember I told you that\n\n702\n00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:59.556\nthe local security policy looks a little\nbit different than group policy.\n\n703\n00:37:59.556 --> 00:38:03.030\nI want to go ahead and take the time and\ngo ahead and show you this.\n\n704\n00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.820\nSo that you guys are aware.\n\n705\n00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.610\nI'm just gonna go down\nto that search window.\n\n706\n00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:10.290\nI'll tell you that search window sometimes\nI have luck with it, sometimes I don't.\n\n707\n00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:13.670\nBut I know if I drop down to a CLI I\ncan get the results that I want.\n\n708\n00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:17.249\nSo go ahead and let power shell open\nup and then I'm gonna turn around and\n\n709\n00:38:17.249 --> 00:38:19.407\nI'm gonna run something known as Gpedit.\n\n710\n00:38:19.407 --> 00:38:20.170\nThere we go.\n\n711\n00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:27.277\nThere we go, so\nwe're going to run gpedit.msc.\n\n712\n00:38:27.277 --> 00:38:30.383\nAnd what that brings up,\nif you're in enterprise and\n\n713\n00:38:30.383 --> 00:38:33.360\npro that will bring up your\nlocal security policy.\n\n714\n00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.990\nAnd you'll get the chance to see\nagain that some of these settings,\n\n715\n00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:43.010\nthey vary just a little bit as far\nas compared to back group policy.\n\n716\n00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:46.400\nSo again, this is just for\nyour benefit on the exam.\n\n717\n00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.470\nNotice that I don't have policies and\npreferences.\n\n718\n00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:51.160\nPreferences are something that\nare specific to active directory group\n\n719\n00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.050\npolicies.\n\n720\n00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:55.020\nNotice here that the path to get\nto the user account control,\n\n721\n00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.600\nif you needed to implement it for whatever\nreason in a work group environment,\n\n722\n00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.320\nyou can just come into Windows settings,\nsame location, right guys?\n\n723\n00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.740\nSecurity settings.\n\n724\n00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:07.350\nGet down here to Local Policies and\nSecurity options.\n\n725\n00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:09.840\nAnd, as you can see on the Local Security,\n\n726\n00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.050\npolicy takes a little bit especially\nwith the security settings.\n\n727\n00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:15.549\nAnd I'm not sure exactly why that is and\nI usually have a problem in the labs here\n\n728\n00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.650\nwith that expanding out,\nit usually takes a while.\n\n729\n00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.450\nSo local policies, and\nonce you're in here,\n\n730\n00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:27.660\nyou notice that if you reverse the order,\nthere's those ten settings there.\n\n731\n00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:31.850\nNot much different but they might ask you\na question and they give you an exhibit,\n\n732\n00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:35.540\nyou might want to know that this is\nlocal policy, local group policy\n\n733\n00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.420\nversus what you would see in the GPNC\ninside of a active directory environment.\n\n734\n00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:44.000\n>> Awesome stuff Wes this is really the\nmeat and potatoes of, using Windows 10.\n\n735\n00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.360\nGetting into user account control,\nvery important stuff.\n\n736\n00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.070\nNeed to know that.\n\n737\n00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.300\nNot just for an exam.\n\n738\n00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.680\nThat's practical stuff to trigger and\n\n739\n00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.160\nencounter out in the real\nworld environment.\n\n740\n00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.790\nAnd, of course, KMS,\nif you have to deal with that system,\n\n741\n00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:01.350\nobviously it's a nice system because you\nhave one key and it rules everything.\n\n742\n00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.220\nIt's just setting up servers and\nstuff, and\n\n743\n00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.520\nthe good thing is you're\nnot quite there yet.\n\n744\n00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:08.500\nYou got a little time before\nyou crawl out of that ooze, but\n\n745\n00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.570\nyou will encounter it from time to time.\n\n746\n00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.712\nWes, thank you so much for dropping by\ntoday, explaining these concepts to us,\n\n747\n00:40:13.712 --> 00:40:15.714\nbut it looks like we've come\nto the end of our show.\n\n748\n00:40:15.714 --> 00:40:16.577\nWe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n749\n00:40:16.577 --> 00:40:18.780\nFor ITPro.TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel

00:00:17.280\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.610\nAnd today we're doing our installing and\nconfiguring Windows.\n\n5\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.053\nAnd specifically, in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:22.053 --> 00:00:24.600\nwe're gonna be looking at\nconfiguring networking.\n\n7\n00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.314\nAnd who better to help us with that\nthan our Windows guru, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:28.420\nHow are you doing, Wes?\n\n9\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.420\n>> Man, I'm doing great.\n\n10\n00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.890\nAnd as always, it's great to\nbe here with the ITProTV crew.\n\n11\n00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.918\nThat's right we're continuing\nalong in our 7698 track, and\n\n12\n00:00:34.918 --> 00:00:38.163\nwe're gonna be looking at a little\nbit of configuring networking, and\n\n13\n00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:41.520\nsome of the utilities that you\ncan use to configure networking.\n\n14\n00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.010\nSome of you have probably\ndone this before.\n\n15\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.550\nMaybe you've done it through the Graphical\nUser Interface, but we'll also look at\n\n16\n00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.670\nsome utilities that can help you when it\ncomes down to troubleshooting networking.\n\n17\n00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.000\nThat's one of the things\nthat they call out.\n\n18\n00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.550\nSo in this episode, what we're trying\nto do is we're gonna look at some of\n\n19\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.280\nthe commands and\nthe utilities that you can use.\n\n20\n00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.440\nWe're gonna talk just briefly about\nsomething known as WiFii direct.\n\n21\n00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.630\nWe're gonna show you a little\nbit more about VPNs,\n\n22\n00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.920\nand then finally, a technology that's\nbeen around since, I believe, Windows 7,\n\n23\n00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.870\nit started that, the direct access.\n\n24\n00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.470\nIt might go back to Vista, but\nit's been around for a while.\n\n25\n00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.840\nAnd they do call it out on the exam.\n\n26\n00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.140\nSo, let's go ahead, and I tell you what,\nwe're gonna jump right in here, and\n\n27\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.196\nwe're gonna look at some of the things\nthat you can do in order to configure\n\n28\n00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:20.152\nnetworking and\nthen also troubleshoot them.\n\n29\n00:01:20.152 --> 00:01:21.802\nNow, I've gone ahead here\non this computer, and\n\n30\n00:01:21.802 --> 00:01:23.110\nI've remoted into another computer.\n\n31\n00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.690\nSo we use virtualization here, and one of\nthe things our virtualization doesn't do\n\n32\n00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.410\nis it doesn't emulate\nwireless network adapters.\n\n33\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.170\nAnd I'd really like to take the time\nto show you some of those commands.\n\n34\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.380\nNow, let's go ahead, and let's talk\na little bit about the Action Center.\n\n35\n00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.330\nNow I know my head's covering it up right\nhere, but down in the lower right-hand\n\n36\n00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.290\ncorner of my screen, you're gonna\nsee the little Action Center, and\n\n37\n00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.630\nyou can also see, well,\nI can see this little wireless icon here.\n\n38\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.740\nAnd you can see that I\nhave Internet access.\n\n39\n00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.240\nSo a couple different locations that if\nyou wanna configure networking, you can.\n\n40\n00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.100\nLet's go ahead, we're gonna use\nthis little wireless network icon,\n\n41\n00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.450\nwe're gonna right click on it.\n\n42\n00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.920\nAnd notice that I get the option to choose\nTroubleshoot Problems, or Open Network and\n\n43\n00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.990\nSharing Center.\n\n44\n00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.460\nNow Network and Sharing Center came about\nback in Vista, it's been around for\n\n45\n00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.830\na while now,\nit really hasn't changed too much.\n\n46\n00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.747\nSince the Vista days, Windows 7, 8, and\n8.1 have all kept it the same, so by now,\n\n47\n00:02:13.747 --> 00:02:15.950\nyou should be pretty familiar with it.\n\n48\n00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.710\nIf you're new to Windows in general, on\na clime exam, let me tell, you probably do\n\n49\n00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.366\nwanna get familiar with this, because\nit's in a lot of your operating systems,\n\n50\n00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:26.964\nwhether it's your server operating\nsystem or your client operating system.\n\n51\n00:02:26.964 --> 00:02:31.412\nSo regardless of what exam you're taking,\nit is good to know a little bit about it.\n\n52\n00:02:31.412 --> 00:02:33.220\nAll right, so,\nlet's look at what we can do here.\n\n53\n00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.290\nWhen you look at Network and\n\n54\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.310\nSharing Center, we have a couple\nof things that you can see here.\n\n55\n00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.826\nYou can see the network that\nyou're connected to, and\n\n56\n00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.080\nyou can also see the network\ncategories as well.\n\n57\n00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.050\nI'm gonna talk briefly about the network\ncategories, network location awareness,\n\n58\n00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.360\nand what that means for us, and then,\nwe'll move into some of these commands.\n\n59\n00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.760\nNow, notice that it says that\nI have a private network here.\n\n60\n00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.040\nWhen we talk about private network, this\nis a network location, it's a choice you\n\n61\n00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.420\nmake on a computer, specifically\none that's not joined to a domain.\n\n62\n00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.860\nIf it's in a soho environment,\nmaybe it's your home network.\n\n63\n00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.650\nAnd the first time you connect\nto a network, it asks you,\n\n64\n00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.900\ndo you wanna choose your location?\n\n65\n00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.160\nDo you wanna make your device discoverable\non this network, if I can say that?\n\n66\n00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.730\nAnd you can choose yes or no.\n\n67\n00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.407\nAll right, now,\ndepending on what choice you make,\n\n68\n00:03:17.407 --> 00:03:20.930\nit's gonna set a global suite of\nsettings called a firewall profile.\n\n69\n00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.670\nAnd the way the profile is set is really\ngonna control different aspects of\n\n70\n00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.270\nthe security inside of\nyour operating system.\n\n71\n00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.560\nAnd sometimes it can be for the better,\nsometimes it can be for the worse.\n\n72\n00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.825\nBut definitely when you're building up\nlabs and stuff, like we do over here,\n\n73\n00:03:33.825 --> 00:03:35.456\nsometimes these network locations and\n\n74\n00:03:35.456 --> 00:03:37.790\nsome of the security settings\ncan cause problems here.\n\n75\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.050\nSo it really is good to know\na little bit about them.\n\n76\n00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.290\nSo let me go ahead and dive right in\nhere and show you some of the settings\n\n77\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.640\nthat are controlled here via the different\nnetwork locations slash profiles.\n\n78\n00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.110\nIf you'll notice here,\nthe current profile is what I'm on here.\n\n79\n00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.470\nNetwork discovery is turned on, and again,\nthat is exactly what it sounds like.\n\n80\n00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.240\nMy computer can call out\nto the rest of the network.\n\n81\n00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.840\nIt can use a combination of IPv4,\nIPv6 multicast communications, even\n\n82\n00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.780\nsome link local communications, and it can\nfind the devices that are on the network.\n\n83\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.180\nAnd then if these other devices\nare configured to respond to the request,\n\n84\n00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.080\nwell, we can paint a network map,\nwe can see these devices on the network.\n\n85\n00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.822\nHowever, if you're on a public network,\nchances are you're probably not\n\n86\n00:04:20.822 --> 00:04:25.080\ngonna wanna have all these settings\nturned on, well, because, think about it,\n\n87\n00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.700\nif I'm at the WiFi hot spot, I certainly\ndon't want somebody that's sitting next to\n\n88\n00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.580\nme that I have no clue who they\nare being able to discover my devices.\n\n89\n00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.160\nSo you can see that the public profile,\nyou can see that these are turned off.\n\n90\n00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.290\nAnd that's kind of what I mean when I\nsay you've gotta pay attention to what\n\n91\n00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.780\nnetwork location you're a part of.\n\n92\n00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.140\nBecause it will dictate way programs and\nstuff will interact inside of\n\n93\n00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.900\nthe operating system and\nsome of the underlying protocols, too.\n\n94\n00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.875\nLike, for instance, ICMP, if you're\ngonna use something like a ping packet,\n\n95\n00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:54.282\nif you're on a private network,\nyou're okay.\n\n96\n00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:59.413\nICMP is enabled, it will allow\nthis computer to receive pings.\n\n97\n00:04:59.413 --> 00:05:03.085\nBut if I'm on a public network and\nfile and printer sharing is turned off,\n\n98\n00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:07.882\nI can't send ICMP echo requests from\nthis computer, which, again, for\n\n99\n00:05:07.882 --> 00:05:10.542\ntroubleshooting purposes,\nif I'm using the ping utility,\n\n100\n00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:14.052\nwhich we're gonna look at, and I'm pinging\na computer and it's got a public profile,\n\n101\n00:05:14.052 --> 00:05:16.172\nit isn't gonna return responses back.\n\n102\n00:05:16.172 --> 00:05:20.082\nAnd I might assume, we never wanna assume,\nright, but I might assume that, hey,\n\n103\n00:05:20.082 --> 00:05:21.192\nthat computer's offline.\n\n104\n00:05:21.192 --> 00:05:25.127\nWhen really, what it boils down to is it's\nbeing blocked at the firewall level, so\n\n105\n00:05:25.127 --> 00:05:26.154\ndo keep that in mind.\n\n106\n00:05:26.154 --> 00:05:29.485\nAll right, a couple of other things\nI wanna kinda just look at here,\n\n107\n00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:31.660\nwe've got home group connections as well.\n\n108\n00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.580\nIf you've got a home group set up,\n\n109\n00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.000\nyou can tell Windows how you\nwant to access the home group.\n\n110\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.190\nFor instance, Windows users,\nthey have their accounts here.\n\n111\n00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.300\nYou could set a password if you want.\n\n112\n00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.570\nAnd then everybody can\njust enter the password.\n\n113\n00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.370\nOr you can say,\nno user accounts and passwords,\n\n114\n00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.160\nthat's what we're gonna use to connect.\n\n115\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.460\nAnd then that's where the local\nsecurity authority comes in.\n\n116\n00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.510\nAnd it basically handles\nthe authentication of the home groups.\n\n117\n00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.350\nAll right, so that's a little bit\nabout our Network and Sharing Center.\n\n118\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.112\nLet's go ahead and let's dive in a little\nbit to the graphical user interface to\n\n119\n00:06:08.112 --> 00:06:12.178\nwhere we set IP addresses, and\nwe configure our network adapters.\n\n120\n00:06:12.178 --> 00:06:12.875\nNow in 7697,\n\n121\n00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:15.760\nthey did a really good job of showing\nyou setting your networks and stuff.\n\n122\n00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.400\nSo I'm just gonna brief kind of over this,\nand\n\n123\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.760\nthen we'll dive into the command prompt.\n\n124\n00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.900\nAll right, if I right-click on the network\nadapter that's in question, you can see,\n\n125\n00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.590\nin this case, it's WiFi,\nI get the ability to connect, disconnect.\n\n126\n00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.840\nI can show status and it tells me, again,\na little bit more information about it.\n\n127\n00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.610\nIf I decide that I want\nto view the details here,\n\n128\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.990\nI could see a lot of information,\nincluding things like the IP address,\n\n129\n00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.840\nDNS servers,\nis this DHCP that's configured or not?\n\n130\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.070\nAnd again, those could all become things\nthat you might need to troubleshoot.\n\n131\n00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.080\nMaybe if you don't have\nInternet connectivity,\n\n132\n00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.360\nif you can't communicate with other\ncomputers within your network,\n\n133\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.612\nso you can get a lot of really good\ninformation really quick here.\n\n134\n00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:57.300\nAll right, we can also look at\nthe wireless properties too, and\n\n135\n00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.700\nyou can see again the SSID here, some\ngeneralized security information, right?\n\n136\n00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.440\nWhat is the password,\n\n137\n00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.710\nthe pre-share key that I'm gonna use to\nconnect to the wireless access point?\n\n138\n00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.070\nIf I do have connectivity problems,\nI can't connect to the access point.\n\n139\n00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.310\nWell, I can always go in here, and\n\n140\n00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.690\nyou guys have seen me typing in\nsome of these other episodes.\n\n141\n00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.188\nIf you fat finger the keyboard, you might\nhave typed that password wrong, and\n\n142\n00:07:17.188 --> 00:07:19.684\nit won't allow you to associate\nwith the access point.\n\n143\n00:07:19.684 --> 00:07:23.171\nAnd then by association, it's not gonna\nlet you connect to the network or\n\n144\n00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:23.910\nthe Internet.\n\n145\n00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.309\nAll right, so looking at a couple of\nother things here, guys, Properties,\n\n146\n00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:32.795\nif I dig down into the Properties,\nagain, these are your protocol bindings.\n\n147\n00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:35.555\nThese are the protocols that\nyou can think of it as when I\n\n148\n00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:37.475\nbind a protocol to a network adapter,\n\n149\n00:07:37.475 --> 00:07:41.675\nbasically, means you're teaching it how\nto speak those rules of communication.\n\n150\n00:07:41.675 --> 00:07:45.777\nAnd if we look at IPv4 and\nwe choose Properties, right,\n\n151\n00:07:45.777 --> 00:07:51.596\nwe see the General tab here, and I'm set\nto obtain an IP address automatically.\n\n152\n00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.962\nAnd than I can also see\na Pippa configuration and\n\n153\n00:07:53.962 --> 00:07:57.810\nmaybe an alternate configuration if I\nhave Two different networks that I like\n\n154\n00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.030\nto connect to, maybe one's connected via\nDHCP, maybe one's a static IP address.\n\n155\n00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.280\nAnd I'm gonna let it try and use the DHCP\nserver, if I'm not on that network and\n\n156\n00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.810\nthe DHCP server's unavailable,\nit'll fall back to a static configuration.\n\n157\n00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.580\nSo again, you can use this for\n\n158\n00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.620\nthings like your work network\nversus maybe a home network.\n\n159\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.190\nYet again, it's really up to you,\nthere's no right or wrong way to do this.\n\n160\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.500\nAll right, now that's enough of\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n161\n00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.900\nI told you guys we're gonna dive into\nthe command prompt, that's right,\n\n162\n00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.440\nlet's go ahead.\n\n163\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.130\nWhat we're gonna do, I keep saying command\nprompt, it's just a slip of the tongue\n\n164\n00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.610\nhere, I tell you guys,\nI pretty much stay in PowerShell today.\n\n165\n00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.020\nAnd that's not because I have to\nalways run PowerShell commandlets, but\n\n166\n00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.180\nthe benefit is, if I need to get into\ncommand prompt, I can get into command\n\n167\n00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.510\nprompt, and I can turn around and\nI can exit out of command prompt.\n\n168\n00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.820\nAnd then the benefit, also too,\n\n169\n00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.000\nPowerShell's got a lot of aliases that\ntranslate right into the PowerShell.\n\n170\n00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.560\nSo, enough about the PowerShell, but\n\n171\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.100\nthat's one of the reasons you'll\nsee that I launch it up today.\n\n172\n00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.240\nAll right, speaking of that, let's go\nahead and try to clear the screen,\n\n173\n00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.335\nred is bad, you don't want red.\n\n174\n00:08:58.335 --> 00:09:00.850\n[LAUGH] So what are the first\nthings that we're gonna look at?\n\n175\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:06.350\nWell, we're gonna look at an oldy but\ngoody and that's IP config and\n\n176\n00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.800\nif you've never used this or maybe\nnever seen it, probably seen it before.\n\n177\n00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.880\nI'd definitely be aware of it on the exam\nand some of the things you can do with it.\n\n178\n00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.740\nFor instance, if I want basic\ninformation I could do IP config and\n\n179\n00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.870\nI can run it by itself and\nit shows me some of the information.\n\n180\n00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:26.260\nFor instance, I can see that I've\ngot some IPv6 information here,\n\n181\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.930\nlooks like I've got\na Teredo Tunneling going on, and\n\n182\n00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:34.890\nthen I can also see that I'm\npart of the IT Pro TV network.\n\n183\n00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.870\nAgain, notice that I can see my\nIPv4 address, my subnet mask, and\n\n184\n00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.440\nthe default gateway.\n\n185\n00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.210\nAll right, now that being said,\n\n186\n00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.840\nnotice there's some things\nthat are missing here, right.\n\n187\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.660\nI don't know what my DNS server is,\nI don't know what, for instance,\n\n188\n00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.210\nif I've got DHCP or not.\n\n189\n00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.560\nNow you guys see us look at\nthe network adapter right?\n\n190\n00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.700\nI can tell via the GUI that, yeah,\nDHCP's on in the details, right,\n\n191\n00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.100\nbut inside of the command prompt,\n\n192\n00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.590\nor command line interface,\nI might wanna be able to see that.\n\n193\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.560\nAnd that's where you're\ngonna add the all switch.\n\n194\n00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.560\nAnd when you add the all switch,\nit gives you a lot of information here.\n\n195\n00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.440\n>> A lot more.\n\n196\n00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.830\n>> That's right, so you'll see things\nlike bluetooth adapters, if you have your\n\n197\n00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.630\nwired ethernet connection,\nyou can see information on that.\n\n198\n00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.580\nNo about IP config, right?\n\n199\n00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.416\nWhat are some things that\nI might do with IP config.\n\n200\n00:10:21.416 --> 00:10:26.856\nWell if I got for instance, maybe I look\nin here and I've got what's known as\n\n201\n00:10:26.856 --> 00:10:31.875\nthe IPA address.169.254.anything.anything\naddress and\n\n202\n00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:34.692\nknow a DHCP servers out there, right?\n\n203\n00:10:34.692 --> 00:10:36.211\nBut I come in here and\nI do an IP config and\n\n204\n00:10:36.211 --> 00:10:38.066\nall of a sudden I got a 169.254 address.\n\n205\n00:10:38.066 --> 00:10:41.210\nWell that could be because\nthe DHCP server was turned off at\n\n206\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.720\nthe moment that this computer connected\nto the network, maybe it's back online.\n\n207\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.560\nMost of the time, your APIPA will resolve\nitself, because in the background your\n\n208\n00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.640\nDHCP process is going on even\nthough you have that APIPA address.\n\n209\n00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.740\nSo what can I do?\n\n210\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.270\nI can type if I wanted to,\nand I'm not gonna do this, or\n\n211\n00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.570\nI'm gonna lose my connection here.\n\n212\n00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:05.700\nI can do an ipconfig, and\nthen I can do a renew.\n\n213\n00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.630\nYou can do a release if you\nalready have an IP address and\n\n214\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:13.040\nthe lease is still valid for some reason\nyou want to renew a completely different\n\n215\n00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.090\nlease you can always release\nthe IP address and then renew it.\n\n216\n00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.400\nKeep in mind in the background\nthough DHCP is doing this for you.\n\n217\n00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.960\nIf you still have communication\nwith a DHCP server and\n\n218\n00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.540\nyou have an IP address, typically it's\ngonna renew itself unless there's some\n\n219\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.542\nkind of architecture\nchange in the background.\n\n220\n00:11:28.542 --> 00:11:32.862\nAll right, so what else are some\nthings that we can do here?\n\n221\n00:11:32.862 --> 00:11:36.460\nAll right,\nnow the other thing that I can do,\n\n222\n00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.420\nif I want to display for\ninstance the local resolver cache.\n\n223\n00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.500\nMaybe I'm trying to\nconnect to a website and\n\n224\n00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.930\nI've got this name I'm trying to connect\nto it and it just won't work, right.\n\n225\n00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.120\nWell, maybe sometimes, if you let these\nmachines on and never reboot them,\n\n226\n00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.560\nwhat they do is they build up\na large local resolver cache and\n\n227\n00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.550\nit isn't flushed until\nyou turn off the machine.\n\n228\n00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.660\nYou reboot it and\nnow it's gonna go out and\n\n229\n00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.160\nit's gonna talk to the DNS server\nbecause it doesn't have anything locally\n\n230\n00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.250\nto do what DNS does for\nus like resolve names to IP addresses.\n\n231\n00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.590\nWell, if you happen to have that machine\nthat's on for awhile and you think, well,\n\n232\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:11.370\nmaybe I need to just clear the slate,\nright, but\n\n233\n00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.510\nI don't wanna reboot the machine.\n\n234\n00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.530\nWell, you can always run, in fact,\nspeaking of clearing the machine,\n\n235\n00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.600\nthere we go, make that a little easier.\n\n236\n00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:24.100\nI could always do an ipconfig and\nwe can do a flushdns.\n\n237\n00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.110\nAll right, now what does that do?\n\n238\n00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.190\nFlush is the local resolver cache and now,\nif I decide that I need to connect out to\n\n239\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:35.080\nthe Internet to the webpage, now I gotta\ngo out to the DNS name resolution process.\n\n240\n00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.310\nAnd what it will essentially do is update\nthose records if you happen to have any\n\n241\n00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.770\nold records that might\nbe causing the problem.\n\n242\n00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.470\nReally, really good to use\nthe ipconfig and flushdns.\n\n243\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:50.730\nAnd Mike I know you love DNS and we\ncould spend hours on DNS with Mike here.\n\n244\n00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.570\nI'm not sure, registered DNS, if you\nhave dynamic updates I don't think you\n\n245\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.780\nhave to do a registered DNS on\ndomain computers, do you know?\n\n246\n00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.850\n>> You shouldn't have to but\n\n247\n00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:02.440\nsometimes you've seen it where if\nyou're experiencing issues like\n\n248\n00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.380\nnobody else can resolve your\ncomputer's name into an IP address.\n\n249\n00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.760\nMaybe that the process had failed, so\nyou can force it to do a registration or\n\n250\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.760\nsay hey, go register again,\nby doing that IP config register DNS.\n\n251\n00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.480\n>> Very good, so let's go ahead, we'll\ntake a look at what he's saying here.\n\n252\n00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.570\nIf I do a /?all,\n\n253\n00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.200\nnotice that I have this reregistered DNS,\nright, so it does exactly that.\n\n254\n00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.410\nIt reaches out to the domain controller\nif it happens to be a domain machine and\n\n255\n00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.340\nit says hey, here I am, here's my name,\nhere's my IP address and\n\n256\n00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.440\na zone file within your DNS\nhopefully will be updated.\n\n257\n00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.340\nAll right now if I need to\never view the resolver cache,\n\n258\n00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.200\nwe can always do a displaydns as well.\n\n259\n00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.560\nSo if I hit for instance ipconfig,\n\n260\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:50.210\nwe do a displaydns, I don't know\nif I'll have anything in there,\n\n261\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.515\ndoesn't exist and\nagain that's because well I just cleared.\n\n262\n00:13:53.515 --> 00:13:57.315\nBut you can also see the records that are\nstored locally in the local resolver cache\n\n263\n00:13:57.315 --> 00:13:58.595\nwith ipconfig as well.\n\n264\n00:13:59.595 --> 00:14:00.705\n>> Yeah, those are good ones to know.\n\n265\n00:14:00.705 --> 00:14:04.695\nAnytime you do any restructuring on your\nnetwork like if you change the IP address\n\n266\n00:14:04.695 --> 00:14:09.080\nof a file server, problem is all of your\nclients have recently connected to it.\n\n267\n00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.290\nThey're gonna have that\nold IP address cached and\n\n268\n00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:16.260\nyou can tell them that you've fixed the IP\naddress but until they flush their cache\n\n269\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.500\nit won't ever the the new IP address so\nvery important one to know.\n\n270\n00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.250\n>> Nothing like changing the IP address\nto your Internet site when you're not\n\n271\n00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.360\nrebooting your machines and\n\n272\n00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.360\neverybody says I have no clue why I can't\nget to that web page now, so very good.\n\n273\n00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.150\nNow, I wanna go ahead, and, since I've\ntalked about ipconfig, I'd like to show\n\n274\n00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.580\nyou some of the equivalence here\nthat we have in PowerShell.\n\n275\n00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.630\nRather than going through all the command\nprompt commands and then coming back and\n\n276\n00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.310\ndoubling back to PowerShell,\n\n277\n00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:43.190\njust to try to give you an idea\nof how they relate together.\n\n278\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.370\nSo if I wanted to I could also do what's\nknown as the Get-NetIPAddress and\n\n279\n00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.810\nthat's close to the equivalent of\nipconfig inside a command prompt.\n\n280\n00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:56.200\nIf I do a Get-net,\ndon't use your tab on that one,\n\n281\n00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.460\nmake sure you put enough of the command\nin there you'll be here a while.\n\n282\n00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.330\nIf I run this alright,\nboy boy look at that information.\n\n283\n00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.260\nRight, there sure enough here I’ve got\n\n284\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.490\nan adapter that isn’t connected\nthere’s an APIPA address there too.\n\n285\n00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.840\nAnd if I scroll back up here, yep,\nI'll see a lot of information.\n\n286\n00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.020\nNow keep in mind that\nwhat you're looking for,\n\n287\n00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.100\nif I am inside of the command\nprompt a lot of times we look for\n\n288\n00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:24.350\nthings like local area connection,\nEthernet, Ethernet zero, Ethernet one.\n\n289\n00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.850\nIf you're inside of this get-net\nIP address what you're looking for\n\n290\n00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.250\nis the interface alias there.\n\n291\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.228\nNow, all right, for instance if I\nscroll back up, there's your local area\n\n292\n00:15:35.228 --> 00:15:38.479\nconnection, the ones that we\ncommonly see inside of the GUI.\n\n293\n00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:46.129\nAll right so remember get-net IP address\nif they ask you on the exam, if you will.\n\n294\n00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:46.933\nAll right,\n\n295\n00:15:46.933 --> 00:15:52.012\nnow we have some other great utilities\nthat are inside of our command line.\n\n296\n00:15:52.012 --> 00:15:54.106\nThat we need to use from time to time.\n\n297\n00:15:54.106 --> 00:15:56.385\nOne of those is called netstat,\nNetwork Statistics.\n\n298\n00:15:56.385 --> 00:15:57.940\nIt's been around for a while.\n\n299\n00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.410\nIt's native to command prompt, but\nit also works here in power shell.\n\n300\n00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.160\nAnd if I run a netstat, all right.\n\n301\n00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.520\nAnd let's say for instance,\nI do a -a, all right.\n\n302\n00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.600\nWhat is it gonna do?\n\n303\n00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.670\nWell, it's going to peer\ninto the session layer.\n\n304\n00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.200\nThose of you that probably have\nheard about your OSI model,\n\n305\n00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:19.460\nright, remember we say the application\npresentation session transport\n\n306\n00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.045\nnetwork layer, if I can even remember.\n\n307\n00:16:21.045 --> 00:16:23.090\n[LAUGH] Data link layer,\nand the physical layer.\n\n308\n00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.150\nWell, remember that session layer,\nthat's where connections happen?\n\n309\n00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.830\nWell, netstat taps into the listeners for\nthose services and\n\n310\n00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:33.430\nthose connection states, and\nyou might say, well, wait a second Wes,\n\n311\n00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:37.470\nUDP, we probably remember\nthat UDP's connection list.\n\n312\n00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:38.690\nSo why is it?\n\n313\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.700\nWhy does it even show UDP\ninformation versus TCP\n\n314\n00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.800\ninformation which is connection oriented?\n\n315\n00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.040\nAgain keep in mind that it's not really\nshowing you the connections themselves,\n\n316\n00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.080\nmore as it's tapping in to the listeners\nthat are listening out for\n\n317\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:55.470\nincoming communications whether they're\nconnection oriented or connection less.\n\n318\n00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.110\nBut there is a lot of cool\nfilters that you can do.\n\n319\n00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.670\nNotice that we have TCP and\nUDP information here.\n\n320\n00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.340\nMaybe I just want TCP information.\n\n321\n00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.570\nSo I can actually filter\nthis out if I want.\n\n322\n00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:11.190\nAnd I can run a net stat and I could do\ndash P for protocol and I could do TCP.\n\n323\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:15.410\nAnd when I rerun this now what it's gonna\ndo is it's gonna look for the connections\n\n324\n00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:19.920\nthat are using TCP and it'll filter\nout the ones that are using UDP.\n\n325\n00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.710\nIn this case, it's not really looking for\nthe eliciting TCP connections, right.\n\n326\n00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:26.990\nIt's saying what is established?\n\n327\n00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.920\nSo you can see in the background here I\nwould almost venture to say that that MSN\n\n328\n00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.720\nbot out there has something to do\nwith Bing or the Edge browser,\n\n329\n00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.340\nI'm not really sure here, but\nyou can definitely see that, too.\n\n330\n00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.570\nAll right, well, what if you want\na little bit more information, right?\n\n331\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:46.620\nIf I wanna get statistical information\non a per protocol basis then what I can\n\n332\n00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.850\ndo here is I can change this up here and\nI can add a -s to it.\n\n333\n00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.610\nNow it gives me a lot more\ninformation on these statistics.\n\n334\n00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.140\nI can scroll back up here,\nagain guys a lot of information,\n\n335\n00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.170\nbut it gives me the IPv4\ninformation right?\n\n336\n00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:06.620\nNotice that I can see packets received,\npacket errors, the statistics for IPv6.\n\n337\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.780\nICMP, we talk about the Internet Control\nMessage Protocol and using that for\n\n338\n00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.850\ntesting.\n\n339\n00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.550\nNot only testing communications but\nit's used all over the place for\n\n340\n00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.250\njust normal network communications.\n\n341\n00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.100\nWell I can see that information here too.\n\n342\n00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:24.575\nSo again notice that now we can break it\ndown to the TCP statistics for just IPv4.\n\n343\n00:18:24.575 --> 00:18:28.535\nSo again,\nyou have the ability to go on a per\n\n344\n00:18:30.055 --> 00:18:33.722\nprotocol and\nmore detailed information per statistics.\n\n345\n00:18:33.722 --> 00:18:36.412\nI did that,\nI'll give you a piece of advice.\n\n346\n00:18:36.412 --> 00:18:42.713\nIf you pipe this out to the more option,\nIt makes it a little bit easier,\n\n347\n00:18:42.713 --> 00:18:46.570\nit stops and allows you the ability\nto go line by line if you want.\n\n348\n00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.570\nRight rather than me sit\nhere torturing Mike and\n\n349\n00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.547\nsay hey did you catch line 24 of 153,000?\n\n350\n00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:54.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it might make it a little bit\n\n351\n00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.430\neasier for you.\n\n352\n00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.510\nNow how about this, let me go ahead and\nget away from sticky keys here.\n\n353\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.820\nLet me try something else I want\nto show you guys here real quick.\n\n354\n00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:05.480\nI'm gonna go ahead and let me say,\nask me later and let's go ahead and\n\n355\n00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.790\njust close that out there.\n\n356\n00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:08.720\nGotta love the news.\n\n357\n00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:15.380\nSo What if I want to find out what\nprocess is making the connection?\n\n358\n00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.900\nNotice that when I, In fact,\nlet me do that again.\n\n359\n00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.930\nAll right, you should see some\nmore information come up now\n\n360\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.480\nbecause we've got Internet Explorer\nconnected to MSN in the background here.\n\n361\n00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.900\nSo we should see some\nestablished connections here.\n\n362\n00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:33.490\nBut notice that I don't really know\nwhat is causing this connection.\n\n363\n00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.540\nSo what I can do is I can go\na little bit farther here if I want.\n\n364\n00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.750\nI can say I wanna know the owning process,\nall right?\n\n365\n00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.376\nNow, I will tell you, this thing, [LAUGH]\nI was showing this with Mike yesterday.\n\n366\n00:19:42.376 --> 00:19:43.460\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> It didn't stop\n\n367\n00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.530\nwith the established connection\ncuz there's a lot of advertizing.\n\n368\n00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:47.410\nAnd guess what?\n\n369\n00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:50.220\nYou're making connections or\nthey're making connections to you,\n\n370\n00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.930\nwhichever way you might look at it,\nto third party advertising.\n\n371\n00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.370\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\njust control C this here.\n\n372\n00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:00.490\nAll right, and that just stops it from\npiping out all this information here.\n\n373\n00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.590\nBut what if I do a dash o?\n\n374\n00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.430\nAll right.\n\n375\n00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.210\nNot zero, excuse me, letter o.\n\n376\n00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.600\nWell now what this tells me is it gives\nme the process identifier, right.\n\n377\n00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.530\nNow I know the process that is using\nthese connections, are using, excuse me.\n\n378\n00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.920\nSo for instance, or\nit doesn't mean much to you.\n\n379\n00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.650\nDo these process ID's mean much to you?\n\n380\n00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:22.253\nNo.\n>> Well no,\n\n381\n00:20:22.253 --> 00:20:23.986\nthey don't mean much to me either.\n\n382\n00:20:23.986 --> 00:20:25.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But let me go ahead and\n\n383\n00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:30.240\nControl + C this again, pausing the,\nor actually stopping the command.\n\n384\n00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.190\nAll right,\nwell let's find out what 5692 is.\n\n385\n00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.650\nI'm gonna fire up the old\ntask manager here.\n\n386\n00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.490\nI'm gonna do more details,\ngo specifically to details.\n\n387\n00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.950\nAnd notice I have my process\nidentifier right here.\n\n388\n00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.840\nAnd if I search through these.\n\n389\n00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.270\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ndo it numerically here and\n\n390\n00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.530\nI kind of scroll down, probably should\nhave done it the other way there.\n\n391\n00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:53.290\n6, what have we got,\nthere we go, sure enough 5692.\n\n392\n00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.580\nIf you could see it by comparison it lets\nme know that the process that is making\n\n393\n00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.550\nthat communication right\nnow is Internet Explorer.\n\n394\n00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:04.381\nAnd I would almost be\nwilling to say that 952,\n\n395\n00:21:04.381 --> 00:21:07.970\nif I scrolled all the way back up, 952.\n\n396\n00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.560\nThat's actually the internal machine.\n\n397\n00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.470\nSo, I was saying that I think\nit might be Microsoft Update.\n\n398\n00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.420\nThat very well could be Microsoft Update\nthat you're using to connect.\n\n399\n00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.800\nSo It gives you a little bit more\ninformation about what services,\n\n400\n00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.760\nwhat executable is making the connection,\nif you need to troubleshoot.\n\n401\n00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.270\nSo very handy to have.\n\n402\n00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.970\nAll right, let's go ahead and\n\n403\n00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.890\nwe will clear our screen out unless\nthis thing is still running.\n\n404\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.600\nAll right, so know that netstat,\nknow what it does,\n\n405\n00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.360\nknow that it's got a lot of\nthings that you can do for.\n\n406\n00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.430\nOne more that I might throw in there is,\nif you want ethernet statistics,\n\n407\n00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.230\nyou can always do a -e.\n\n408\n00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.800\nAnd it does exactly that.\n\n409\n00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.310\nYou might say non unicast package, right,\n\n410\n00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.790\nwill non unicast packets can be\nmulticast and they can be broadcast.\n\n411\n00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:57.730\nAnd obviously, they're the only ones that\nare left when you talk about the three\n\n412\n00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:58.720\ntypes of communications.\n\n413\n00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.520\nWell, maybe I've got a hub\nconnected to this machine and\n\n414\n00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.480\nI'm seeing a whole bunch\nof non unicast packets.\n\n415\n00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.370\nAgain it could be IGMP, you know\nthe gateway management protocol for\n\n416\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.360\ncontrolling those\nmulticast communications.\n\n417\n00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:16.030\nBut again, it could be a kicking off\npoint, if you will, for troubleshooting.\n\n418\n00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.120\nAll right, so\nnext gets us to another oldie but\n\n419\n00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.100\ngoodie and that's the ping command.\n\n420\n00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.862\nPing, the packet internet grover, I have\nno clue how they came up with these names.\n\n421\n00:22:26.862 --> 00:22:27.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n422\n00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.030\nthat's always been\nan interesting ping guys.\n\n423\n00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:32.740\nThis is very easy.\n\n424\n00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.800\nThere's a way that you ping in\norder to test communications.\n\n425\n00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.710\nThe way I was taught it was you\nstart locally and you work your\n\n426\n00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.640\nway out to the edge of your network and\nthen finally off of your network.\n\n427\n00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.720\nWell how do we do that?\n\n428\n00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.998\nWell the first thing you might ping is,\nand you can even do local host if you\n\n429\n00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:50.586\nwant, that still works, but\nnotice that it's using IPV6.\n\n430\n00:22:50.586 --> 00:22:55.094\nYou can also do ping, 127.0.0.1.\n\n431\n00:22:55.094 --> 00:22:56.640\nThat's our loop back address.\n\n432\n00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.160\nThat lets me know that the TCP IP protocol\nstack inside of Windows can communicate.\n\n433\n00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.890\nThey call it the loop back address because\nit takes down to the network layer,\n\n434\n00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.480\nloops it back up,\ngoes back to the application layer.\n\n435\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.600\nAnd we see the output.\n\n436\n00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.970\nSo it lets me know that my\ncomputer can speak TCPIP.\n\n437\n00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:14.000\nWell, can my computer call or\n\n438\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.680\ncan it answer the call when\nits IP address is used?\n\n439\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.100\nSo that's the next thing\nthat we're gonna do.\n\n440\n00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.570\nRemember, we told you IP config?\n\n441\n00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.140\nWell, we're gonna use some\nof these with each other.\n\n442\n00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:30.070\nSo we're doing IP config and\nthere's my IP address.\n\n443\n00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:33.287\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll do a ping of that IP address.\n\n444\n00:23:37.755 --> 00:23:39.455\nIt's what I get for\ntrying to cheat the system.\n\n445\n00:23:39.455 --> 00:23:41.435\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just go ahead and type it out.\n\n446\n00:23:41.435 --> 00:23:42.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, we'll run that.\n\n447\n00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.050\nNotice that I do communication.\n\n448\n00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.400\nSo what have I done?\n\n449\n00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.575\nI know my computer can speak\nthe language of TCPIP.\n\n450\n00:23:48.575 --> 00:23:51.761\nI know it can respond to when it's\ncalled on based on its IP address.\n\n451\n00:23:51.761 --> 00:23:55.919\nNow what I have to do is I have to ping\nanother computer on my local network.\n\n452\n00:23:55.919 --> 00:23:59.437\nSo for instance, we might do, and I'm\nnot sure if this one is gonna work, but\n\n453\n00:23:59.437 --> 00:24:02.163\nI might do something like for\ninstance my default gateway.\n\n454\n00:24:02.163 --> 00:24:07.372\nNow, yeah, I'll go ahead and\nuse my default gateway.\n\n455\n00:24:07.372 --> 00:24:08.788\nI'll tell you what, guys,\n\n456\n00:24:08.788 --> 00:24:13.039\nunderstand I'm kinda skipping a step here\nbecause typically you should ping another\n\n457\n00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:16.757\ncomputer that's inside of your LAN\nbecause that lets you know that you have\n\n458\n00:24:16.757 --> 00:24:20.720\ncommunication with another computer\ninside of your local area network.\n\n459\n00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.200\nI'm kind of skipping a step here and\n\n460\n00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.320\ngoing to the next step which is\npinging your default gateway.\n\n461\n00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.970\nCan I communicate with the router?\n\n462\n00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:31.080\nCan I send information that I have\nno clue where it's supposed to go\n\n463\n00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.390\nto the device that is going to send\nthat information off of my network?\n\n464\n00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.120\nSo when we send a ping,\n\n465\n00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.390\nI verified that I can communicate\nacross this local area network.\n\n466\n00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.820\nAt least from this standpoint\non the internal network,\n\n467\n00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.350\nfrom the view of this computer, I know\nthat I have communication across the LAN.\n\n468\n00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.880\nBut that doesn't let me know\nthat if errors are failing,\n\n469\n00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.515\nmaybe if I can't connect to the Internet,\nwell, have you paid your Internet bill?\n\n470\n00:24:54.515 --> 00:24:55.887\nWell, we don't really know that,\n\n471\n00:24:55.887 --> 00:24:59.150\nand that's why it's always good to ping\nanother computer off of your network here.\n\n472\n00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.247\nSo for instance,\na couple that I've been taught,\n\n473\n00:25:03.247 --> 00:25:07.362\nI've used for a while is the ping 4.2.2.1.\n\n474\n00:25:07.362 --> 00:25:09.742\nI believe it's a DNS server\nsomewhere in Atlanta here.\n\n475\n00:25:09.742 --> 00:25:13.838\nIf you wanna use something like Google's,\nyou can do 8.8.8.8 and\n\n476\n00:25:13.838 --> 00:25:15.101\nyou could ping these.\n\n477\n00:25:15.101 --> 00:25:16.625\nNow, what does this let me know?\n\n478\n00:25:16.625 --> 00:25:19.988\nFrom the standpoint of this computer, not\nonly can I communicate with the router,\n\n479\n00:25:19.988 --> 00:25:22.918\nbut the router can send information\noff my local network out there across\n\n480\n00:25:22.918 --> 00:25:23.950\nthe Internet.\n\n481\n00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:27.280\nSo, that's one of the steps that you wanna\nkeep in mind when you're using ping in\n\n482\n00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.100\norder to do some troubleshooting.\n\n483\n00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.480\nNow that being said, do we have\nan equivalent inside of the PowerShell?\n\n484\n00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.470\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n485\n00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:37.019\nThis is what's known as test connection.\n\n486\n00:25:37.019 --> 00:25:40.082\nSo, I can do a test connection and\nI can do the same thing.\n\n487\n00:25:40.082 --> 00:25:45.160\nI can do, for instance,\nwe'll go ahead and skip right out.\n\n488\n00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.510\nNotice that I do have communication here,\nis returning replies.\n\n489\n00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:54.532\nAnd notice over on the right-hand side\nthat I have a fairly low latency.\n\n490\n00:25:54.532 --> 00:25:59.076\nSo that's the equivalent\ninside the PowerShell,\n\n491\n00:25:59.076 --> 00:26:02.569\nif you want to do a ping type of command.\n\n492\n00:26:02.569 --> 00:26:05.160\nAll right,\nnow we've got a couple other ones.\n\n493\n00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.750\nAnd I'll tell you, Mike,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n494\n00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.710\nI'm gonna switch it up just a little\nbit here because I know that\n\n495\n00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.590\nthe next thing I wanted to talk\nabout are the wireless interface.\n\n496\n00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.660\nI think I'm gonna go ahead and just\nstick with some of these utilities and\n\n497\n00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.190\nthen we'll come back to\nthe wireless interface here.\n\n498\n00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.090\nThe next one is trace RT, right?\n\n499\n00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.150\nYou might have heard it called trace\nroute in other operating systems.\n\n500\n00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.600\nSometimes even in Windows\nwe call it trace route.\n\n501\n00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.670\nTrace RT, like ping that we've seen and\ntest connection,\n\n502\n00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:33.750\nare using ICMP in order\nto discover the various\n\n503\n00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:38.170\nhops that a packet takes as it\nmakes its way across the Internet.\n\n504\n00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.530\nSo to go ahead and use maybe an IP\naddress that we've already used here,\n\n505\n00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.839\nlet me go ahead and\ndo a trace here on my computer.\n\n506\n00:26:43.839 --> 00:26:47.618\nI'll do a tracert, and\nmaybe we'll do a 4.2.2.1.\n\n507\n00:26:47.618 --> 00:26:49.850\nAnd we'll go ahead and we'll let this run.\n\n508\n00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:54.680\nNow you can see, and yeah, that is\na top level Internet backbone provider.\n\n509\n00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.400\nRoot hit server there, you could see that.\n\n510\n00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.670\nMike's over here shaking my head,\nhe really knows dying.\n\n511\n00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.380\nHe's like, yeah,\nI've seen that one before.\n\n512\n00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.760\nBut notice what's going on here.\n\n513\n00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:07.360\nNotice that what I can see here\nare the routers, the connectivity\n\n514\n00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.950\ndevices that this passes through as\nit makes its way to its destination.\n\n515\n00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:14.570\nYou'd say, well, Wes,\ncan you control any of those?\n\n516\n00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.100\nAbsolutely not.\n\n517\n00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:21.990\nMaybe this first one we might have control\nover, right, 10.1.230.11 or .1, excuse me.\n\n518\n00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:26.398\nThat's our internal router, if you will,\nthat's our default gateway.\n\n519\n00:27:26.398 --> 00:27:29.050\nBut where this information\ndoes come in handy is\n\n520\n00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:32.210\nall businesses have a local\nISP that they use, right?\n\n521\n00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.180\nAnd I could see that this information is\ngoing across grucom, right, that's our\n\n522\n00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.610\nGRU, Gainesville Regional Utility company\nhere and that's who our local ISP is.\n\n523\n00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.450\nIf I see timeouts in this\nlocation then what I know is that\n\n524\n00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.880\nthey're having a problem on their network,\nthen I could call them.\n\n525\n00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.610\nI could say you guys have any outages,\nwe might need a plan for that?\n\n526\n00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.060\nAnd they can tell me, no sir,\nwe don't have any outages,\n\n527\n00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.369\neven though you might be able to see it,\njust kidding.\n\n528\n00:27:53.369 --> 00:27:55.942\n>> [LAUGH] And\nthen two in some corporate environments,\n\n529\n00:27:55.942 --> 00:27:59.861\nthey're heavily routed where you've got\nmany different subnets and it's not\n\n530\n00:27:59.861 --> 00:28:03.912\nas small and easy as our little network\nhere, one hop and we're out to the public.\n\n531\n00:28:03.912 --> 00:28:06.753\nBut what if you've got\na company where there's four or\n\n532\n00:28:06.753 --> 00:28:10.040\nfive hops to get through before\nyou make it out to the Internet?\n\n533\n00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.394\nIf one of those routers is holding up\npackets or dropping packets, beneficial to\n\n534\n00:28:13.394 --> 00:28:16.880\nknow cuz now I can talk to somebody and\nsee if we can get that straightened out.\n\n535\n00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.650\n>> That's right.\n\n536\n00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.440\nAnd that last one, though,\nyou start getting down here towards those\n\n537\n00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.700\nlower ones and sometimes you end up with\nthe IBPs, the Internet Backbone Providers.\n\n538\n00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.220\nYou could see right here\nthis is level three.\n\n539\n00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.280\nIt's one of those, you guys really\ncan't call them and say, hey,\n\n540\n00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.300\nwhat wrong with your network?\n\n541\n00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.419\nThey have some of the best network\nengineers in the world that are trained to\n\n542\n00:28:33.419 --> 00:28:34.966\nrespond to these things in seconds.\n\n543\n00:28:34.966 --> 00:28:36.486\nSo if you're aware of the problem,\n\n544\n00:28:36.486 --> 00:28:39.642\nI can almost guarantee you they were\naware of it before you ever got there.\n\n545\n00:28:39.642 --> 00:28:40.442\n>> All right, yeah.\n\n546\n00:28:40.442 --> 00:28:42.313\n>> So good thing to have.\n\n547\n00:28:42.313 --> 00:28:45.631\n>> There's a couple of options\nyou can hand this as well, so for\n\n548\n00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:48.510\ninstance notice that it's\ndoing name resolution.\n\n549\n00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.210\nIf I want to speed it up but\nI just want to kind of see the hops,\n\n550\n00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:55.590\nI can just add a D here, -D.\n\n551\n00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.480\nDid I do that right?\n\n552\n00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.460\nMaybe got to put that on the inside here.\n\n553\n00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.520\nTrace RT, try that there.\n\n554\n00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.550\nYep, there we go.\n\n555\n00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:08.160\nDidn't like the position\nof the switch there.\n\n556\n00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.690\nPut the switch before the IP address.\n\n557\n00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:14.380\nAnd notice that I don't have\nany of those names here.\n\n558\n00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.540\nAnd again, if I'm looking at just\na quick way to get some information and\n\n559\n00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.360\njust want to find out if it can\nconnect and if there's a breakdown in\n\n560\n00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.600\ncommunication between the source and\ndestination, I can find it out here.\n\n561\n00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.990\nAnd I certainly don't have\nto resolve the names.\n\n562\n00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.693\nCouple of other options that you can do if\nyou use the dash h, you could tell it how\n\n563\n00:29:31.693 --> 00:29:35.470\nmany hops you wanna go and, in fact,\nI wouldn't even really maybe change this.\n\n564\n00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.820\nBy default, it does a maximum of 30 hops.\n\n565\n00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.530\nIf you're getting close to 30 hops,\nyou might say, well, I only want five.\n\n566\n00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:45.050\nSo if you wanna throttle that back,\nyou can too.\n\n567\n00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:49.590\nYou can also force it to do IPv4 or\nforce it to do IPv6, all right.\n\n568\n00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:55.780\nNow with the dash four option or the dash\nsix option, in case you are testing those.\n\n569\n00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.630\nAll right.\n\n570\n00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:00.090\nSo that's one of the things\nthat you can use as well.\n\n571\n00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:05.660\nThe other one that I might want to look at\nis going to be the route print command,\n\n572\n00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.960\nroute in general.\n\n573\n00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.270\nIf you need to see the routing table, for\nwhatever reason you might need to see\n\n574\n00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:14.480\nthe routing table inside of your computer,\nyou can do that.\n\n575\n00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.900\nYou can do it inside\nof the command prompt.\n\n576\n00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.530\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n577\n00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:22.060\nSo for instance, let me go ahead and\nclear the screen and if I do a route and\n\n578\n00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:26.230\nI do print, all right,\nit shows me the local routing table.\n\n579\n00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:29.772\nAnd I can see that up top\nhere I have the interfaces,\n\n580\n00:30:29.772 --> 00:30:31.970\nall right, the list of interfaces,\n\n581\n00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:37.930\nI can see the IPv4 routing table as\nwell as the IPv6 routing table, as well.\n\n582\n00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.420\nWell, maybe you're not really looking for\nthe IPv6 routing table.\n\n583\n00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.930\nMaybe that's not what you're looking for.\n\n584\n00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.650\nMaybe you're just looking for\nthe IPv4 routing table.\n\n585\n00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.550\nWell, you can filter this down\ntoo by just putting a -4 there.\n\n586\n00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.554\nNotice IPv6 is filtered out.\n\n587\n00:30:51.554 --> 00:30:56.981\nLikewise, I could put a -6 there if\nI need to, and it just gives me IPv6.\n\n588\n00:30:56.981 --> 00:30:59.676\nCouple of the options I would know, add,\n\n589\n00:30:59.676 --> 00:31:03.260\nroute-add adds a route\nto the routing table.\n\n590\n00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.910\nRoute print we've looked at,\nshows you the output of the routing table,\n\n591\n00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:07.670\nwhat's currently in the routing table.\n\n592\n00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.980\nI can also do a route delete.\n\n593\n00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:14.781\nAnd then, whatever the route is,\nyou can delete it out of there, too.\n\n594\n00:31:14.781 --> 00:31:17.828\nAnd then change makes modifications,\nlikewise.\n\n595\n00:31:17.828 --> 00:31:20.230\nNow, there's also a PowerShell\nequivalent to this, too.\n\n596\n00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:24.940\nI can do a get-netroute, and\nI believe, if I remember right,\n\n597\n00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.880\nMike, I might want to\nformat this into a list.\n\n598\n00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.524\nThat's definitely not any easier.\n\n599\n00:31:29.524 --> 00:31:31.156\n[LAUGH] Let's try the table.\n\n600\n00:31:31.156 --> 00:31:31.900\nYeah, there we go.\n\n601\n00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.990\n[LAUGH] The table.\n\n602\n00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:34.600\nYou can filter the output and\n\n603\n00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.490\nwhat you're seeing here is you're\nseeing the PowerShell equivalent to\n\n604\n00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:41.235\nthe routing table that we see with the\nroute print option so keep that in mind.\n\n605\n00:31:41.235 --> 00:31:45.092\nGet-netroute and all I did is I piped\nit out to the formats, I say that here,\n\n606\n00:31:45.092 --> 00:31:50.010\nthat format table, yeah, [LAUGH] cuz the\nlist certainly didn't do anything for us.\n\n607\n00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:53.596\n>> All right, Wes, great discussion and\ngreat look at some of those utilities and\n\n608\n00:31:53.596 --> 00:31:56.540\ncommands that we can use when\nwe're troubleshooting network and\n\n609\n00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.120\nconnectivity in Windows.\n\n610\n00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.250\nSo, we thank you for that, Wes.\n\n611\n00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.467\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n612\n00:32:01.467 --> 00:32:04.570\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n613\n00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:05.363\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n614\n00:32:05.363 --> 00:32:07.703\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n615\n00:32:07.703 --> 00:32:12.435\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.768\nat ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.768 --> 00:00:18.606\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing installing and\n\n5\n00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:19.800\nconfiguring Windows.\n\n6\n00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.350\nSpecifically in this episode we're\nactually continuing our look\n\n7\n00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.420\nat configuring networking.\n\n8\n00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.220\nSo this is a part two.\n\n9\n00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.810\nIf you missed the first part,\nmake sure you go back and check that out.\n\n10\n00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.950\nAnd here to help us continue our\njourney with configuring networking\n\n11\n00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.780\nis Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.720\nHow you doing, Wes?\n\n13\n00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.900\n>> Doing okay, before I get done with this\none, it might be another mini series or\n\n14\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.420\na novel there, for sure.\n\n15\n00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.290\nBut there are some\nthings we wanna go over.\n\n16\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.550\nKeep in mind, in the first episode,\n\n17\n00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.470\nwe looked at some of the things you can do\ninside of the graphical user interface.\n\n18\n00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.510\nWe'll take a look at a couple\nof those options, as well.\n\n19\n00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.770\nAnd we looked at some of the commands.\n\n20\n00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.970\nNow I'm going to go ahead and continue on\nin the commands where we left off because,\n\n21\n00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.552\nI talked too much in the first episode.\n\n22\n00:00:57.552 --> 00:01:00.120\nSo, coming back at you here\nwere going to dive right\n\n23\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.700\nback into our command prompt here.\n\n24\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.060\nPower shell again, one of the last\nthings we looked at in the last episode.\n\n25\n00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.150\nWe looked at the routing table and\n\n26\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.790\na couple of different ways that\nyou can view that routing table.\n\n27\n00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.590\nOne of the things that we didn't\nreally talk about too much was\n\n28\n00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.980\nname resolution, right?\n\n29\n00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.190\nWe talked a little bit about DNS,\nbut not really too much.\n\n30\n00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.180\nSo let's talk about some commands that\nyou can use in order to troubleshoot DNS.\n\n31\n00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.210\nWell you've got an oldie but\ngoodie, right.\n\n32\n00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.920\nYou've got NS lookup and\n\n33\n00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.680\nI want you to remember,\nNS lookup comes in a couple of flavors and\n\n34\n00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.920\nit really depends on how much you need to\ndo when you're talking to a DNS server.\n\n35\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.980\nMost of us for basic and\n\n36\n00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.600\nthe clients, we're gonna use\nwhat's known as interactive mode.\n\n37\n00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.080\nInteractive mode right,\nlike you can see here is just saying,\n\n38\n00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.048\nNS lookup when I say\nsomething like www.bing and,\n\n39\n00:01:49.048 --> 00:01:51.870\n.com, right.\n\n40\n00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.310\nTakes a second and what does it do?\n\n41\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.810\nIt looks at the interface\nassign DNS server, right.\n\n42\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.700\nIt's IP address and it says, okay let me\nsend a request out to that DNS server,\n\n43\n00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.270\nlet's see if it can resolve it for me.\n\n44\n00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.470\nIn this case,\nI can see that any.edge.bing.com\n\n45\n00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.430\nthere resolves to this IP address so, you\ncan see that we do have name resolution.\n\n46\n00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.210\nMaybe I wanna test a specific DNS server,\nright?\n\n47\n00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.750\nMaybe I'm wondering if my internal DNS\nserver is actually doing the resolution.\n\n48\n00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.810\nWell, guess what?\n\n49\n00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.236\nYou can always bounce these\noff of other DNS servers,\n\n50\n00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:24.880\nrather than one that is\nassigned to the interface.\n\n51\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.810\nSo for instance, if I redo this and\nI decide that I'm going to put another\n\n52\n00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.920\nserver address out here, if I can type it\nall right, I can do nslookup www.bing.com\n\n53\n00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.030\nand now I'm going to put an address beside\nit and what it has done it has actually\n\n54\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.920\nsent this request out to the IP address\nthe DDS server IP address if you will.\n\n55\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.660\nOf the same server that we were\nlooking at in the first episode.\n\n56\n00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.390\nSo notice that all I did is said,\nyou know what?\n\n57\n00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.990\nI wanna bounce this off\nanother DNS server.\n\n58\n00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.420\nAnd so what does this do for me?\n\n59\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.650\nThis lets me know that\nthis machine can resolve\n\n60\n00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.350\nan IP address if it hits a DNS\nserver that can respond back to it.\n\n61\n00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.010\nAll right, so again we can use this.\n\n62\n00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.230\nThe other flavor of nslookup,\na little bit more detailed.\n\n63\n00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.210\nAnd again, I'm not so sure you have to\nworry about this on the client exam,\n\n64\n00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.710\nbut I do just want to make mention of it.\n\n65\n00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.900\nAnd if you hit nslookup and you dive in\nthere, notice it's a little bit different.\n\n66\n00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.650\nNotice it's a little bit,\nmy cursor's changed a little bit.\n\n67\n00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.580\nAnd if I do a question mark here,\nI've got a lot of options.\n\n68\n00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.120\nNow whether you get any\nof this information back.\n\n69\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.690\nChances are you're not gonna get some\nof this information back because,\n\n70\n00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.570\nit's very sensitive and they certainly\ndon't want you to ask a DNS server for\n\n71\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.810\nmore information than you\nreally should have access to.\n\n72\n00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.860\nBut it does give you the option that\nyou can expand on the questions or\n\n73\n00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.820\nthe requests that you send to\nthe DNS server if you're doing\n\n74\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.970\nname resolution testing.\n\n75\n00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.420\nAll right, so let me go ahead and,\nI believe it's just exit, there we go.\n\n76\n00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.280\nAnd let me clear the screen out here,\nprovided I can spell clear.\n\n77\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.170\nRight, and well, do we have\na PowerShell equivalent to this?\n\n78\n00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.120\nWell, the answer is yes, yes we do.\n\n79\n00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.960\nWe've got the resolve and\nhere's where I absolutely love PowerShell.\n\n80\n00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.220\nI don't have to type the whole thing out.\n\n81\n00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.260\nI just have to know,\nclose to the commandlet.\n\n82\n00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.420\nNow, you might get a text-based\nanswer on the exam.\n\n83\n00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.470\nIt might not have any kind of simulation,\nor\n\n84\n00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.470\nlike they say,\nperformance-based questions.\n\n85\n00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.520\nSo, don't just rely on\nthe tabbing feature.\n\n86\n00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.340\nAs you practice it,\ndefinitely use that tab functionality,\n\n87\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.550\nbecause if you don't quite\nknow the commandlet, but\n\n88\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.930\nyou're wanting to memorize it, the tab\nfunctionality can fill it in for you.\n\n89\n00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.990\nNotice we have resolve-dns name.\n\n90\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.590\nAll right and\nI can put a name parameter on this and\n\n91\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.460\nI can do the same thing www.bing.com.\n\n92\n00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.635\nRight, I run this and\n\n93\n00:04:36.635 --> 00:04:40.500\nI'm getting a little bit more\ninformation than we did with nslookup.\n\n94\n00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.180\nI'm getting the start of authority,\nthe SOA.\n\n95\n00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.760\nRight, it basically talked\nto Microsoft's servers and\n\n96\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.160\nit said who's the authority over this?\n\n97\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.040\nAnd it gives me back\nthe start of authority there.\n\n98\n00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.390\nI can see the TTL, ZoneRefresh.\n\n99\n00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.570\nIt's a little bit more information.\n\n100\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.900\nNow, for us, basically, we're just testing\nname resolution here, so this information\n\n101\n00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.100\nmight not be so important to you, but\nyou do have access to it if you need it.\n\n102\n00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.380\nSo for instance we can do let's say,\n\n103\n00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.000\ncan we do the same thing that\nwe could inside of NsLookup?\n\n104\n00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.090\nCan we bounce this up\nanother server if we want to?\n\n105\n00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.120\nWell the answer is yes.\n\n106\n00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.730\nSo if I rerun that command, but\nthis time I do a sever parameter.\n\n107\n00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.910\nNow I can change what the interface\nassigned DNS server is.\n\n108\n00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.950\nWe run this.\n\n109\n00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.100\nAnd again it does give me an answer back.\n\n110\n00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.830\nAnd you can see that I've bounced\nit off of that server right there.\n\n111\n00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.680\nSo you do have the ability to do the same\nthing we've seen in a NS look up.\n\n112\n00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.670\nAlright, so let's try another on here.\n\n113\n00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.300\nLet's try a result.\n\n114\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.690\nAnd I'm going to change this to dot net.\n\n115\n00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.530\nAll right.\n\n116\n00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.770\nNow I only do this because\nI kind of realized this,\n\n117\n00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.100\nin fact I was messing around in my lab and\nI told Mike this, I said,\n\n118\n00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.698\nI just found out that apparently Microsoft\nowns www.bing.com and www.bing.net.\n\n119\n00:05:57.698 --> 00:05:59.420\nHow could I tell that, well,\n\n120\n00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.230\nI can see that that's resolving\nto a single IP address, right.\n\n121\n00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.930\nThat's what we want DNS,\nnotice it's 204.79.197.200.\n\n122\n00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.630\nWell remember we just did Bing.com,\nwell if you look what did that result to.\n\n123\n00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.190\nSo it's resulting to the same name there,\nbut you know again not for\n\n124\n00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.220\nthe exam more some of the things that you\n\n125\n00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.230\ndon't see I would say just like browsing\nto the website you kind see into the hood.\n\n126\n00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.770\nWhen it comes to things\nlike name resolution.\n\n127\n00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.390\nI thought that was pretty interesting.\n\n128\n00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.890\n>> Very cool.\n\n129\n00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.880\nAll right, so Mike,\n\n130\n00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.040\nthat takes care of some of\nthe connectivity tests that you can do.\n\n131\n00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.330\nRemember how to use ping.\n\n132\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.230\nIf you're not familiar with some of the\nstandard procedures there, go ahead and\n\n133\n00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.860\njump back to the first episode.\n\n134\n00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.000\n>> Now as I know that all\nthese commands we've seen so\n\n135\n00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.840\nfar work on any network connection,\nwhether its wired or wireless,\n\n136\n00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.990\nbut wireless does introduce some new\nproblems or issues that we can run in to,\n\n137\n00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.030\nso there are some tools that\nare specific to wireless, aren't there?\n\n138\n00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.280\n>> That's right, and that's another\none everybody kind of cringes.\n\n139\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.950\nI know I first started getting this into\nthis command and I started cringing,\n\n140\n00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.950\nuntil I started to learn the power of it,\nand get a little bit more comfortable.\n\n141\n00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.720\nAnd that's what's known\nas the network shell.\n\n142\n00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.250\nIt's abbreviated Net SH.\n\n143\n00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.840\nSo, Net SH command,\nit allows you to do many, many things.\n\n144\n00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.860\nLike for instance,\nyou can see the state of,\n\n145\n00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.730\nif you've got IP set communications,\nyou've got IP set tunnels built up.\n\n146\n00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.010\nIf you've got things like,\nyou wanna modify the firewall.\n\n147\n00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.710\nYou could modify the firewall, you could\nset IP addresses, but what we wanna look\n\n148\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.100\nat, what are some of the things that you\ncan do if you have a wireless network?\n\n149\n00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.740\nWell, if you're connected\nto a wireless network,\n\n150\n00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.650\nyou might have to troubleshoot\nit from time to time.\n\n151\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.780\nSo you do have some options here.\n\n152\n00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.610\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n153\n00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.350\nI'll go ahead and\nclear the screen out there.\n\n154\n00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.680\nAnd managed to type that\nright once [LAUGH].\n\n155\n00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.030\nSo we'll do our netsh.\n\n156\n00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.520\nAnd we're gonna type wlan.\n\n157\n00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.703\nThen we're gonna do a couple\ndifferent ones, all right?\n\n158\n00:07:45.703 --> 00:07:50.030\nThis command,\nwe're in command prompt technically,\n\n159\n00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:55.182\nhas a lot of hidden gems that maybe\nsome people don't really know so\n\n160\n00:07:55.182 --> 00:07:57.500\nthis is not only for the exam.\n\n161\n00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.425\nWe're hoping maybe you can\ntake some of this away and\n\n162\n00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:00.706\nuse it inside of your own network.\n\n163\n00:08:00.706 --> 00:08:09.000\nLike, for instance, I can do a net sh\nwlan show, and then the all option.\n\n164\n00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.110\nAnd it's gonna give you a lot\nof information, all right?\n\n165\n00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.988\nSo, let's see what kinda\ninformation can we get here,\n\n166\n00:08:14.988 --> 00:08:18.466\ncuz we're gonna torture Mike and say,\nhey, did you get line two, there?\n\n167\n00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:21.225\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm gonna show you individual, too.\n\n168\n00:08:21.225 --> 00:08:22.285\nSo, we're just gonna talk about it.\n\n169\n00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:23.660\nAnd I can see the drivers, and\n\n170\n00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.260\nwe'll talk a little bit more about that\ncuz we can narrow it down a little bit.\n\n171\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.080\nI can see things like what\nare the authentication supported\n\n172\n00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.870\ntypes in our infrastructure mode, right?\n\n173\n00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.750\nWhen I'm connected to\na wireless access point.\n\n174\n00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.530\nAm I gonna use WEP?\n\n175\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.403\nAm I gonna use WPA?\n\n176\n00:08:36.403 --> 00:08:37.670\nAm I gonna use WPA2?\n\n177\n00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.032\nIf you guys have paid\nattention to your security,\n\n178\n00:08:40.032 --> 00:08:42.460\nyou should know that first\none we should never use.\n\n179\n00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.390\nBut it is there, right?\n\n180\n00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.260\nAnd we can also use things like\nthe temporal key integrity protocol, or\n\n181\n00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.950\nthe TCMP, for greater strength.\n\n182\n00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.750\nBut you can, again,\nsee the capabilities, right?\n\n183\n00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.820\nI scroll down here, show interfaces.\n\n184\n00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.720\nSo, I can see the current interface.\n\n185\n00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.700\nThis is what would be essentially\nmy WiFi profile right now.\n\n186\n00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.550\nThis is what I'm connected to, right?\n\n187\n00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.980\nAnd I can see the physical address,\nI can see the service set identifier,\n\n188\n00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.090\nthe basic service set identifier as well.\n\n189\n00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.540\nI could even see the radio type.\n\n190\n00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.190\nI could see what encryption type\nit's using, and the cypher.\n\n191\n00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.830\nIn this case,\nwe're not using the we're using CCMP.\n\n192\n00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.920\nYou can see auto connect.\n\n193\n00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.300\nI can see the channel that it's on, right?\n\n194\n00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.337\nI could see that it's on channel 44.\n\n195\n00:09:21.337 --> 00:09:25.204\nSo, my guess would be that that is a five\nnetwork, because if I remember right,\n\n196\n00:09:25.204 --> 00:09:28.520\n2.4 network goes by 2.4 increments\nin the various spectrum.\n\n197\n00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.990\nSo we can see that we're connected to a 5.\n\n198\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:37.250\nAnd by that, I do mean an 802.11 and,\nyeah, there we go.\n\n199\n00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.220\nA 5 gigahertz aspect there.\n\n200\n00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:39.960\nAll right.\n\n201\n00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.200\nI can see the transmission rate, right?\n\n202\n00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.400\nI say 300, and transmit rate.\n\n203\n00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.730\nEven the signal strength, right?\n\n204\n00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.126\nA lot of good information\nthat you can get here, right?\n\n205\n00:09:48.126 --> 00:09:50.170\nI can see additional information.\n\n206\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.010\nShow the settings, the wireless\nLAN settings that are in here.\n\n207\n00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.360\nHere's another thing that's really great.\n\n208\n00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.610\nThe filters I wouldn't worry\nabout too much on this one,\n\n209\n00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.230\nbut look at this here, all right.\n\n210\n00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.680\nLet me scroll down just a little bit here.\n\n211\n00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.530\nI can see surrounding\nwireless access points here.\n\n212\n00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:07.970\nLet me see if I can scroll.\n\n213\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:08.860\nThere we go.\n\n214\n00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.420\nRight?\nI can see what rates they're running on.\n\n215\n00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.408\nI can see what channels\nthey're running on.\n\n216\n00:10:14.408 --> 00:10:15.960\nThe signal strength's in here,\n\n217\n00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.720\nso you got a lot of good information\nhere that you can use, right?\n\n218\n00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.951\nWhat you see, lab dash guest.\n\n219\n00:10:20.951 --> 00:10:26.185\nA lot of good information in the show all\noption, so definitely check that out.\n\n220\n00:10:26.185 --> 00:10:28.615\nNow, maybe you're looking\nat just a couple of things.\n\n221\n00:10:28.615 --> 00:10:31.605\nMaybe you wanna see the drivers, or\nmaybe you wanna see the networks.\n\n222\n00:10:31.605 --> 00:10:34.275\nWell, you can do that here likewise.\n\n223\n00:10:34.275 --> 00:10:39.241\nI can do a net sh,\nwlan show networks, all right?\n\n224\n00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:43.980\nAnd what I'm gonna see\nis the various access\n\n225\n00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.110\npoints that are around our building,\nright?\n\n226\n00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.440\nI can see the signal strength.\n\n227\n00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.696\nI can see their encryption type, right?\n\n228\n00:10:50.696 --> 00:10:55.764\nI can see if they're closed or not [LAUGH]\nand you know what kind of mode they're on,\n\n229\n00:10:55.764 --> 00:10:58.996\nand whether they would be\nin a infrastructure mode or\n\n230\n00:10:58.996 --> 00:11:02.385\nmaybe an ad hoc network,\nif it happened to be that way.\n\n231\n00:11:02.385 --> 00:11:02.970\nAll right.\n\n232\n00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.540\nSo a couple different things\nthat you can do there.\n\n233\n00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.210\nNow, what if you're looking at maybe\ntroubleshooting drivers, right?\n\n234\n00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.250\nDrivers we know are what allows\nour hardware to talk with our\n\n235\n00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.070\noperating system.\n\n236\n00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.520\nAnd if there's something wrong with them,\nwe don't have that communication between\n\n237\n00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.782\nthe high level programming language that\nthe operating system is written in, and\n\n238\n00:11:18.782 --> 00:11:19.980\nthat low level machine code.\n\n239\n00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.320\nSo we can do that, too.\n\n240\n00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.280\nWe can do a net sh.\n\n241\n00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.810\nAnd a wlan here again.\n\n242\n00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.290\nAnd we can do, not sow, we don't wanna sow\nthe drivers, we wanna show the drivers.\n\n243\n00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.730\nAnd then, we'll do show drivers,\nall right.\n\n244\n00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.215\nAnd when we run this again,\nit shows me where these drivers are.\n\n245\n00:11:36.215 --> 00:11:38.855\nAll right, now,\nshow you this by comparison.\n\n246\n00:11:38.855 --> 00:11:43.943\nGetting out of the command prompt, or\nPowerShell, I can go into Device Manager,\n\n247\n00:11:43.943 --> 00:11:48.753\nand if I wanted to check these, the\nwireless adapter here, where is that at?\n\n248\n00:11:51.428 --> 00:11:52.505\nWhere is that?\n\n249\n00:11:52.505 --> 00:11:55.255\nNetwork, network, network,\nnetwork adapters, there we go.\n\n250\n00:11:55.255 --> 00:11:58.395\nNotice I have this Intel Centrino Advance.\n\n251\n00:11:58.395 --> 00:12:01.940\nI would almost be willing to bet\nthat if I right-click on that,\n\n252\n00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.560\nchoose Properties,\nlet's see, I'm not sure.\n\n253\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.200\nWe should be able to close that, no,\nit's not gonna let us close down.\n\n254\n00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.560\nBut I kinda wanna show\nyou the drivers here.\n\n255\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.240\nSee if that I can get that into the view\nto where you guys can see that.\n\n256\n00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.010\nIf I look at the drivers tab, and\nI view the driver details, I might see\n\n257\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.790\nthat there is a comparison between what\nwe see here in the command prompt.\n\n258\n00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:24.298\nI don't know if you guys can see that,\nbut notice we have net wew01, right?\n\n259\n00:12:24.298 --> 00:12:28.840\nNETwew01.sys, and\nagain with the next one you can see.\n\n260\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.650\nSo it shows me the drivers that\nare installed for my machine.\n\n261\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:36.245\nSo, again, it's one of those things that,\nif you don't ever use it and\n\n262\n00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:39.435\nyou don't know that it's there, well,\nyou don't get to benefit from it.\n\n263\n00:12:39.435 --> 00:12:44.805\nBut I would know some of\nthese commands for the exam.\n\n264\n00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:47.015\nNow, we've got a couple of other\nones that I really like, too.\n\n265\n00:12:47.015 --> 00:12:51.825\nAnd if you wanna know, it shows some\nof the capabilities right here.\n\n266\n00:12:51.825 --> 00:12:54.895\nIt shows you all the radio types\nthat this adapter supports, so\n\n267\n00:12:54.895 --> 00:12:58.740\nit's a, and it's all of the adapter types.\n\n268\n00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.260\nBut I can actually do something else.\n\n269\n00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:05.970\nI can do something like netsh we can see\nthe capabilities of the network adapter.\n\n270\n00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.340\nAnd like I said, in the authentication and\ncipher that's supported,\n\n271\n00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.190\nyou can see some of that\ninformation already.\n\n272\n00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.894\nBut what we can do is do a show and\n\n273\n00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:18.950\nthen this next option is\nall together wireless.\n\n274\n00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.765\nAnd I'm going to have such a hard time, I\ncan tell you right now, at spelling this.\n\n275\n00:13:24.765 --> 00:13:26.446\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Bilities.\n\n276\n00:13:28.773 --> 00:13:30.650\nBilities.\n\n277\n00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.070\nI swear I can do it.\n\n278\n00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.140\nWireless capabilities.\n\n279\n00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.480\nNow, this is another one\nof those hidden gems that\n\n280\n00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.220\nmaybe some people don't know about.\n\n281\n00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.070\nRight?\nYou can see a lot\n\n282\n00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.745\nof the things that are supported inside,\nright?\n\n283\n00:13:43.745 --> 00:13:46.670\nWi-Fi direct,\nnotice that Wi-Fi direct is supported.\n\n284\n00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.826\nWhat is Wi-Fi direct?\n\n285\n00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:52.613\nWell, Wi-Fi direct is an industry-wide\nstandard that is overseen by\n\n286\n00:13:52.613 --> 00:13:56.522\nthe Wi-Fi alliance that controls\na lot of the standards,\n\n287\n00:13:56.522 --> 00:14:00.210\nnot 802.11 per se,\nthat's an IEEE committee.\n\n288\n00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.420\nBut the WiFi Alliance, they're the ones\nthat support a lot of this infrastructure.\n\n289\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.730\nWhile WiFi Direct is a basic\nscreen sharing technology.\n\n290\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:11.020\nInside of Windows it's purported\nthere's something mirror cast.\n\n291\n00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.092\nIf you haven't heard of mirror cast,\nkeep in mind that that's Microsoft's\n\n292\n00:14:14.092 --> 00:14:17.870\nimplementation of the industry wide\nstandard called WiFi Direct, right?\n\n293\n00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.525\nMike, I believe you have an iPhone, right?\n\n294\n00:14:20.525 --> 00:14:22.360\n>> Yes.\n>> Well, it supports things like\n\n295\n00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.760\nbeing able to transfer your screen over\nto an iPad or maybe over to your Mac.\n\n296\n00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.900\nWell, so, that's Apple's\nimplementation of WiFi Direct.\n\n297\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:37.090\nMirror cast is a way that you share\nyour screen inside the Microsoft world.\n\n298\n00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.620\nI need to know if it's supported.\n\n299\n00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.340\nI can see that information right here.\n\n300\n00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:44.880\nMike, as you can see, this wireless\ncapabilities really does give you\n\n301\n00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.830\nbasically an output of what it is\nthat your wireless adapter can do.\n\n302\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:54.270\nLike, for instance, promiscuous mode,\nyou can see it's supported here, right?\n\n303\n00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.500\nIBSS, right?\n\n304\n00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.790\nThe Independent Basic Service Set, right?\n\n305\n00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.790\nWe could basically make this computer\nits own access point where we can\n\n306\n00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.810\ndo peer to peer communications,\nso it's really, really nice.\n\n307\n00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:09.270\nNow, one of the last ones I wanna show you\nis probably most of the hidden gems I was\n\n308\n00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:14.180\ntalking about, and that is something\nknown as show w lan report.\n\n309\n00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.580\nThis one's really, really cool.\n\n310\n00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.170\nAnd like I said, some people\ndon't even know that it is here.\n\n311\n00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:26.686\nIf I run the netsh and\nI do spell these right.\n\n312\n00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:33.930\nAnd then a show, and\nthen wlan report, and I run this.\n\n313\n00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.204\nAll right.\nNow, wasn't that absolutely amazing?\n\n314\n00:15:37.204 --> 00:15:38.548\n>> That's a lot of\ninformation [CROSSTALK].\n\n315\n00:15:38.548 --> 00:15:40.040\n>> That's a lot of information, man.\n\n316\n00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.420\nI tell you what, I got a great report.\n\n317\n00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.320\nJust kidding guys.\n\n318\n00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.560\nLet me show you this.\n\n319\n00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.480\nI'm gonna go ahead and copy this path,\nand we'll launch it up.\n\n320\n00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:56.060\nI believe, I believe it'll\nlet you just copy the path.\n\n321\n00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.863\nDo you need to know that path for\nthe exam?\n\n322\n00:15:57.863 --> 00:15:58.842\nNo.\n\n323\n00:15:58.842 --> 00:16:03.246\nIt doesn't seem to be letting me do that.\n\n324\n00:16:03.246 --> 00:16:04.540\nTry it one more time.\n\n325\n00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.580\nThird time's a charm.\n\n326\n00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:10.260\nAnd it didn't seem to get it.\n\n327\n00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.358\nI tell you what,\nwe'll do this a little bit different.\n\n328\n00:16:12.358 --> 00:16:14.470\nWe're going to go ahead and you know what,\n\n329\n00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:20.000\nI'm not going to rely on the good\nold graphical user interface.\n\n330\n00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.620\n>> That would be cheating at this point.\n\n331\n00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.700\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n332\n00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.220\nCan't do that.\n\n333\n00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.690\nTell you guys, hey, we're going to spend\nsome time in the graphical user interface\n\n334\n00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.520\nand then, of course, I don't use it.\n\n335\n00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.910\nAll right, we'll do tab.\n\n336\n00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.257\nI don't think.\n\n337\n00:16:40.736 --> 00:16:42.870\nAll right and which one do we want?\n\n338\n00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:50.300\nWe want WLAN report, latest HTML.\n\n339\n00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.200\nCheck this out guys.\n\n340\n00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:57.650\nThis is a fully formatted, all right,\nhypertext markup language web page of\n\n341\n00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:03.840\nthe functionality of a lot of different\ncharacteristics of your wireless adapter.\n\n342\n00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.470\nWhen you've started the connection,\nconnection to the internet,\n\n343\n00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:14.420\nno connectivity, and notice when I hover\nover this, see how the summary changes,\n\n344\n00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.230\nlet me do that a little bit,\nnotice how the summary changes and\n\n345\n00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:22.090\nit gives you information, but that's not\nall guys I've got system information on my\n\n346\n00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:26.850\nmachine, user info,\nwho is logged in the network adaptors,\n\n347\n00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:30.690\nall of their PMP device ids and\nclass guides if you had to grab these.\n\n348\n00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:35.320\nMaybe you're controlling in group policy,\nyou want to control what kind of\n\n349\n00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:40.430\nPMP devices can actually be used\nhere while I can see guids here.\n\n350\n00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.769\nI can see the driver versions.\n\n351\n00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:48.050\nI could see a scripted output all for your\nIP config all which we were running right,\n\n352\n00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:53.480\nit doesn't follow, and it puts the output\nright here in a web page, right?\n\n353\n00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.010\nI could look at session durations,\nI can see the wireless sessions, and\n\n354\n00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:02.770\nI can see all the individual information,\nstart and stop capabilities,\n\n355\n00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:06.780\nthe fact that I'm running some\nof the WLAN options here.\n\n356\n00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.950\nThis is a really, really good gem, and\nI'll tell you what, I really like it.\n\n357\n00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.650\nIt opened up in the Edge browser,\nbut again,\n\n358\n00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.180\nyou can change that by default here.\n\n359\n00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.590\nI've just kind of left the default so\n\n360\n00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.350\nyou can see basically what you\nwould see here All right so,\n\n361\n00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:24.220\nknow some this commands, know some of\nthe commands we've gone over, all right.\n\n362\n00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.810\nNow the other thing that they call\nthat on the exam for you guys to know,\n\n363\n00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:32.400\nis something known us VPN\napplication triggering.\n\n364\n00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.520\nAll right, well let's go ahead, let's set\nthe stage, let's setup a VPN first and\n\n365\n00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.700\nthen we'll look at what we're\ntalking about when we say VPN or\n\n366\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.310\napplication based VPN triggering here.\n\n367\n00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.200\nI've got another machine here I'm\nprobably going to have to get logged in.\n\n368\n00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.010\nI've been out of this machine for\na while here.\n\n369\n00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.810\nLet me see.\n\n370\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:53.910\nHello machine.\n\n371\n00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:54.680\nThere we go.\n\n372\n00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.870\nSo we'll go ahead and resume and\napparently it went to sleep on me.\n\n373\n00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.436\nAgain, I was talking too much.\n\n374\n00:18:59.436 --> 00:19:00.990\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.590\n>> Alright.\n\n376\n00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:02.270\nYeah, not me.\n\n377\n00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.140\nMike's over here, yeah, right.\n\n378\n00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.340\nAlright, let me go ahead and\nget logged in to this real quick.\n\n379\n00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.180\nNotice first of all, you should see that\nthis is non domain join computer here.\n\n380\n00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:15.280\nThat is one of the stipulations if\nyou do application triggering vpn,\n\n381\n00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.750\ncan't be a domain join computer.\n\n382\n00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.090\nSo please keep that in mind for the exam.\n\n383\n00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:24.790\nAll right, now let's go ahead, and you'll\nalso notice that I have internet access\n\n384\n00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.500\nright here, down here,\nI know it's kind of hard to see there.\n\n385\n00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.800\nSo were connected to the internet, and\n\n386\n00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.020\nif I decide to connect to a VPN,\nthen I can choose the new action center.\n\n387\n00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:38.360\nNotice that the new action center also\ngives me this little VPN tile here,\n\n388\n00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.140\nI can choose that.\n\n389\n00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.200\nAnd this is the new interface,\n\n390\n00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.400\nthe new way you would go through\nsetting up your VPN communication.\n\n391\n00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.850\nNow you can also go\nthrough the Network and\n\n392\n00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.630\nSharing Center that we've\ntalked about before.\n\n393\n00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.266\nSetting up a new connection and connecting\nto your workplace and while that's going\n\n394\n00:19:52.266 --> 00:19:55.730\nto take it's time to open up here, let me\ngo ahead and open up the control panel.\n\n395\n00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.950\nAnd we'll go to system and security,\nnope not system and security.\n\n396\n00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:00.720\nExcuse me.\n\n397\n00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.550\nWrong side of the river.\n\n398\n00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.610\nNetwork and internet,\nnetwork and sharing center.\n\n399\n00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.020\nAnd notice that we have the option\nhere if we want to set up\n\n400\n00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.400\na new network connection, and when I do\nthat I can choose connect to a workplace,\n\n401\n00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.240\nchoose next, and\nyou can put your information in here.\n\n402\n00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.490\nAll right,\nwell you can also do this information,\n\n403\n00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.410\nlike I said if this thing\nwill ever launch up.\n\n404\n00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.083\nLet's see what its problem was.\n\n405\n00:20:26.697 --> 00:20:28.100\nAll right, there we go.\n\n406\n00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.920\nI guess there's more\nthan one way to do it.\n\n407\n00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.240\n[LAUGH] We're going to go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose Network and Internet.\n\n408\n00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.270\nAnd it is good to see\nthis interface as well.\n\n409\n00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:38.100\nKeep in mind that, that little tile would\nhave taken you right to this location.\n\n410\n00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.190\nAll right.\n\n411\n00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.236\nAnd if I go ahead,\nI'm going to switch down here, and\n\n412\n00:20:42.236 --> 00:20:44.627\nwe're going to go to the VPN side of this.\n\n413\n00:20:47.088 --> 00:20:48.670\nAll right, we'll give it a second here.\n\n414\n00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.183\nLooks like it's chugging along here.\n\n415\n00:20:54.547 --> 00:20:55.990\nHm.\n\n416\n00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.140\nI'll try that one more time.\n\n417\n00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.690\nSeems like it didn't really\nlike that resume real quick.\n\n418\n00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.170\nThere we go.\n\n419\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.270\nIt did finally render here, but I want\nto take you to those steps again, guys,\n\n420\n00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.760\nbecause it took a little bit to get there.\n\n421\n00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.450\nOn the exam, they might give you these\ntext based answers or they give you\n\n422\n00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.810\nan exhibit that says, where do you click\nto do this?, so we want you to know that.\n\n423\n00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.220\nWe'll go ahead and choose network and\ninternet, we'll choose VPN, and\n\n424\n00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.010\nhere comes the information\nthat we wanted to see.\n\n425\n00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.460\nYou have the option here to allow\nVPN connection over metered network\n\n426\n00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.490\nkeep in mind if you got a data plan,\nthis is going to chew your data plan up.\n\n427\n00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.460\nYou turn it on you've got a data plan it\nrecognizes a metered network its gonna go\n\n428\n00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.040\nahead connect to the VPN that's going to\nbe up to you whether you want to do that.\n\n429\n00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.340\nIf you've got a mobile device you want to\nconnect while roaming, think about money,\n\n430\n00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.670\nthink about your charge\nwhether you use this or not.\n\n431\n00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.990\nLet's go ahead,\nwe're going to set up our VPN connection.\n\n432\n00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.180\nNow, I'm going to go ahead and\nuse the built-in Windows provider here.\n\n433\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:55.221\nMy connection name, I'll just call it,\nlet's call it ITPro.\n\n434\n00:21:57.832 --> 00:22:01.660\nI'll do all caps, ITPROTV.\n\n435\n00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.540\nI'm going to do my server address here.\n\n436\n00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.480\nNow keep in mind that the server address\nthat you use is going to be the one that\n\n437\n00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.430\nis provided to you by your administrator,\nor if you are the administrator,\n\n438\n00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:13.580\nprobably the one that you're\nall ready know about.\n\n439\n00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:19.510\nI will do edge one here.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n440\n00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.260\nThat's the VPN server that I'm\ngoing to be connecting to.\n\n441\n00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:27.040\nYou have the option that you could\nconfigure the different VPN protocol,\n\n442\n00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.690\nthe tunneling types if you want.\n\n443\n00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:29.720\nPPTP here, right?\n\n444\n00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.170\nPoint to point tunneling protocol.\n\n445\n00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.660\nIPSEC as well as SSTP.\n\n446\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.900\nAnd finally Ike version two.\n\n447\n00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.970\nI want you to keep in mind that if\nyou want to use the VPN reconnect\n\n448\n00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.570\nFunctionality, you're\ngonna use Ike version two.\n\n449\n00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.250\nIt is required,\nbecause it does a good job,\n\n450\n00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:48.480\nit's one of the reasons it's called mobike\nas well, mobile internet key exchange,\n\n451\n00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:54.410\nis because it allows you to maintain when\nyou have intermittent VPN connectivity,\n\n452\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.590\nwhen you have wireless access.\n\n453\n00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:01.010\nSo as I'm hopping between networks It can\nreconnect and automatically connect back\n\n454\n00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:05.690\nup to the VPN, I do want to make mention\nof that that does require IKE version two.\n\n455\n00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.000\nNow I can choose what kind\nof authentication I want,\n\n456\n00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.900\nusername and password.\n\n457\n00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.600\nIn this case I'm going to use kerberos\nauthentication, you now, user name and\n\n458\n00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.280\npassword.\n\n459\n00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.410\nYou could use smart cards, certificate,\nobviously one of strongest ways to do it.\n\n460\n00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.610\nDoes require a little extra setup here.\n\n461\n00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:21.810\nWe're going to just say automatic.\n\n462\n00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:22.890\nWe'll let it choose.\n\n463\n00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.477\nAnd I'm going to go ahead, and I'm going\nto put in our username, and password.\n\n464\n00:23:30.466 --> 00:23:32.330\nAnd we'll go ahead and choose save.\n\n465\n00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:35.700\nAll right, now that's got our connection.\n\n466\n00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.580\nLet's show you some of the advanced\noptions we haven't really connected yet,\n\n467\n00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.690\nbut I can see that I can edit this\ninformation if I was going through\n\n468\n00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.150\na proxy,\nif I was doing automatic configuration,\n\n469\n00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:47.080\nwe can configure this here too or\nmanual configuration.\n\n470\n00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.160\nWe're just going to leave these settings.\n\n471\n00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.900\nI want you to be aware of them though for\nthe exam.\n\n472\n00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.185\nAnd I'm going to choose connect.\n\n473\n00:23:54.185 --> 00:23:57.901\nAll right now,\nwhat we're doing here is we're connecting\n\n474\n00:23:57.901 --> 00:24:02.745\nover a public network right back into\nthe private network the intranet site.\n\n475\n00:24:02.745 --> 00:24:06.226\nAll right and sometimes it takes a little\nbit to establish the connection.\n\n476\n00:24:06.226 --> 00:24:09.666\nNow one of the things I want\nyou to notice is my little,\n\n477\n00:24:09.666 --> 00:24:12.038\nI know my head's covering it up, but\n\n478\n00:24:12.038 --> 00:24:17.120\nnotice we went from having internet\naccess to not having any internet access.\n\n479\n00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.270\nWhy is that?\n\n480\n00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:21.660\nNo longer am I using my public IP address.\n\n481\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.070\nRemember we were talking about\nipconfig for testing and\n\n482\n00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.580\nconfigurations, testing\nyour configurations.\n\n483\n00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.560\nLet's go ahead and let's bring up\nour PowerShell one more time and\n\n484\n00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.910\nlet's do an ipconfig and\nsee what we find out here.\n\n485\n00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.830\nSo we'll do an ipconfig.\n\n486\n00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.660\nI can see that I've got a six\nto four adaptor, right?\n\n487\n00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.380\nThis is your IPv6 encapsulating and\n\n488\n00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:46.480\nthen being sent over an IPv4 network\nback into our intranet site.\n\n489\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.010\nNotice my IP address.\n\n490\n00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:53.460\nNow my ethernet adaptor has\na public IP address, but\n\n491\n00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:59.020\nmy PPP adaptor, point to point protocol,\nthat has a private IP address.\n\n492\n00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.635\nSo does that mean now with\na public IP address and\n\n493\n00:25:01.635 --> 00:25:04.330\nconnected to this VPN I can\nping my domain controller?\n\n494\n00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.449\nI don't know, let's find out.\n\n495\n00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.325\nAnd sure enough,\nI have access to the domain controller.\n\n496\n00:25:11.325 --> 00:25:13.060\nWhy is that?\n\n497\n00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:17.100\nIt's because it's established that\ntunnel and it's now connected to my\n\n498\n00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.820\nedge server and it's allowing me through\nthe VPN into the internal network.\n\n499\n00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:26.510\nFor instance, something else I\nmight be able to do, all right?\n\n500\n00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:31.610\nMaybe I want to type backslash,\nbackslash, ten, that same server.\n\n501\n00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:33.870\nYou know, because you should always\nconnect to your domain controller\n\n502\n00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:34.960\nshares, right?\n\n503\n00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.800\nThat’s perfectly safe.\n\n504\n00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.220\nWe are going to do C, dollar sign here.\n\n505\n00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.830\nAnd you know what, Cortana tell you what,\nreally annoys me sometimes.\n\n506\n00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.215\nBackslash, backslash,\nwe will try that again.\n\n507\n00:25:44.215 --> 00:25:47.820\nWe'll use our UNC path and we'll see if\nwe can get to our administrative share\n\n508\n00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.140\nfrom our public network.\n\n509\n00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:54.360\nSure enough, if I look in\nthe windows folders, I can see ADS,\n\n510\n00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.990\nI can see ADWS, right?\n\n511\n00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.260\nThat's my domain controller.\n\n512\n00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.040\nI now have access because\nI have connectivity\n\n513\n00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.270\nthrough the VPN back into\nthe internal network.\n\n514\n00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.370\nNow that's setting up the VPN.\n\n515\n00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:10.970\nOne of the things that it doesn't really\nhelp you with is this next part and\n\n516\n00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.940\nthis is called the application\ntriggered VPN.\n\n517\n00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.050\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n518\n00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.200\nNow that you've got your VPN setup,\nif decide to,\n\n519\n00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.760\nI can actually make it to where I can\nconfigure an application, all right?\n\n520\n00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:32.520\nThe moment I click the application and it\nexecutes, it says wait, tunnel isn't open.\n\n521\n00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:38.750\nBut this is a application triggered,\nVPN triggered app I guess I should say.\n\n522\n00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.980\nAnd it's gonna trigger the VPN,\nit's gonna bring it online.\n\n523\n00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.740\nLet's see how we do that.\n\n524\n00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.720\nWe'll give it a little more real\nestate on our screen here, all right.\n\n525\n00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:52.170\nNow this is, I'm gonna show you\nanother reason why I love PowerShell.\n\n526\n00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.670\nBecause I could sit here,\nand I can tab through.\n\n527\n00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.810\nMake sure that I got that right,\nadd-vpn, there we go.\n\n528\n00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.720\nTrigger, that's not the one that you want.\n\n529\n00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.900\nLet me go ahead and, there we go.\n\n530\n00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.270\nTrigger application.\n\n531\n00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:08.870\nThere we go.\nSo,\n\n532\n00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.000\nI want you to remember,\nfor the exam, I know\n\n533\n00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.315\nthis is one that absolutely just rolls\nright off the tongue in the memory, right?\n\n534\n00:27:15.315 --> 00:27:20.130\nAdd-vpnConnectionTriggerApplication.\n\n535\n00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.000\nBoy, I tell you what, can't say that six,\nI can't even say it once,\n\n536\n00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.590\nlet alone six times.\n\n537\n00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:27.300\nNow here's what we're gonna do.\n\n538\n00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.690\nWe got a couple of different things,\nways that we can set this up.\n\n539\n00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.106\nYou have legacy applications and\nthen you have the more modern UI,\n\n540\n00:27:33.106 --> 00:27:36.652\nthat's what they called it in\nthe Windows 8.1 operating system.\n\n541\n00:27:36.652 --> 00:27:40.400\nToday, I think they're called UWAs,\nthe Universal Windows Application.\n\n542\n00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.740\nSo you got a couple of different\nways that you can do this.\n\n543\n00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:47.670\nIf you use a legacy app,\nyou can specify the name parameter\n\n544\n00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.270\nand then you just basically\npoint it to the application.\n\n545\n00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:55.111\nSo for instance, we can do C:\\.\n\n546\n00:27:55.111 --> 00:28:02.811\nI could do Windows\\system.32.\n\n547\n00:28:02.811 --> 00:28:07.290\nAll right, then we can do Notepad.\n\n548\n00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.040\nOops!\nBetter not Tab through that one or\n\n549\n00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:09.680\nit will take a while.\n\n550\n00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.660\nWe can do Notepad.exe.\n\n551\n00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.060\nAnd when I run this, and you know what,\n\n552\n00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.720\nI have to have an additional parameter,\nguys.\n\n553\n00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.450\nLet me go ahead.\n\n554\n00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:21.770\nI can see right away what I forgot.\n\n555\n00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:23.210\nNotice that I put the path.\n\n556\n00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.940\nThat path is actually supposed\nto be preceded by the parameter\n\n557\n00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.470\napplication identifier and\nthat's what I meant to put there.\n\n558\n00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:32.980\nThe application identifier can\nbe done in a couple of ways.\n\n559\n00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.100\nIf it's traditional\napplications like Notepad,\n\n560\n00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:39.210\nit's gonna be the path to the executable,\nso I wanna put application.\n\n561\n00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.930\nLet me back this out here and quit typing\nall over the place, that might help.\n\n562\n00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.140\nApplication ID, now that's what\nI wanted to run, all right?\n\n563\n00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:58.910\nAnd let me just make sure, oops,\nI could see errors all over the place.\n\n564\n00:28:58.910 --> 00:28:59.785\n>> Gotta type it right.\n\n565\n00:28:59.785 --> 00:29:01.910\nLet me show you what I did wrong.\n\n566\n00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:06.660\nThe name is supposed to be the name\nof what's known as the VPN profile.\n\n567\n00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.330\nThe VPN profile is that collection\nparameters that we talked about and\n\n568\n00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:16.050\nunfortunately I did not put the VPN so\nit doesn't know.\n\n569\n00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:20.500\nIt's saying hey, there's a profile\nhere that I need to apply this to,\n\n570\n00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.130\nand I can't find it.\n\n571\n00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.630\nAll right, so that worked.\n\n572\n00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.428\nThat's what we wanted.\n\n573\n00:29:27.428 --> 00:29:33.150\nRemember that it's name, the VPN profile\nand then it's the application identifier.\n\n574\n00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:36.630\nNow, it requires split tunneling to\nbe able to do this triggering, so\n\n575\n00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.309\nwe're gonna go ahead and say yes to this.\n\n576\n00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:40.950\nAnd like everything in PowerShell,\n\n577\n00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.900\nwhen you do it right,\nit doesn't tell you anything.\n\n578\n00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.400\nBoy, you get one parameter wrong and\n\n579\n00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.710\nyou got it painted red across the screen,\nall right?\n\n580\n00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.510\nSo what has that done for us?\n\n581\n00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.610\nWell, let's go ahead and show you.\n\n582\n00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.920\nWe're gonna go ahead and we'll use\nour Windows snap feature here, and\n\n583\n00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.050\nI'm gonna disconnect.\n\n584\n00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.250\nNotice, can you see that Mike,\nthat I'm not connected there?\n\n585\n00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:59.930\nI don't know if you can see that.\n\n586\n00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.070\nAll right, so we're disconnected.\n\n587\n00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.240\nI'm gonna go down to the PowerShell and\n\n588\n00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.110\nI'm just gonna fire up\nNotepad from the PowerShell.\n\n589\n00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.910\nAnd I don't know if you noticed that,\nbut notice we're connected.\n\n590\n00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:16.530\nNotice that the moment, and by the way\nit's not gonna let me disconnect it.\n\n591\n00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.920\nI'm gonna have to close down Notepad now.\n\n592\n00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.730\nCuz you've said Notepad,\nif it's open, fire up the VPN and\n\n593\n00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.000\nlet me connect into the internal network.\n\n594\n00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.920\nSo let's do that one more time.\n\n595\n00:30:28.114 --> 00:30:30.760\nWe gotta disconnect or\nthat's not gonna help you guys.\n\n596\n00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.790\n>> There we go.\n\n597\n00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.920\nNow, one more time,\nthird time's the charm.\n\n598\n00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.270\nAnd notice that it is connecting.\n\n599\n00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:39.500\nThat is what is known as\nan app triggered VPN.\n\n600\n00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.070\nThat was with a Legacy application.\n\n601\n00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:45.340\nThe other way that we can do this\nis with a more modern, again,\n\n602\n00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:49.470\nuniversal Windows applications is\nwhat I think they call them now.\n\n603\n00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:50.830\nNow this is a little bit different.\n\n604\n00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:52.710\nSo there's a couple of\noptions that you can add.\n\n605\n00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:56.280\nYou might say well, Wes, do you know these\nidentifiers off the top of your head?\n\n606\n00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.710\nAbsolutely not.\n\n607\n00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:58.570\nNot even close.\n\n608\n00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.340\nSo there's another commandlet\nthat I want you to know.\n\n609\n00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:07.950\nI can get them basically,\nI can get all of them for every single\n\n610\n00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:14.320\napplication on this machine if I just do\na Get AppxPackage and run this command.\n\n611\n00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.890\n>> All right, Mike,\nwhat was the second one in line?\n\n612\n00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:17.260\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n613\n00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.940\n>> Probably not, right.\n\n614\n00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.660\nSo what this does is it gives me\nthe ability that I can come through here,\n\n615\n00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:27.850\nand I could say okay,\nwhich one of these newer applications\n\n616\n00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:33.200\ndo I want to basically configure for\napplication triggering?\n\n617\n00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.140\nSo what I can do here is I can\nmake this a little bit easier and\n\n618\n00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:39.650\nI can say name, right?\n\n619\n00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:42.300\nAnd then I can do Microsoft.\n\n620\n00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:49.690\nLet's see if it will let me Tab,\nI don't know if it will let me Tab.\n\n621\n00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.654\nWindows Calculator.\n\n622\n00:31:57.977 --> 00:31:59.394\nActually, you know,\nit's kind of interesting.\n\n623\n00:31:59.394 --> 00:32:01.080\nI actually know this.\n\n624\n00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.680\nSo let me just scroll back up here, I've\ngot it written down in the background.\n\n625\n00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.012\nAll right, so calculator again\nalphabetically, I'm sure there's a way\n\n626\n00:32:10.012 --> 00:32:14.138\nthat you can alphabetize this but,\nunfortunately that would have been\n\n627\n00:32:14.138 --> 00:32:17.330\nthe easy way of doing this,\n>> We don't want to do that.\n\n628\n00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:18.310\n>> No, no definitely not.\n\n629\n00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:25.340\nSo you can see, notice this package\nfamily In the application identifier,\n\n630\n00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.770\nnotice we have the publisher ID as\nwell and then we have the family name.\n\n631\n00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:34.720\nIt's the family name that you're\ngonna actually use here, and\n\n632\n00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.650\nI tell you what.\n\n633\n00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:39.722\nGet dash app x.\n\n634\n00:32:39.722 --> 00:32:41.618\nI'm gonna see if I can\nfilter this real quick.\n\n635\n00:32:45.568 --> 00:32:51.082\nPackage name equals, I don't know\nif I'm gonna be able to filter,\n\n636\n00:32:51.082 --> 00:32:54.577\nthat's probably gonna do the same thing.\n\n637\n00:32:54.577 --> 00:32:55.695\nAnd the yep.\n\n638\n00:32:55.695 --> 00:32:57.975\nSo didn't catch that\none there either Mike?\n\n639\n00:32:57.975 --> 00:32:58.538\n>> I didnt not.\n\n640\n00:32:58.538 --> 00:32:59.125\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n641\n00:32:59.125 --> 00:32:59.628\n>> I was trying.\n>> Yeah.\n\n642\n00:32:59.628 --> 00:33:00.134\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n643\n00:33:00.134 --> 00:33:02.585\n>> So again you get the ability and\n\n644\n00:33:02.585 --> 00:33:06.985\nI could scroll back through here and\nI can find which\n\n645\n00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:11.685\napplication given the package\nfamily name I want.\n\n646\n00:33:11.685 --> 00:33:16.950\nIn fact I have the package name for\ninstance for the new Microsoft Calculator.\n\n647\n00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:18.300\nSo in that case,\n\n648\n00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:23.980\nI could rerun this commandlet that\nwe ran before to add the trigger.\n\n649\n00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.970\nAnd this time,\ninstead of doing application,\n\n650\n00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:31.660\nthe legacy application, path right?\n\n651\n00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.690\nPath the executable?\n\n652\n00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.070\nWhat I'm going to type and\nI'll just go ahead and\n\n653\n00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:37.080\ntype it out here guys, maybe it'll\nsave some time searching through that.\n\n654\n00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:43.367\nIt's Microsoft .windowscalculator,\n\n655\n00:33:43.367 --> 00:33:48.037\nand you'll see why it is better\n\n656\n00:33:48.037 --> 00:33:52.962\nto Use the search functionality because\n\n657\n00:33:52.962 --> 00:33:56.000\nyou can see that some of these\ndon't just roll off the tongue.\n\n658\n00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:03.410\nAll right, and with my impeccable\ntyping skills you are gonna see that\n\n659\n00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:07.030\nthis is going to hopefully\nwork the first time.\n\n660\n00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:10.402\nI wouldn't be surprised if I have to\ntype this a couple of times here.\n\n661\n00:34:10.402 --> 00:34:15.102\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, and we'll go ahead and\n\n662\n00:34:15.102 --> 00:34:18.500\nmake sure that I've got that and\nthat I don't have anything.\n\n663\n00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.960\nAll right, so,\nbasically you typed it right.\n\n664\n00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.610\nRemember, red is not good in PowerShell.\n\n665\n00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.580\nBut what I told it was\nthat package family name.\n\n666\n00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.480\nFor the newer apps,\nit's the package family name,\n\n667\n00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.900\nversus legacy apps which\nare the paths to the executables.\n\n668\n00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.020\nWe'll go ahead and say yes,\nand we'll run this.\n\n669\n00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.799\nNow, let's find out.\n\n670\n00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.710\n>> And I can close this down and\ndisconnect, all right.\n\n671\n00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.292\nAnd I'm gonna type calculator here and\n\n672\n00:34:47.292 --> 00:34:50.600\nnotice that we're gonna\nuse the new calculator and\n\n673\n00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.870\nwhen I fire this up, sure enough in the\nbackground it has triggered that VPN and\n\n674\n00:34:55.870 --> 00:35:00.120\nit says okay I see this application and\nnow I know you want to connect so\n\n675\n00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:04.310\nit's no different with your legacy apps\n>> You can also do this with a U,\n\n676\n00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:05.660\nW, A apps.\n\n677\n00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.420\nA couple more points I'd like to make they\ncall out on the exam, you can do things\n\n678\n00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.910\nlike VPN lockdown if you're using like\nthe System Center Configuration Manager.\n\n679\n00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:16.260\nYou can create a VPN profile and\nwhat it does is it says the user\n\n680\n00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:20.490\ncannot shut the VPN off,\nthey can't delete or modify the VPN.\n\n681\n00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.070\nIt's always gonna stay connected so\n\n682\n00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:27.410\nyou can really control the aspect through\nthe VPN, creating of the VPN profile.\n\n683\n00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:31.889\nThe other thing that you can do as well is\nyou can do what is known as VPN filters,\n\n684\n00:35:31.889 --> 00:35:34.270\nright, traffic filters.\n\n685\n00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:36.750\nYour traffic filters can\nbe a couple different ways.\n\n686\n00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.018\nThey can either be\napplication-based rules.\n\n687\n00:35:39.018 --> 00:35:42.950\nAnd the application-based rules,\nit just keeps a list of applications that\n\n688\n00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:47.060\nare the only applications that can\ncommunicate through the VPN tunnel.\n\n689\n00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.020\nThe other way that you can do\nthis is by traffic-based rules.\n\n690\n00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.330\nAnd these are three of the common ones\nthat sometimes we control, right?\n\n691\n00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:56.900\nThat's port-based,\naddress-based or protocol-based.\n\n692\n00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.020\nRight, so couple different\nways that you can do that too.\n\n693\n00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.640\nSo remember, lockdown VPN, also remember\ntraffic filtering that can be done through\n\n694\n00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:07.810\nthings like System Center Configuration\nManager to really control more granular\n\n695\n00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:13.010\nlevel what you can and can't do, or\nyour users, with your VPN communications.\n\n696\n00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:14.140\n>> Fantastic Wes.\n\n697\n00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.510\nAnother great episode there,\nsome great demonstrations.\n\n698\n00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:21.150\nAnd we started off kind of continuing\non from Part One with a look at some\n\n699\n00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:25.610\ncommand line utilities that we'd used\nto troubleshoot our wireless networks.\n\n700\n00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:27.010\nThen we moved into VPNs.\n\n701\n00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.280\nWe showed you how to\ncreate a simple VPN and\n\n702\n00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:34.380\nthen how to do an application triggered\nVPN which could be extremely useful.\n\n703\n00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:38.980\nEspecially with these modern applications\nthat maybe they rely on some data that\n\n704\n00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:43.180\nresides back on the corporate network, and\nwhen your user's outside of the network,\n\n705\n00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:47.000\nthe application can't get to the data,\nthe application is useless.\n\n706\n00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.600\nSo now, they can,\ninstead of having to train them,\n\n707\n00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.130\nfirst you're gonna have to create your\nVPN and make sure it's connected and\n\n708\n00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:56.330\nauthenticate, then you can\nlaunch your application.\n\n709\n00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:59.120\nYou know how many calls you're gonna get,\nI've launched the application and\n\n710\n00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.560\nI've got no data, what's going on?\n\n711\n00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:04.330\nWell now we can set it up to where when\nthey launch the application it triggers\n\n712\n00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:07.540\nthe VPN in the background, they don't\neven have to be concerned with it.\n\n713\n00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:10.930\nSo fantastic,\nappreciate those demonstrations there Wes,\n\n714\n00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:13.220\nhope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n715\n00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.490\nSigning off for ITPROTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n716\n00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:17.140\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n717\n00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.255\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n718\n00:37:19.822 --> 00:37:28.060\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

episode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.890\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick, and\ntoday we're doing our installing and\n\n5\n00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.530\nconfiguring Windows.\n\n6\n00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.830\nAnd specifically, in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.170\nwe're gonna be looking at\nconfiguring networking.\n\n8\n00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.450\nAll right, this is a part three.\n\n9\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.040\nWe've already covered a lot.\n\n10\n00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.740\nSo we're setting up our network TCP/IP\nsettings, taking a look at some of\n\n11\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.840\nthe utilities we can use to both\nconfigure and troubleshoot.\n\n12\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.607\nBut there is more that we need to discuss,\nand\n\n13\n00:00:36.607 --> 00:00:38.291\nhere to help us with that is Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n14\n00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:39.380\nHow you doing, Wes?\n\n15\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.000\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n16\n00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.230\nAs always great to be here\nwith the ITProTV crew.\n\n17\n00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.840\nThat's right,\nwe're coming back with a part three.\n\n18\n00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.110\nWe are working on a small novel here.\n\n19\n00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.080\nBut there are just a few more things\nthat we wanna go ahead and include so\n\n20\n00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.860\nyou'll be a little bit\nmore prepared on the test.\n\n21\n00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.990\nAnd what I'm talking about is\nsomething known as Direct Access.\n\n22\n00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.616\nNow, Direct Access is something\nthat's been in Windows,\n\n23\n00:00:56.616 --> 00:01:00.252\nI wanna say it started it back in Windows\n7, and it's a very beneficial, right?\n\n24\n00:01:00.252 --> 00:01:02.839\nWe've already talked about and\ndiscussed VPNs, right?\n\n25\n00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.760\nAnd VPN communication.\n\n26\n00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.060\nAnd with VPNs, right,\nthere is extra infrastructure that we need\n\n27\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.320\nif we're running a Microsoft\nenvironment or Windows environment,\n\n28\n00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.169\nwe're gonna need extra infrastructure\nin order to support VPNs.\n\n29\n00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:17.550\nNow, one of the things that also happens,\n\n30\n00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.790\nif you haven't seen our VPN episode there,\ngo back and watch it.\n\n31\n00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.970\nYou might remember one of the things that\nhappened when I connected to the VPN\n\n32\n00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.370\nis I lost Internet connectivity, right?\n\n33\n00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.150\nI've got one Internet adapter,\nbrings up the VPN, and I lose, well,\n\n34\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.950\nthe ability to connect to the Internet.\n\n35\n00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.240\nWell, the one good thing about\nDirect Access is the fact that\n\n36\n00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.980\nit's handled in the background.\n\n37\n00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.750\nFirst of all,\nit's integrated into Windows.\n\n38\n00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.620\nIf you have Enterprise level editions\nof Windows, if you already got Windows\n\n39\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.650\nservers within your networks, then you're\nalready supporting, you could support,\n\n40\n00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.240\nthis and maybe don't even know it.\n\n41\n00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.760\nThe other thing is, too, is that\nWindows handles this communication in\n\n42\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.920\nthe background, basically connecting\nin to the corporate resources, and\n\n43\n00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.090\nyou can go about your day to\nday browsing of the Internet.\n\n44\n00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.630\nYou still have Internet connectivity,\nand you don't get disconnected.\n\n45\n00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.870\nAgain, it's much like a VPN technology,\nbut\n\n46\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.135\nwe don't have to have all\nthe third party software.\n\n47\n00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:14.330\nSee, when you get different VPN platforms,\nmaybe you got different locations,\n\n48\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.900\ngeographically dispersed, and you bought\none VPN technology for one location,\n\n49\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.710\nand maybe as you expanded,\nyou had to buy a different technology.\n\n50\n00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.658\nOr maybe you bought the same technology,\nbut\n\n51\n00:02:23.658 --> 00:02:26.100\nthere's a lot of inconsistency\nin the configurations.\n\n52\n00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.890\nAnd the inconsistency is because different\nvendors do it a little bit different ways.\n\n53\n00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.610\nWith Windows, if you're implementing\nDirect Access, then you're\n\n54\n00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.140\npretty much gonna configure it most likely\nthe same through all of your environments.\n\n55\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.268\nSo, that's one of the good things for\nassistance administration, is you do\n\n56\n00:02:42.268 --> 00:02:47.080\nhave more of that unified implementation\nof this type of communication.\n\n57\n00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.930\nThe other benefit to\nDirect Access is the fact that,\n\n58\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.810\nnot only does it allow you to\nconnect a VPN technology, but\n\n59\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.710\nit allows you to take advantage\nof things like IPsec.\n\n60\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.060\nIPsec, the Internet protocol security\nsuite of technologies, if you will,\n\n61\n00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.190\nthat allow you to connect\nover a public network and\n\n62\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.600\nmaintain things like we talk about in\nour some of our security episodes.\n\n63\n00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.990\nThat's CIA triad, right?\n\n64\n00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.350\nConfidentiality, through\nthe encryption that you get.\n\n65\n00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.330\nIntegrity of your information, knowing\nthat because you're using IPsec between\n\n66\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.270\nthe two endpoints, we are validating the\ninformation that is moving between them.\n\n67\n00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.790\nAnd then also, you get the availability.\n\n68\n00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.280\nOne of the great things is almost\nconsistent with, for instance,\n\n69\n00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.540\nwhat we showed you in the prior episode\nto application triggering, all right?\n\n70\n00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.550\nMike and\nI showed you where you fire up Notepad, or\n\n71\n00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.640\nyou fire up something like\nthe Windows calculator.\n\n72\n00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.240\nThat application comes online and Windows\nrecognizes it as, well, hey, this needs to\n\n73\n00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.470\ngo over the VPN, and it needs to\ngo back into the internal network.\n\n74\n00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.197\nWell, that's all great.\n\n75\n00:03:43.197 --> 00:03:46.165\nBut the moment I did that I\nlost my Internet connectivity.\n\n76\n00:03:46.165 --> 00:03:49.170\nAnd if I had a couple of things open,\nmaybe I was doing some research.\n\n77\n00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.260\nWell, unfortunately, all those\nweb pages aren't any good for me.\n\n78\n00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.570\nBut now, if I need a resource that's on\nthe internal network, with Direct Access,\n\n79\n00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.080\nit's more transparent to me.\n\n80\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.160\nI can access it, and Windows handles the\ncommunication process in the background.\n\n81\n00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.820\nAnd, again, I get more of that\nconsistent user experience and\n\n82\n00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.370\nmore of a transparency.\n\n83\n00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.010\nWhen it's deployed from a systems\nadministration side of it,\n\n84\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.130\nwe don't have to worry about doing things\nlike the process of creating VPN profiles,\n\n85\n00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.500\nworrying about inconsistencies\nwith the VPN profiles.\n\n86\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.740\nAnd you have, honestly, you have\nprofile managers out there, right?\n\n87\n00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.415\nSystem center configuration manager.\n\n88\n00:04:23.415 --> 00:04:24.690\nYou got CIMA.\n\n89\n00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.290\nBut now, what we're talking about is\na second technology bringing in to\n\n90\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.060\ntry to maintain consistency\nthrough our VPNs.\n\n91\n00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.040\nThis is all something that's just\nbuilt right into Direct Access.\n\n92\n00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.490\n>> I will tell you,\nthat dealing with VPNs and end users,\n\n93\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.710\nyou can make it as simple as you want,\nand they're still gonna call the help\n\n94\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.660\ndesk because they can't just double-click\non that little, you can use the,\n\n95\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.820\nwhat was it the, gosh,\nthe VPN profile generator.\n\n96\n00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.430\n>> Yes,\nthe connection manager administration kit.\n\n97\n00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.280\n>> Yes.\n\n98\n00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.440\nYou could use that,\nmake this great little executable.\n\n99\n00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.720\nAll they do is double-click on it, and it\nwould create their profile for them, and\n\n100\n00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.820\nI still have people calling the help desk.\n\n101\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.390\nWith Direct Access,\nit's all done behind the scenes.\n\n102\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.620\nAll they do is log onto their computer,\n\n103\n00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.700\nwhich they'll probably call\nthe help desk for that.\n\n104\n00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.480\nBut at least we don't have\nto worry about the VPN,\n\n105\n00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.190\nor the-\n>> I've gotta throw a question back to how\n\n106\n00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.470\nwould you deploy that executable,\ntypically?\n\n107\n00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.750\n>> You would do it a couple of ways.\n\n108\n00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.420\nIf they were people that come in and\n\n109\n00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.690\nout of the network,\nyou'd make it available on a share.\n\n110\n00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.660\nYou could put it on a thumb drive.\n\n111\n00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.680\nYou could try to e-mail it to them,\nbut if it is an executable,\n\n112\n00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.170\nnow I've got to zip it up and try to\nkeep the mail servers from blocking it.\n\n113\n00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.123\n>> Could you potentially do it\nthrough group policy, as well?\n\n114\n00:05:30.123 --> 00:05:30.721\n>> You could.\n\n115\n00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:32.277\nNo, [CROSSTALK]\n>> Because it's an executable, right?\n\n116\n00:05:32.277 --> 00:05:33.753\nSo, it's an MSI file.\n\n117\n00:05:33.753 --> 00:05:34.884\nIt has to be group policy.\n\n118\n00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:38.380\nSo, you got some challenges\nin deploying that technology.\n\n119\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.000\nAnd speaking of group policy,\nwith VPN communications you might think,\n\n120\n00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.240\nwell, I've got a connection into the\nresource, why can't the domain controller,\n\n121\n00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.660\nI just do a GP update and\nupdate group policies through the VPN?\n\n122\n00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.730\nWell, you lose that ability.\n\n123\n00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.240\nNow, you have, through Direct Access, you\nstill have the ability as an administrator\n\n124\n00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.770\nto reach through the Direct Access\ntunnel and manage those endpoints.\n\n125\n00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.280\nSo, that's another one of those\nadvantages of Direct Access.\n\n126\n00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.450\nCouple of things, and I'm sure I've\nalready said it, but just a recap.\n\n127\n00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.040\nMake sure that you do have the Windows 10\nEnterprise Edition in order to support\n\n128\n00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.380\nDirect Access.\n\n129\n00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.850\nLet's go ahead, and\nI'll tell you what, we'll dive in and\n\n130\n00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.110\nwe'll look at a couple of the components\nhere that we need to talk about.\n\n131\n00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.890\nWell, we've got two different\ntypes of clients, and\n\n132\n00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.360\nwe'll talk about these clients coming up.\n\n133\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.970\nWe have our Internet facing clients, and\n\n134\n00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.790\nwe also have our internal\ncorporate clients as well.\n\n135\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.170\nAnd the way they discover, they go through\na process to figure out which one,\n\n136\n00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.670\nwhich side of the river,\nthey're actually on.\n\n137\n00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.240\nThe next thing that we have\nis our Direct Access server.\n\n138\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.515\nOur Direct Access server is one\nof our edge servers, if you will.\n\n139\n00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:41.580\nSitting on the edge of\nour corporate network.\n\n140\n00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.400\nIt is a multi-honed server, if you will.\n\n141\n00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.700\nIt has an Internet base,\nor facing, interface.\n\n142\n00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.920\nInterfacing, facing, interface,\nwe'll get that right.\n\n143\n00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.270\nWe'll make our own contributions here.\n\n144\n00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.760\nSo, we got two network adapters.\n\n145\n00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.360\nOne facing the Internet, and\nonce facing the corporate network.\n\n146\n00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.340\nAnd it handles the communication\nbetween your internal resources.\n\n147\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.520\nNow, the other thing we're gonna have you,\ntypically, have your internal DNS server,\n\n148\n00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.050\nright, on your corporate network.\n\n149\n00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.850\nAnd that comes into play for our Internet\nclients as well as our intranet clients.\n\n150\n00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.010\nAnd we'll talk more about that coming up.\n\n151\n00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.450\nAnd then, we have this NLS,\n\n152\n00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.160\nthe NLS server,\nthe Network Location Server server.\n\n153\n00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.860\nA little redundant there.\n\n154\n00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.850\nAnd basically, guys, all this really is,\nis this is a server that is, really, just\n\n155\n00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:29.070\na web application server, and it's got\nan SSL certificate that is assigned to it.\n\n156\n00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.090\nAnd we'll go into a little\nbit more of that process.\n\n157\n00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.200\nBut keep in mind, it helps the clients\nto determine which side of\n\n158\n00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.410\nthe network connection are they on.\n\n159\n00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.300\nAgain, corporate versus the Internet.\n\n160\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.560\nResources, guys.\n\n161\n00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.620\nI lump these all together.\n\n162\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.080\nIt's a very generic diagram here,\ncould be a web application server.\n\n163\n00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.570\nIt could be file server, if you will.\n\n164\n00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.520\nIt just depends on what kind of resources\ninside of your internal network\n\n165\n00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.870\nthat you're trying to gain access to.\n\n166\n00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:01.150\nNow, so these components collectively\nmake up our Direct Access solution.\n\n167\n00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.940\nI will tell you one\nserver that is missing.\n\n168\n00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:09.252\nAnd Mike, being our active directory guru,\nI'm surprised you didn't catch it.\n\n169\n00:08:09.252 --> 00:08:10.078\n>> I wasn't gonna say anything.\n\n170\n00:08:10.078 --> 00:08:11.232\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, okay.\n\n171\n00:08:11.232 --> 00:08:13.380\nSo, he's letting me off the hook, here.\n\n172\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.099\nNeeds to be an Active Directory server, so\n\n173\n00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:18.300\nwe have to make sure we understand that\nthis is controlled by Active Directory,\n\n174\n00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.300\nand it's deployed through\nActive Directory.\n\n175\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.630\nSo, in fairness, and\nmake sure that we're complete here,\n\n176\n00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.440\nthere should probably be another\nlittle server in here called a domain\n\n177\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.840\ncontroller that controls most of\nthe authentication process for us.\n\n178\n00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.900\nSo, do keep that in mind.\n\n179\n00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.100\nIt is missing from the slide here.\n\n180\n00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.253\nAll right, so\nlet's go through the process here.\n\n181\n00:08:37.253 --> 00:08:41.815\nWhen it comes to determining whether you\nare, as far as client computer, I say you,\n\n182\n00:08:41.815 --> 00:08:43.248\nbut the computer itself.\n\n183\n00:08:43.248 --> 00:08:47.120\nDetermine whether it's on\nthe internal network, the intranet,\n\n184\n00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.280\nyour corporate network, or\nwhether it's on the Internet.\n\n185\n00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.933\nMake sure I get that one right.\n\n186\n00:08:51.933 --> 00:08:54.405\nSo, one of the first things\nthat it does is it tries,\n\n187\n00:08:54.405 --> 00:08:57.460\nremember we talked briefly about\nthe network location server.\n\n188\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.782\nThe network location server,\njust like the name implies, and\n\n189\n00:09:01.782 --> 00:09:03.210\nremember it on the exam, right?\n\n190\n00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:08.080\nThe network location server is\nwhat clients utilize to figure out\n\n191\n00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.200\nam I under the corporate network or\nam I on the Internet?\n\n192\n00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.010\nAgain, keep in mind,\njust a web server with an SSL certificate.\n\n193\n00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.240\nFirst thing it's gonna do, your client,\n\n194\n00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.560\nis it's gonna try to contact\nyour internal DNS server.\n\n195\n00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.410\nAnd it's gonna say, hey, do you have the\nIP address to the server I'm looking for?\n\n196\n00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.190\nTypical DNS name resolution process.\n\n197\n00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.550\nAnd your DNS servers can\nreturn the response.\n\n198\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.810\nOnce it knows where that NLS server is,\nit then locates it, all right.\n\n199\n00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:41.040\nIt essentially sends an HTTPS\ncommunication over to the NLS server,\n\n200\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.070\nand because it can contact the NLS server,\n\n201\n00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.590\nit says,\nI've gotta be on the Intranet, right?\n\n202\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.970\nSo then,\nit doesn't need to use Direct Access.\n\n203\n00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.740\nIt works like any of your\nother internal clients, right?\n\n204\n00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.810\nIt says, okay, I don't need Direct Access,\nI'm already here, so\n\n205\n00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.690\nI can just go ahead and use DNS,\n\n206\n00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.280\nfind out where that resource is inside\nof the network, and I can connect to it.\n\n207\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.980\nAgain, provided that you have\nthe authorization to do so.\n\n208\n00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.820\nYou don't negate permissions here in ACLs,\nbut if you've got the permissions for\n\n209\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.520\nthe resource, you can access it.\n\n210\n00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.100\nSo, again, the big component\nto take away from this is,\n\n211\n00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:23.160\nkeep in mind that that NLS\nserver really is important.\n\n212\n00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:29.453\nNow, I used the NLSlab.itpro.tv, okay?\n\n213\n00:10:29.453 --> 00:10:33.430\nIf you wanna remember it on the exam,\n\n214\n00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.620\nthis is one of those things that's\ngonna change in the answer.\n\n215\n00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.400\nJust remember,\nNLS dot your domain dot com, all right?\n\n216\n00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.250\nAnd that's essentially the web address, if\nyou will, the URL it's gonna look to, and\n\n217\n00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.429\nit's gonna try to contact it.\n\n218\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.040\nNow, the next thing we have\nare Internet clients, and\n\n219\n00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.420\nthis is a little bit different here.\n\n220\n00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.420\nThis is, what they're gonna do here\nis they're gonna use something called\n\n221\n00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.250\nthe Name Resolution Policy Table.\n\n222\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.790\nAnd it's gonna modify the default\nnature of a DNS query, right?\n\n223\n00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.670\nIf we take the NLS, or\nexcuse me, not the NLS, but\n\n224\n00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:11.230\nthe NRPT, out of it, right,\nthe policy table, right, what happens?\n\n225\n00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:15.680\nYour operating system generates a DNS\nquery, it looks at the interface, the IP\n\n226\n00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.920\naddress of your TCP/IP properties, and\nit says, there's the IP address of the DNS\n\n227\n00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.570\nserver, and it fires off a request to\nlocate resources on the Internet, right?\n\n228\n00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.990\nSo, for the most part,\nthat doesn't really change.\n\n229\n00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:30.980\nBut the process changes a little bit with\nthe name resolution policy table that's\n\n230\n00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.250\nimplemented back to\ngroup policy over here.\n\n231\n00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.520\nMike's kinda laughing at me.\n\n232\n00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.550\nBack to group policy.\n\n233\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.070\nWhen you deploy Direct Access, it\ncreates two new GPOs that aren't in your\n\n234\n00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.800\ngroup policy management console\nuntil you implement Direct Access.\n\n235\n00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.290\nYou've got one for the client, and\nyou've got one for the server.\n\n236\n00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.830\nThe one for the client adds\nthe name resolution policy table.\n\n237\n00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:55.820\nAnd what the name resolution policy table,\nwhat it's gonna do, is it's gonna say,\n\n238\n00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.300\nit's gonna put in a,\nit's gonna alter it, right?\n\n239\n00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.370\nIt's gonna put a namespace in that\nname resolution policy table.\n\n240\n00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.910\nAnd it says, if you're looking for\n\n241\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:11.040\na resource that ends in dot\nyour domain dot com, then what\n\n242\n00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.570\nI want you to do is I want you to contact\nthe internal DNS server, all right?\n\n243\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:22.960\nNow, the next thing it has, and it was an\nexemption for the NLS server, all right?\n\n244\n00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.750\nIt says, if you're looking for\n\n245\n00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.640\nthe NLS server,\nI want you to use your ISP's DNS server.\n\n246\n00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.180\nNow, you might say, well,\nwhy would I wanna do that?\n\n247\n00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.220\nWell, remember, if we can resolve\nwhere that NLS server is,\n\n248\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.380\nand talk to it, your client says,\nI'm on the internal network.\n\n249\n00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.560\nDirect Access closes down,\nnothing else happens, and it's\n\n250\n00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.730\nexpecting to talk to DNS and resolve the\nresource names on your internal network.\n\n251\n00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:51.860\nBecause you put an exemption here, and\nyou're saying if you're looking for\n\n252\n00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:57.060\nNLS server,\nI don't want you to use the namespace.\n\n253\n00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.235\nI want you to use your normal DNS\nsettings on your TCP/IP properties or\n\n254\n00:13:01.235 --> 00:13:04.235\nyour network adapter, and\nyou try to resolve it.\n\n255\n00:13:04.235 --> 00:13:07.860\nNow, your ISP is not, doesn't have\nan A record or any kind of host record for\n\n256\n00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.900\nyour internal NLS server.\n\n257\n00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:15.990\nAnd because it can't resolve it,\nit says, I must be on the Internet.\n\n258\n00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.405\nAll right, so what happens from there?\n\n259\n00:13:19.309 --> 00:13:22.530\nIt ends up building two tunnels, right?\n\n260\n00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.840\nTwo IPsec tunnels.\n\n261\n00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.700\nYou might say, well,\nwhere do the IPsec tunnels come in?\n\n262\n00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.870\nIn part of deploying\nDirect Access to your clients,\n\n263\n00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.950\nthe group policy will configure\nconnection security rules inside of your\n\n264\n00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.960\nWindows firewall that will tell\nit to build these tunnels.\n\n265\n00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.830\nThe first tunnel that it's gonna do,\nremember, we're looking for\n\n266\n00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.680\na resource inside of the internal network,\nright?\n\n267\n00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.690\nThe Intranet.\n\n268\n00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:48.200\nSo it's gonna build up what's known as an\ninfrastructure tunnel, and that's gonna be\n\n269\n00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.940\nbetween the, both end points,\nthe client and the direct access server.\n\n270\n00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.030\nAnd in that case,\n\n271\n00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:57.370\nit can locate the resource that's\ninside of the internal network.\n\n272\n00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:02.020\nAnd then, when it's time to communicate,\nyou also have the intranet tunnel.\n\n273\n00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.710\nAnd the intranet tunnel is\nwhere you get the ability to\n\n274\n00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.090\ncommunicate with the resource back and\nforth.\n\n275\n00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.550\nSo, keep in mind that the NRPT is\n\n276\n00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.040\nsomething that's deployed\nthrough group policy.\n\n277\n00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.950\nIt alters the way we normally implement,\nor\n\n278\n00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.220\nthe computer,\nnormally implements DNS, right?\n\n279\n00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.390\nIt's what's gonna help you to locate\nnot only the resources on your internal\n\n280\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:28.560\nnetwork, provided that it has that\nnamespace entry in the policy table.\n\n281\n00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.040\nBut then,\nit's also gonna have an exemption for\n\n282\n00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.035\nthe NLS server that says go out and\ncheck your ISP's DNS server.\n\n283\n00:14:35.035 --> 00:14:37.840\nAnd when you can't resolve it,\nthat's what helps to turn around and\n\n284\n00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.140\nlook at these connection's security rules,\nbuild up that first infrastructure tunnel\n\n285\n00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.100\nso that you can communicate\nthrough the Direct Access server\n\n286\n00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.740\ninto your internal DNS server,\nessentially locating your resources.\n\n287\n00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.360\nAnd once you've done that,\nyou establish the second tunnel.\n\n288\n00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.740\nAnd your internet tunnel allows\nyou to communicate back and\n\n289\n00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.910\nforth with those resources.\n\n290\n00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.630\nNow, one of the great things is even\nthough we're talking about all this,\n\n291\n00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:00.910\nwe didn't have to do anything, right?\n\n292\n00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.530\nSo, close to the app-triggering VPN,\nright?\n\n293\n00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.230\nWe had to set it up, and don't get me\nwrong, you have to set this up, too.\n\n294\n00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:12.820\nBut I had to mark specific applications\nto basically trigger the VPN.\n\n295\n00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.300\nIf you set up Direct Access, and\nit realizes that it's a resources on\n\n296\n00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.360\nthe internal network,\nit's not based on a specific application,\n\n297\n00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.320\njust the resources on your internal\nnetwork, it fires this up and\n\n298\n00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.370\nit keeps it connected so that you\ncan maintain a secure communication.\n\n299\n00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:27.720\nOne of the last things I'll mention is,\n\n300\n00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.870\nkeep in mind that you're using\nthat IPSec encryption so\n\n301\n00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.130\nyou get that confidentiality,\nthe integrity, the availability,\n\n302\n00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:38.870\nall over your public Internet, which\nessentially keeps your documentation safe.\n\n303\n00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.030\n>> Fantastic, Wes.\n\n304\n00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.780\nLove it, I love Direct Access.\n\n305\n00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.630\nBig fan of it.\n\n306\n00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.000\nGood job explaining it,\nshowing us how it works.\n\n307\n00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.460\nIt's a really cool technology.\n\n308\n00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.600\nAppreciate that.\n\n309\n00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.460\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n310\n00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.440\nSinging off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.217 --> 00:00:17.822\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:17.822 --> 00:00:21.920\nin today's episode we are continuing\non more of our Windows 10 series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.800\nAnd joining us back in the studio the man,\nthe myth,\n\n6\n00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.270\nthe legend that knows\nall things Window 10.\n\n7\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.839\nOur good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.915\nWes welcome back sir, we're so\nglad to have you today.\n\n9\n00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:31.197\n>> Thanks for having me here.\n\n10\n00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.981\nThat's right moving along in\nthat 7698 exam and today,\n\n11\n00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:37.710\nwhat we're gonna be looking at in\nthis episode is configuring storage.\n\n12\n00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.250\nIt is something that they've called out\nin just about any client exam that you\n\n13\n00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.900\nwill probably take inside\na Windows operating system cuz\n\n14\n00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.942\nit is some things that you have to know.\n\n15\n00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:51.820\nWe're gonna rely today heavily on\ncommand line because we want you\n\n16\n00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.751\nto be aware of almost ,we\ncan't say every question.\n\n17\n00:00:55.751 --> 00:00:59.055\nBut a good majority of percentage of the\nquestions that they might give you when it\n\n18\n00:00:59.055 --> 00:01:00.840\ncomes to configuring storage.\n\n19\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.452\nNow I can tell you right now that yes,\n\n20\n00:01:02.452 --> 00:01:04.747\nwe could do this from\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n21\n00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:08.391\nAnd I'll kinda go off the beaten path\nthere Dan, and I'll bring up disk\n\n22\n00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:12.890\nmanagement and the graphical user\ninterface interchangeably a little bit.\n\n23\n00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.757\nFor the most part we're gonna stay\ndown there in the command prompt and\n\n24\n00:01:15.757 --> 00:01:17.611\nwe'll go into the GUI just a little bit,\nso.\n\n25\n00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:21.100\n>> Is that where they typically test you\non is in the command prompt nowadays?\n\n26\n00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.866\n>> They do, and I'll give you an example.\n\n27\n00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:27.296\nThere are some situations or\nscenarios that I've been in.\n\n28\n00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:32.437\nWell yeah, they've asked you about\nthe graphical user interface, and they'll\n\n29\n00:01:32.437 --> 00:01:37.517\nsay for instance, what are the utilities\nyou can use to do certain xyz scenario.\n\n30\n00:01:37.517 --> 00:01:39.669\nAnd you'll have to know disk management,\ndiskpart,\n\n31\n00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:42.240\nwhich is what we're gonna look at today,\nand even PowerShell.\n\n32\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.390\nThey might give you a little bit\nof an exhibit, where you have to\n\n33\n00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.383\nview something and you have to say, where\nwould you click to do a certain thing?\n\n34\n00:01:49.383 --> 00:01:53.693\nSo you'll see for instance when we get\nlater in this episode when we get into for\n\n35\n00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:57.810\ninstance creating dynamic disk simple\nvolume and stripes, and expand and\n\n36\n00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.260\nwe'll [LAUGH] explain\nall of that coming up.\n\n37\n00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.920\nWe will use disk management for that so\nyou are gonna see it coming up but largely\n\n38\n00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.850\nspeaking I would know this commands\nbecause if you think about it Dan.\n\n39\n00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.508\nIf you're heavily in the graphical user\ninterface and you're commonly using that.\n\n40\n00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:13.290\nYeah, you're gonna do good with\na couple of the questions.\n\n41\n00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.950\nBut how do you get the commands\nright if they ask you?\n\n42\n00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.963\nAnd that's why we wanna make\nsure that you're prepared for\n\n43\n00:02:18.963 --> 00:02:22.950\nboth sides of the tracks, whichever side\nof the river you may currently be on.\n\n44\n00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.182\nSo let's go ahead and\ndive right in and we're gonna talk and\n\n45\n00:02:27.182 --> 00:02:30.326\nshow you how to start, creating your disk.\n\n46\n00:02:30.326 --> 00:02:32.240\nWe're gonna do this with virtual disks.\n\n47\n00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.995\nUnderstand that a virtual disk is\na single file that encompasses\n\n48\n00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:39.116\nall basic disk operations.\n\n49\n00:02:39.116 --> 00:02:42.774\nSo it will serve the purposes for\nwhat you need to do.\n\n50\n00:02:42.774 --> 00:02:46.342\nAnd this is great because this is\nsomething that you can practice on\n\n51\n00:02:46.342 --> 00:02:48.837\nyour own machine if you\nunderstand diskpart.\n\n52\n00:02:48.837 --> 00:02:51.881\nAnd you can sit here and\npractice all these commands by yourself\n\n53\n00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:55.284\non your own Windows 10 machine or\non Windows 10 lab environments.\n\n54\n00:02:55.284 --> 00:02:58.990\nSo let's go ahead and dive right in,\nlet's go right to my machine here.\n\n55\n00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.760\nI've got a PowerShell open.\n\n56\n00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.100\nI want you to know that this is\na program diskpart that runs diskpart.\n\n57\n00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.280\nRuns in command prompt, it runs in\nPowerShell because when you run it,\n\n58\n00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.260\nit's actually running in executable\nthat's in the background.\n\n59\n00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.250\nSo don't worry about being tied\ndown to any one command line.\n\n60\n00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.930\nYou say well,\nI don't really know PowerShell too well.\n\n61\n00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.145\nThat's okay, because when I run\ndiskpart inside Power Shell,\n\n62\n00:03:25.145 --> 00:03:28.537\ntakes me right in the diskpart software.\n\n63\n00:03:28.537 --> 00:03:32.820\nIf I exit out this, and\nwe switch over to command line.\n\n64\n00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.810\nNow we're in command line,\n\n65\n00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.020\nnotice that clear doesn't work,\nsince it's not a command.\n\n66\n00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.080\nBut CLS does so\nwe are in command prompt and\n\n67\n00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.620\nI run diskpart,\ntakes me back to the same interface.\n\n68\n00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.062\nSo don't get really tripped up on\ncommand prompt versus PowerShell,\n\n69\n00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:53.520\ncuz this is it's own separate utility\nthat really runs independent.\n\n70\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.594\nWe just have a graphical user\ninterface and in this case,\n\n71\n00:03:56.594 --> 00:03:59.426\nwe have a command line\ninterpreter we can work with.\n\n72\n00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:05.165\nSo let me go ahead and just for\nmy own OCD, let me exit out.\n\n73\n00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:06.183\nEven though I say hey,\n\n74\n00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:09.516\nwe can't do this in PowerShell I'm\ngonna get back to PowerShell anyway.\n\n75\n00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:14.133\nAnd it's just because I like to stay\nin the PowerShell because we can do all\n\n76\n00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:14.737\nof them.\n\n77\n00:04:14.737 --> 00:04:15.640\nSo what have we gotta do?\n\n78\n00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.160\nWell the first thing that we're gonna do\nis we're gonna show you how to manage\n\n79\n00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.120\na couple of your virtual disks and\nthat'll set the stage for\n\n80\n00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.260\nsome of the other things that we're\ngonna get to as we go through this.\n\n81\n00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.830\nSo the first thing that we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna go ahead and\n\n82\n00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.360\nwe're gonna create a virtual disk,\nand we're gonna start to work with it.\n\n83\n00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.110\nSo when we do this, remember that\non the exam the paths might change.\n\n84\n00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.798\nCuz it's gonna be unique to your scenario,\nyour environment or in this case,\n\n85\n00:04:42.798 --> 00:04:46.007\nthe scenario that the exam\nquestion's looking for.\n\n86\n00:04:46.007 --> 00:04:50.177\nUnderstand, I wouldn't focus too\nmuch on the paths themselves,\n\n87\n00:04:50.177 --> 00:04:53.006\nas I would focus on things\nlike the command and\n\n88\n00:04:53.006 --> 00:04:58.740\nthe parameters associated the surrounding\nthe location where we store these files.\n\n89\n00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.984\nSo for instance,\nwe're gonna do a create, and\n\n90\n00:05:02.984 --> 00:05:08.408\nthis is gonna be create vdisk oops,\ntry that again, vdisk.\n\n91\n00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:12.657\nAnd then what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna say file=, and here's where again,\n\n92\n00:05:12.657 --> 00:05:16.070\nit's gonna vary a little bit from\nmaybe what your environment is.\n\n93\n00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.420\nWe're gonna say file= and\nwe'll just say test01.vhdx.\n\n94\n00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.571\nA couple of different virtual hard\ndisk files that you can create.\n\n95\n00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:28.680\nThe older ones vhd does have\nsome of the limitations.\n\n96\n00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.102\nThe newer one that we have here that we're\ngonna use from Windows 10 is vhdx and\n\n97\n00:05:33.102 --> 00:05:36.285\nhas a lot more benefits than\nthe traditional vhd format.\n\n98\n00:05:36.285 --> 00:05:40.915\nWe're gonna say, what the file is but\nthen we have to tell it that it's gonna be\n\n99\n00:05:40.915 --> 00:05:45.774\na maximum and what we're doing here is\nwe're giving it its size limitation here.\n\n100\n00:05:45.774 --> 00:05:49.614\nWe're gonna say 40, 96.\n\n101\n00:05:49.614 --> 00:05:50.148\nI'll tell you what?\n\n102\n00:05:50.148 --> 00:05:51.218\nWe'll make these a little bit smaller.\n\n103\n00:05:51.218 --> 00:05:56.172\nWe'll do 20 or 20,000 I should say, 480.\n\n104\n00:05:56.172 --> 00:05:59.153\nAnd then we have to tell at the type\ncouple different types of virtual\n\n105\n00:05:59.153 --> 00:06:00.211\ndisk that you can make.\n\n106\n00:06:00.211 --> 00:06:05.054\nA fixed disk type that says that if I give\nit 40 gigs or in this case if I give it\n\n107\n00:06:05.054 --> 00:06:10.165\n20 gigs, it allocates all of that space\nright away to the virtual hard drive.\n\n108\n00:06:10.165 --> 00:06:13.247\nIn this case we're not gonna use that\ncause we are in a lab environment.\n\n109\n00:06:13.247 --> 00:06:16.895\nAnd a lab environment the ones that\nare really beneficial is what's known as\n\n110\n00:06:16.895 --> 00:06:17.580\nexpandable.\n\n111\n00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.864\nThat in the command prompt,\n\n112\n00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:26.143\nsays expandable in the graphical user\ninterface when you're making a selection.\n\n113\n00:06:26.143 --> 00:06:30.839\nIt's actually what's known as a dynamic\ndisk, virtual disk type, which means\n\n114\n00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:35.671\neven though it's 20 gigs, it's only gonna\nallocate what I take up at the time and\n\n115\n00:06:35.671 --> 00:06:38.180\nit's gonna grow to a maximum of 20 gigs.\n\n116\n00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.960\nSo we're gonna go ahead and use that.\n\n117\n00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.258\nLet's see what I did.\n\n118\n00:06:42.258 --> 00:06:43.378\nAnd there we go.\n\n119\n00:06:43.378 --> 00:06:45.942\nLet me show you a typo that I made.\n\n120\n00:06:45.942 --> 00:06:48.081\nAnd when I do this a lot here Dan,\n\n121\n00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:52.447\nwhen you're working with deployment\nimage servicing manager,\n\n122\n00:06:52.447 --> 00:06:57.230\ndeployment image servicing manager\nlike for files like that, :c:.\n\n123\n00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.339\nWhile when you're diskpart here, it just\nlike file= and then you tell it to pass.\n\n124\n00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:04.880\nSo that's what happened and\nyou could see that it's now complete.\n\n125\n00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.670\nSo now that we created our virtual\nhard disk, if we look down and see,\n\n126\n00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.550\nin fact we could do this\nin command prompt too.\n\n127\n00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:16.240\nBut if I drop down to c: here, just to\nshow you the graphical user interface.\n\n128\n00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.770\nI now have this test01 and\nyou can see it is a hard disk image file.\n\n129\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.070\nAnd even though I said it's gonna be 20\ngigs notice what it's taking up there.\n\n130\n00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.146\nDan it's only taking up what?\n\n131\n00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:30.445\n4 megs, it is not taking up that much,\nso that means.\n\n132\n00:07:30.445 --> 00:07:31.586\n>> It is smaller than 20 gigs.\n\n133\n00:07:31.586 --> 00:07:33.075\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That is right.\n\n134\n00:07:33.075 --> 00:07:37.605\nSo it is gonna grow over time\nto a maximum of 20 gigs.\n\n135\n00:07:39.235 --> 00:07:43.440\nSo that's got a virtual hard\ndrive ready to work with, but\n\n136\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.090\nwe still need a couple of\nthings that we need to do.\n\n137\n00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:45.876\nWe need to attach it,\n\n138\n00:07:45.876 --> 00:07:48.641\nessentially attaching in this mounting\nthe disk to be able to work with it.\n\n139\n00:07:48.641 --> 00:07:54.237\nSo to do that, we're gonna do a select,\nspace and it's gonna be vdisk.\n\n140\n00:07:54.237 --> 00:08:00.768\nAll right, and then we're gonna do a file,\nand this time I'll remember file=,\n\n141\n00:08:00.768 --> 00:08:05.501\ncuz we're not in\nthe Deployment Image Servicing Manager,\n\n142\n00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:08.840\nand we are going to select it, all right.\n\n143\n00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.830\nNotice that it does say that it is\nselected, now we need to attach it.\n\n144\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.920\nIt's kind of interesting these steps,\nwe created it, can't work with it.\n\n145\n00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.250\nWe select it, can't work with it.\n\n146\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.100\nWe attach it, now we can work with it.\n\n147\n00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.870\nNow why do I make mention of that?\n\n148\n00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.480\nThat might be a multipart\nanswer on the exam.\n\n149\n00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.420\nWhen they ask you choose which steps\napply, you need to maybe do a drag and\n\n150\n00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.010\ndrop and\nthey will want to know these steps.\n\n151\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:37.360\nSo let's go ahead and say,\nattach vdisk and now it is attached.\n\n152\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.290\nSo now at this point what\nI have the ability to do,\n\n153\n00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.980\nis I have the ability to\nstart working with this disk.\n\n154\n00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.450\nNow, let's go ahead and\ndo the next option.\n\n155\n00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:50.400\nLet's do a list disk, and I can see\n\n156\n00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.290\nthat disk 3 in this case is the virtual\ndisk that we're looking for, right.\n\n157\n00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.790\nBecause I created it and I selected it, it\nputs me right there and I can tell by this\n\n158\n00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:06.170\nlittle asterisk symbol that it is selected\nand I have the appropriate disk selected.\n\n159\n00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.658\nI would tell you, Dan, that list disk\ncommand has helped me more times-\n\n160\n00:09:09.658 --> 00:09:10.359\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n161\n00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:11.760\n>> Than I can tell you in\n\n162\n00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.389\nformatting the wrong disk or\nhelping me to avoid that, all right.\n\n163\n00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:20.322\nSo now we're ready to create\nsome partitions, right.\n\n164\n00:09:20.322 --> 00:09:23.623\nOne of the things that you need to\ndo in storage is you need to create\n\n165\n00:09:23.623 --> 00:09:26.458\na structure in order to store\nthe information, right.\n\n166\n00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:27.923\nSo the first thing that we do,\n\n167\n00:09:27.923 --> 00:09:31.280\nis we start out by creating what\nare known as primary partitions.\n\n168\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.100\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n169\n00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.505\nA couple of different ways\nthat you can do that.\n\n170\n00:09:33.505 --> 00:09:40.715\nYou can use abbreviations,\nI can do create part prime, right.\n\n171\n00:09:40.715 --> 00:09:44.038\nDisk part accepts abbreviations.\n\n172\n00:09:44.038 --> 00:09:47.368\nBut what I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo is I want you to know what it is,\n\n173\n00:09:47.368 --> 00:09:49.425\nI'm gonna create partition primary.\n\n174\n00:09:49.425 --> 00:09:53.161\nAll right, now I'm gonna give\nit a size limitation here and\n\n175\n00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:58.170\nI'm gonna say size= and these are just\ngonna be very little partitions just for\n\n176\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.580\nthe purposes of demonstration here.\n\n177\n00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.820\nSo I'm gonna say size= and\nwe'll just do 1024, all right.\n\n178\n00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.350\nSo now I got a partition and\nwith this disk selected,\n\n179\n00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.550\nif I wanna find out the partitions we do,\nwell just list partition.\n\n180\n00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.610\nYou can also do a list part on this one is\nanother one that accepts abbreviations.\n\n181\n00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.030\nNotice we got a primary partition.\n\n182\n00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:22.788\nWell, that partition is kind of like\na file cabinet where you've now\n\n183\n00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:24.172\nslid the drawer in.\n\n184\n00:10:24.172 --> 00:10:27.910\nBut if you think about it, I can't really\nuse the drawer in that filing cabinet\n\n185\n00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.608\nuntil I start putting rails on it and\n\n186\n00:10:29.608 --> 00:10:33.240\nI give it some kind of structure\nthat I can now put folders in.\n\n187\n00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.900\nWell, that's the next part\nof using your storage.\n\n188\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.040\nWe're gonna do a format option, right.\n\n189\n00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:44.950\nWe're gonna say format, we're gonna say,\nfile system= or fs=ntfs, all right.\n\n190\n00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:49.565\nI'm gonna put a label on this, and\nI'm gonna just call it prime1, just so\n\n191\n00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:54.053\nwe can keep track of these, all right,\nand I'm gonna do a quick format.\n\n192\n00:10:54.053 --> 00:10:57.234\n>> All right, so\nnow it's formatted, right.\n\n193\n00:10:57.234 --> 00:11:00.052\nThe next thing I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna go ahead,\n\n194\n00:11:00.052 --> 00:11:02.696\nI'm gonna assign it a volume letter,\nall right.\n\n195\n00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:04.690\nSo we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n196\n00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.014\nAnd there's a couple of different\nways that you can do this.\n\n197\n00:11:06.014 --> 00:11:11.489\nI could do the assign option,\njust say assign, and what it would if I\n\n198\n00:11:11.489 --> 00:11:16.770\ndo a list vol you can see that it\nwould take this volume and send C and\n\n199\n00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:23.303\nD, D more specifically is the last letter\nthat has been assigned to the volumes,\n\n200\n00:11:23.303 --> 00:11:29.677\nwhich is in this case is the optical drive\nit's going to assign me the letter E.\n\n201\n00:11:29.677 --> 00:11:31.850\nAll right, so let's go ahead and see that.\n\n202\n00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:37.137\nNow I can control this and I want you\nto know that by putting in letter= and\n\n203\n00:11:37.137 --> 00:11:39.484\nI can put the letter that I want.\n\n204\n00:11:39.484 --> 00:11:45.374\nBut I'll show you here if I just do\nassign it does give me a mounting point,\n\n205\n00:11:45.374 --> 00:11:49.980\nand if I rerun my list vol I\ncan now see that we have, what?\n\n206\n00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.620\nOne primary, and in this case I\nmarked it so we can keep track of it.\n\n207\n00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.132\nI've got a Volume now, it's got an NTFS.\n\n208\n00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:59.851\nIn this case, we named it primary so\nwe can keep one, it's got a label now.\n\n209\n00:11:59.851 --> 00:12:04.170\nSo that's prim1, that's first\nprimary partition we've created, so\n\n210\n00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.361\nnot too difficult.\n\n211\n00:12:05.361 --> 00:12:07.460\nLet's go ahead and\ndo that again, all right.\n\n212\n00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.970\nWe're gonna go ahead, and we're gonna\ncreate another primary partition.\n\n213\n00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.800\nNotice that I don't have to tell it,\nif I know the disk is selected, and\n\n214\n00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.780\nI do a create again,\nit just creates another one.\n\n215\n00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.100\nRight now, we've slid in another\nfile into the filing cabinet within\n\n216\n00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.570\nour storage device, right, but\nnow we need to prep it again.\n\n217\n00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.588\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll rerun our format option and\n\n218\n00:12:29.588 --> 00:12:32.079\nI'm gonna name this just prim2.\n\n219\n00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:36.439\nWe'll do a quick format and then we'll\ndo assign, all right, but this time,\n\n220\n00:12:36.439 --> 00:12:40.110\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna assign it a letter purposely.\n\n221\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.296\nNow, I'm gonna assign with\nthe next sequential letter, but\n\n222\n00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:46.614\nI'm gonna show you that you that\nyou can control it, all right.\n\n223\n00:12:46.614 --> 00:12:49.558\nSo we're gonna do assign, then we'll\ndo letter= in this case F, all right.\n\n224\n00:12:49.558 --> 00:12:53.797\nAnd if I wanna make sure that it did that,\nI could see that by doing the list ball\n\n225\n00:12:53.797 --> 00:12:58.695\noption, well, we now have two primary\npartitions, right, so it's not too bad.\n\n226\n00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:01.438\nAnd I can go through here and\nI could create a few of them, right.\n\n227\n00:13:01.438 --> 00:13:06.055\nThere's another one, right,\nwe could do the format option, and\n\n228\n00:13:06.055 --> 00:13:08.617\nI can do prim3, all right, quick.\n\n229\n00:13:08.617 --> 00:13:15.760\nIt's formatted, assigned,\nwe got another one.\n\n230\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.260\nWe do our list vol.\n\n231\n00:13:19.057 --> 00:13:24.530\nNow we see we've got E, F and\nG, 1, 2, 3 primaries, right.\n\n232\n00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.590\nAnd again if I wanna keep\ncreating primary partitions,\n\n233\n00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.180\nwe'll just keep repeating the process,\nright.\n\n234\n00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.303\nThis time I'm gonna say that was prim3,\nthis will be prim4.\n\n235\n00:13:34.303 --> 00:13:37.817\nWe'll go ahead, we'll format it now.\n\n236\n00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:40.878\nIt is formatted, sorry about that.\n\n237\n00:13:40.878 --> 00:13:42.280\nGetting ahead of myself here.\n\n238\n00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:48.560\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and we'll do\nthe assign option and again list vol.\n\n239\n00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.684\nSo Dan,\nnow I have four primary partitions, right.\n\n240\n00:13:50.684 --> 00:13:54.340\nSo we can keep partitioning this drive.\n\n241\n00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:59.250\nIn fact, let's go ahead and\nwe'll do it one more time, or not.\n\n242\n00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.368\nWell, wait a second, what happened here?\n\n243\n00:14:00.368 --> 00:14:03.411\nAll right, no free usable content.\n\n244\n00:14:03.411 --> 00:14:08.457\nWell that's a 20 gig hard drive and\nthese are 1 gig partitions, 4 gigs.\n\n245\n00:14:08.457 --> 00:14:11.412\nMy math isn't that great but\nI know that's not,\n\n246\n00:14:11.412 --> 00:14:14.161\nthe fact that there's unusable free space.\n\n247\n00:14:14.161 --> 00:14:16.945\n>> Your math ain't that great,\nbut if I'm not mistaken,\n\n248\n00:14:16.945 --> 00:14:18.968\nI've been around the block a few times.\n\n249\n00:14:18.968 --> 00:14:23.339\nInside of your system here, you only\nhave the ability to create 4 primary\n\n250\n00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:28.015\npartitions, if I'm correct and\nyou're running up against that wall.\n\n251\n00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:30.621\n>> Very good, Dan, [LAUGH] smart guy.\n\n252\n00:14:30.621 --> 00:14:32.064\n>> I know a thing or two.\n\n253\n00:14:32.064 --> 00:14:32.627\n>> That's right.\n\n254\n00:14:32.627 --> 00:14:33.464\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n255\n00:14:33.464 --> 00:14:36.805\nwhat Dan's talking about is a limitation\nthat's been around for a while.\n\n256\n00:14:36.805 --> 00:14:41.083\nAnd it's a limitation more not so much on\nthe hard drives cuz you guys probably know\n\n257\n00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:43.630\nwe have up to 4, 8,\n8 terabyte drives today.\n\n258\n00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:48.730\nThe limitation stems from the 1983\nrelease of the boot record known\n\n259\n00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.100\nas master boot record, MBR, right.\n\n260\n00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.670\nMaster boot record does have a limitation,\nthe limitation is just like Dan said,\n\n261\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.320\nwell, it can only have\n4 primary partitions.\n\n262\n00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.840\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n263\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.380\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nstart over, all the way over.\n\n264\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.870\nI'm gonna show you how\nto clean this drive and\n\n265\n00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.270\nwe're gonna start back\nat the beginning and\n\n266\n00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.222\nsee if there's a way that\nwe can get around this.\n\n267\n00:15:08.222 --> 00:15:10.840\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n268\n00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.020\nhere's where the list disk option\ncomes in handy, watch this.\n\n269\n00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.620\nBecause If I clean the wrong hard drive,\nwe might have a bad day at the office.\n\n270\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.797\nSo I can see that the drive that I started\nwith is still the one that's selected.\n\n271\n00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:25.359\n>> Yeah, the wrong drive would be\na TV timeout, I'm pretty sure.\n\n272\n00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:26.215\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes,\n\n273\n00:15:26.215 --> 00:15:28.241\nit would definitely be a TV timeout,\nand an airball-\n\n274\n00:15:28.241 --> 00:15:28.756\n>> Yeah.\n\n275\n00:15:28.756 --> 00:15:29.976\n[LAUGH]\n>> On camera.\n\n276\n00:15:29.976 --> 00:15:32.690\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll hit clean.\n\n277\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.163\nAll right, if I do a list part, no\npartitions, well, you got the right disk?\n\n278\n00:15:37.163 --> 00:15:39.500\nI don't know, let's find out.\n\n279\n00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.560\nList disk and yes, I do, all right.\n\n280\n00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.646\nSo let me show you a way that\nyou can get around this.\n\n281\n00:15:44.646 --> 00:15:47.872\nNow I'm gonna re-run some of\nthese commands, all right, so\n\n282\n00:15:47.872 --> 00:15:50.054\nI'm gonna do create partition primary.\n\n283\n00:15:50.054 --> 00:15:53.758\nAll right, we'll do that,\nthere's that first primary partition.\n\n284\n00:15:53.758 --> 00:15:57.078\nRight and we'll scroll back here and\nwe'll do prime 1.\n\n285\n00:15:57.078 --> 00:15:59.450\nRight we're just kind\nof starting over here.\n\n286\n00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:05.770\nAnd now that that's done we've got it\nformatted and if we do a list val.\n\n287\n00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.155\nMake sure that we're\nkeeping track of this.\n\n288\n00:16:10.155 --> 00:16:11.000\nWe've got a prime one.\n\n289\n00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.770\nWe don't have a drive letter or sign.\n\n290\n00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.260\nSo I could do, if I wanted to,\na sign and now it's there.\n\n291\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.270\nRight, we're starting back\nover just like we did before.\n\n292\n00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.410\nNow I could create another\nprimary partition.\n\n293\n00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.560\nWe'll do the format here as well.\n\n294\n00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.954\nWe'll call this Prime 2.\n\n295\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:35.670\nAll right,\nwe're gonna rerun the assign option here.\n\n296\n00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.970\nAll right, I'm gonna do this one\nmore time guys, just follow with me.\n\n297\n00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:41.960\nRemember where we're at.\n\n298\n00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.090\nIt's gonna be prime 3, right?\n\n299\n00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.410\nWe'll do a quick format.\n\n300\n00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.240\nYou know what?\n\n301\n00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.620\nGetting ahead of myself, why don't\nwe create a primary partition here.\n\n302\n00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.399\nNow we'll format it.\n\n303\n00:16:57.098 --> 00:16:58.540\nAnd we'll call this 3.\n\n304\n00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.240\nAnd then we'll do a list val.\n\n305\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:08.935\nAll right, so I've got EF and prime 3 if\nwe do an assign and we do a list val.\n\n306\n00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.310\nNow I've got my 3 primary partitions.\n\n307\n00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:15.240\nAll right?\n\n308\n00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.240\nNow, here's where it changes.\n\n309\n00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:21.132\nThis is a little hack of the MBR,\nif you will,\n\n310\n00:17:21.132 --> 00:17:26.210\nthat they implemented to try to get\naround the four partition limitation.\n\n311\n00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.650\nSo let's show you how you\ncan kind of bypass that.\n\n312\n00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.540\nIf I do a create, now I'm gonna change\nthe command up here, I'm gonna do create\n\n313\n00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:40.350\npartition extended, all right.\n\n314\n00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.960\nAnd I'm gonna say, just leave it at that.\n\n315\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.070\nWe'll create an extended partition with\nthe rest of the drive space, all right?\n\n316\n00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:56.120\nNow if I do a list part, notice I have\nthree primaries and I have an extended.\n\n317\n00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.700\nSo at this point four primaries\nis the limitation right?\n\n318\n00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:07.650\nNow, let's go ahead, now that we got\nthat partition, let's go ahead and\n\n319\n00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:14.340\nwe will do a format of that partition.\n\n320\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.900\nAll right and we're gonna call this EX,\n\n321\n00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:22.850\nI'm gonna do extend one\ncuz if I do EXT one,\n\n322\n00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.700\nI know Dan knows Linux, he'd be like\nthat's the file system of Linux man.\n\n323\n00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.680\nQuit that.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n324\n00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.360\n>> So we'll go ahead\n\n325\n00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.650\nwe'll\n>> We gotta-\n\n326\n00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.800\n>> I just think you're right,\n\n327\n00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.349\nyou should do that.\n\n328\n00:18:31.349 --> 00:18:32.900\n[LAUGH].\n>> [LAUGH] That's right, all right.\n\n329\n00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.330\nLet me see.\nNo volume, gotta select the volume,\n\n330\n00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.840\nso here we go.\n\n331\n00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:42.640\nList val, all right, and you know what?\n\n332\n00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.350\nWe created the partition but\nwe haven't created the volume.\n\n333\n00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:49.500\nAnd here's where now that we've\ngot that extended partition,\n\n334\n00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.510\nwe're gonna start dividing\nthat up even more.\n\n335\n00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.670\nLet's show you what you\nwould do here in that case.\n\n336\n00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:58.050\nYou'd do a create, all right, partition.\n\n337\n00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.110\nSo it's interesting that we're\nstill saying partition but\n\n338\n00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.350\nwe're gonna say logical.\n\n339\n00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:12.160\nCreate partition logical, and I'll even do\nhere size equals and we'll do 10 24 again.\n\n340\n00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.660\nAlright, so wait a second here.\n\n341\n00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.240\nThat's what happened.\n\n342\n00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:22.220\nIf we do a format and\n\n343\n00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:28.500\nlet's see if we can do this format,\nextend, we'll call it logical, logic1.\n\n344\n00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.980\nAll right and we'll go ahead and run this.\n\n345\n00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.630\nNow and we'll do an assign.\n\n346\n00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.810\nAll right, we got to have a mounting\npoint to be able to work with it and\n\n347\n00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:38.350\nwe'll do list vol.\n\n348\n00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:44.740\nAll right, now, I've got primary partition\n1, prime 1, 2, 3 and I've got logical 1.\n\n349\n00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.870\nLast demonstration,\n\n350\n00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.650\nthat should be it, we shouldn't be\nable to do anything more, right?\n\n351\n00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.440\nWell let's find out, all right?\n\n352\n00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.180\nNow I'm gonna do create partition\nlogical and it succeeds.\n\n353\n00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.860\nAnd we'll do the same thing, we'll\nformat it but I'll call this extend two.\n\n354\n00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.940\n>> And this is all because we're not\nusing a primary type of partition.\n\n355\n00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.660\n>> That's right.\n>> We're using\n\n356\n00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.940\nan extended type of partition.\n\n357\n00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.680\n>> This, yeah, and under the hood,\nit was called, for\n\n358\n00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:13.010\nthe BIOS hack,\na master extended partition, right?\n\n359\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.110\nSo, let's see.\n\n360\n00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:16.070\nExtended two, we've got that.\n\n361\n00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.090\nI called it extended two.\n\n362\n00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.830\nLet me format that and\nchange that just a little bit.\n\n363\n00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.510\nBecause we want to keep track\nof where we're adding logic to.\n\n364\n00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.600\nThere we go.\n\n365\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.720\nAnd assign.\n\n366\n00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.240\nAnd we do our list val, all right?\n\n367\n00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.860\nNow you can see I have what?\n\n368\n00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.740\nOne, two, three, four, five, why?\n\n369\n00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.080\nBecause inside of that extended partition,\n\n370\n00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.578\n16 gigs of it if we back out\nhere we'll see with a list part,\n\n371\n00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:49.560\nthe 16 gigs of that partition,\n\n372\n00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:55.750\ncan now be divided up into what\nare known as logical partitions.\n\n373\n00:20:55.750 --> 00:21:00.080\nNow, I got a diagram here, let's\nkinda see what's going on, all right?\n\n374\n00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:05.750\nIf these are,\nlet's say primary partitions, all right?\n\n375\n00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.413\nIf they are primaries.\n\n376\n00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:17.780\nAll right,\nwe have that limit of how many, right?\n\n377\n00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:22.290\nWe said, I'm gonna do that\na little bit different there.\n\n378\n00:21:25.533 --> 00:21:30.240\nTell you what, for Wes's typing abilities,\nwe had, what, one?\n\n379\n00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.570\nWe add one partition and\nby default that is C;, right?\n\n380\n00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.330\nThat was the first one.\n\n381\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:41.410\nThe next one that we have, we created and\n\n382\n00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.550\nthat one wasn't necessarily a partition,\nremember.\n\n383\n00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:50.050\nThe next letter was actually the D drive.\n\n384\n00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:51.870\nThat's an optical drive,\nwe don't worry about that one.\n\n385\n00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.350\nSo that the next letter after\nthat we did was E, right?\n\n386\n00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:56.960\nSo that's our second one.\n\n387\n00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.070\nThen we did a third one.\n\n388\n00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:06.640\nThat was E, F and then we did\na fourth one and that was G, right?\n\n389\n00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.040\nThese primary partitions,\nthat's all we get.\n\n390\n00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.270\nAll right, so what did we do here?\n\n391\n00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:17.850\nWell, this last one, remember that\nwe made it an extended partition,\n\n392\n00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:22.040\nand the extended partition allows\nme to do something like this.\n\n393\n00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.890\nOnce I create the extended\npartition I can now\n\n394\n00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:35.040\ntake this last remaining space and I can\ndivide it up the way I want, alright?\n\n395\n00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:41.140\nSo in this case what would have been\nthe letter G is now an extended partition.\n\n396\n00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:45.650\nI can start to divide this\nup any way that I see fit\n\n397\n00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:49.190\nprovided that I still\nhave remaining space.\n\n398\n00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:54.040\nAnd that's what we were essentially doing\nand this is the little hack that they did\n\n399\n00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.040\nwhen it came to trying to get around\nthe four primary partition limit.\n\n400\n00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.830\nRight?\nSo, in this case, G\n\n401\n00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.110\nis not the whole entire\npartition because it's extended.\n\n402\n00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:18.994\nWe're basically dividing up the remaining\nspace into these logical volumes.\n\n403\n00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.900\nAnd we can divide it up as\nlong as we have space and\n\n404\n00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.190\nas long as we have drive letters, alright?\n\n405\n00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:30.900\nSo that's kind of what was going\non in the background, alright?\n\n406\n00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:37.165\nNow that is on what's known inside\nof Windows as a Basic disc, alright?\n\n407\n00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:41.978\nBasic discs have that primary\npartition limitation that\n\n408\n00:23:41.978 --> 00:23:44.992\nyou have to worry about, alright?\n\n409\n00:23:44.992 --> 00:23:47.295\nNow, there are ways.\n\n410\n00:23:47.295 --> 00:23:48.892\nThat you can get around this.\n\n411\n00:23:48.892 --> 00:23:53.458\nThe way that Microsoft implemented\ngetting around this for\n\n412\n00:23:53.458 --> 00:23:59.050\nprimary partition was through\nsomething known as dynamic disks.\n\n413\n00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:01.350\nNow, there's another way\nthat you can do this, too.\n\n414\n00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:06.179\nYou can this and what is known as GTP.\n\n415\n00:24:06.179 --> 00:24:11.528\nGTP is, if you will a firmware,\na boot record that's directly tied to\n\n416\n00:24:11.528 --> 00:24:17.622\nthe unified extensible firmware interface\nthat gets completely around that.\n\n417\n00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:22.304\nGTP partitions allow you, they say\nan unlimited amount of partitions but\n\n418\n00:24:22.304 --> 00:24:25.500\nin Windows they implemented\n128 partitions.\n\n419\n00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:30.010\nMBR has a total volume size or\ndrive size limit of 2 terabytes,\n\n420\n00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.860\na little over 2 terabytes but 2 terabytes.\n\n421\n00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:37.160\nThe other thing that it includes now when\na Master Boot Record gets corrupted,\n\n422\n00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.320\nthe whole entire system freezes and\nit can't boot.\n\n423\n00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.540\nYou guys maybe seen some boot errors?\n\n424\n00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.494\nWell, GPT actually has\nwhat's known as a CRC value,\n\n425\n00:24:45.494 --> 00:24:50.155\na Cyclic Redundancy Check in it that says,\nhey, we're gonna check the integrity of\n\n426\n00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:54.647\nthe boot record and if it's failed,\nif it's been corrupted, well guess what?\n\n427\n00:24:54.647 --> 00:24:57.240\nOther volumes have that GPT, too.\n\n428\n00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.980\nSo because of that we can read off\nof the other one that's uncorrupted,\n\n429\n00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.640\nstill boot the system and GPT can be\nrebuild by the one that isn't corrupted.\n\n430\n00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.590\nSo it's kinda cool,\nit's got some built in tolerance.\n\n431\n00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:14.640\nNow, there are some limits for boot drives\nwhen it comes to be using this GPT format.\n\n432\n00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.520\nOnly 64 bit implementations of\nWindows can use GPT as a boot drive.\n\n433\n00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.373\nIt's just a limitation.\n\n434\n00:25:21.373 --> 00:25:24.196\nGoing all the way back to Windows 7 and\nup,\n\n435\n00:25:24.196 --> 00:25:27.500\nall of those editions can\nuse them as data drives.\n\n436\n00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.660\nThere's not a limitation there.\n\n437\n00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.130\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n438\n00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.760\nBasic disks, and\nwe're gonna show you this coming up,\n\n439\n00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.950\nbasic disks have to be set to GPT and\nthen converted to Dynamic if you\n\n440\n00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:47.310\nwanna follow the Dynamic disk format, and\nwe wanna show you a little bit about that.\n\n441\n00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:54.580\nDynamic disks inside of Windows allow\nyou a benefit that basic disks don't.\n\n442\n00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.210\nAnd what that means is a Dynamic\ndisk essentially can be\n\n443\n00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:03.890\nspanned across multiple drives,\nyour container doesn't\n\n444\n00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:08.470\nhave to be just within a single\npartition on a single disk.\n\n445\n00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.700\nAnd that is some of the benefits\nof the Dynamic disk.\n\n446\n00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.290\nYou say, well,\nhow do I know if I have a Dynamic disk?\n\n447\n00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:19.602\nWell, here back to disk part,\nif I do a list disk,\n\n448\n00:26:19.602 --> 00:26:23.284\nyou'll see this option here Dyn.\n\n449\n00:26:23.284 --> 00:26:27.400\nThat's not dine out or\nanything like that, I was going to joke,\n\n450\n00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.670\ndidn't have one there.\n\n451\n00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:34.780\nThis is dynamic and if it's isn't\nselected, you don't have a dynamic disk.\n\n452\n00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:40.668\nLet me take a second here and\ndrop you down to Disk Management.\n\n453\n00:26:40.668 --> 00:26:43.130\nNow, I don't wanna initialize\nthese disks right there.\n\n454\n00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:44.090\nThey're not online.\n\n455\n00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:48.177\nThey're asking me, at this point,\nin the graphical user interface,\n\n456\n00:26:48.177 --> 00:26:50.504\ndo I wanna pick the MBR format or the GPT?\n\n457\n00:26:50.504 --> 00:26:52.080\nI don't really wanna do that.\n\n458\n00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.470\nYou could do that from disk management\nhere if you want and you guys can see it.\n\n459\n00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.160\nAll it is is clicking OK.\n\n460\n00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.292\nKnow that for the exam.\n\n461\n00:26:59.292 --> 00:27:01.720\nWe wanna show you how to do\nit in the command prompt,\n\n462\n00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.350\nthrough disk part in case they ask you.\n\n463\n00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:06.940\nSo I'm just gonna for now,\nI'm not gonna worry about those disks.\n\n464\n00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.570\nI'm not gonna initialize them.\n\n465\n00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.950\nI can see right here the Disk 0 says basic\nand if I look down here in this part,\n\n466\n00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:17.590\nI could see that the Dyn which stands for\ndynamic,\n\n467\n00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:21.140\nit doesn't have an asterisk in it, so it\nlets me know that it isn't a dynamic file.\n\n468\n00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:25.700\nNow, I will tell you for the purposes of\nyour lab when you're testing this out,\n\n469\n00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.705\nyou cannot convert virtual\nhard disk to dynamic drives.\n\n470\n00:27:30.705 --> 00:27:34.680\nThey're only supported on basic disks,\nso that is a limitation.\n\n471\n00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.590\nBut I do have another hard\ndrive ready to go here.\n\n472\n00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:44.563\nSo let's go ahead and show you what\nwould happen if you need to convert\n\n473\n00:27:44.563 --> 00:27:48.789\na basic disk to a dynamic disk\nin order to get the benefits.\n\n474\n00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:54.354\nEnsure that you don't have any data on\nit when you're prepping your machine.\n\n475\n00:27:54.354 --> 00:27:56.860\nSo let's go ahead, we'll back out of here.\n\n476\n00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:01.159\nWe get out of the disk management,\nwe'll drop back down to the command line,\n\n477\n00:28:01.159 --> 00:28:04.268\nand we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna select disk,\n\n478\n00:28:04.268 --> 00:28:08.985\nnotice that I'm using the abbreviation\nsel disk 1, we'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n479\n00:28:08.985 --> 00:28:13.745\nI always do the list disk to ensure\nthat I'm working with the right hard\n\n480\n00:28:13.745 --> 00:28:16.336\ndrive here, or the disk in this case.\n\n481\n00:28:16.336 --> 00:28:19.568\nAnd let's say that we'll go ahead and\n\n482\n00:28:19.568 --> 00:28:25.325\nwe'll do create partition primary,\nand I'm not gonna put a size,\n\n483\n00:28:25.325 --> 00:28:31.390\nand if I do that that means it takes\nup the one single massive partition.\n\n484\n00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:37.400\nAnd if I do list disk,\nI still don't see anything.\n\n485\n00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.290\nSo let's go ahead, and let's do a format.\n\n486\n00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.770\nWe'll just keep in line\nwith what we've been doing.\n\n487\n00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.277\nAnd we'll do ntfs space, and\n\n488\n00:28:47.277 --> 00:28:53.323\nI'll put label =basic and\nthen we'll do a quick.\n\n489\n00:28:53.323 --> 00:28:54.700\nWe're gonna do our assign.\n\n490\n00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.555\nIn this case, I'll go ahead, and\n\n491\n00:28:57.555 --> 00:29:02.700\nI'll just get the next sequential\nletter here, in this case it's J, and\n\n492\n00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:07.490\nif we do a list vol, I can now see that\nI have that basic volume right there.\n\n493\n00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:13.578\nThat's essentially inside for just\nidentification purposes to this disk here.\n\n494\n00:29:13.578 --> 00:29:19.070\nNow, if I want to convert the disk,\nfirst, make sure that it's selected.\n\n495\n00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:22.570\nThe little asterisk symbol lets\nme know that it is selected.\n\n496\n00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:31.126\nAnd the next thing that I'll do is\nI'll do convert and we'll do dynamic.\n\n497\n00:29:34.326 --> 00:29:35.330\nNot that bad.\n\n498\n00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:36.927\nPretty simple, pretty simple.\n\n499\n00:29:36.927 --> 00:29:42.895\nAnd if I do a list disk now, notice that\nwe still have the asterisk symbol or\n\n500\n00:29:42.895 --> 00:29:46.765\nwe have the asterisk\nsymbol now next to disk 1.\n\n501\n00:29:46.765 --> 00:29:51.087\nAnd that's a way that you can take\na basic disk that doesn't have some of\n\n502\n00:29:51.087 --> 00:29:55.699\nthe advantages that we're gonna show you,\ncoming up, like for instance,\n\n503\n00:29:55.699 --> 00:29:58.210\ncreating these dynamic volumes.\n\n504\n00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:03.900\nNow, when it applies to basic disks and\ndynamic disks, here's another limitation.\n\n505\n00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.140\nWe're gonna also show you storage spaces,\nbut storage spaces, kinda interesting,\n\n506\n00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.820\nonly works on basic disks.\n\n507\n00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.690\nAnd that's why we wanna kinda get\nthese squared away for the exam,\n\n508\n00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.710\njust in case they try\nto trick you up there.\n\n509\n00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.199\nNow, Dan,\nwe still got some more to go through, but\n\n510\n00:30:17.199 --> 00:30:20.610\nI know that we're probably coming\nto the end of this episode, right?\n\n511\n00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:23.401\n>> Yeah, we're a little pressed for\ntime as far as we have none left.\n\n512\n00:30:23.401 --> 00:30:28.009\nSo there that is, that will bring us into\na part two because you're totally correct,\n\n513\n00:30:28.009 --> 00:30:31.465\nthere's tons of stuff to learn when\nit comes on down to how to work\n\n514\n00:30:31.465 --> 00:30:34.153\nwith partitions, and\ndifferent types of disks,\n\n515\n00:30:34.153 --> 00:30:37.385\ninside of your Windows\n10 operating system.\n\n516\n00:30:37.385 --> 00:30:41.735\nGreat job so far, Wes, with the\nexplanations, it's very straightforward.\n\n517\n00:30:41.735 --> 00:30:43.710\nYou just have to learn some commands.\n\n518\n00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:46.890\nAnd a little bit of order of operations.\n\n519\n00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:48.400\nAnd then you can get into that.\n\n520\n00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.290\nObviously, the graphic user interphase\na whole lot simpler than using\n\n521\n00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:55.180\nthe command line but\nyou're gonna need to know that as well\n\n522\n00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:59.430\nbecause there will be times in life and in\nthe exam when they're gonna call that out.\n\n523\n00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.170\nSo we gotta have you prepared for that.\n\n524\n00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:04.580\nThat being said, Wes, let's go ahead and\nshut this monkey down.\n\n525\n00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.490\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n526\n00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:08.390\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n527\n00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:10.020\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n528\n00:31:10.020 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:17.200\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.040\nIn today's episode we are continuing\non with more Windows 10.\n\n5\n00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.760\nAnd joining me back in studio again for\n\n6\n00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.580\na part two on configuring storage\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.460\nWes welcome back, sir, glad to have you.\n\n8\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.130\nHow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.400\n>> Man, it's going all right.\n\n10\n00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.500\nAnd that's right, this is a part\ntwo,as we continue through our 7698.\n\n11\n00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.020\nNow in the first part remember\nwhat we kinda went through.\n\n12\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.520\nWe went through basic partitions, some\nof the benefits of the basic partitions.\n\n13\n00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.940\nActually I don't really know if there's a\nbasic benefit to those partitions anymore.\n\n14\n00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.890\nBut we also talked about\ndynamic volumes and\n\n15\n00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.990\nsome of the benefits between the NBR and\nthe GPT, the GUI partition.\n\n16\n00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.550\nNow one of the last things we showed you,\nwe left you with another cliff hanger.\n\n17\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.790\nWe showed you how to take a basic disk and\nconvert it to a dynamic disk.\n\n18\n00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.150\nNow I wanna get back to the convert\ncommand because one of the things I\n\n19\n00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.900\ndidn't do, and I told Dan this.\n\n20\n00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.280\nI was like, I meant to do this and\nI didn't put it in the last episode,\n\n21\n00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.210\nwas convert an NBR-based disk to GPT and\nshow you what that looks like.\n\n22\n00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.940\nNow lets go ahead and I'll tell you what,\nwe'll dive right in and\n\n23\n00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.080\nI've got the interface.\n\n24\n00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.850\nWe're already in disk\npart by the way guys.\n\n25\n00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.270\nAnd if you remember from the last video,\n\n26\n00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.510\nif any of this sounds foreign\nto you just go back and\n\n27\n00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.305\nwatch that first video and then come\nback here and we'll see you soon.\n\n28\n00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:33.725\nAll right, now, the next thing you'll see,\nremember in the last one,\n\n29\n00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:39.255\nwe converted this Disk 2 here\nto a dynamic disk, all right?\n\n30\n00:01:39.255 --> 00:01:42.160\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do.\n\n31\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.100\nIs we're gonna convert this dynamic\ndisk now from the NBR to the GPT, right?\n\n32\n00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.330\nNotice that there isn't, there's a lack\nof an asterisk symbol next to GPT.\n\n33\n00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.620\nSo let's go ahead and convert this.\n\n34\n00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.620\nNow, we're gonna do the same thing.\n\n35\n00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.930\nWe're gonna do the convert command.\n\n36\n00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.209\nAll right, we're gonna do convert.\n\n37\n00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.930\nMaking sure that it's selected,\nthat's one thing to keep in mind,\n\n38\n00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.010\nremember the asterisk symbol\nis also next to Disk 2,\n\n39\n00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.280\nwhich is the one that\nwe're going to modify.\n\n40\n00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.080\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna do a convert to GPT.\n\n41\n00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.070\nAnd notice that I get this error,\nnotice what it says.\n\n42\n00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.610\nIn this case it is\nthe Virtual Disk Service Error,\n\n43\n00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.680\nbecause we're working with VDISKs,\nthat we showed you how to create as well.\n\n44\n00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.580\nAll right, so what's the problem here?\n\n45\n00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.390\nI want you to remember this for the exam.\n\n46\n00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.330\nThere's an order of operations in order\nto manipulate the type of partition or\n\n47\n00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.210\nthe partition style you're using.\n\n48\n00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.950\nAll right?\n\n49\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.970\nI can't change the disk to dynamic and\n\n50\n00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.940\nthen modify in any way\nthe partitioning scheme.\n\n51\n00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.190\nOkay, so, let me show you what we're\ngoing to have to do to solve this.\n\n52\n00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.570\nAnd I only harp on this because this\nmight be something in the exam that\n\n53\n00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.600\nyou get like a two part question there and\nyou have to maybe even drag and drop.\n\n54\n00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.670\nSo watch what we have to do.\n\n55\n00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.140\nNotice we got the error trying to convert\nit from an MBR based disk to GPT.\n\n56\n00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.400\nSo what do we have to do?\n\n57\n00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.850\nWell, we have to kind of back out and\nstart over again.\n\n58\n00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.850\nWhat I'm going to go ahead and\ndo is I'm gonna convert this.\n\n59\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.830\nAnd you can also see converting\nit back to basic, too.\n\n60\n00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.130\nI'm gonna convert this back to basic.\n\n61\n00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.090\nAll right.\nNotice that didn't give me a hard time.\n\n62\n00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.530\nAnd if we do the list disk option notice\nthat were starting over from square one.\n\n63\n00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.010\nRight we don't have Disk 2.\n\n64\n00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.990\nDoesn't have any asterisks next to it.\n\n65\n00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.520\nIf you are gonna change the partitioning\nscheme, change it first.\n\n66\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.180\nAll right so let me show you what I mean.\n\n67\n00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.590\nIf now I do a convert gpt,\nnotice it finishes successfully.\n\n68\n00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.500\nIf I do a list disk again, now I've\ngot my little asterisk next to gpt.\n\n69\n00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.830\nIt's GUI Partition Table,\nnow we can start to take advantage of all\n\n70\n00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.450\nthe benefits that GPT gives us.\n\n71\n00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.790\nNow we can do the convert dynamic,\nand notice something.\n\n72\n00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.600\nIt didn't give me a hard time there,\nright?\n\n73\n00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.970\nSo if I turn around and\n\n74\n00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.185\nI do it a list disk again, now we have\nboth of our asterisk symbols here.\n\n75\n00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:05.135\nOkay, now why is the dynamic\ndisk beneficial?\n\n76\n00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:09.505\nWell we mentioned some of those\nbenefits in the prior episode.\n\n77\n00:04:09.505 --> 00:04:13.720\nI'm gonna get back and\nshow you exactly why the dynamic\n\n78\n00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.540\ndisk can help you, over some of\nthe just limitations of the basic disc.\n\n79\n00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.910\nBut, we've been working a lot here,\nall right,\n\n80\n00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.570\ninside of the Command prompt.\n\n81\n00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.700\nHere in a second, we're gonna go ahead,\nand we're gonna drop down to PowerShell,\n\n82\n00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.450\nand show you that PowerShell\nhas some of its native\n\n83\n00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.130\nnative commands as well that are built,\ncmdlets as they call them.\n\n84\n00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.660\nBuilt right in the PowerShell.\n\n85\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.790\nBut staying in disk part,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n86\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.820\nreal quick just show you a benefit of\nthat dynamic volume by creating now,\n\n87\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.862\nnot what are known as partitions but\nnow what are known as simple volumes.\n\n88\n00:04:51.862 --> 00:04:53.280\nAll right, so if I turn around and\n\n89\n00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.330\nI decide I'm gonna to create a volume,\nall right?\n\n90\n00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.790\nI'm gonna do a create volume, and\nyou can also use your abbreviations here.\n\n91\n00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.380\nI'm gonna go ahead and say create volume,\nand then I'm gonna do simple, and\n\n92\n00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.429\nyou still do your size here,\nand we'll do 1024.\n\n93\n00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.430\nAll right, we'll give it a second and\nnotice that it is successful, all right?\n\n94\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.700\nAnd I'm gonna do assign, all right?\n\n95\n00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.010\nAnd look,\nyou can see that it says local disk E.\n\n96\n00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.820\nNow I haven't formatted anything cuz,\nagain, this is just for\n\n97\n00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.060\nthe purposes of showing you what we can do\nwith it if I do a list ball, all right,\n\n98\n00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.172\nnotice that I have volume E and\nit's raw, it doesn't say partition.\n\n99\n00:05:36.172 --> 00:05:40.070\nAll right, these partitions\nare on our NBR based disks.\n\n100\n00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.060\nNow that we have a dynamic disk\nit is now a volume, all right.\n\n101\n00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.920\nSo now that we've got volume E\nhere selected, we'll go ahead and\n\n102\n00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.000\nit already assigned it.\n\n103\n00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.250\nI tell you what.\nWe'll go ahead and format this real quick.\n\n104\n00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.630\nWe'll do format equals NTFS and\nwe'll do label equals and\n\n105\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.410\nwe'll do Let's say simp vol 1.\n\n106\n00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.000\nAll right, so just simple volume 1 and\nwe'll do it quick and this is just for\n\n107\n00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.480\nthe purposes so\nthat we can identify what's going on, and\n\n108\n00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.260\nif we do our list vol again, you can\nsee okay, simple volume, all right.\n\n109\n00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.059\nNow, next thing we're gonna do is we're\ngonna create another simple volume.\n\n110\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.500\nAnd it creates, that's what?\n\n111\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.980\nTwo, we're up to now, Dan,\nI believe, if we're keeping score?\n\n112\n00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.920\nWe're gonna create three.\n\n113\n00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.730\nCreates three just fine.\n\n114\n00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.510\nWe're gonna create four.\n\n115\n00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.310\nRemember, four is the limit\non primary partitions, right?\n\n116\n00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.420\nIf I haven't created\nan extended partition in MBR,\n\n117\n00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.470\nI should get a warning here\nthat says that's it, right?\n\n118\n00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.250\nLet's go ahead and do it again.\n\n119\n00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:48.220\nAll right.\nWell looks like we're well\n\n120\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.430\npast our limitation here Dan.\n\n121\n00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.240\n>> You're through the looking\nglass here my friend.\n\n122\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.250\n>> That's right.\n\n123\n00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.270\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee what's going on here.\n\n124\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.310\nI got list ball.\n\n125\n00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.020\nRight?\nAnd look at all these volumes here.\n\n126\n00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.090\nAnd since I'm selecting volume 4,\nwe'll go ahead and just do an assign.\n\n127\n00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.670\nAll right, we'll do a select vol.\n\n128\n00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:13.440\nHow about we try that again, select vol,\nand I'm using my abbreviations, 5 here.\n\n129\n00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.700\nWe'll do an assign.\n\n130\n00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.220\nAnd again,\nI am just working through the list.\n\n131\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.300\nSelect vol 6.\n\n132\n00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.110\nI have a whole bunch of format options\ncoming around in the background.\n\n133\n00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.640\nAnd that's okay.\n\n134\n00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.790\nI´m not worried about those.\n\n135\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.460\nWe'll close all those down.\n\n136\n00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.240\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n137\n00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.250\nI kind of lost track of the numbers here.\n\n138\n00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.730\nNow, okay, so\nwe need to do a select vol 7.\n\n139\n00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.390\nWe'll do, again, assign.\n\n140\n00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.520\nAnd again, we've got, what,\neight, nine, so let's do sel.\n\n141\n00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.225\nWe'll do vol, volume 8.\n\n142\n00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.100\nAll right, and we'll do assign.\n\n143\n00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.343\nAnd last but not least,\nsel vol 9, and we'll go ahead and\n\n144\n00:07:53.343 --> 00:07:57.870\ntype our assigned command again,\nall right?\n\n145\n00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.045\nNow when we do a list vol here,\n\n146\n00:08:00.045 --> 00:08:04.486\nyou can kinda see how many\ndifferent volumes I have, right?\n\n147\n00:08:04.486 --> 00:08:07.577\nAnd if I want to go through\nmy format process here.\n\n148\n00:08:07.577 --> 00:08:11.590\nAll right and we've got a lot that\nwe've got to scroll through here.\n\n149\n00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.960\nI can do simple vol nine,\nwe'll format that.\n\n150\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.890\nWe'll go ahead and do a, let's do\na select vol, we'll do sel just for\n\n151\n00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.940\nthe purposes of keeping\nthis consistent and\n\n152\n00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.920\nwe'll do, that will be volume eight,\nwe'll go ahead and format that.\n\n153\n00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.490\nWe'll do seven and again,\nI'm just kind of working backwards through\n\n154\n00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.070\nthe list here guys,\nnothing really fantastic about this.\n\n155\n00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.976\nWe'll do six, as you can see\nwe're just kind of going through.\n\n156\n00:08:42.976 --> 00:08:45.160\nAnd once you know these\nit makes it a lot easier,\n\n157\n00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.510\nyou could really work with your\ndrives at a fairly fast pace.\n\n158\n00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:55.330\nEven for somebody, as you guys have seen,\nlike me, who has impeccable typing skills,\n\n159\n00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.850\nyou can kinda work through this list\nfairly fast and there we have it.\n\n160\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.520\nIf I go back and\ndo my list vol, that easy.\n\n161\n00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.170\nI've got, what?\n\n162\n00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.640\nOne, two, three, four, five, six,\n\n163\n00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.440\nseven volumes on a dynamic disk and\nthat's one of the benefits, right?\n\n164\n00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.930\nNow understand that in other operating\nsystems, you're pretty much unlimited\n\n165\n00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.653\nin the amount of volumes you have, Windows\ndoes put an artificial limitation, right.\n\n166\n00:09:24.653 --> 00:09:28.710\nIt's a Windows limitation of 128 volumes,\nthat's how they limit you.\n\n167\n00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.840\nBut if you think about it,\n\n168\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.730\non a single drive you got 128 volumes,\nmight become a little complex to manage.\n\n169\n00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.200\nBut you do have the ability, right?\n\n170\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.930\nNever say never, right,\nwhen it comes to computing.\n\n171\n00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.885\n>> Yeah, in their defense,\n128 is probably a decent number for that.\n\n172\n00:09:43.885 --> 00:09:47.800\n[LAUGH] If you're hitting\nthe 128 limitation, wow,\n\n173\n00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.480\nyou've got a heck of an environment.\n\n174\n00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.480\n[LAUGH]\n>> That is true, so\n\n175\n00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.940\nthat's one of the benefits.\n\n176\n00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.410\nWe still have more benefits to show you on\nwhy you might format a dynamic disk and\n\n177\n00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.985\nthat's more of an implementation\nof software based RAID.\n\n178\n00:09:59.985 --> 00:10:02.320\nBut we'll show you a little\nbit of that coming up.\n\n179\n00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.560\nBut Dan what I really want to do\nnow is I kinda wanna go down to, or\n\n180\n00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.070\nif I will go back to our PowerShell.\n\n181\n00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.150\nLet me go ahead real quick and\njust do a list disk and\n\n182\n00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.450\nsee which one we've got selected.\n\n183\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.190\nAnd let me show you this while I'm here.\n\n184\n00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.050\nI'm going to clean this disk, but notice\nthat it still, we've got our dynamic disc,\n\n185\n00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.890\nand we've got our GPT.\n\n186\n00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:29.100\nIf I do a clean and then I turn around and\ndo list disk, that is gone, all right?\n\n187\n00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.550\nAnd if I do a list vol, be careful,\nall your work's undone, right?\n\n188\n00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.050\nSo remember what I told you, be careful.\n\n189\n00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.930\nI do it, I'm showing you here, I do this\nin reality, it's not just for a lab, and\n\n190\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.600\nit's certainly not just for\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n191\n00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.450\nCheck the disks that you're working with,\ncuz that simple,\n\n192\n00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.870\nall the work that you did, could be\nundone, so be very careful on that.\n\n193\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.348\nSo let's go ahead now and\nlet's exit out of diskpart.\n\n194\n00:10:54.348 --> 00:10:58.360\nHopefully you've got a better\nunderstanding of what you can do\n\n195\n00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.560\ninside of diskpart, making virtual disks,\nhow you select them, how you attach them.\n\n196\n00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.034\nAnd then ultimately how you partition them\ninto either partitions or simple volumes,\n\n197\n00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:12.092\nand as well as formatting and labeling\nthem, so you'll be ready for the exam.\n\n198\n00:11:12.092 --> 00:11:16.950\nHowever, PowerShell also has\nsome native cmdlets too.\n\n199\n00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:21.410\nSo for instance, if we do a get disk,\n\n200\n00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.840\nyou'll see here are all of those disks\nthat we were just working with, right?\n\n201\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.540\nWe can do a get partition if we want,\nall right?\n\n202\n00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.840\nAnd, here are all the partitions, so\n\n203\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.300\nyou'll see, even though it is different,\nyou can kinda work\n\n204\n00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.580\nthrough it on the exam if you know\nexactly what you're looking for.\n\n205\n00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:44.370\nNow, if there is a specific disk that\nI wanna find the partitions, like for\n\n206\n00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.095\ninstance, maybe I want to find\nout on my main drive here,\n\n207\n00:11:49.095 --> 00:11:52.860\nalthough I can already see it down here,\n\n208\n00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:57.990\nwhat the partition numbers are,\nI can always do a get dash partition.\n\n209\n00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.700\nAnd I can do, disk ID path or number,\n\n210\n00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:06.650\nin this case I'm gonna do number and I'm\ngonna say three and I'm gonna run that.\n\n211\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:10.465\nAll right, now notice that I get\na red line, usually when we see red\n\n212\n00:12:10.465 --> 00:12:13.530\nlines in Power Shell that means\nyou've done something wrong.\n\n213\n00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.640\nAll right I don't have any partitions.\n\n214\n00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.430\nWhat this says is that objects,\n\n215\n00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.030\nthere aren't any objects found with\na property disk number equal to three.\n\n216\n00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.510\nWe have no partitions, right?\n\n217\n00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.230\nWhen I did just a get partition\nit looked at all the disks and\n\n218\n00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.100\nsays let me find partitions\non all the disks.\n\n219\n00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.040\nSo you can get a little bit more specific.\n\n220\n00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.820\nNow, I wanna go ahead and\ndo a get disk one more time and\n\n221\n00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.710\nnotice that we have some of\nthese disks that are offline.\n\n222\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.580\nWell, we could bring them\nonline with PowerShell.\n\n223\n00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:48.450\nNow when you bring one\nonline you do a set disk.\n\n224\n00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.720\nAll right, so we'll do set disk.\n\n225\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.670\nAll right and\nthen this one is offline all right,\n\n226\n00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:58.780\nwell it's already offline, so if I set\na variable to this, I've got two options.\n\n227\n00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.820\nI got false, and is it offline, false?\n\n228\n00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.030\nThat means it's gonna turn it on, right?\n\n229\n00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:09.040\nIs offline equals true, it's gonna just\nkeep it to the state that it is right now\n\n230\n00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.010\nbut that's not what we want.\n\n231\n00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.490\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe'll bring that, parameters not set.\n\n232\n00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.850\nYou have to make sure that you\nput the disk number in there or\n\n233\n00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.870\nit says, PowerShell says, yeah,\nI've got native commandlets, but\n\n234\n00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:20.860\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n235\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.830\n>> Yeah, what disk do you\nwant me to use in here, Wes?\n\n236\n00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:23.990\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's absolutely right.\n\n237\n00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:29.825\nSo let me go ahead and\nsay set disk 3 is offline equals false and\n\n238\n00:13:29.825 --> 00:13:33.235\nwow, aren't you glad that I\ntook care of that mistake?\n\n239\n00:13:33.235 --> 00:13:35.155\nIt really didn't show you anything,\ndid it?\n\n240\n00:13:35.155 --> 00:13:37.745\nSo we'll do, get disk, one more time.\n\n241\n00:13:37.745 --> 00:13:43.425\nNow you can see that our disk three,\nif we look over here, is online.\n\n242\n00:13:43.425 --> 00:13:46.745\nAnd I can turn around and do, set disk and\n\n243\n00:13:46.745 --> 00:13:49.865\nI love the history that,\nI love the history in here.\n\n244\n00:13:49.865 --> 00:13:55.110\nI can do, let's see, four is offline,\nlet's do this one more time and\n\n245\n00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.370\nI think five it says is offline.\n\n246\n00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:04.530\nAll right, and you can see this one,\nthe F drive here, is actually one\n\n247\n00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.090\nof those volumes that we created earlier,\nwhen we were creating primary partitions.\n\n248\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:10.860\nSo just because I took the disk offline,\n\n249\n00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.290\nit doesn't erase the data within it,\nright.\n\n250\n00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.390\nThe moment I bring that disk back online,\nif I for\n\n251\n00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:21.540\ninstance if I do get partition, right?\n\n252\n00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.125\nWe got a lot more on the list now, and\n\n253\n00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:25.261\nthat's again is because\nthat disk is online.\n\n254\n00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:31.000\nNow if I want, I can also set\ninitialize disks too, so for\n\n255\n00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.640\ninstance, I can do a get-disk 3,\nyou know what?\n\n256\n00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.300\nLet me change this around\nhere a little bit.\n\n257\n00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.510\nLet me show you how to clear it first, and\nthen what we'll do is we'll go ahead and\n\n258\n00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.650\nset the disk to a certain partition style.\n\n259\n00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.430\nSo that's a good thing to know because,\n\n260\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.100\nwhat I want to show you too is how you can\ntake PowerShell, and you don't get this\n\n261\n00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:52.000\nbenefit in a disk var, I can take\nPowerShell and I take one commandlet and\n\n262\n00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.900\nI can pipe the output to another\ncommand or commandlet in this case.\n\n263\n00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.930\nSo let me show you that here.\n\n264\n00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.660\nI'm going to get the disk,\nin this case it's gonna be three.\n\n265\n00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.710\nWe are going to use our pipe character and\nwe're gonna use clear, and\n\n266\n00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:10.830\nthat's gonna be disk, and\nwe're gonna say remove data, right?\n\n267\n00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.650\nWe're gonna run this, now,\nit warned you, it says, careful.\n\n268\n00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.540\nIf you do this, and\nI didn't even get to see, but\n\n269\n00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.210\nthe little PowerShell, like when it\nupdates, and it shows you that little\n\n270\n00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:23.330\nlike a light blue screen there,\nit actually removed all the data.\n\n271\n00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:29.720\nNow, if I wanna say, take disk three and\nmake it a maybe MBR, I can do that.\n\n272\n00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:38.370\nI do the initialize,\nMake sure I spell initialize right.\n\n273\n00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.910\nInitialize Disk 3 and\nthen we can do a partition\n\n274\n00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:49.050\nstyle and MBR and we can run it.\n\n275\n00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:52.250\nThere again, wow,\ndidn't that do a lot, right.\n\n276\n00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.920\nYou don't really see it.\n\n277\n00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.730\n>> It dazzled me, Wes.\n\n278\n00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.918\n>> Yeah, so\na little bit of magic in the background.\n\n279\n00:15:56.918 --> 00:15:59.176\nSo we'll go ahead and do get disk again.\n\n280\n00:15:59.176 --> 00:16:01.324\nAll right and you can see the information.\n\n281\n00:16:01.324 --> 00:16:04.725\nIf we wanted to, we could do getPartition.\n\n282\n00:16:04.725 --> 00:16:08.665\nNow, get-partition is really just gonna\nshow us the same information that we just\n\n283\n00:16:08.665 --> 00:16:10.310\nhad and it's kinda interesting.\n\n284\n00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.650\nYou can see the extended partition,\nnotice that right there.\n\n285\n00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.200\nSo that extended partition that you and\n\n286\n00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.180\nI created in the first episode is still\nhere and it's still letting me know that.\n\n287\n00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.420\nBut maybe I wanna partition disk 3, right?\n\n288\n00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:26.540\nWe removed the data,\nwe set what the partitioning scheme is.\n\n289\n00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.750\nLet's go ahead and\nsay we partition this one.\n\n290\n00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.150\nSo we can do a new-partition, all right.\n\n291\n00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.948\nDisk number in this case is gonna be 3,\nall right.\n\n292\n00:16:37.948 --> 00:16:41.930\nAnd we're gonna use a big, old,\nlong parameter says use maximum size.\n\n293\n00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:48.130\nAnd we hit Enter and it creates\na single partition for the entire disk.\n\n294\n00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.840\nNow what if I wanna format?\n\n295\n00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.800\nNow this is another one where the piping\ncommand comes into play here, right?\n\n296\n00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.030\nSo, we're gonna use the pipe option.\n\n297\n00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.120\nFirst of all we're gonna do get-partition,\nall right.\n\n298\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.280\nThis number in this case is gonna be 3.\n\n299\n00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.140\nAnd partition number is gonna be 1.\n\n300\n00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.950\nAnd then we're gonna format.\n\n301\n00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.482\nSo, we're gonna pipe that\nout to the format volume.\n\n302\n00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:17.490\nAnd then we're gonna\nsay file system equals.\n\n303\n00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.710\nNot equals excuse me, just -filesystem.\n\n304\n00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.047\nAnd then NTFS.\n\n305\n00:17:24.047 --> 00:17:24.940\nAnd we're gonna run that.\n\n306\n00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:29.800\nNow you get to see that little dialog box\nthere that you couldn't really see when we\n\n307\n00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.460\nwere initializing this because\nit just happens so quick.\n\n308\n00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.110\nEven if you were in the graphical\nuser interface, you right click,\n\n309\n00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.280\nyou choose initialize disk and\n\n310\n00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.890\nit doesn't say anything,\nit changes it from offline to online.\n\n311\n00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:45.631\nAll right, so, we wouldn't be\ndoing it justice if we didn't put\n\n312\n00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:50.547\na little bit of PowerShell in there and\nshow you getdisk, setdisk,\n\n313\n00:17:50.547 --> 00:17:53.760\ninitialize disk, right, new partition.\n\n314\n00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.650\nSo, keep these in mind.\n\n315\n00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.750\nRemember these for the exam.\n\n316\n00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.960\nClear-disk, right.\n\n317\n00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.980\nAlways remember it's verb,\nnoun, syntax, right.\n\n318\n00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.780\nYour verb and then your noun.\n\n319\n00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.980\nGet connects you to an object.\n\n320\n00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.840\nSet modifies the object.\n\n321\n00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.640\nAnd it's something I would remember for\nthe exam.\n\n322\n00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.420\nRemember the variables or the parameters\nmight change a little bit, and\n\n323\n00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.240\nthe paths and the locations,\nbut for the most part,\n\n324\n00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.630\nthe cmdlets is gonna stay the same\nif you know the parameters.\n\n325\n00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.880\nAll right, so\nthat's a little bit about PowerShell.\n\n326\n00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.090\nWe haven't really worked much in\nthe graphical user interface and\n\n327\n00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.680\nwe're about to switch gears here.\n\n328\n00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.710\nWe're gonna show you, like I told you\nin the beginning of this episode.\n\n329\n00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:35.380\nA little bit more about why\ndynamic disks can benefit you.\n\n330\n00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:40.700\nNow Dan, would you say a hardware raid or\na software raid is better?\n\n331\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.070\n>> Hardware raid, definitely.\n\n332\n00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.650\n>> All right, and he's absolutely right.\n\n333\n00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.010\nWhy?\nCuz a hardware raid says\n\n334\n00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.390\ntake it off of our CPU.\n\n335\n00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:51.640\nOur CPU is the commander-in-chief\nof the entire system unit, right?\n\n336\n00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.230\nAnd if I have software managing the disks,\nI'm\n\n337\n00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.920\nrobbing my operating system of CPU cycles\nthat could be doing something better.\n\n338\n00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.890\n>> Right, with the hardware you\nget to outsource it to the board,\n\n339\n00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.600\nlet the board take care\nof all the RAID stuff.\n\n340\n00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.860\n>> Let the operating system take\ncare of the operating system.\n\n341\n00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.010\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n342\n00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:11.440\nSo that's why I'm gonna tell you, don't\nlet me sit here and like I'm trying to\n\n343\n00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.570\ntell you software RAID is the bee's knees,\nit has nothing to do with that.\n\n344\n00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:18.210\nHardware RAID any day of the week\nit's gonna outperform software RAID.\n\n345\n00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.760\nBut what if your system's limited?\n\n346\n00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.570\nWhat if you don't have a RAID controller?\n\n347\n00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.100\nAre you out?\n\n348\n00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.500\nWell, not necessarily.\n\n349\n00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.270\nNow keep in mind, it's not\na substitution for hardware RAIDs.\n\n350\n00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.200\nSo let's go ahead,\nwe'll jump back to the desktop here.\n\n351\n00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:32.790\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n352\n00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.270\nuse those administrative quick\nlinks we showed you back\n\n353\n00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.400\nin the episode implementing Windows and\nwe're gonna go to Disk Management.\n\n354\n00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.460\nNow we're gonna take a, and\nnotice that the disks here that I\n\n355\n00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.790\ndidn't initialize and that's one of\nthe reasons I wanted to go here.\n\n356\n00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:50.510\nAll right, notice that the disks that\nI didn't initialize with PowerShell,\n\n357\n00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.790\nthey're asking me here.\n\n358\n00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.730\nWhat partitioning scheme do you wanna use?\n\n359\n00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.400\nAll right, at this point, a dynamic disk.\n\n360\n00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.773\nYou do not have to worry about\nwhether it's MBR or GBT.\n\n361\n00:20:00.773 --> 00:20:03.632\nI wanna focus in on the dynamic disk side,\nall right.\n\n362\n00:20:03.632 --> 00:20:06.520\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\nwe'll just leave this with MBR.\n\n363\n00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.787\nKeep in mind, even though GPT came out\nin the late 90s and for the most part is\n\n364\n00:20:11.787 --> 00:20:17.627\nwhat's going to eventually replace BIOS,\nBIOS is still one of the most compatible,\n\n365\n00:20:17.627 --> 00:20:22.037\nso it's kinda still dragging its\nfeet along in the background.\n\n366\n00:20:22.037 --> 00:20:25.159\nAnd then slowing down progress I'm sure,\nbut it's still compatible so\n\n367\n00:20:25.159 --> 00:20:26.680\nit's still out there.\n\n368\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.780\nNow, let's go ahead and we'll expand this\nout, and if we look through in here,\n\n369\n00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.240\nwe'll see all those drives.\n\n370\n00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.649\nNow this is a good thing, because it gives\nme a chance to show you kind of in a more\n\n371\n00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.850\ndiagram type style if you will.\n\n372\n00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:43.330\nWhat we were talking about the primary\npartitions, one prime, two prime,\n\n373\n00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.330\nthree prime.\n\n374\n00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.030\nNotice this big green box?\n\n375\n00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:53.070\nThat's letting me know that, that whole\nentire divided section is the extended\n\n376\n00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:57.610\npartition and here are the logical volumes\ninside of that extended partition.\n\n377\n00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:02.117\nNow, so one thing you're gonna notice is\nthat the disks here say basic, all right.\n\n378\n00:21:02.117 --> 00:21:06.940\nAnd we can convert them inside\nof the operating system here.\n\n379\n00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.112\nWe can convert these from basic,\nif we want, to dynamic disks.\n\n380\n00:21:11.112 --> 00:21:16.670\nAll right, now it's asking me which\nof the disks do I want to convert?\n\n381\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:21.540\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and I'll\nsay disk 2 will convert to dynamic and\n\n382\n00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:27.020\nmaybe even let's see, make sure I'm not\ndoing my operating system drive here.\n\n383\n00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:27.770\nAnd I believe.\n\n384\n00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.830\nLets see.\n\n385\n00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:31.750\nOkay, there we go.\n\n386\n00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:36.310\nBasic disk one, disk two, disk three,\nand there's our NTFS and there we go.\n\n387\n00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.870\nSo, disk zero we'll stay away from.\n\n388\n00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:42.880\nAgain, just like a list disk\ninside a disk management in here.\n\n389\n00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.790\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do is we will.\n\n390\n00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.050\nI'll tell you what.\n\n391\n00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.220\nLet's start with a basic disk.\n\n392\n00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.700\nLet's right click here and\nlet's choose new simple volume.\n\n393\n00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.860\nAll right, this is all very basic stuff.\n\n394\n00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:59.520\nWe're just gonna go through here and\nI tell you what, we'll make, for instance,\n\n395\n00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.990\nmaybe a 2 gig partition on this.\n\n396\n00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.510\nWe'll choose next.\n\n397\n00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:10.950\nNext, and we'll call this a simple volume.\n\n398\n00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.880\nAll right, we'll choose next and\nwe'll let that finish.\n\n399\n00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.920\nNotice the colors there's another reason\nI want you to see disk management in case\n\n400\n00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.640\nthey happen to give you a question on this\nand all they do is give you the colors.\n\n401\n00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.070\nJust like I said for\ninstance about the icon.\n\n402\n00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.520\nWhen you look at the icons\nthere is a big difference here.\n\n403\n00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.240\nYou can see one is blue and one is gray.\n\n404\n00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.622\nBlue means that this is\na virtualized disk and\n\n405\n00:22:32.622 --> 00:22:35.452\nits online because it doesn't\nhave a red down arrow.\n\n406\n00:22:35.452 --> 00:22:38.850\nYou need to know that just in\ncase they ask you on the exam.\n\n407\n00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:43.210\nJust like I would know these colors,\nsee the blue here represents a simple\n\n408\n00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:48.330\nvolume or in this case a partition,\nall right, on a single basic disk.\n\n409\n00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:53.070\nNow, if I wanna extend this,\nI can, I choose extend volume.\n\n410\n00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.120\nAll right,\nnow when I choose extend volume,\n\n411\n00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.920\nnotice that it gives me more\nthan one disk to choose.\n\n412\n00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.250\nWell, what's that about?\n\n413\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.130\nWell let's go ahead and show you.\n\n414\n00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:04.365\nWe'll add this too,\nwe'll add it and I'm gonna add,\n\n415\n00:23:04.365 --> 00:23:09.230\n2 gigs from another disk.\n\n416\n00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.940\nAnd I'm gonna choose Next,\nand I'm gonna choose Finish.\n\n417\n00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.470\nAnd it's gonna give me this warning.\n\n418\n00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.830\nIt says, well, wait a second.\n\n419\n00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.680\nIf you decide that you're gonna create\nwhat's known as a spanned volume,\n\n420\n00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.335\nyou're gonna take a portion of this disk\nand a portion of a separate disk, and\n\n421\n00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:26.225\nyou're gonna span the volumes\nthat will collectively be\n\n422\n00:23:26.225 --> 00:23:28.645\nseen as one storage container.\n\n423\n00:23:28.645 --> 00:23:33.130\nIt's gonna convert this basic disk\ninto what's known as a dynamic disk.\n\n424\n00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.300\nSo let's go and do that, let's choose Yes.\n\n425\n00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.820\nAll right, now look at the difference\nin the colors, all right.\n\n426\n00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:44.873\nThis is no longer a simple volume,\nall right.\n\n427\n00:23:44.873 --> 00:23:51.453\nThis is now what is called a span volume\nand notice how it changes, right?\n\n428\n00:23:51.453 --> 00:23:56.471\nIf I wanted, to I could also use\nthe rest Of this disk, likewise.\n\n429\n00:23:56.471 --> 00:23:59.200\nAll right, so let me go ahead,\nand I'm gonna delete this volume.\n\n430\n00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:04.100\nAnd it always tells you, if you're\ngonna delete the volume, be careful.\n\n431\n00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.410\nAll right, now, how about this?\n\n432\n00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.500\nAnd we'll go ahead and walk you through\nthe process of what is actually,\n\n433\n00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.190\nwithout extending it,\nthe process of creating a span volume.\n\n434\n00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:19.550\nNow, understand that a span volume\ndoesn't give you any fault tolerance.\n\n435\n00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.940\nThis is like JBOD, right.\n\n436\n00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.510\nIf I have a bunch of hard drives, and\n\n437\n00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:28.380\nI want them to be seen as one contiguous\nstorage space, I create a JBOD, right.\n\n438\n00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.278\nJust a Bunch of Discs,\nwhich is what JBOD stands for.\n\n439\n00:24:31.278 --> 00:24:32.450\nGives me no-fault tolerance, and\n\n440\n00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.960\ncertainly doesn't give me Any\nperformance increase at all.\n\n441\n00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.870\nAll right, so I can select, and\nnotice how as I select these,\n\n442\n00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.750\nthey individually have their own size,\nright.\n\n443\n00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.039\nSo for instance and\nwhat I mean by that a little bit more.\n\n444\n00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.670\nTo the point is, I can say I wanna\ntake two gigs of this disk and\n\n445\n00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.570\nI wanna take maybe two gigs of this disk.\n\n446\n00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:59.140\nAll right now, I can tell you you're\nprobably not gonna set it up in the real\n\n447\n00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.490\nworld that way because what is\nthe benefit of a span volume?\n\n448\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.210\nLet me show you.\n\n449\n00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.240\nLet me go ahead, create a new simple\nvolume on this, and we're just gonna\n\n450\n00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.660\nrifle through this with all the settings\nthat it takes up the entire space.\n\n451\n00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:15.560\nBut now I come to the end of my space\nhere and I need to extend this volume.\n\n452\n00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.020\nNotice the blue.\n\n453\n00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.870\nNotice the blue here.\n\n454\n00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:23.249\nWell, when I extend this,\nwhat we don't understand,\n\n455\n00:25:23.249 --> 00:25:26.410\nreally what's going under the hood.\n\n456\n00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:31.515\nIf I say give me two gigs\nof the next hard drive,\n\n457\n00:25:31.515 --> 00:25:35.355\nright, watch what happens\nto my simple volume.\n\n458\n00:25:36.565 --> 00:25:38.395\nIt gives me the same warning.\n\n459\n00:25:38.395 --> 00:25:41.125\nIt says well if you're going\nto extend this into Disk 2,\n\n460\n00:25:41.125 --> 00:25:42.469\nit's gonna create a dynamic disk.\n\n461\n00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.500\nAll right, and\nthere again we get that span volume.\n\n462\n00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.020\nSo that's what a span volume is.\n\n463\n00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.770\nIt takes two or more discs, and\n\n464\n00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:56.270\nit aggregates them together into\na single contiguous storage space.\n\n465\n00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.820\nNow what if you needed a little bit\nof performance increase, right?\n\n466\n00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.320\nWell, what do we have there,\nthat we can use?\n\n467\n00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.410\nWell, I still got a disk down\nhere that I can use, right?\n\n468\n00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.467\nSo if I go back up, and\nI say, you know what,\n\n469\n00:26:07.467 --> 00:26:11.760\nI think I'm going to take this next\nspace I'm gonna make a striped volume.\n\n470\n00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.990\nAll right now, I choose a striped volume,\nnotice I have Disk 4 here,\n\n471\n00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:18.020\nthat's that one that's down\nthere that we just looked at.\n\n472\n00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:25.050\nNow watch what happens when I set\nthe striped volume size, 2048.\n\n473\n00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.610\nDan, I don't know if you can see that,\nI know it's relatively small.\n\n474\n00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:29.750\nDid you notice the difference\nwhen we were creating that one?\n\n475\n00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.280\nIt's like it's clustering them together.\n\n476\n00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.270\n>> It is, that's right, because in\na striped volume, and I want you to know\n\n477\n00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.610\nthis for the exam, you don't get to\npick and choose and mix and match.\n\n478\n00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:42.630\nYou set the volume size and\nit's applicable for both drives.\n\n479\n00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.980\nSo we choose Next.\n\n480\n00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.960\nWe'll just leave the default letters.\n\n481\n00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.820\nAnd this one instead I'll call StripedVol,\nso\n\n482\n00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.450\nwe can see that, and choose next.\n\n483\n00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:58.340\nNow, remember Disk 4 down\nthere is still a basic disk.\n\n484\n00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.400\nSo it's saying the same thing.\n\n485\n00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.660\nIt's saying hey, this is a basic disk,\nwe're gonna convert it to a dynamic\n\n486\n00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.730\nbecause where the dynamic\ndisk can be the benefit.\n\n487\n00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.710\nAll right, takes a second here.\n\n488\n00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.710\nNotice the color format, and voila.\n\n489\n00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:18.700\nWe now have a striped disc, or\nstriped volume if you will.\n\n490\n00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.250\nNotice the colors.\n\n491\n00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.680\nWe're getting really colorful,\nhere, right.\n\n492\n00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.600\nWe've got our extended volume,\nwe've got a simple volume, or\n\n493\n00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.800\nin this case it's a partition.\n\n494\n00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.618\nWe've got unallocated space, we've got\nthis magenta-type color and that's for\n\n495\n00:27:31.618 --> 00:27:32.485\nyour span volume.\n\n496\n00:27:32.485 --> 00:27:35.630\nAnd then we've got this aqua green type\ncolor, and that's for your striped volume.\n\n497\n00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:36.690\nAnd again-\n>> That striped\n\n498\n00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.360\nvolume's gonna give us\na performance increase, right?\n\n499\n00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.640\nBecause it's only writing\nportions of the data to one disk,\n\n500\n00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.830\nand another portion to the other.\n\n501\n00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:45.838\nAnd it can do this simultaneously,\ncuz it's two separate disks.\n\n502\n00:27:45.838 --> 00:27:49.020\nYeah, two read-write heads cranking away,\nand so\n\n503\n00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.480\nyou get an increase in performance, right?\n\n504\n00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.840\n>> That is absolutely correct.\n\n505\n00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.900\nBut back to Dan and I's original comment,\nthis doesn't replace hardware RAID.\n\n506\n00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:56.560\nWhy?\n\n507\n00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.520\nBecause the CPU is now handling that.\n\n508\n00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.160\nLike Dan would say,\nwrite a piece to this disk here,\n\n509\n00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.560\nwrite a little piece to this disk here.\n\n510\n00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.370\nIf you read it you're gonna have to read,\nso your reads don't necessarily increase,\n\n511\n00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.190\nbecause you gotta read\nfrom two different disks.\n\n512\n00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.290\nBut, your writes, absolutely,\ndo increase, alright.\n\n513\n00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:17.560\nSo, one last one,\nsince we created most of them, here.\n\n514\n00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.250\nLet's go ahead and,\nlet's create one other one, all right.\n\n515\n00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:24.845\nWe're gonna to create, make sure I have\nsome unallocated space left there.\n\n516\n00:28:24.845 --> 00:28:26.915\nWe're gonna create a new mirrored volume.\n\n517\n00:28:26.915 --> 00:28:28.865\nNow, the mirrored volume, all right,\n\n518\n00:28:28.865 --> 00:28:32.195\ndoes something that striped\ndoes not do for us, right?\n\n519\n00:28:32.195 --> 00:28:34.265\nStriped volume doesn't\ngive us fault-tolerance.\n\n520\n00:28:34.265 --> 00:28:35.685\nIf we lose one of those drives,\n\n521\n00:28:35.685 --> 00:28:40.890\njust like in a RAID-0 configuration at the\nhardware level, you lose all your data.\n\n522\n00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:46.100\nSo that one is not something you do for\nthe purposes of fault tolerance.\n\n523\n00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.570\nHowever, the mirrored volume, that does\ngive us a little bit of fault tolerance.\n\n524\n00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:52.660\nSo we're gonna add the disc here.\n\n525\n00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.080\nOops, I say that and\nI remove both of them.\n\n526\n00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.184\nAll right, [CROSSTALK] yeah, that doesn't\ngive you any fault tolerance either.\n\n527\n00:28:59.184 --> 00:29:00.277\n[LAUGH] And then I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna say.\n\n528\n00:29:00.277 --> 00:29:01.282\n>> Let's call it a fault [LAUGH].\n\n529\n00:29:01.282 --> 00:29:02.609\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n530\n00:29:02.609 --> 00:29:04.370\nI'm my own worst enemy.\n\n531\n00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.940\n>> That's right,\nwatch me destroy these disks.\n\n532\n00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.150\n>> [LAUGH] So now you'll notice, and Dan I\ndon't know if you notice the same things\n\n533\n00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:13.850\nhappen that happen with our striped volume\nhere when we allocated this space here.\n\n534\n00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:15.365\nIt's got to be the same.\n\n535\n00:29:15.365 --> 00:29:17.440\nSpan volume is the one you can mix and\nmatch.\n\n536\n00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.210\nBecause you're not doing any of\nthis increased performance or\n\n537\n00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:25.750\nfault tolerance so\nit's going to be allocated the same time.\n\n538\n00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:26.800\nAll right so let's go ahead.\n\n539\n00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.850\n>> Wes really quickly here, with the\nstriped volume, when we created that set\n\n540\n00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:36.560\nof disks, the size,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong, it increases too.\n\n541\n00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.950\nIf we get two gigs he and two gigs there,\nthe overall size is four gigs.\n\n542\n00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:40.670\n>> That's right.\n>> Correct?\n\n543\n00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:42.040\n>> Very good.\n>> But with mirrored\n\n544\n00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.450\nwe do not get that, correct?\n\n545\n00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.520\n>> That's right and\nI'm glad you brought that up.\n\n546\n00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:51.000\nStriped is gonna be\nthe allocated space for\n\n547\n00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.610\nboth drives, even though you\ngotta pick it at the same, and\n\n548\n00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.620\nit's two gigs here, two gigs here,\nwe do get the four gigs.\n\n549\n00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.177\nWith the mirrored volume you allocated,\nyou're gonna lose two gigs of total\n\n550\n00:30:00.177 --> 00:30:03.690\nspace because you're gonna be writing\ntwice, hence the fault tolerance.\n\n551\n00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:06.480\nOne disk fails,\nI still have my data on the second disk.\n\n552\n00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.675\n>> The second disk is basically\na backup disk at that point.\n\n553\n00:30:09.675 --> 00:30:11.440\n>> Yes, it really is.\n\n554\n00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.710\nAnd I'm going to go ahead, I didn't\ndo this one with the striped volume.\n\n555\n00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.420\nDemonstration and lab purposes, it doesn't\nreally matter here, but I'm going to go\n\n556\n00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.150\nahead and do a quick format,\njust to speed it up a little bit here.\n\n557\n00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:24.310\nAnd we'll choose Finish.\n\n558\n00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.850\nAnd now, well we have the third or\nfourth color here,\n\n559\n00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:33.040\nI'm losing count on the colors.\n\n560\n00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.360\nWe're creating a Christmas tree.\n\n561\n00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.500\n>> Like a Christmas tree\nthat's right [LAUGH].\n\n562\n00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.600\n>> So now we have our mirrored volume\nokay, now that being said and you know\n\n563\n00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.620\nwhat, let me go ahead cuz I do want to\nshow you this in File Explorer in the GUI.\n\n564\n00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.980\nI know I'm doing this,\nI'm gonna delete this volume, guys.\n\n565\n00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.210\nI apologize ahead of time, but\nlet's go ahead hey, and do it twice here.\n\n566\n00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:55.740\nBecause I do want to make sure that\nwe can identify what the span volume.\n\n567\n00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:56.950\nAnd you know what's cool?\n\n568\n00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:58.870\nNow that we have all of\nour volumes created,\n\n569\n00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.492\nI can add the remaining space in this\nfour that was used for the mirror.\n\n570\n00:31:02.492 --> 00:31:06.150\nAll right, so that's actually a way\nto show you that you can mix and\n\n571\n00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:10.030\nmatch with the span volumes and\nit doesn't really bug you.\n\n572\n00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.350\nSo first why I did two gigs,\nhave you seen that?\n\n573\n00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:18.490\nSecond one, we'll do, let's say,\nwhat, 4096, that'll be 4 gigs.\n\n574\n00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:25.684\nAnd the first one, we don't really have\nmuch space, so let's do 1 gig, so 1024.\n\n575\n00:31:25.684 --> 00:31:31.092\nI'm gonna give it the J letter there,\n\n576\n00:31:31.092 --> 00:31:38.450\nand we'll call this SpannedvolOne,\nif it fits.\n\n577\n00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:41.300\nAnd we'll do a Quick Format,\nand we'll Finish.\n\n578\n00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.990\nAll right, so\nit's telling me the same thing.\n\n579\n00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:44.860\nThese are gonna be\nconverted to dynamic disks.\n\n580\n00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.650\nAll right, and now look at this Dan.\n\n581\n00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.520\nThis is where it gets really twisty.\n\n582\n00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.170\nNotice I have Disc 1, Disk 2 and Disk 3.\n\n583\n00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:57.320\nLet's see what that looks like in\nFile Explorer even though you and\n\n584\n00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.142\nI know that it's three disks, let's see\nwhat it looks like in File Explorer.\n\n585\n00:32:01.142 --> 00:32:03.820\nAll right,\nif I go to Local Disk or actually,\n\n586\n00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.510\nwe go to This PC, that's where it is.\n\n587\n00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.130\nAnd I look at where's spanvol?\n\n588\n00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:13.570\nNotice I have 7 gigs but\nit's a single contiguous storage space.\n\n589\n00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:16.690\nAnd the same thing applies\nwith all your other volumes,\n\n590\n00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.930\nremember we have the mirrored vol here and\nwe have the striped vol?\n\n591\n00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:24.380\nEven though under the hood, you know\nas the technician or the administrator,\n\n592\n00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.980\nthat there are multiple disks,\n\n593\n00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.340\nthe operating system sees it\nas a single storage location.\n\n594\n00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:34.450\nAnd that is one of the benefits\nof your dynamic discs,\n\n595\n00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:37.500\ngives you the ability to\ncreate these dynamic volumes.\n\n596\n00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:42.130\n>> It is very cool stuff and this is just\nstuff that you're gonna have to work with\n\n597\n00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.410\nas you get into enterprise level stuff.\n\n598\n00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:47.230\nYou're going to create RAID arrays,\n\n599\n00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:52.000\nyou're gonna work with RAID, so\nyou have to know which RAID does what.\n\n600\n00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.900\nBasically when we say striped,\nright, we mean RAID-0.\n\n601\n00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:58.690\nWhen we say a mirror we mean RAID-1,\nand so on so forth.\n\n602\n00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:02.700\nSo you're getting a taste of that inside\nthe Windows operating system, it's built\n\n603\n00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.210\nright in, and you don't have to go out and\nbuy a multi thousand dollar server.\n\n604\n00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.288\nYou can use your home machine,\nthrow in a couple of new drives and\n\n605\n00:33:09.288 --> 00:33:13.166\nstart playing around with these different\ntypes of partitions, and volumes and\n\n606\n00:33:13.166 --> 00:33:15.635\neverything that we showed you,\nthe dynamic disk.\n\n607\n00:33:15.635 --> 00:33:16.655\nAnd expanding and\n\n608\n00:33:16.655 --> 00:33:21.100\nhaving all sorts of fun creating\na myriad of different types of volumes.\n\n609\n00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.290\nVery lot of fun and very practical.\n\n610\n00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:26.610\nWes, I know we got a bunch\n>> Yeah, man.\n\n611\n00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:29.070\n>> When it comes to disk\nmanagement it is a little bit.\n\n612\n00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.830\nIt's a bit of a mountain for us to climb\nso it's gonna take us a part three.\n\n613\n00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.130\nRight?\nWe're on part three on this?\n\n614\n00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:34.800\n>> Yes, part three.\n\n615\n00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.460\nA Trilogy.\n\n616\n00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.100\n>> That's right.\n\n617\n00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.670\nThe trilogy of terror that we're\ngoing to have to get through.\n\n618\n00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.170\nSo hopefully we'll see you then.\n\n619\n00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.970\nWes, thanks so much for\nexplaining these things.\n\n620\n00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.570\nYou do a great job of that and\nwe appreciate it.\n\n621\n00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.532\nWe thank you guys for watching,\nbut it's time to sign off.\n\n622\n00:33:46.532 --> 00:33:48.960\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n623\n00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.151\n>> And I'm Wes Bryant and\nwe'll

In this third part, they focus in on how to format volumes and manipulate file attributes via the command line interpreters, respectively.  The guys talk about Storage Spaces.  This feature, Wes explains, gives Windows users the ability to aggregate diverse and multiple disparate storage devices, in bulk or incrementally, depending on how it’s configured. They also show some of the different configurations possible when configuring “Storage Spaces”.",

00:00:18.970\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\ntoday we're talking about installing and\n\n4\n00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.882\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n5\n00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:23.890\nNow we're actually in the middle\nof configuring stores of ISIS,\n\n6\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.575\nactually a little bit\nmore than the middle.\n\n7\n00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:26.724\nWe're into a part three,\n\n8\n00:00:26.724 --> 00:00:29.713\nwhich means that Wes has actually\ntalked way too long on something.\n\n9\n00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:32.707\nNot really, he has given us all\nthe full details and benefits and\n\n10\n00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:34.795\nthat means we have a whole\nlot more to cover.\n\n11\n00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:36.630\nSo welcome back Wes, thanks for\nbeing with us today.\n\n12\n00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.280\n>> Absolutely and thanks for\njumping in Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.070\nThat's right,\n\n14\n00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.631\nwe're working on a small novel here\nwhen it comes to configuring storage.\n\n15\n00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:44.240\nBut storage is very important, so\n\n16\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.410\nwe want to make sure that you have\nall the little bells and whistles.\n\n17\n00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.850\nAnd we've been working\nheavily in the command line.\n\n18\n00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.640\nAnd when it comes down to it, we're going\nto stay a little bit more in the command\n\n19\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.080\nline, but we do have a few more topics\nthat we're gonna go ahead and discuss and\n\n20\n00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.160\nsome of those topics are going\nto be things like your format.\n\n21\n00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.102\nWe'll talk a little bit file formats and\n\n22\n00:01:02.102 --> 00:01:06.155\nwe're gonna talk about something known as\nattributes cuz it's one of the things that\n\n23\n00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:08.780\nyou have to know if you're\ngonna configure file options.\n\n24\n00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.800\nRemember in some of the earlier episodes,\nwe showed you how to create virtual hard\n\n25\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.430\ndisks, we showed you some\nof the limitations and\n\n26\n00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.220\nactually demonstrated the limitations of\nlike MBR and why we might move to a GPT,\n\n27\n00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.680\nthe difference between the basic disks and\nthe dynamic disks.\n\n28\n00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.860\nAnd we showed you how to convert those\nin between on the command prompt.\n\n29\n00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.100\nRemember, we also showed you how\nto take those dynamic disks and\n\n30\n00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.700\nturn them into dynamic volumes.\n\n31\n00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.750\nRemember, one of the benefits that we had\ntalked about, we created the spanned,\n\n32\n00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.490\nthe striped, and\nthe mirrored volumes and set that up.\n\n33\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.210\nSo we're gonna move\nforward a little bit more,\n\n34\n00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.560\nwe're gonna come at you\nwith some of the basics.\n\n35\n00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.890\nWe're gonna talk about file systems.\n\n36\n00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.550\nNow, when it comes to file systems guys,\nsome of the things that you have to know,\n\n37\n00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.740\nwe've got an oldie but goody,\nbeen around for a while, FAT32.\n\n38\n00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.610\nIt does support large drive sizes so\n\n39\n00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.780\nit gets around the limitations of\nthe earlier FAT16, but it still does\n\n40\n00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.040\nhave a limitation in the fact that we\ncan only have a four gig file size.\n\n41\n00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.720\nYou might remember back in the episode\nwhen we created that WINPE disk,\n\n42\n00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.060\nWINPE has to be created on a FAT32 system.\n\n43\n00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.400\nWhich means unfortunately when we're\nimplementing WINPE on a bootable USB\n\n44\n00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.080\ndrive, we can't slipstream the image in\nthere because the image was seven gigs.\n\n45\n00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.330\nSo, that's gonna be one of\nthe things we're gonna look here.\n\n46\n00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.700\nWe're gonna look at taking a volume and\nconfiguring it to FAT32 and\n\n47\n00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.660\nthen showing you how to convert it.\n\n48\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.850\nSo if you're ever in a situation,\nwhere maybe you have a FAT32 disk and\n\n49\n00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.595\nyou wanna convert it over,\nyou'll be able to do that.\n\n50\n00:02:32.595 --> 00:02:34.275\nLet's go ahead and dive right it.\n\n51\n00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:39.625\nI've got my PowerShell open, keep in mind\nthat you can do this in command prompt.\n\n52\n00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.839\nRemember that disk part\nis just an executable and\n\n53\n00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:45.807\nit doesn't matter which of the command\nline interpreters you launch it from.\n\n54\n00:02:45.807 --> 00:02:49.327\nI just typically launch PowerShell,\nbecause as you can see,\n\n55\n00:02:49.327 --> 00:02:51.927\nI can move in and\nout of command prompt if I want.\n\n56\n00:02:51.927 --> 00:02:55.247\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's fire up diskpart here and\n\n57\n00:02:55.247 --> 00:02:57.517\nwe'll take a look at some\nof the disks that we have.\n\n58\n00:02:57.517 --> 00:02:58.180\nAll right, so\n\n59\n00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.667\nwe're gonna do the list disk option, and\nyou can see that we have a few disks here.\n\n60\n00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:07.097\nWe're gonna start by working with,\nlet's say, this 10 GB disk here.\n\n61\n00:03:07.097 --> 00:03:11.090\nRemember that it is GPT, and you can see\nthat because the little asterisk symbol,\n\n62\n00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.680\nthat's kind hard to see there but,\n\n63\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.820\nremember that at this point we could\nturn this into a dynamic disk.\n\n64\n00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.690\nOne thing that I'll recap from\nthe previous episode, remember you cannot\n\n65\n00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.390\nmodify partitioning schemes if you've\nalready converted it into a basic disk or\n\n66\n00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.520\nif you've already converted\nit into a dynamic disk.\n\n67\n00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.840\nRemember the operating, or procedure\nof operations, operating order and\n\n68\n00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.900\nthat on the exam is modify\nthe partitioning scheme, and\n\n69\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.140\nthen convert it between dynamic and basic.\n\n70\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.550\nSo just keep that in mind\nin case it's on the exam.\n\n71\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.040\nSo let's go ahead, we're gonna dive\nright in here and we'll select disk one.\n\n72\n00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.380\nRemember that we can do abbreviations in\nhere, we told you you that, like in some\n\n73\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.820\ncommand line interpreters that you see,\nthey accept abbreviations, this one does.\n\n74\n00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.240\nSo, we could either type out select if\nwe want or we could just do sel and\n\n75\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.150\nI'm gonna go ahead and select Disk 1.\n\n76\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.840\nNow, like I also showed you,\nmisery doesn't love company,\n\n77\n00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.055\nso don't join the boat club,\nin the boat of misery with me.\n\n78\n00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:12.240\nAlways come back and\n\n79\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.530\nensure that the asterisk symbol is next to\nthe disk that you are trying to work with.\n\n80\n00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.635\nI won't tell you how I know that\nthis can cause quite a few problems.\n\n81\n00:04:22.635 --> 00:04:24.850\n[LAUGH] You do a clean on the disk and\n\n82\n00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.630\nunfortunately, now you've\nwiped out all your data.\n\n83\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.760\nSo, let's go ahead and do that real quick.\n\n84\n00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.370\nWe're gonna just provision this disk\nreal quick by just cleaning it,\n\n85\n00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.290\nmaking sure there's no partitions on it or\nanything.\n\n86\n00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.370\nAnd if we did a list part, remember I\ncan also spell out partition if I want,\n\n87\n00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.820\nnotice there's no partitions on this,\nso we're good to go.\n\n88\n00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.280\nSo we'll go ahead, we're gonna create\na partition, and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n89\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.880\nuse my abbreviations, create part prime.\n\n90\n00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.160\nI'm not gonna modify any size like\nwe did in the previous episode,\n\n91\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.642\nin fact I did that wrong apparently,\nthere's no, there isn't two t's in create,\n\n92\n00:04:59.642 --> 00:05:01.850\nall right, create part prime.\n\n93\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.339\nAnd you can see basically that's\nthe abbreviation create partition primary.\n\n94\n00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:10.100\nAll right now, now comes with the\nformatting, we have some options, right.\n\n95\n00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.860\nWe have NTFS that we could format with,\nor we could format with FAT32.\n\n96\n00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.340\nNow again, remember FAT32, it does have\nthat file size limitation of four gigs,\n\n97\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.928\nso this is why you might wanna turn\naround and convert it to NTFS, right?\n\n98\n00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:30.695\nNTFS, we don't have to worry\nabout that file size restriction,\n\n99\n00:05:30.695 --> 00:05:35.020\nit does have a two terabyte limitation,\nso you do have to keep that in mind.\n\n100\n00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.170\nLet's go ahead and do that very thing,\nlet's do a format here.\n\n101\n00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.890\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead, I do this all the\ntime I know, may be a little paranoid on\n\n102\n00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.050\nhere but I just want to make sure\nthat I haven't selected another disk.\n\n103\n00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.400\nNow we'll do a format and\nwe'll do an fs = and this'll be fat32, and\n\n104\n00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.070\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nput a label of filesystem on this,\n\n105\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.220\nso that when we do our list vol or\nour list disk here we'll know\n\n106\n00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.580\nthat this is the drive and volume that\nwe're working with is called filesystem.\n\n107\n00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.660\nAnd then we'll do quick.\n\n108\n00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.330\nNow, With NTFS I want you to understand,\n\n109\n00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.990\nwe're doing FAT32 here, so this really\ndoesn't apply, but when you do an NTFS\n\n110\n00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.230\nformat, and you do quick, or you don't\ndo quick, well what's the difference?\n\n111\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.210\nWhen you run a quick, that says,\njust don't format it,\n\n112\n00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.780\ndon't erase the disk,\njust format right over it.\n\n113\n00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.920\nWhen you leave the quick off, it could\ntake a little bit longer, hence the option\n\n114\n00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.420\nfor quick, but what it does is it runs\na check disk before on every sector of\n\n115\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.450\nthat drive or in this case I guess it\nwouldn't benefit solid state drives and\n\n116\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.410\nit looks at those sectors and says\nare there any sectors that are damaged?\n\n117\n00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.980\nIf they are, let's go ahead and mark them\nas bad so we don't write to them, and\n\n118\n00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.120\nthen we'll come through and\nwe'll format them with file system.\n\n119\n00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.860\nSo the difference between the quick\noption and the lack of the quick options.\n\n120\n00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:02.170\nSo we'll go ahead and run this, and\nyou'll see we've formatted it to FAT32.\n\n121\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:07.010\nNow if we turn around and, I'll tell you\nwhat, we'll go ahead and do assign and\n\n122\n00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.922\nI'm just gonna let it the, let it give us\nthe next sequential drive letter in this\n\n123\n00:07:11.922 --> 00:07:14.043\ncase and then we'll do a list vol.\n\n124\n00:07:14.043 --> 00:07:19.026\nAll right, when we do our list vol here\nnow you can see we have our volume,\n\n125\n00:07:19.026 --> 00:07:22.420\nwe have our e drive,\nthe file system is FAT32.\n\n126\n00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.450\nAll right, now I've talked about\nsome of the limitations to FAT32 and\n\n127\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.260\ntalked a little bit about\nwhy we might use NTFS but\n\n128\n00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.470\nthere is another reason\nthat we might use NTFS.\n\n129\n00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.346\nSee NTFS, like other good file systems, is\nwhats known as a journal file system and\n\n130\n00:07:36.346 --> 00:07:39.203\nwhat that means is it has\nan isolated partition or\n\n131\n00:07:39.203 --> 00:07:43.196\nan isolated place on the disk that's\nheld by the master file table.\n\n132\n00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:46.842\nIt says let me go ahead and\nwrite that to that journal there and once\n\n133\n00:07:46.842 --> 00:07:51.353\nall the writes are committed and complete,\nand I know that they're accurate and\n\n134\n00:07:51.353 --> 00:07:55.464\nthey're consistent, then we'll write\nit over to the main file table and\n\n135\n00:07:55.464 --> 00:07:59.642\nit just gives you a way to ensure\nconsistency in your file infrastructure,\n\n136\n00:07:59.642 --> 00:08:01.281\nfile hierarchy if you will.\n\n137\n00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:02.113\nAll right.\n\n138\n00:08:02.113 --> 00:08:06.260\nNow, if you need to convert your disk,\nit's very easy.\n\n139\n00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.921\nIt's kinda like we were doing when we did,\nif you remember, if I put a,\n\n140\n00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:13.596\nlet me go ahead and back out of here so\nyou can see what we're doing here.\n\n141\n00:08:13.596 --> 00:08:16.641\nIf I do a help convert,\nthis is the way you practice it,\n\n142\n00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:19.503\nyou'll see we have a few options here,\nall right?\n\n143\n00:08:19.503 --> 00:08:24.660\nWe have the basic dynamic GBT and MBR.\n\n144\n00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.880\nNow, this convert is\na little bit different.\n\n145\n00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.980\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna back out of disc part, and\n\n146\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.440\nI want you to see something here.\n\n147\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.340\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna type exit.\n\n148\n00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.360\nAll right.\n\n149\n00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.610\nAnd then from here,\nI'm gonna type convert.\n\n150\n00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.700\nAnd notice that we get a different\nset of options, right?\n\n151\n00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.270\nDisk parts convert is completely\ndifferent than the convert\n\n152\n00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.786\ncommand that's native to\nthe command prompt, right?\n\n153\n00:08:48.786 --> 00:08:51.339\nAnd, again, in this case,\nwe're in PowerShell.\n\n154\n00:08:51.339 --> 00:08:54.190\nI want you to be careful with\nthat on the test, all right?\n\n155\n00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.650\nAgain, a lot of times they say choose two,\nchoose three, in a drag and\n\n156\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:02.670\ndrop situation, and say each choice\nrepresents a complete solution.\n\n157\n00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.630\nWell, if they mention\nthe disk part convert for\n\n158\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.110\nthe file system,\nyou're gonna get it wrong.\n\n159\n00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.760\nRemember, this is something\nthat's outside a disk part.\n\n160\n00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.400\nNow, it's fairly easy when we do this,\nall we have to do is convert,\n\n161\n00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.480\nand in this case,\nour drive letter e for us.\n\n162\n00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.900\nAnd we will do fs.\n\n163\n00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.990\nAnd then this is :ntfs.\n\n164\n00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.968\nJust like you can see it\nhere in the list here.\n\n165\n00:09:25.968 --> 00:09:27.123\nAll right?\n\n166\n00:09:27.123 --> 00:09:34.550\nAnd then, we can do the v if we want for\nverbose mode.\n\n167\n00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.680\nAnd then we can do the forward slash x,\nand again,\n\n168\n00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.060\nthis forces the volume to dismount\nbefore you run this option.\n\n169\n00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.935\nNow, I want you to know that just\nbecause you type the drive letter,\n\n170\n00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:49.570\nyou're not done here,\nyou have to know what the volume label is.\n\n171\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.360\nAnd if you remember,\nwe called it File System.\n\n172\n00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.570\nAnd when we run this,\nthe verbose mode says, okay,\n\n173\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.250\nlet me show you what's going on.\n\n174\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.270\nIf you guys have ever had to run Check\nDisk, and you reboot your computer and\n\n175\n00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.140\nit gives you that verbose output kinda\nlike on a splash screen, pre-boot screen.\n\n176\n00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.670\nWell, that's what its doing here.\n\n177\n00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.630\nNotice that it tells you exactly\nwhat's going on in the list, right?\n\n178\n00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.950\nTells you the current volume label, and\nit tells you when it was created, time.\n\n179\n00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.290\nSo it gives you a lot\nof extra information.\n\n180\n00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.790\nBut it's as simple as that.\n\n181\n00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:21.378\nAnd if I wanna check this out and\nsee if everything has\n\n182\n00:10:21.378 --> 00:10:26.740\ncompleted successfully, I'll just\njump back to disk part, all right.\n\n183\n00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.660\nAnd we're gonna do our list vol.\n\n184\n00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.910\nNow, if you look here,\nwe have volume three.\n\n185\n00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.770\nFILESYSTEM is now NTFS, right?\n\n186\n00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.400\nAnd it's healthy.\n\n187\n00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.710\nSo, it really isn't too difficult to\ndo a conversion inside of Windows.\n\n188\n00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.160\nNow, I will say something, all right?\n\n189\n00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.680\nFor our lab environment, I didn't have\nany information on the hard drive.\n\n190\n00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.740\nOkay?\n\n191\n00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.880\nWe have stressed here at ITProTV,\nanytime you do storage configuration,\n\n192\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.180\nyou do an operating system configuration,\n\n193\n00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.430\nyou implement a new feature,\nyou should be doing backups.\n\n194\n00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:02.170\nOkay?\n\n195\n00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.340\nIf I have data on this machine and\nI do the conversion,\n\n196\n00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.110\nI could potentially lose information.\n\n197\n00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.810\nSo, you wanna get that data off of there,\nget it on an external source, or\n\n198\n00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:15.722\nat least external to this drive, then you\nwanna make your modifications, all right?\n\n199\n00:11:15.722 --> 00:11:19.130\nRemember, I mean nothing can\nreally replace a good backup.\n\n200\n00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.740\nSo, Ronnie, you could see here,\nwhen it comes to the conversions,\n\n201\n00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.908\nfairly straightforward.\n\n202\n00:11:23.908 --> 00:11:26.200\nI will tell you, there's one other file\nsystem that we're gonna see a little bit\n\n203\n00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.620\nlater that we really don't see in Windows,\nclient side, if you will,\n\n204\n00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.790\nexcept for in one location called storage\nspaces, and that's a newer file system.\n\n205\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.590\nAnd it'll probably as it matures,\nit will probably replace ntfs.\n\n206\n00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.800\nAnd that's something called refs.\n\n207\n00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.560\nThat's the resilient file system.\n\n208\n00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.410\nIt has things like check disk built\nin to it, so its keeping track,\n\n209\n00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.792\nit keeps multiple tabs like we\nhad today with master file table.\n\n210\n00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:51.710\nSo, it's very, very resilient.\n\n211\n00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.990\nI know all pun intended.\n\n212\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.740\nBut we'll probably see that it's\ngoing to replace eventually.\n\n213\n00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.170\nIt isn't really completed.\n\n214\n00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.470\nIt isn't material yet.\n\n215\n00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.150\nThey've thrown it in there,\nand they haven't really\n\n216\n00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.870\nunlocked all of its features yet\nbecause it's still in development.\n\n217\n00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.251\nBut it is one that I just want\nyou to be aware of for the test.\n\n218\n00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:11.190\nAll right?\n\n219\n00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.070\nSo, that's got our conversion.\n\n220\n00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.226\nThe next thing I'd like to look\nat are attributes, all right?\n\n221\n00:12:16.226 --> 00:12:21.560\nWe talk about attributes in the aspect\nof a file looks at extension, right?\n\n222\n00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.980\nWe talked about like if you go back to our\nA plus shows, we talk about extensions and\n\n223\n00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.340\nwhat they do, right?\n\n224\n00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:31.050\nExtensions tell the operating system,\nokay, this is a data file, or\n\n225\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.330\nthis is a system file,\na configuration file.\n\n226\n00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.310\nThis is a multimedia format, right?\n\n227\n00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.965\nSo, it tells not only what the file\ntype is, but it also says, okay,\n\n228\n00:12:41.965 --> 00:12:43.925\nthis is the program you open it with.\n\n229\n00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:47.835\nNow, there is another\nset of characteristics,\n\n230\n00:12:47.835 --> 00:12:51.295\nhence attributes, I don't know how you can\nexplain that without saying attributes,\n\n231\n00:12:51.295 --> 00:12:56.060\nbut certain characteristics\nthat tell the operating system\n\n232\n00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.200\nthis is how you treat the file,\nnot what you open it up with,\n\n233\n00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.820\nnot what program it's associated with,\nbut this is how you treat the file.\n\n234\n00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.620\nAnd these are called attributes.\n\n235\n00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.750\nNow, I'm gonna drop out of the command\nprompt just for second, or the PowerShell,\n\n236\n00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.570\nand I wanna show you these in\nthe graphical user interface real quick\n\n237\n00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.690\ncuz maybe you've never seen them before.\n\n238\n00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.530\nI'm gonna pull up the properties here.\n\n239\n00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.250\nAnd when I pull up the properties,\n\n240\n00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:23.060\nyou'll notice down here at the bottom, in\nthe gooey I've got this attributes menu.\n\n241\n00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.870\nAnd it says I can choose read only,\n\n242\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.150\nhidden, or\nif I wanted I could go into advanced.\n\n243\n00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:33.460\nAnd in the advanced option,\nthere is an archiving attribute,\n\n244\n00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.930\nand there's a couple of special\nattributes that are specific to Windows.\n\n245\n00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:38.820\nOkay?\n\n246\n00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:44.690\nSo, when I, if I were to flag this\nfile as read-only, all right?\n\n247\n00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:49.132\nIt doesn't tell me that this is\njust associated with BGinfo, right?\n\n248\n00:13:49.132 --> 00:13:51.490\nThat this executable is called BGinfo.\n\n249\n00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.440\nIt also says that I can't\nmake modifications to it.\n\n250\n00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.510\nNow, if I choose Hidden,\nyou might notice over here,\n\n251\n00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.800\nthat bg.info completely disappeared.\n\n252\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.570\nIt's not there anymore, right?\n\n253\n00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.090\nBecause now what you're doing\nis you're taking the default\n\n254\n00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:09.000\nnature of File Explorer, which hides\nthese files, again, by default,\n\n255\n00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.019\nand says hide them from the graphical user\ninterface, we don't want to see them.\n\n256\n00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.470\nWell, how do I get to that?\n\n257\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.650\nIt's gone, right?\n\n258\n00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:20.340\nJust become a magician, and\nwe can't gain access to it.\n\n259\n00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.840\nWell, it's still there, and you can, but\nnow you have to drop back to the command\n\n260\n00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.940\nline to be able to see it and\nto be able to work with it.\n\n261\n00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.610\nSo, let's go ahead and do that, and\n\n262\n00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.620\nI'll show you a little bit more on\nthe command line what we're talking about.\n\n263\n00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.950\nNow, let me go ahead and\nI'm gonna exit out of disk part.\n\n264\n00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.920\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nnavigate to where we're located.\n\n265\n00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.370\nWe'll do a set location,\nand we'll go users and\n\n266\n00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.350\nthis is administrator, I believe.\n\n267\n00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:53.525\nYeah, and we'll do desktop, and\nwe'll do our dir, all right?\n\n268\n00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:58.450\nNow, let me just double-check, see, make\nsure that that's who I am logged in, yes,\n\n269\n00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.860\nokay, just making sure\nwho I was logged in as.\n\n270\n00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.443\nAll right.\nAnd I guess I could have gone whoami.\n\n271\n00:15:03.443 --> 00:15:06.121\nAll right, just wanna make sure\nI'm on the right account and\n\n272\n00:15:06.121 --> 00:15:08.870\non the right desktop in\nthe command prompt as well.\n\n273\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.010\nAlright, so, notice that I say dir.\n\n274\n00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.630\nIt doesn't show me anything, all right?\n\n275\n00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:18.850\nIf you're doing a Powershell command,\nit's just get-childitem.\n\n276\n00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.630\nIt's not showing me anything.\n\n277\n00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.220\nWhy?\n\n278\n00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.930\nWell, remember the hidden attribute?\n\n279\n00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.830\nWe've got a file on the desktop,\nbut it's hidden.\n\n280\n00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.320\nSo what we have to do is drop\ndown to a oldie but goodie,\n\n281\n00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.570\nit's been around in Windows for\na while, called a tread.\n\n282\n00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.030\nAnd if I run on a Trib,\n\n283\n00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:37.590\nwait a second, there are files on\nthe desktop, but we can't see them.\n\n284\n00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.750\nSee, File Explorer,\nyour graphical user interface,\n\n285\n00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.230\nhides these two files based\non its attributes, right?\n\n286\n00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.600\nIt's telling the operating\nsystem this is a hidden file.\n\n287\n00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.960\nRemember we just hid the bg.info,\n\n288\n00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.860\nthe executable for\nsysinternals from Microsoft?\n\n289\n00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.822\nWell, notice it has the H attribute.\n\n290\n00:15:54.822 --> 00:15:56.717\nIt's hidden I can't see it anymore.\n\n291\n00:15:56.717 --> 00:16:01.151\nBut if I decide to, and\nwe'll talk about that other one here in\n\n292\n00:16:01.151 --> 00:16:05.841\na second If I decide that I wanna\nback out of this PowerShell here,\n\n293\n00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:10.956\nI want you to pay attention, my head\nis kind of covering it up right now,\n\n294\n00:16:10.956 --> 00:16:15.986\nbut over there in just above this\nVMware folder, if I do an ATTRIB, and\n\n295\n00:16:15.986 --> 00:16:21.390\nI mean the file BG info, and I do a -h for\nhidden and I run that command.\n\n296\n00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:25.270\nYou will see all of a sudden,\nit's back, all right.\n\n297\n00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.200\nNow, why is that?\n\n298\n00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:31.490\nAgain, that's the attribute,\nnot a permission, it isn't an extension,\n\n299\n00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:36.960\nit's a characteristic that's telling this\noperating system, don't let us see that.\n\n300\n00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.940\nAll right, now,\nthere's another one up there, too.\n\n301\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.290\nRemember, when we run the attrib command,\nwe also had another file up here.\n\n302\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.360\nLet me go ahead and maximize that so\nyou guys can see it.\n\n303\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.180\nAnd it's got a whole slew\nof letters by it's name.\n\n304\n00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.860\nWell what is this?\n\n305\n00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.530\nThis is archive, remember in the graphical\nuser interface we showed you that\n\n306\n00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.410\nthere is an archive option?\n\n307\n00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.870\nWell this really has to do with you're\nWindows backup subsystem, your Windows\n\n308\n00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:05.190\nbackup subsystem uses the archive bits\nto determine what it needs to back up.\n\n309\n00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:09.040\nNow depending on an archive or\nwhat backup type you run\n\n310\n00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.290\nwill determine if that archive\nattribute will be cleared or not.\n\n311\n00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:16.150\nBut let's just say that for\nconversation purposes,\n\n312\n00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.040\nwhen I run a full backup,\nit clears all archive bits.\n\n313\n00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.430\nNow if it doesn't have\nthe full archive bit,\n\n314\n00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.900\nit means the last time I ran a full\nbackup, this file was included all right.\n\n315\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.760\nIf it does have the archive bit\nthat means it's been modified or\n\n316\n00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.400\ncreated since the last\ntime I ran a full backup.\n\n317\n00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.760\nSo it isn't telling the operating\nsystem launch it with this program,\n\n318\n00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:42.360\nit isn't saying it's a system file,\nit's telling the backup subsystem,\n\n319\n00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.170\nwhen you see this file,\ninclude it in your backup.\n\n320\n00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.860\nAll right, so hopefully that makes\na little bit more sense is that it's what\n\n321\n00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.700\nit's telling the operating system to do.\n\n322\n00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:55.380\nNow the next one here is really important,\nthis is the system attribute.\n\n323\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.450\nThe system attribute marks\nit as a system file.\n\n324\n00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:03.801\nNow again,\ndon't confuse system file with .sys,\n\n325\n00:18:03.801 --> 00:18:07.110\n.dll, we see a lot of these\nin our system files, right?\n\n326\n00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.470\nDynamic link library files,\nINF files for drivers,\n\n327\n00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.300\nwe see .SYS, those are extensions.\n\n328\n00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:21.030\nAny file could be flagged with the S\nattribute and be denoted as a system file.\n\n329\n00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.420\nLet me show you.\n\n330\n00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:27.050\nSo let me go ahead and\nI'm just gonna right click here, and\n\n331\n00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:30.950\nI'm gonna choose text document and\nI'm gonna say,\n\n332\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:35.380\nthis is my system file.\n\n333\n00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.150\nAnd because of the spaces,\nthat'll be great in the command prompt.\n\n334\n00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:43.980\nAll right now, if I do a dir,\nI have this is\n\n335\n00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.540\nmy system file but\nnotice it's a .txt extension, all right.\n\n336\n00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:55.970\nNow if I do A-T-T-R-I-B, sure enough,\nyou'll see the archive attribute.\n\n337\n00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.210\nAnd I'll tell you what,\nthat's bugging the heck out of me so\n\n338\n00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.935\nlemme take the space out.\n\n339\n00:18:59.935 --> 00:19:05.550\n[LAUGH] Spaces in the names of your files,\nI can tell you, can give you a hard time\n\n340\n00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.500\nin the command prompt if you don't like\nputting quotes in front of everything.\n\n341\n00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.090\nAnd, again,\n\n342\n00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.025\nI'm just a little OCD on that Let's\nrun that attrib option one more time.\n\n343\n00:19:13.025 --> 00:19:16.980\nWe'll get that up to towards the top and\nyou can see.\n\n344\n00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:22.390\nNotice that I have the a attribute next\nto it, I don't have a system attribute.\n\n345\n00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.480\nBut, if I decide I want to do that, I can.\n\n346\n00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:32.169\nI can do attrib, I can say this is,\ntab it out, this is my system file.\n\n347\n00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.320\nAnd I could do a +s.\n\n348\n00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.300\nWell Ronnie I tell you, man,\nwasn't that absolutely amazing,\n\n349\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.490\ndoesn't look like it did anything.\n\n350\n00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:46.560\nSo if we clear this out a little bit and\nI rerun that attrib option, or\n\n351\n00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:53.960\ncommand I should say, now you can see\nthat it has the system attribute.\n\n352\n00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.640\nWell, notice that the system attribute is\nregardless of what the file extension is.\n\n353\n00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.070\nSo keep that in mind, it tells\nthe operating system, protect this.\n\n354\n00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:07.390\nProtect this, if this file is modified,\nit's going to hurt you.\n\n355\n00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.080\nBut we're not done there,\n\n356\n00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.890\nwe've got a couple more that we can do as\nwell when it comes to files, all right.\n\n357\n00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:17.530\nWhat if I decide that I don't\nwant anybody modifying that file?\n\n358\n00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:23.042\nWell let me go ahead real quick and\nI'll remove the system attribute, again,\n\n359\n00:20:23.042 --> 00:20:28.410\njust a minus vs a plus, and let me go\nahead and change this and we'll do a +r.\n\n360\n00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.580\nWell that was my file I just created it,\nright?\n\n361\n00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.500\nAnd if you've seen some of our other\nepisodes where they go in to things like\n\n362\n00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:40.420\nData Security permissions,\nthe owner of an object, DACL,\n\n363\n00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.710\nDiscretionary Access Control.\n\n364\n00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.740\nI'm the owner, I have full control, right?\n\n365\n00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.110\nSo if I check out my properties and\nI go up to my security and\n\n366\n00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.330\nI look at the ACL that's on here.\n\n367\n00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.630\nNotice that administrators and\n\n368\n00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:01.070\nadministrator have full control, and\nif you know about your permissions,\n\n369\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:05.060\nremember full control means I should\nbe able to type in this document.\n\n370\n00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.600\nLet's see if that's true or not.\n\n371\n00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.065\nAll right, so let's go ahead,\nwe'll come out here, close this down, and\n\n372\n00:21:11.065 --> 00:21:14.740\nwe're going to open up\nmy text document here.\n\n373\n00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:19.550\nWe are going to say\nthis is my system text.\n\n374\n00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:23.700\nAnd we will do a Control S to save but\n\n375\n00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.860\nit is giving me the Save As,\nwell,maybe I hit the wrong shortcut.\n\n376\n00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:33.600\nSo, I will go up to File and\nI'm going to do \"save\", and\n\n377\n00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.890\nyet again it's giving me the Save As,\nall right.\n\n378\n00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:39.670\nWell that's because,\nif I try to save it as this file,\n\n379\n00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.990\nit's going to say well wait a second,\nthere's already this system file here.\n\n380\n00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.910\nDo you want to replace\nit with this same file?\n\n381\n00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:47.680\nWe'll say yes.\n\n382\n00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.550\nNotice what it says\nthis is my system file.\n\n383\n00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.060\nThis file is set to read-only.\n\n384\n00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.500\nTry again with a different name.\n\n385\n00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.590\nKeep in mind, if I do this with\na different name, it isn't the same file.\n\n386\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.910\nIt's a different file you're creating,\na copy.\n\n387\n00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:05.425\nSo I want you to also know that on\nthe exam, just in case they give you\n\n388\n00:22:05.425 --> 00:22:10.375\nan option where they say, you've got\nthe full control permission but for\n\n389\n00:22:10.375 --> 00:22:14.195\nwhatever reason, the person can't make\nany modifications to the document.\n\n390\n00:22:14.195 --> 00:22:16.285\nAnd they give you a command prompt or\na PowerShell and\n\n391\n00:22:16.285 --> 00:22:20.825\nshow you that, remember the read\nonly archive, or excuse me,\n\n392\n00:22:20.825 --> 00:22:24.381\nI'm sorry, read only attribute\ntrumps all permissions.\n\n393\n00:22:24.381 --> 00:22:27.820\nIt says, I don't care what the access\ncontrol is, as the system,\n\n394\n00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.040\nI look at the attribute, and\n\n395\n00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.590\nthe attribute says read-only,\nregardless of what your permissions are.\n\n396\n00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.560\nAll right, so that should give\nyou a little bit of an idea.\n\n397\n00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.415\nWe can look at some other files too,\nlike system files and stuff.\n\n398\n00:22:39.415 --> 00:22:43.131\nLet's drop down to the user\nprofile real quick, and\n\n399\n00:22:43.131 --> 00:22:45.669\nlet me show you a couple more files.\n\n400\n00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:50.193\nSo I'll get down here,\nwe'll go into local disk C, Users,\n\n401\n00:22:50.193 --> 00:22:53.510\nand I'm the administrator here.\n\n402\n00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:59.240\nAnd notice that, and I'm in the profile,\nif you aren't familiar with the profile\n\n403\n00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.758\nlocation, this is\nthe administrator profile.\n\n404\n00:23:01.758 --> 00:23:07.590\nNow, there again there's files that I see,\nare folders that I don't see.\n\n405\n00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:14.310\nSee, files explorers default view,\nif we open up our file and folder options,\n\n406\n00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:18.170\nor folder options and chose view one\nof the things that you're gonna notice,\n\n407\n00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:23.780\nis that it says by default here don't show\nhidden files, folders, or drives right.\n\n408\n00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:28.305\nBut if I move the radio button and\nI apply that,\n\n409\n00:23:28.305 --> 00:23:32.639\nnow we're no longer,\n\n410\n00:23:32.639 --> 00:23:38.650\nwe're not really looking or caring\nanymore about that hidden attribute.\n\n411\n00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.330\nIt's saying,\nI know the default is to hide these, but\n\n412\n00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.020\nnow we don't care about it anymore.\n\n413\n00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.940\nAll right, so you can see how it\nkinda works in the GUI as well.\n\n414\n00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.480\nAnd there's one other location\nthat I wanted to look at and\n\n415\n00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.400\nthat's in Users there.\n\n416\n00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.634\nLet me see here.\n\n417\n00:23:55.634 --> 00:23:59.340\nFor instance, there's Default,\njust a couple of locations there.\n\n418\n00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.442\nDefault as well, the Default profile.\n\n419\n00:24:01.442 --> 00:24:02.932\nThese are all hidden folders.\n\n420\n00:24:02.932 --> 00:24:04.861\nThese are hidden files.\n\n421\n00:24:04.861 --> 00:24:08.788\nMicrosoft doesn't think you really need to\nbe manipulating them or messing with them\n\n422\n00:24:08.788 --> 00:24:12.290\nunless you are an administrator so you\nmight have to come in here and do that.\n\n423\n00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:17.030\nSo I kind of mentioned that the file\nexplorer there all in the same\n\n424\n00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:21.540\ncontext because it really is looking and\nmodifying those attributes as well.\n\n425\n00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:28.160\nAll right, so one of the last things\nthat we're gonna do here inside of our\n\n426\n00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:33.650\nconfigure storage episode, is we're gonna\nlook a little bit at storage pools.\n\n427\n00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.870\nNow, when it comes to storage pools,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n428\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:41.650\nlet's go back to my computer real quick\nand we'll drop down to Control Panel.\n\n429\n00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.294\nWe're going to go to system and\n\n430\n00:24:43.294 --> 00:24:48.350\nsecurity and then we're gonna look at\nthis location here, storage spaces.\n\n431\n00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:52.390\nAlright now, storage spaces is\nan interesting technology, right.\n\n432\n00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.440\nWe have looked at basically\nsoftware level raid for\n\n433\n00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:59.870\nredundancy if you will default tolerance,\nnot default tolerance and mirrors.\n\n434\n00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.540\nWe looked at the stripe and\nthat gives you better performance.\n\n435\n00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.060\nAnd span is like JVOD, right?\n\n436\n00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.340\nWell, the limitation to that is\nthat it has to be internal disks.\n\n437\n00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.710\nNow, they can be virtualized disks.\n\n438\n00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.470\nThey work on virtual disks,\nthey work on internal disks, but\n\n439\n00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.510\nthey have to be internal disks.\n\n440\n00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:16.170\nAlright.\n\n441\n00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:20.670\nImagine a technology that allows you to\naggregate your storage devices together,\n\n442\n00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.680\nand it doesn't just have\nto be internal drives.\n\n443\n00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.240\nI can plug in USB drives.\n\n444\n00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.430\nIt works with SAS drives,\nwith scuzzy drives, with SATA drives.\n\n445\n00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:33.650\nAnd, I can aggregate them together\nin one massive storage container.\n\n446\n00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.820\nThat's what we can do with storage pools.\n\n447\n00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.240\nThe first thing that we have to do,\nis we have to create a pool.\n\n448\n00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.882\nThis is gonna grab these\ndisks that we want and\n\n449\n00:25:40.882 --> 00:25:45.040\nit's gonna put them together\nas a single storage container.\n\n450\n00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.980\nAll right, and then after that,\nwe're gonna create these logical or\n\n451\n00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.990\nvirtualized containers in the side of this\nbig pool of hard drives that we have.\n\n452\n00:25:53.990 --> 00:26:00.960\nNow, I do wanna make mention of this, keep\nin mind, if you're on the exam you will\n\n453\n00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.520\nsee I have some formatted drives here, and\nthey're telling you, now wait a second.\n\n454\n00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.310\nYou might not wanna do this\nbecause this contains files,\n\n455\n00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:13.760\nand if you put it as part of the storage\npool, it's gonna erase it, or format it.\n\n456\n00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.970\nThe other thing to keep in mind is,\n\n457\n00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.920\nstorage pools do not\nwork on dynamic disks.\n\n458\n00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.630\nThey have to be basic disks or\nyou won't even see them in this list.\n\n459\n00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.870\nThat's another thing for\nthe exam if they ask you that.\n\n460\n00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:24.790\nSo we're gonna go ahead.\n\n461\n00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:27.210\nWe're not going to check that one\nthat one that we just formatted.\n\n462\n00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.840\nWe're go ahead and leave that one alone.\n\n463\n00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.320\nBut I do have three disks here that I am\ngoing to include in the storage pool.\n\n464\n00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.460\nNow down here at the bottom\nwe're going to go ahead, and\n\n465\n00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.089\nwe will just choose create pool.\n\n466\n00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.720\nAnd we'll do that.\n\n467\n00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.140\nNow, so what have we done here?\n\n468\n00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:45.530\nWe've taken those drives and we've\nbasically aggregated them together and\n\n469\n00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:50.680\nnow what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ncreate these logical divisions inside.\n\n470\n00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.350\nWhere are they held?\n\n471\n00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.650\nI don't know, and that's the great thing.\n\n472\n00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.400\nI don't have to know.\n\n473\n00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:01.010\nAs long as I have enough space in\nthe pool, I can create multiple\n\n474\n00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:05.890\nvirtual containers, and\nthose are called the storage spaces.\n\n475\n00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.110\nNow, when it comes to storage spaces,\nyou got a few options,\n\n476\n00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.800\ndepending on how many drives you have.\n\n477\n00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.240\nI have the option to do simple.\n\n478\n00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.190\nThat's no resiliency.\n\n479\n00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:18.110\nAnd what that means is it's just\nlike JBOD for an external and\n\n480\n00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.370\ninternal disks as well.\n\n481\n00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.385\nI also have the ability to do\na two-way mirror, all right?\n\n482\n00:27:23.385 --> 00:27:27.840\nTwo-way mirror requires two disks minimum,\nokay?\n\n483\n00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.500\nKeep that in mind for the exam.\n\n484\n00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.720\nIf you want to loose at least one drive,\n\n485\n00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.330\nand still be good, you need at least\ntwo disks for a two-way mirror.\n\n486\n00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:44.240\nIf you want to loose two drives,\nyou need a five disk two-way mirror.\n\n487\n00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.142\nNow you also have three-way mirror.\n\n488\n00:27:47.142 --> 00:27:49.580\nNow three-way mirror is\ngonna get even more,\n\n489\n00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:53.489\nif you look at three-way mirror,\nyou need at least five drives.\n\n490\n00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.670\nLast one is the parity space.\n\n491\n00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.410\nWhen you look at the parity space,\n\n492\n00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:04.060\nthe parity space requires three\ndrives just to be able to use one.\n\n493\n00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.938\nNow you say, wait a second Wes,\nyou're telling me mirrored?\n\n494\n00:28:06.938 --> 00:28:09.510\nIt takes two and I can lose one, but\n\n495\n00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:12.830\nyet parity requires an extra\ndrive just to lose one?\n\n496\n00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:15.140\nSo why would I choose one over the other?\n\n497\n00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.710\nWell, what we haven't done is\nscroll down to the bottom.\n\n498\n00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:21.500\nI want you to notice that when\nI have the same three drives,\n\n499\n00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:28.490\ndepending on what I picked,\nmy total capacity including resiliency\n\n500\n00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:34.020\nis gonna take up 44 gigs of these three\ndrives that we just put together.\n\n501\n00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.320\nOkay, if I decide that I wanna do a parity\n\n502\n00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:45.720\nwith these three, notice what it's\ntaking up on my drive, only 27 gigs.\n\n503\n00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:52.380\nSo parity spaces allow you to take more\nefficient utilization of the capacity that\n\n504\n00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:57.640\nyou have, but it's not as resilient\nto failure as the two-way mirror.\n\n505\n00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.880\nPlease keep that in mind for the exam.\n\n506\n00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.760\nThe other things that you can do as\nwell when you are doing mirrored spaces,\n\n507\n00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.500\nremember we talked about REFS?\n\n508\n00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:12.476\nWell this is where it\nstarts to show its face.\n\n509\n00:29:12.476 --> 00:29:16.480\nWith a two-way mirror I can benefit and\n\n510\n00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.130\nadd more resiliency over\nthe parity by using REFS.\n\n511\n00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.610\nNow that is up to you.\n\n512\n00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:28.250\nThe other thing that we can do is down\nhere at the bottom, pool capacity.\n\n513\n00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.950\nNotice that it says\nthe maximum size is 22 gigs?\n\n514\n00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.340\nWhat if I decide I'm gonna put a terabyte?\n\n515\n00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.710\nI could put a terabyte there, right?\n\n516\n00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.500\nI can do what's known as\nthin provisioning, and\n\n517\n00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.940\neven though I don't have\na terabyte of drives in here\n\n518\n00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.200\nI can add drives later, right?\n\n519\n00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.090\nYou can do thin provisioning that says I'm\ngoing to use only the space that I have\n\n520\n00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:49.260\nnow, and\nwhen that space starts to accumulate,\n\n521\n00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:54.900\nI start to accumulate too much files\non there, I can add in other drives.\n\n522\n00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.220\nAnd again, guys, it can be as simple as\nplugging in another USB drive, right?\n\n523\n00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:04.900\nIf you've got one of these desktops now\ntoday that have 15 USB ports on them,\n\n524\n00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.660\nwell then you could plug in as many drives\nas you need and the parity space or\n\n525\n00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.660\nthe mirror would handle.\n\n526\n00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:17.020\nStorage spaces would handle moving that\nstuff, that information to each drive and\n\n527\n00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.000\nyou could reach out,\nyou could pull one drive.\n\n528\n00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.790\nSimulate a drive failure and all of\nyour data is moved to the other drive.\n\n529\n00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:25.580\nSo that's one of the great\nthings about storage spaces.\n\n530\n00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:29.850\nSo I tell you what,\nwe'll go ahead and we're gonna just,\n\n531\n00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:34.310\nwe'll leave this to the,\nwhat did it say it was here?\n\n532\n00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.220\nLet me back up just a second.\n\n533\n00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.549\nAnd if you ever need to refresh it,\njust back out of it.\n\n534\n00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:43.060\nAnd then you can change the settings,\nand I wanna talk a little bit about\n\n535\n00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.050\nthese settings too, so\nyou know what's going on here.\n\n536\n00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.420\nI can add drives to the pool,\njust like we said right here, and\n\n537\n00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.900\nI can also create a storage space.\n\n538\n00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.280\nNow we'll go ahead and\nleave the storage space.\n\n539\n00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.380\nWe'll go ahead and create this.\n\n540\n00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.070\nIt's creating it for us.\n\n541\n00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:59.970\nAnd now, notice how much of\nmy pool I'm currently using.\n\n542\n00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.630\nRight, four gigs.\n\n543\n00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:02.260\nSo what is that?\n\n544\n00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:07.120\nThat is a logical container inside\nof this larger pool that we have and\n\n545\n00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:12.680\nwe can start to dice it up anyway we see\nfit as long as we're not out of space.\n\n546\n00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.180\nAll right.\n\n547\n00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.190\nNow, couple other things\nI want you to know.\n\n548\n00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.230\nNotice that deleting\nthe pool can not happen.\n\n549\n00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:25.080\nThis is another operating procedure I\nwant you to be aware of for the exam.\n\n550\n00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.630\nYou can't delete a pool.\n\n551\n00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:27.940\nAnd on an exam, if they ask you,\n\n552\n00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:30.830\nthe first thing you have to\ndelete is your storage space.\n\n553\n00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.820\nYou delete your storage space.\n\n554\n00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.410\nAll right.\n\n555\n00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.200\nWe'll go ahead and\ndelete the storage space.\n\n556\n00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:35.897\nIt's gone.\n\n557\n00:31:37.688 --> 00:31:40.388\n[LAUGH] In a bit here.\n\n558\n00:31:40.388 --> 00:31:43.500\nAnd now,\nnotice how the delete pool comes back.\n\n559\n00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.050\nAll right?\nSo\n\n560\n00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:46.140\nkeep that in mind just on\nthe exam if they ask you.\n\n561\n00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.361\nNow I don't wanna delete that pool\nhere cuz I kinda wanna show you\n\n562\n00:31:49.361 --> 00:31:52.357\nwhat the storage space looks\nlike inside of File Explorer.\n\n563\n00:31:52.357 --> 00:31:54.174\nWe'll go ahead and just create it again.\n\n564\n00:31:55.839 --> 00:32:00.260\nAnd let's open up File Explorer.\n\n565\n00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:04.980\nAnd you can see here,\nwe have our storage space.\n\n566\n00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.320\nNotice that we have the drive that\nwe were working with earlier.\n\n567\n00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.850\nNotice that storage space\nshows up as F: drive.\n\n568\n00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.350\nIt looks like a single\ncontiguous container to us.\n\n569\n00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:17.460\nAlthough you and\nI know now that we've created it,\n\n570\n00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.010\nthat under the hood it's\nactually three drives.\n\n571\n00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.670\nThree different drives that are attached\nto the machine and one of the great things\n\n572\n00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.395\nabout storage space is if one\nof those drives starts to fail,\n\n573\n00:32:26.395 --> 00:32:31.500\nprovided you've got it configured right,\nstorage spaces will\n\n574\n00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:36.640\nstart moving that data to another drive\njust so you don't lose your information.\n\n575\n00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.510\nSo, when it comes to the storage space,\n\n576\n00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.500\nI can tell you a couple of\nother things we could do.\n\n577\n00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.920\nWe could create a parity space.\n\n578\n00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.340\nI know we're kinda running out of time on\nthis one, Ron is giving me the evil eye\n\n579\n00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.010\nover here [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n580\n00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:49.300\n>> I tell you what, let's go ahead and\n\n581\n00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.920\nsee if we can do this one more time,\nwe'll just do a parity space real quick.\n\n582\n00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:55.540\nAll right, and\n\n583\n00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:00.250\nI want you to notice that with parity\nspace you don't get the option of REFS.\n\n584\n00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:03.200\nThat's another thing for the exam,\nremember that REFS is only\n\n585\n00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.480\nsomething that is available when\nyou configure a mirrored space.\n\n586\n00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.680\nSo we'll call this Parity.\n\n587\n00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:17.460\nWe'll jump back and we'll choose\ncreate space, create storage space.\n\n588\n00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.540\nIt'll assign the letter for us.\n\n589\n00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.460\nNow we have two pools and\nwe can even look down here and\n\n590\n00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.509\nwe can do,\nwe can see physical drives, right?\n\n591\n00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.900\nNotice that I don't get the ability to\ndo anything with the drives once they're\n\n592\n00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:29.570\na part of the pool.\n\n593\n00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:30.960\nAll I can do is rename them.\n\n594\n00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.780\nSo again, more things that you need to be\naware of when it comes to storage spaces.\n\n595\n00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.780\nStorage spaces are really cool technology,\nguys.\n\n596\n00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.120\nI encourage you to try it out.\n\n597\n00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.840\nI encourage you to practice with it.\n\n598\n00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.410\nUse it.\n\n599\n00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:45.750\nIt's very nice if you've got these\nold drives that are laying around.\n\n600\n00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:46.750\nI don't know about you Ronnie,\n\n601\n00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.890\nbut Ronnie's gonna laugh on this\none cuz he knows me all too well.\n\n602\n00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:54.475\nIf you've got old devices laying around,\nwhich I have plenty, you can [INAUDIBLE]\n\n603\n00:33:54.475 --> 00:33:59.485\nlike external cases with USB connections,\nplug them into one of\n\n604\n00:33:59.485 --> 00:34:03.885\nyour Windows 10 boxes and you could create\na storage space and you could start to use\n\n605\n00:34:03.885 --> 00:34:07.495\nthose drives again that would otherwise\nbe sitting on the shelf collecting dust.\n\n606\n00:34:07.495 --> 00:34:09.420\nSo very cool technology.\n\n607\n00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.800\nGlad to see it in here.\n\n608\n00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.440\nI'm glad it gives us other\nstorage options there, Ronnie.\n\n609\n00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.740\n>> Well, thank you,\nWes, for helping us and\n\n610\n00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:18.880\nreminding us that we have different\noptions inside of Windows 10 for\n\n611\n00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.220\nconfiguring some of the storage\nthat we have available to us.\n\n612\n00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:26.030\nA lot of times, we do need to know some of\nthe very basics that we have to understand\n\n613\n00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:30.930\nabout, of course putting files onto our\ncomputers and that begins with the idea of\n\n614\n00:34:30.930 --> 00:34:34.740\nformatting and understanding the file\nsystem that we're gonna be running.\n\n615\n00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.160\nThere are some limitation with FAT32 that\n\n616\n00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.660\nmost of the times NTFS is\ngoing to help us out with.\n\n617\n00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:44.030\nThe other thing that we also took\na little look at is of course the idea of\n\n618\n00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.300\nfile attributes.\n\n619\n00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.260\nRemember to take a look\nat that attrib command.\n\n620\n00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.280\nMake sure you do know what that attrib\ncommand actually helps you to do, and know\n\n621\n00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.470\nthe difference between the minus and the\npluses with those different letters that\n\n622\n00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:59.480\nyou have to have available for you for\nthe exam.That is also gonna be helpful.\n\n623\n00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.320\nAnd then lastly, West also showed us\nthis idea of using storage spaces\n\n624\n00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.170\nto be able to aggregate our\nstorage devices together,\n\n625\n00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:10.280\nso that we can chop it up and divide it up\nthe way that we want to as well, and that\n\n626\n00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.910\nway we can effectively use our storage the\nway that we need to inside of Windows 10.\n\n627\n00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:17.270\nWell that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n628\n00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.540\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n629\n00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.380\n>> And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n630\n00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:25.015\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows 10 shows to come.\n\n631\n00:35:25.015 -->

00:00:19.165\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong And today we're\ntaking a look at our Windows 10 show.\n\n4\n00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:23.810\nWe're specifically into the 70-698 series,\ntrying to get ready for\n\n5\n00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.870\nthat exam and we are moving into\nthe realm of implementing apps.\n\n6\n00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.300\nAnd who better to help us than well, Mr.\nWindows 10 himself, Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.670\nWelcome back to our show Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.460\n>> Hey, how you doing Ronnie and\nthanks for having me here.\n\n9\n00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.330\nThat's right we're back\ninto implementing apps and\n\n10\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.970\nwe're gonna basically just start\nwith applications in general.\n\n11\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.910\nNow couple of things I wanna keep\nin your mind is that when Windows\n\n12\n00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.140\n8 came out it introduced a whole\ndifferent set of applications for us.\n\n13\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.470\nKeep in mind we still have\nthe traditional 32-bit apps but\n\n14\n00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.490\nwe also have a new application interface\ntoday called the Windows RT API and\n\n15\n00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.170\nthat's what runs these Windows Store apps.\n\n16\n00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.510\nWe are going to look at\ninstalling the apps locally.\n\n17\n00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.390\nAnd we're going to look at\na couple of the commands.\n\n18\n00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.160\nBecause well when it comes to\napplications, installation for\n\n19\n00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.900\nthe most part is fairly simple today.\n\n20\n00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.040\nLet me show you what I mean right here.\n\n21\n00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.740\nI actually have the Windows,\nor excuse me, not Windows, but\n\n22\n00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.530\nthis the Office Professional Plus\n2016 ISO here.\n\n23\n00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.970\nAnd I just want to show you that its nice.\n\n24\n00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.870\nI remember when I first started getting\ninto computing, you had to go out and\n\n25\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.750\nif you wanted to mount an ISO so that you\ncan install it without having a optical\n\n26\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.550\ndrive, you had to get a third\nparty in order to do this.\n\n27\n00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.655\nWell today it's as simple as\njust right-clicking on it and\n\n28\n00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:33.755\nchoosing Mount right?\n\n29\n00:01:33.755 --> 00:01:37.275\nWe do that and\nwe get access to the setup.exe and\n\n30\n00:01:37.275 --> 00:01:42.045\nif we look at this PC here we can see\nit just like any other drive itself.\n\n31\n00:01:42.045 --> 00:01:45.930\nI know my head's kinda covering that up,\nlet me move that to the side there.\n\n32\n00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.820\nAnd notice that if I wanted to, well,\n\n33\n00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.870\nI can start the installer\nprocess from right here.\n\n34\n00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.050\nNow that's a setup.exe fairly\neasy to install, however,\n\n35\n00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.480\nthat's probably not gonna be the way that\nthey're gonna ask you on the exam, right?\n\n36\n00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.590\nYou guys have probably installed\nan application or two.\n\n37\n00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.433\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ndrop down to our command line, and\n\n38\n00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:09.974\nwe're gonna show you a utility that allows\nyou to manage and maintain your MSI files.\n\n39\n00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:13.522\nMSI files are gonna be used typically\nin things like deployment inside\n\n40\n00:02:13.522 --> 00:02:14.371\na group policy.\n\n41\n00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:16.941\nIt's a way that you can\npublish applications and\n\n42\n00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:19.330\ndeploy them to different machines.\n\n43\n00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.906\nBut we also want you to know how to, for\nthe exam purposes, how to install them\n\n44\n00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:26.828\nlocally and that starts out with something\nknown as the Windows Installer Service.\n\n45\n00:02:26.828 --> 00:02:30.820\nAnd it runs by default in the background\nwhen you click on one of these\n\n46\n00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.740\nexecutables.\n\n47\n00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.580\nNow if you have an MSI file,\nit's also handling installing the MSIs.\n\n48\n00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.300\nLet's go ahead, I tell you what,\nlet's drop down to our command line and\n\n49\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.580\nlet's look at that process here.\n\n50\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.150\nI'm gonna go ahead, in fact,\nI've already got PowerShell launched up.\n\n51\n00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.860\nKeep in mind that, like we've been talking\nabout with some of the other command line\n\n52\n00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.700\ninterpreters, if I type msiexec and\nI do a forward slash question mark.\n\n53\n00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.360\nThis is a little VB script here that\nyou can see that it's running and\n\n54\n00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.660\nit gives you a series of options.\n\n55\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.200\nNotice that I am in PowerShell but\n\n56\n00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.450\nif I decide that I want to drop down\nto command prompt and I put msiexec and\n\n57\n00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.830\nI do a forward slash question mark,\nnotice that the dialogue box comes up.\n\n58\n00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.660\nSo on the exam I want you\nto keep that in mind.\n\n59\n00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.840\nIt doesn't really matter which of these\ncommand line interpreters you are in here.\n\n60\n00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.540\nLet me go ahead and exit out of that and\nget back into PowerShell.\n\n61\n00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.040\nNow I will tell you, when you go to\ninstall these, there's a couple of options\n\n62\n00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.060\nthat I want you to know, and kind of how\nto utilize this in your own environment.\n\n63\n00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.670\nNow by default let's go ahead and let's\nlook at what we've got on the C:, and\n\n64\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.060\nI've got an MSI file already\ndropped on C: here and\n\n65\n00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.400\nthis is actually the Google for\nenterprise.\n\n66\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.880\nIt's an MSI file that they allow you to\ndownload so that if you want to distribute\n\n67\n00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.560\nthis web browser inside of your\ncorporate environment, you can do that.\n\n68\n00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.810\nSo If I do a get child\nitem here we can see\n\n69\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.110\nthat I've got the Google Chrome standalone\nenterprise 64-bit installer here.\n\n70\n00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.310\nNow this is something to keep in mind.\n\n71\n00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.300\nLet me show you something here.\n\n72\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.370\nIf I go to install this, I'd use msiexec,\nI'd do a forward slash and\n\n73\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.150\nI'd do an i option.\n\n74\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.900\nNow some of you guys have probably,\nif you've worked with the PowerShell,\n\n75\n00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.940\nyou know that it does have this autofill.\n\n76\n00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.840\nMaybe you've worked in the command prompt,\nalso has an autofill.\n\n77\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.690\nIf you type a file,\nthe first couple of letters, and\n\n78\n00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.328\nyou hit the tab functionality,\nwhat does it do?\n\n79\n00:04:24.328 --> 00:04:27.030\nWell, it fills it in for you.\n\n80\n00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.890\nBut let me show you some of the problems\nwith Microsoft having to maintain two\n\n81\n00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.240\ndifferent kinds of\ncommand line interfaces.\n\n82\n00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.100\nBecause if I was to type g for\nGoogle here, right, and I was to do a tab,\n\n83\n00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.830\nwell this is typically the way we could\nfind locations inside of PowerShell.\n\n84\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.570\nLet me give you an example here,\nfor instance if I wanted to\n\n85\n00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.950\ngo to a different location,\nright, I could do Set-Location,\n\n86\n00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.550\nI could do for instance Program Files,\nI could hit tab like this, right.\n\n87\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.610\nNow I'm in Program Files, and you can see\nthat relative path right there, that dot.\n\n88\n00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.280\nWell we use that in PowerShell,\npretty much a lot of the time,\n\n89\n00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.160\nmost of the time here, and you certainly\ndon't have to but it makes it easier.\n\n90\n00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.650\nLet me show you where this\nkinda gets lost in translation.\n\n91\n00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.536\nAnd one of the good ways to show\nyou that is right down in msiexec.\n\n92\n00:05:20.536 --> 00:05:25.889\nSo we're gonna go ahead and msiexec,\nto let you know what it is,\n\n93\n00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.170\nit is the Windows installer program,\nif you will.\n\n94\n00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.730\nAnd it's based\n\n95\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.200\noff of the Windows installer\nservice running in the background.\n\n96\n00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.200\nAnd if I decide that I want to choose the\nforward slash i option, which basically\n\n97\n00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.420\njust says install if you can remember that\nfor the exam forward slash i is install.\n\n98\n00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.690\nAnd I decide to use that relative path,\n\n99\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.940\nif you will here, just by doing the g and\nthen hitting tab.\n\n100\n00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.460\nNotice that it does fill it in for\n\n101\n00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.880\nme, I don't have to worry about\ntyping this big long path.\n\n102\n00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.960\nAnd then well when I run it\nunfortunately we get a problem here.\n\n103\n00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.780\nIt says install package\ncould not be opened,\n\n104\n00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.820\nverify that the package exists and\nyou have access to it.\n\n105\n00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.330\nWell I just showed you guys right?\n\n106\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.980\nLet's make sure that I do have\nit in this location here, right?\n\n107\n00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.680\nSo if I say for\n\n108\n00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.605\ninstance, get child item here, well it's\nright there, I just showed you that.\n\n109\n00:06:19.605 --> 00:06:21.515\nSo here's something that to keep in mind.\n\n110\n00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:23.675\nNow if I go into command prompt right, and\n\n111\n00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:26.305\nI do this same thing, and\nwe'll just do our CLS here.\n\n112\n00:06:26.305 --> 00:06:28.781\nAnd I decide that I'm gonna run msiexec.\n\n113\n00:06:28.781 --> 00:06:30.572\nI'm gonna do a forward slash.\n\n114\n00:06:30.572 --> 00:06:33.702\nNothing has changed by the way guys,\ni for install.\n\n115\n00:06:33.702 --> 00:06:36.062\nI do the g, and\nnow it feels it in for me, right?\n\n116\n00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:40.532\nIt's using a relative path because I'm\nalready in C: and I could put C:\\.\n\n117\n00:06:40.532 --> 00:06:41.792\nAnd when I run this I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n118\n00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:45.422\ncancel it, notice that the installer\nfires right off, all right?\n\n119\n00:06:45.422 --> 00:06:48.702\nNow I'll probably have to go back and\nuninstall this because sometimes if you\n\n120\n00:06:48.702 --> 00:06:52.590\ndon't catch it fast enough, it'll go\nthrough the complete installation process.\n\n121\n00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.620\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised if I\njust went ahead and installed that.\n\n122\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.630\nBut notice that it doesn't\ntranslate inside a PowerShell.\n\n123\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.265\nSo you have to be careful with that when\nyou go through the installation process.\n\n124\n00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:11.875\nLet me exit out of the native command\nprompt here and let's try that again.\n\n125\n00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:13.009\nLet me verify on my desktop.\n\n126\n00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:14.754\nWhoop, sure enough,\nI've got it right there.\n\n127\n00:07:14.754 --> 00:07:19.922\nAnd interestingly enough, and we're going\nto get into programs and features here.\n\n128\n00:07:19.922 --> 00:07:24.242\nI just wanna make sure that\nthat isn't in the list.\n\n129\n00:07:24.242 --> 00:07:27.168\nAll right, now if I wanted to do an\nuninstall, we might as well go ahead and\n\n130\n00:07:27.168 --> 00:07:28.372\njust show you that.\n\n131\n00:07:28.372 --> 00:07:30.965\nI do a msiexe/x and here again,\n\n132\n00:07:30.965 --> 00:07:36.061\nhere's that pesky little problem\nthat we had before, right?\n\n133\n00:07:36.061 --> 00:07:40.061\nBut this time I'm gonna take off\nthat backslash and that dot right,\n\n134\n00:07:40.061 --> 00:07:43.148\nagain the relative path here and\nI'm gonna run it and\n\n135\n00:07:43.148 --> 00:07:45.693\nnotice that the installer runs just fine.\n\n136\n00:07:45.693 --> 00:07:48.249\nAll right now it's gonna say\nthis action is only valid for\n\n137\n00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:50.125\nproducts that are currently installed.\n\n138\n00:07:50.125 --> 00:07:53.531\nAnd interestingly enough,\nthis is something that's specific to\n\n139\n00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:57.564\nthe Google Chrome web browser even if it\ngets just a little bit of an install in.\n\n140\n00:07:57.564 --> 00:08:01.089\nThat icon's active and\nit can actually reach out to Chrome pull\n\n141\n00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:04.160\nback down the installer and\nfinish that process here.\n\n142\n00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.820\nSo let me go ahead real quick we're\ngonna do a little bit of magic here,\n\n143\n00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.050\nwe're gonna go down to programs file.\n\n144\n00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.240\nJust make sure there's\nGoogle right there and\n\n145\n00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.740\nwe're just gonna delete this completely,\nshould get rid of what we need.\n\n146\n00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.930\nWe'll go ahead and\ndelete the icon so again, just for\n\n147\n00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.080\nthe purposes of the demonstration I\njust wanted to show you that yes we\n\n148\n00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.820\ncould fire off that installation process,\nno problem.\n\n149\n00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.825\nNow let's go ahead,\n\n150\n00:08:29.825 --> 00:08:33.940\nlet's do the full install this time and\nI won't worry about stopping it.\n\n151\n00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.590\nNow when you do your\ninstallation here keep in mind\n\n152\n00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.790\nthat the dot backslash can't be there,\nright?\n\n153\n00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.780\nAnd when you start to run\nthis notice what we get.\n\n154\n00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.850\nAll right, you can see it says please wait\nwhile Windows configures Google Chrome.\n\n155\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.820\nAnd it's gonna go through\nits install process.\n\n156\n00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.640\nIt's gonna right some registry keys down\nin the registry which we're gonna take\n\n157\n00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.560\na look at coming up here in a second,\n\n158\n00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.940\nbecause I wanna show you a way that you\ncan locate some of the processes that\n\n159\n00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.990\nare going on in the background when you\ndecide that you are going to use MSI Exec.\n\n160\n00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.340\nNow notice that sure enough\nGoogle's in the background but\n\n161\n00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.824\nthis time if I right click.\n\n162\n00:09:12.824 --> 00:09:18.520\nActually, you know what I can do this\nright from the command prompt if\n\n163\n00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:24.120\nyou type app wiz if you will, appwiz.cpl\nthat actually brings up your add and\n\n164\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.120\nremove programs context menu if you want.\n\n165\n00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.060\nNow you can see Google Chrome\nis here right, and like I said,\n\n166\n00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.480\nwe're gonna look at some of these location\nright here but I wanna really focus on\n\n167\n00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.990\nMSI Exect and show you some of\nthe different options that you can use.\n\n168\n00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.840\nNow you could see that the installation or\n\n169\n00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.610\nthe uninstallation process\nfairly straight forward, right?\n\n170\n00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.270\nIt's the same thing.\n\n171\n00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.390\nYou just seen it there.\n\n172\n00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.740\nAll we did is replace\nthe forward slash i for install,\n\n173\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.850\nwith the forward slash x, keep in mind\non the exam that that's an uninstall.\n\n174\n00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.810\nBe nice if it'd be a forward slash u,\nbecause it'd be a little bit easier\n\n175\n00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.120\nto remember but\njust remember it for the exam.\n\n176\n00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:08.305\nAnd when we run this again we get\nthis interactive install/uninstall.\n\n177\n00:10:08.305 --> 00:10:13.685\nAll right, now maybe you're working\nwith a company that needs to\n\n178\n00:10:13.685 --> 00:10:16.275\nfind out some more information\nabout this installer.\n\n179\n00:10:16.275 --> 00:10:20.955\nOr maybe you're doing testing purposes,\nmaybe you're doing verification and\n\n180\n00:10:20.955 --> 00:10:25.975\nyou want to make sure that every little\nstep of this process goes pretty smooth.\n\n181\n00:10:25.975 --> 00:10:28.055\nLet's just double check really quick and\n\n182\n00:10:28.055 --> 00:10:32.595\nlet's find out if that\npackage has been removed.\n\n183\n00:10:32.595 --> 00:10:35.100\nJust gonna right-click on\nthe little start icon.\n\n184\n00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.100\nChoose Programs and Features, and\nit looks like it's still there.\n\n185\n00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.451\nSo we'll give it a second, it could take\na bit before it uninstalls, all right.\n\n186\n00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:48.420\nNow you have the ability that you\ncan do verbose logging as well.\n\n187\n00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:54.520\nIf I wanna make sure that when I do an\ninstall process that it goes through and\n\n188\n00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.940\nit gives me some logging information\non whether the install was successful,\n\n189\n00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.800\nwhether it was unsuccessful.\n\n190\n00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.840\nWell, I might wanna be able to\nsee that and we can do that.\n\n191\n00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:10.440\nNow, I'm gonna verify real quick if this\nuninstaller has finished real quick.\n\n192\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.550\nWe can do that fairly easy.\n\n193\n00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.720\nWe can do get package.\n\n194\n00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.580\nAnd when we do, it looks down and\nit looks at the software that's installed.\n\n195\n00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.990\nAnd I could see some definitions here.\n\n196\n00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.130\nI don't see any Google Chrome here.\n\n197\n00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.490\nSo it looks like at this point,\n\n198\n00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.350\nsince this is not a dynamic menu it's\nstill showing me the same thing.\n\n199\n00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:32.730\nI could have just refreshed it and\nthere it is, it is gone, all right.\n\n200\n00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.320\nSo, let's go ahead,\nlet's clear our screens.\n\n201\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.980\nSo we'll just do a Clear Post here.\n\n202\n00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.520\nWe'll clear our screen out and got some\nremnants left there at the bottom.\n\n203\n00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.520\nAnd what we're gonna do now,\nlet's show you how to add some logging.\n\n204\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.906\nNow there's several different\noptions with logging.\n\n205\n00:11:48.906 --> 00:11:53.700\nOn the exam, I want you to keep\nin mind the forward slash l.\n\n206\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.481\nNow you could have quite a few\nletters after the L, right?\n\n207\n00:11:57.481 --> 00:12:01.780\nYou're gonna see in this case we're\ngonna use LV, V as in verbose.\n\n208\n00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.090\nSo pay attention to that on the exam.\n\n209\n00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.330\nIf they give you a scenario\nwhere they're like,\n\n210\n00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.550\nwell we want you to enable logging and\nwe want you to set this type of logging.\n\n211\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:11.690\nWell pay attention to the L.\n\n212\n00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.200\nThe answer on the exam that has the L\nwith another letter attached to it\n\n213\n00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.920\nis the logging parameter, and\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n214\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.740\nSo we're gonna go ahead.\n\n215\n00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:25.990\nWe'll type msiexec, type forward slash,\ntype i for install and\n\n216\n00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.980\nagain we'll type, remember that relative\npath doesn't really work for us, but\n\n217\n00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:35.860\nit's a lot easier than me typing that big\nlong MSI file, I can tell you that Ronnie.\n\n218\n00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:41.010\nNow forward slash, l for\nlogging, V for verbose.\n\n219\n00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.380\nAnd then what we have to do is we have\nto tell it where we want the file.\n\n220\n00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.520\nWhere do we want the log file to be.\n\n221\n00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.520\nSo, I'm just gonna make it easier for\nme to type and find.\n\n222\n00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.245\nI'm just gonna put c:/ and I'll just\n\n223\n00:12:54.245 --> 00:12:59.294\ncall this install_log.txt all right.\n\n224\n00:12:59.294 --> 00:13:04.870\nAnd then, we'll go ahead and run that and\nnotice I got the interactive log in but\n\n225\n00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:10.830\nif I drop down to SQL in here\nwhich is essentially where we are.\n\n226\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.280\nNotice that I now have\nthis install log here.\n\n227\n00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.320\nAnd provided I could bring it back to\nthe screen here, you'll be able to see it.\n\n228\n00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.110\nI can launch this and it gives me\nsome examples of what is going.\n\n229\n00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.520\nWhat is going on with this installer?\n\n230\n00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.870\nWhat is it modifying, right?\n\n231\n00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.160\nIf I'm doing test bedding\nthis application,\n\n232\n00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.600\nwhether we wanna actually deploy it or\nnot, you might be in a situation where you\n\n233\n00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.630\nwanna find out in the registry\nwhat the heck is it doing?\n\n234\n00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:40.970\nLet's go ahead, well let's type\nthat install and let's launch that.\n\n235\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.240\nAll right, now you can see and\n\n236\n00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.610\ncertainly don't on the exam expect you\nto know any of this information, guys.\n\n237\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:53.288\nBut I use this, for instance,\nI'll do a Ctrl+F for your find option and\n\n238\n00:13:53.288 --> 00:13:54.988\nI'll type H key, right?\n\n239\n00:13:54.988 --> 00:13:57.386\nI wanna find out in the registry\nwhere is it writing to?\n\n240\n00:13:57.386 --> 00:14:00.190\nWell I'll just type H key here and\nI'll choose find next.\n\n241\n00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.430\nAnd sure enough I can see that yes,\n\n242\n00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:08.290\nwe do have some setup operations\ngoing on here in the background.\n\n243\n00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.780\nI can chose find next again.\n\n244\n00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.210\nLet me see if I can get to\nsome of the ones with the.\n\n245\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.770\nThere we go, there's the software Google.\n\n246\n00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.410\nAll right, so you can see right there,\nthat yeah sure enough,\n\n247\n00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:23.000\nI do have some of those registry\nentries that are being added.\n\n248\n00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.820\nAnd if I needed to I could always,\nif I wanted to,\n\n249\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.120\nI could always fire up\nyour registry editor.\n\n250\n00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.750\nAgain be careful, one of the things that\nI was taught very early on, is when you\n\n251\n00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:38.090\nlaunch this utility unless you know what\nyou're doing, don't get in there and\n\n252\n00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.760\nstart making modifications because for\nbetter or worse, they are instantaneous.\n\n253\n00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.550\nBut I just want to kind of show\nyou how you can reference this log\n\n254\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.240\nmaterial, right?\n\n255\n00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.400\nAnd you can use it to find the locations\ninside of the registry in which we\n\n256\n00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.280\nare installing our software.\n\n257\n00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.580\nAll right,\nlet me expand that out there a little bit.\n\n258\n00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.943\nThat's H-key local machine.\n\n259\n00:14:58.943 --> 00:15:01.250\nit kinda disappears there.\n\n260\n00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.760\nSo I'm gonna get down here\nto h-key local machine.\n\n261\n00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.490\nWe're gonna go into software and\n\n262\n00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:13.270\nsomewhere in here we should have well,\nit doesn't look like it's showed up yet.\n\n263\n00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.860\nBut there are different locations down in\nhere that we could find where you could\n\n264\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.220\nstart to find the software\nthat's installed.\n\n265\n00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.450\nLooks like that's\na temporary installer here.\n\n266\n00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.580\nLet's see if we could\nfind another one here.\n\n267\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.720\nSo we'll just do our find next.\n\n268\n00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.470\nAnd there we go, let's do an HQ local\nmachine, I know that one's there.\n\n269\n00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.440\nSoftware, Microsoft, and Windows.\n\n270\n00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.300\nThat's right here, Microsoft.\n\n271\n00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:41.660\nScroll all the way down, and\nwe should see Windows in the list.\n\n272\n00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.530\nAnd again, just showing you how\nyou can use this information to\n\n273\n00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:49.010\ncross reference if you\nneed to just verify.\n\n274\n00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:53.267\nSo you can see current version here and we\ncan see basically in here there is the MSI\n\n275\n00:15:53.267 --> 00:15:57.222\nfile, I do believe, and you'll see\nthat it shows the default installer.\n\n276\n00:15:57.222 --> 00:16:02.757\nAnd let's see here,\nthere's our installer there,\n\n277\n00:16:02.757 --> 00:16:07.554\nlet's see if we got our\nwindows installer down\n\n278\n00:16:07.554 --> 00:16:11.982\nhere Somewhere windows scripting hosts,\n\n279\n00:16:11.982 --> 00:16:15.809\ngive me a second here we will find it.\n\n280\n00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:20.593\nAll right, app history down here.\n\n281\n00:16:20.593 --> 00:16:25.772\nI tell you it's hard to find some\nof these locations when you really,\n\n282\n00:16:25.772 --> 00:16:31.760\nreally need to which is one of the reasons\nagain you want to be very careful.\n\n283\n00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.920\nI tell you what, we'll come back and\n\n284\n00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.520\ncheck that after the uninstall\nhere because I do want to again.\n\n285\n00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.500\nJust make sure that you understand the\npoint that you can look at these locales\n\n286\n00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.900\nand you can use it when you\nare doing testing purposes.\n\n287\n00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:48.538\nSo, here's the thing with the uninstall,\nor that install process.\n\n288\n00:16:48.538 --> 00:16:52.590\nWith the uninstall process,\nevery time I run an install or\n\n289\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:58.620\nI run an uninstall,\nnotice that it is basically\n\n290\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.390\nan interactive install,\nas much as this is in the command prompt.\n\n291\n00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.290\nIt is still an interactive install and\nif I want to do an uninstall,\n\n292\n00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:12.160\nI just change it to x, again \\LV makes\nit logging verbose and then uninstall,\n\n293\n00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.320\nI can run this and again I get\nthe interactive uninstall process.\n\n294\n00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:22.370\nSo again, fairly straightforward, want you\nto know a couple of the switches behind it\n\n295\n00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:25.270\njust in case It comes up on the exam.\n\n296\n00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.820\nBut notice that we still get this,\nthis interact,\n\n297\n00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.420\nyou know interaction that we need.\n\n298\n00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:34.610\nSo why are we dropping down to the command\nprompt to do an interactive install when\n\n299\n00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.850\nall I really need to do is just\ndouble click the installation file?\n\n300\n00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.040\nWell, that's where you can do\nwhat's known as quiet install.\n\n301\n00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.800\nOkay, a quiet install means\nwe can script this out and\n\n302\n00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.970\nwe could still script this point out\nright but the install would stop.\n\n303\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:53.860\nRight, the installs stops if something\ngoes wrong or in this case if somebody not\n\n304\n00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.400\nhere to click yes or\nclick no as far as the installer goes.\n\n305\n00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.240\nBut if I rerun this and I decide\nthat I wanted to be a quiet install.\n\n306\n00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.180\nI can do quiet, all right?\n\n307\n00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.010\nNow, the other thing I'm gonna\nadd to this is a force restart.\n\n308\n00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:13.790\nYou have to be careful with\nthis because if I do a quiet,\n\n309\n00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:17.060\nmaybe I wanna force the restart and\nI don't want it to be interactive,\n\n310\n00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:22.595\nwell if you do a forced restart,\nmake sure you have the \\quiet.\n\n311\n00:18:22.595 --> 00:18:24.050\nQuiet can be run by itself.\n\n312\n00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:27.640\nBut a force restart\ncannot be run by itself.\n\n313\n00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.030\nYou have to add the \\quiet there.\n\n314\n00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.630\nSo let me show what I mean here.\n\n315\n00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:39.500\nSo force restart, and\nlet's go ahead and run that.\n\n316\n00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.130\nNow you'll see that the circle is moving\nhere, right, that spinning cheerio.\n\n317\n00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.040\nSo I know that it is running, right?\n\n318\n00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.350\nIn fact, I could go down, and\nI could check those installation logs.\n\n319\n00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:55.210\nThat's another reason I wanna show you how\nto combine the logs with a quiet install.\n\n320\n00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.250\nHow do you know that it's succeeded,\nhow can you review that information?\n\n321\n00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:02.480\nAnd notice that the machine is restarting\non me, and I didn't have to do anything.\n\n322\n00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.750\nSo this is another way you could use MSI,\nif you're gonna implement apps, and\n\n323\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.150\nyou can do some scripting on it.\n\n324\n00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:12.180\nAnd you wouldn't have to worry about\nsomebody clicking Yes, or clicking No, or\n\n325\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:16.480\nconfirmation, and if it needed\na restart it would force the restart.\n\n326\n00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.130\nKeep in mind though on the exam one that\nI wanna just remind you that if you do\n\n327\n00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.768\nuse the force restart it has\nto be with the quiet option.\n\n328\n00:19:23.768 --> 00:19:26.910\nAll right now.\n\n329\n00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:33.430\nI did show you that there was a way\nthat we could get the package\n\n330\n00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:38.540\nas we could see if the application\ninstalled, we could verify on the machine.\n\n331\n00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.270\nSo if I go back to my machine here,\nlet me go ahead and login.\n\n332\n00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.750\nAnd we'll get back to the desktop.\n\n333\n00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.830\nI can turn around and\nI can run get package again, and\n\n334\n00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.380\nwhen I run that get package,\nit's gonna tell me what's installed.\n\n335\n00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.360\nNow, that is a commandlet.\n\n336\n00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.960\nKeep in mind, that is something\nthat is specific to the PowerShell.\n\n337\n00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.040\nThat's not something, really, that\nyou're gonna be doing in command prompt.\n\n338\n00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.310\nAll right, and I could see that\nthe icon is on the desktop and\n\n339\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.060\nif I go ahead and\nlaunch up my power shell.\n\n340\n00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:15.910\nGive it a second here to connect all\nright, and give us a little more real\n\n341\n00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:22.190\nestate on the screen here I could also do\nsomething known as get -item property.\n\n342\n00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:28.310\nNow again, I want you to know this for the\nexam, this long string of commandlet here.\n\n343\n00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.840\nI'm not so sure you're gonna\nhave to really worry about it,\n\n344\n00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.220\neach individual parameter, but\nI would know get -item property.\n\n345\n00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.330\nIn fact, what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna use the get -item property.\n\n346\n00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.310\nAnd remember I told you in\nthe registry where we are looking.\n\n347\n00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.040\nYou'll look down in the registry and\nsee what we find here.\n\n348\n00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.730\nSo I'm going to do a get item property.\n\n349\n00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:53.260\nIt's going to be a H key or\nHKLM, again that's\n\n350\n00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:58.070\na H Key Local Machine, we're telling it\nin the registry where we want to look.\n\n351\n00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.730\nThis is going to be software.\n\n352\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:05.700\nAll right, this is gonna be the WOW 34 or\n6432 node right?\n\n353\n00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.870\nWOW, Windows On Windows, all right.\n\n354\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:13.499\nThis is going to be Microsoft and\nthen its going to be Windows again.\n\n355\n00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:20.870\nAnd then we're going to go to\nthe current version and then uninstall.\n\n356\n00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.720\nNow you might ask yourself,\nwell wait a second, Wes.\n\n357\n00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.910\nWhy am I going to communicate with the\nuninstaller or uninstall in the registry?\n\n358\n00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.160\nWell, I want you to think about this.\n\n359\n00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.770\nAnything that's installed\nhas to have an uninstaller.\n\n360\n00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.370\nRight, so if I can contact\nthe uninstall and say hey,\n\n361\n00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.590\nwhat have you got in your list?\n\n362\n00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.830\nThat means that by association it\nhas to be installed on the machine,\n\n363\n00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:40.930\nbut i'm going to go ahead and\n\n364\n00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.130\nput an asterisk there and then we're\ngoing to format this a little bit.\n\n365\n00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:47.660\nWe're going to go ahead and\npipe this out to the select object and\n\n366\n00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.220\nthen we're going to say, we're going to\nkind of make it look the way we want.\n\n367\n00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.900\nWe're going to say display name comma and\nthen a space, and\n\n368\n00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:04.970\nwe're going to say, DisplayVersion comma.\n\n369\n00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:06.590\nMake sure that's not plural there.\n\n370\n00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:10.910\nWe're going to say publisher space.\n\n371\n00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.620\nAnd then we're going to do install date.\n\n372\n00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.780\nAll right.\n\n373\n00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.760\nWe're going to pipe that output\nout one more to one more time.\n\n374\n00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.360\nWe're going to do format table.\n\n375\n00:22:24.492 --> 00:22:27.380\nAll right, and\nthen we're going to say auto size.\n\n376\n00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.880\nNow hopefully this will give us\na little bit more information\n\n377\n00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.520\nthan the get package did.\n\n378\n00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.590\nAll right, when I look at this,\nI can see the display name.\n\n379\n00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.020\nNotice that I have the Google helper.\n\n380\n00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.970\nI can see the version that's installed.\n\n381\n00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.160\nI can also see that it's\nfrom Google itself here.\n\n382\n00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.900\nSo that's another way, if you will,\nand again, I know that that's\n\n383\n00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:52.610\na long commandlet there, but if you\ncan remember get item Property here,\n\n384\n00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:57.200\nthe last part of that really is just kind\nof how do I wanna format that output.\n\n385\n00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.650\nYou can find out exactly what's installed.\n\n386\n00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:06.310\nSo again, fairly easy way,\neasy process there if you will, Ronnie.\n\n387\n00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:11.310\nIt's just as easy I have to say [LAUGH]\nif you want to make it a little\n\n388\n00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.840\neasier on yourself let me show you\nthis one one more time, all right?\n\n389\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.631\nYou remember that big old long you\nprobably don't, but remember that big old\n\n390\n00:23:17.631 --> 00:23:21.600\nlong power shell commandlet,\nnotice right here Get-Package, all right?\n\n391\n00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.770\nAnd when I run that, takes a second.\n\n392\n00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.560\nAll right,\ngives me a little bit more information,\n\n393\n00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.920\ndoesn't give me quite the same\ninformation, what version of it.\n\n394\n00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.690\nWell, I guess it does\ngive me the version here.\n\n395\n00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:33.520\nSource, doesn't really\ntell me who it's by.\n\n396\n00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.060\nI would just hope that if\nwe're running Google Chrome.\n\n397\n00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.100\nYou would know that well,\nit's probably gonna be from Google.\n\n398\n00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.980\nAll right, so that is the command line\n\n399\n00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:51.030\ninterface that you can use in order to\nimplement your apps on your local machine.\n\n400\n00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.420\nBut that's not all that we have.\n\n401\n00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.580\nKeep in mind that we also have one\nthat's been around for a while and\n\n402\n00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:59.660\nthat is the Add and\nRemove programs location.\n\n403\n00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.936\nPrograms and\nFeatures as it's called today.\n\n404\n00:24:01.936 --> 00:24:06.078\nIf you want to know the run line to\nbe able to launch this from your\n\n405\n00:24:06.078 --> 00:24:09.986\ncommand prompt all you gotta do\nis just type appwiz .cpl and\n\n406\n00:24:09.986 --> 00:24:12.273\nit launches that console for you.\n\n407\n00:24:12.273 --> 00:24:16.423\nAgain not something I'm sure\nthat might be on the exam, but\n\n408\n00:24:16.423 --> 00:24:19.770\nyou never know, just in case it is there.\n\n409\n00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.860\nAnd from here we can\ndo some modifications.\n\n410\n00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:28.125\nNow, wanted to go ahead and show you for\ninstance a Microsoft product here.\n\n411\n00:24:28.125 --> 00:24:29.290\nI'll kinda zoom in and\n\n412\n00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:33.070\nyou'll see that I've got\nthe Microsoft Office Professional Plus.\n\n413\n00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.910\nAnd if I click off to this,\nnotice that these buttons right?\n\n414\n00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.570\nThey have a context when\nI select something.\n\n415\n00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:44.500\nAnd if I want I can choose Change,\nnotice that I can do an online repair\n\n416\n00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.700\nin this case because this\nis specific to Office 2016.\n\n417\n00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.220\nLet's see if we can get\nChrome to do the same thing.\n\n418\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.220\nOkay, so Chrome, yeah.\n\n419\n00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.910\nI could do a repair, as well.\n\n420\n00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.440\nAnd notice that it says, wait until the\ncurrent program finishes uninstalling or\n\n421\n00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.112\nbeing changed.\n\n422\n00:24:57.112 --> 00:25:00.360\nWe're gonna go ahead and\njust say no to that.\n\n423\n00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:05.220\nAnd then we will select\nOffice Professional Plus one more time.\n\n424\n00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.780\nAnd, give me a second here.\n\n425\n00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:11.970\nLet me just close that down and\ntry to do that again.\n\n426\n00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:12.480\nThere we go.\n\n427\n00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.280\nRemember that this screen doesn't update.\n\n428\n00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:20.390\nSo for instance,\nI opened a Change Operation on it.\n\n429\n00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:21.370\nI closed it down.\n\n430\n00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.310\nAnd then I want to modify another one.\n\n431\n00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:26.360\nAnd so wait a second,\nyou gotta wait till the first one stops.\n\n432\n00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.740\nAll you have to do is just close the\napplication down and then open it back up.\n\n433\n00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:31.240\nAll right?\n\n434\n00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.410\nAnd I could do a quick\nrepair if I wanted to and\n\n435\n00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:39.160\nnotice it shouldn't take a long time.\n\n436\n00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.120\nThis application is fine so I'm not\ngonna run this I just want you to know\n\n437\n00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:47.300\nthat depending on the application itself\nwill tell what options are available.\n\n438\n00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:52.090\nJust know that the common ones\nare Organize, Uninstall, and then Change.\n\n439\n00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:56.100\nAgain, for instance, 2013,\nif you wanted to change your product key,\n\n440\n00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.850\nOffice 2013 will allow you to do\nit right here in this location.\n\n441\n00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.410\nIt looks like it's a little\ndifferent with Office 2016, and\n\n442\n00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:03.390\neverything going to the cloud.\n\n443\n00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:06.200\nSo their licensing model might be\na little bit different for that.\n\n444\n00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.760\nBut you do have the ability.\n\n445\n00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.630\nFor instance I have 80k here,\nI could always change that if I wanted to,\n\n446\n00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.350\nand this is gonna open up\nthe entire installer here and\n\n447\n00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.610\nI'm not gonna change anything here.\n\n448\n00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:20.005\nBut notice that I do get\na different set of options so\n\n449\n00:26:20.005 --> 00:26:25.135\nwhat options you get are really specific\nto the programs that you have installed.\n\n450\n00:26:25.135 --> 00:26:29.085\nSo that really is one of\nthe ways that you can install,\n\n451\n00:26:29.085 --> 00:26:32.765\nyou can modify, you can repair software.\n\n452\n00:26:32.765 --> 00:26:34.405\nIf you're going through MSIexec,\n\n453\n00:26:34.405 --> 00:26:38.455\npay attention to some of those\nparameters that you have.\n\n454\n00:26:38.455 --> 00:26:42.310\nFor instance, the install option,\nthe uninstall option and\n\n455\n00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:45.910\nthen you're logging and logging,\nverbose logging as well.\n\n456\n00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:50.900\nNow, one of the other things that\nthey call out on the exam is\n\n457\n00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.910\nconfiguring your start up options.\n\n458\n00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:56.050\nAnd we want to save some time here,\nand kind of show you a little bit\n\n459\n00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.640\nabout the start up options\nthat we have available for us.\n\n460\n00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.190\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n461\n00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:02.730\nThere's a couple of different\nways that you can do this.\n\n462\n00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.620\nIf you're in the command prompt or\nif you're in the PowerShell.\n\n463\n00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:11.420\nYou can also always type sysdm.cpl and\n\n464\n00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.370\nthat launches your traditional\nsystem properties.\n\n465\n00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:19.040\nSome of you guys that have been in Windows\nfor a while will just recognize this as\n\n466\n00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.280\nyour traditional system properties\ngoing back to like XP and stuff.\n\n467\n00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.010\nAnother place that you can get to this too\nif you wanted to is just by right clicking\n\n468\n00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.020\nour little Quick Links\nadministrative menu here and\n\n469\n00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:33.300\nI could choose system and\nthen choose advanced system, right?\n\n470\n00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.450\nAnd then we get just to, or actually\nany one of these lower three links.\n\n471\n00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:42.620\nBut what I'm focused on Is this\noption more specifically right here,\n\n472\n00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:43.690\nStartup and Recovery.\n\n473\n00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.100\nNotice that right there and\n\n474\n00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.150\nwhat we wanna do is we wanna click\nthis little Settings button.\n\n475\n00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.570\nSo we'll click the Settings button and\n\n476\n00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:56.210\nthis does, as the name implies,\nit does talk about recovery as well.\n\n477\n00:27:56.210 --> 00:28:01.260\nOn our 7697 course, they went in some good\n\n478\n00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.420\ndetail on data recovery and\nrecovering your system.\n\n479\n00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.740\nIf any of this is unfamiliar with you,\njump back over and definitely watch that.\n\n480\n00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.625\nBut what we want to look at for\nthis exam, more importantly and\n\n481\n00:28:12.625 --> 00:28:16.605\nit's all important, but for\nthis one it's a system startup.\n\n482\n00:28:16.605 --> 00:28:19.080\nNow what does this modify?\n\n483\n00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.120\nAll right, this modifies something known\nas the BCD, the boot configuration data,\n\n484\n00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.110\nand some of that information\nstores what we see right here.\n\n485\n00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.300\nFor instance if you have more than one\nWindows operating system you select\n\n486\n00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:29.920\nthe defaults.\n\n487\n00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.770\nWell, what is the default\noperating system in this case,\n\n488\n00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.270\nI don't have a multi- boot system,\nI only have one system.\n\n489\n00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.170\nSo, it's Windows 10 but\n\n490\n00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:42.260\nif you've ever had multi-boot you've\nprobably seen that it says, well, how long\n\n491\n00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:48.480\ndo you want to want to display the\nmulti-operating system selection screen?\n\n492\n00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.280\nWell you might be able to\noptimize your start up time if\n\n493\n00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.010\nyou maybe put this down to 1.\n\n494\n00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.700\nI don't have more than\none operating system so\n\n495\n00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.350\nwhy do I need it to stay there for\n30 seconds.\n\n496\n00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:04.710\nThe other one too is time to display\nrecovery options when needed.\n\n497\n00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.090\nAll right, this is something that's\nI believe, if I remember right,\n\n498\n00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.290\nRonnie you might have to correct\nme if I'm wrong on this one.\n\n499\n00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:14.800\nI believe this is started in Windows 7 and\nthis is where they started to\n\n500\n00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.690\ninclude recovery options when the it\nseemed the machine couldn't boot.\n\n501\n00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:22.430\nIt would restart and it would say\nPreparing automatic recovery, might've\n\n502\n00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:26.920\ncome out in Windows 8, but this says how\nlong do you want to display that screen.\n\n503\n00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.270\nAnd again,\nit's all a part of your startup.\n\n504\n00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.620\nNow, that's only one location, we've got\nanother oldie but goodie that we've been\n\n505\n00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:40.360\nusing for a very long time,\nin order to modify our startup options.\n\n506\n00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.330\nWhere is that?\n\n507\n00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:45.217\nWell this can also be launched from\nthe command prompt if you want or\n\n508\n00:29:45.217 --> 00:29:46.870\nthe PowerShell.\n\n509\n00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.330\nAnd this is good old MS config.\n\n510\n00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:53.450\nAll right this ones been around for\na while, we've been using this for\n\n511\n00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:54.820\na long time now.\n\n512\n00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.500\nI will tell you one thing that's\na little bit different when it comes to\n\n513\n00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.660\nconfiguring startup options\nis this started in Windows 8.\n\n514\n00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.330\nFor the longest time, any files or\nprograms that would put their startup\n\n515\n00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.400\nfiles right there just the moment\nyou would boot the machine,\n\n516\n00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:11.380\nyou could go to this location and\nyou could disable them if you needed to.\n\n517\n00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.180\nJust wanna show you here real quick.\n\n518\n00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.740\nIf you open your Task Manager,\nand choose More Details.\n\n519\n00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.090\nThat's where that option is today.\n\n520\n00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:24.020\nSo just keep that in mind, because that\nis part of configuring startup options,\n\n521\n00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.840\nand they might want you to know that.\n\n522\n00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.020\nBut what I really wanna look at\nare some of these first couple of tabs.\n\n523\n00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:34.080\nNotice you have what's\nknown as a normal Startup.\n\n524\n00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.830\nAll right, normal startup loads all third\nparty drivers, all of the services,\n\n525\n00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:42.700\neven services it doesn't require Windows,\nyou know, for Windows to boot, right.\n\n526\n00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.720\nAnd this is typically what we use.\n\n527\n00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.590\nDiagnostic startup is much\nlike what we call safe mode,\n\n528\n00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.970\nit only loads the basic devices and\nservices only.\n\n529\n00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.990\nIn this case, if you're going to be,\nmaybe troubleshooting\n\n530\n00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:57.920\na third party driver you certainly don't\nwant that third party driver booting up,\n\n531\n00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.820\nif that's the driver that\nyou're trying to diagnose.\n\n532\n00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.610\nAnd then you have a selective\nstartup as well and\n\n533\n00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:05.610\nyou can get a little more picky on this.\n\n534\n00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:08.200\nI wanna go ahead and\ngo over to the Boot tab.\n\n535\n00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.680\nNow the Boot tab,\nyou might have noticed something.\n\n536\n00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.210\nSome of this looks like what\nwe just looked at, right?\n\n537\n00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.930\nIf I go back to my system properties here,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n538\n00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:18.380\nlaunch that up real quick.\n\n539\n00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.190\nAnd the good thing is you don't\nneed both of these open here.\n\n540\n00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.420\nAnd we'll go back to that startup and\nthen settings.\n\n541\n00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.980\nThese look a lot the same.\n\n542\n00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:27.890\nAll right?\n\n543\n00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:29.270\nThey're modifying the same thing.\n\n544\n00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:32.880\nThey're modifying the BCD, and if I had\nmore than one operating system in here,\n\n545\n00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.170\nI could select it,\nwhich one I want, as the default.\n\n546\n00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:40.750\nNow, when it comes to my boot options,\nright, notice the Safe Boot, and\n\n547\n00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.070\nMinimal, all right?\n\n548\n00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:46.950\nWell, if I wanted to do a Safe Boot and\nMinimal, we can boot into Safe Mode.\n\n549\n00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.690\nI want you to [LAUGH] remember\nthis because I've actually made\n\n550\n00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:50.810\na mistake on this.\n\n551\n00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.110\nWhen you set this here, it's not like\nsome of you that might remember that F8\n\n552\n00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.055\nto continue, boots you into the safe mode.\n\n553\n00:31:56.055 --> 00:32:00.011\nBut the moment you restart the computer,\nall of that information is discarded, and\n\n554\n00:32:00.011 --> 00:32:01.639\nyou boot to a normal boot process.\n\n555\n00:32:01.639 --> 00:32:05.597\nIf I do a Safe Boot with Minimal here, and\nI choose OK, and it says hey, go ahead,\n\n556\n00:32:05.597 --> 00:32:09.117\nyou have to restart your operating\nsystem in order to save the changes.\n\n557\n00:32:09.117 --> 00:32:11.539\nI wanna take a second to\nshow you what happens.\n\n558\n00:32:11.539 --> 00:32:16.138\nNow what it's gonna do Rather than keeping\nyou guys on the edge of your seats\n\n559\n00:32:16.138 --> 00:32:19.780\nwaiting, is it's gonna\nboot in the safe mode.\n\n560\n00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.450\nBut here's the difference.\n\n561\n00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:26.540\nWhen I set it from MSConfig,\nit is not going to uncheck itself, so\n\n562\n00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.050\nyou have to be careful.\n\n563\n00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:31.670\nWhen you reboot,\ninto safe mode from MSConfig and\n\n564\n00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:36.930\nyou are done configuring whatever it\nis that you're troubleshooting, make\n\n565\n00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:41.200\nsure you change it back, [LAUGH] because\nit's gonna keep booting into safe mode and\n\n566\n00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.350\nthat might not be a good\nday at the office.\n\n567\n00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.650\nNow right away,\nI can see something's going on here,\n\n568\n00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:50.200\nbecause my screen is a very\nlow resolution, right.\n\n569\n00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.008\nWell, there's a reason we\nboot into safe mode, right.\n\n570\n00:32:52.008 --> 00:32:55.643\nIt takes all of that third-party\nvideo drivers, and it says,\n\n571\n00:32:55.643 --> 00:32:58.454\nlet me just take a default,\ngeneric VGA driver,\n\n572\n00:32:58.454 --> 00:33:03.220\njust enough to get you into the operating\nsystem so that you can work with it.\n\n573\n00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:07.385\nAnd you can see up here, in the upper\nright hand corner we are in safe mode and\n\n574\n00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:10.912\nagain it isn't loading the drivers,\nthird-party drivers.\n\n575\n00:33:10.912 --> 00:33:17.020\nNow keeping that in mind, if I want\nthis to go away and we want to fix it.\n\n576\n00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:21.360\nWell once we're done with\nthe driver testing that's going on,\n\n577\n00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.070\nall we got to do is just\ndo another MSConfig.\n\n578\n00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.920\nWe launch that up.\n\n579\n00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.290\nNotice that it automatically\nchanged me to a selective startup.\n\n580\n00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:31.912\nSaid load system services,\nload up startup items,\n\n581\n00:33:31.912 --> 00:33:34.100\nif it happen to be something with the BCD,\n\n582\n00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:39.360\nthe boot configuration data, well we can\nsay use original BCD, boot configuration.\n\n583\n00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.870\nWe're not gonna do that but we are gonna\nchange that back to a safe boot.\n\n584\n00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:48.490\nWe'll choose OK, it's gonna tell us that,\nhey we've gotta restart.\n\n585\n00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:51.915\nI'm gonna go ahead and exit this without\nrestarting really quick cuz I do wanna\n\n586\n00:33:51.915 --> 00:33:55.650\nlaunch that back up one more time and\njust talk about a couple of the other\n\n587\n00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:58.750\noptions here that we're really not gonna,\nwe're not gonna re boot here though.\n\n588\n00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.170\nAlternate shell, what is that?\n\n589\n00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:03.070\nWell maybe some of you remember\nthe advanced start up options that you set\n\n590\n00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:07.020\nwhere it says start in safe\nmode with command prompt.\n\n591\n00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:10.080\nThat's what that is, alternate shell\njust means start up with command prompt.\n\n592\n00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.160\nAll right, active Directory repair,\nwe're not gonna worry about that.\n\n593\n00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.420\nNetwork, this says go ahead and\nstart up in safe mode but\n\n594\n00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.650\ninitiate the network adapter.\n\n595\n00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.770\nNo GUI boot, well what does that mean?\n\n596\n00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:22.131\nYou say, well wait a second Wes,\n\n597\n00:34:22.131 --> 00:34:25.360\nbooting into command prompt\nas the alternate shell.\n\n598\n00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.940\nWhat does the GUI boot mean?\n\n599\n00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.620\nThat means just don't display the Windows\nwelcome screen, right, just pass that.\n\n600\n00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.800\nAnd then again you got log in,\nBase video, and\n\n601\n00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:39.120\nOS boot information if you're doing for\ninstance debugging and stuff.\n\n602\n00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.249\nMaybe you've got a piece of software\nthat's causing a problem, you can do that.\n\n603\n00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.120\nLast but not least, making all of\nthese boot settings permanent and\n\n604\n00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.400\nalso adjusting that timeout screen.\n\n605\n00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.270\nSo not too difficult once you know.\n\n606\n00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:55.020\nI'm gonna go ahead and choose OK to this.\n\n607\n00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:59.760\nAnd let's go ahead and fix the computer\nhere real quick and just double check.\n\n608\n00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:04.990\nUncheck that, now we're out of safe mode,\nand we can restart.\n\n609\n00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:08.140\nAnd hopefully Ronnie,\nnow that we maybe fixed the driver\n\n610\n00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.622\nwhen we restart the machine it is\ngonna go into a normal boot process.\n\n611\n00:35:11.622 --> 00:35:16.040\nSo a fairly straight forward process once\nyou know, well, where the options are.\n\n612\n00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.156\n>> All right Wes well thank you again for\n\n613\n00:35:19.156 --> 00:35:22.844\nshowing us at least the idea here of\nworking with different applications and\n\n614\n00:35:22.844 --> 00:35:26.280\nalso being able to configure\nsome of the options in startup.\n\n615\n00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.920\nUsually, the startup options\nare really there to help us,\n\n616\n00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.740\nespecially when we\nare troubleshooting some few things.\n\n617\n00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.638\nAnd it gives us this ability to understand\nthat there are multiple options for\n\n618\n00:35:34.638 --> 00:35:35.750\nus to think about.\n\n619\n00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.970\nSo make sure you know where\nthose things are located.\n\n620\n00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:41.420\nMake sure you understand those\noptions that are available to you.\n\n621\n00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.850\nAlso, in terms of implementing\nthe apps that we've talked about here.\n\n622\n00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:48.760\nIt's easy enough for you to double click\non an application that you've downloaded,\n\n623\n00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.210\nbut if you're gonna be an enterprise\nlevel support technician, it means that\n\n624\n00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:56.760\nyou must be able to understand that\nthere is another way to do this,\n\n625\n00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.650\nespecially when you're working\nwith what multiple machines.\n\n626\n00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:02.060\nThis gives us a way to script\nthose things out and so\n\n627\n00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.990\nyou do want to make sure you go back and\ntake a look at the options that Wes has\n\n628\n00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:08.360\nshowed you of how to be able to\ninstall as well as uninstall,\n\n629\n00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:13.420\ndo that silent install and even understand\nthe ability to be able to do the log in.\n\n630\n00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:16.960\nAll those come with what we call different\noptions that we add into that command line\n\n631\n00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.550\nas well.\n\n632\n00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:22.000\nSo, these are all particular\ntypes of tools and things\n\n633\n00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.400\nthat you should be very interested in, as\nyou not only go forward for the exam, but\n\n634\n00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.290\nin your particular career as an enterprise\nlevel support technician as well.\n\n635\n00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:34.110\nSo, that's a great place for\nus also to end this episode then.\n\n636\n00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.400\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n637\n00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.300\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n638\n00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.654\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows 10 episodes.\n\n639\n00:36:40.654 -->

00:00:16.024\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:20.354\nAnd today we're actually moving into,\nwell, Windows 10, implementing and\n\n5\n00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.529\nalso configuring Windows 10 as well.\n\n6\n00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.136\nAnd what we're actually gonna be taking a\nlook at, of course, is the Windows Store,\n\n7\n00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:27.730\nbut specifically for business.\n\n8\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.350\nAnd who better to help us than\nMr Microsoft himself, Wes Bryan?\n\n9\n00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.700\nWes, welcome back to our studios.\n\n10\n00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.210\n>> Thanks, Ronnie, for\nhaving me, as always.\n\n11\n00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.050\nIt is good to be here with ITProTV,\nand that's right,\n\n12\n00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.780\nwe're looking at the Windows Store,\nbut not from the consumer side.\n\n13\n00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.996\nWe're looking at the Windows Store for\nBusiness,\n\n14\n00:00:41.996 --> 00:00:44.737\nit's one of the things that\nthey call out on the 7698 exam.\n\n15\n00:00:44.737 --> 00:00:47.400\nSo it's something that we definitely\nwant you to be prepared for.\n\n16\n00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.085\nSo I'll tell you what, we're gonna go\nahead and we're gonna dive right in and\n\n17\n00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:52.755\nwe'll talk a little bit\nabout the Windows Store.\n\n18\n00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:56.435\nWell the Windows Store,\nfrom the consumer side,\n\n19\n00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:59.465\nit's where we log in with our\nMicrosoft account, right?\n\n20\n00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:04.120\nWe download applications, we install\napplications, we keep them up to date.\n\n21\n00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.850\nBack in Windows 8 they came out, right,\nthey were called the modern UI apps.\n\n22\n00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.610\nWell thank goodness, today,\nthese applications aren't full screen and\n\n23\n00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.060\nstealing all the real\nestate on our desktop.\n\n24\n00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.700\nBut that's not really the store\nthat we're looking for.\n\n25\n00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.600\nYes, that's right,\nMicrosoft has two of the Windows stores.\n\n26\n00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.110\nThey have one that has increased\nscalability, gives you bulk app\n\n27\n00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.850\nacquisition if you need it rather than\njust a single one off application.\n\n28\n00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.880\nAnd that's a per user basis and\n\n29\n00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.990\neach user has to log in in order to\nbe able to access that application.\n\n30\n00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.526\nThat would definitely be\na decentralized model, for sure.\n\n31\n00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:43.135\nSo that's one of the things that\nthe Windows Store for Business allows,\n\n32\n00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:46.940\nis that centralized management of\nthe Windows Store type applications.\n\n33\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.387\nThe other thing it allows us to do is\nimplement things like line of business\n\n34\n00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:51.175\napplications.\n\n35\n00:01:51.175 --> 00:01:56.030\nIn the 7697 exam, and Ronnie, I believe\nit was you that was in this episode.\n\n36\n00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.660\nThey showed you how you could\nside load your applications,\n\n37\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.880\nright, we could bypass the store.\n\n38\n00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.040\nWell what if you're working\nwith other developers and\n\n39\n00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.600\nthese developers wanna put their\napplications up there on the Window Store,\n\n40\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.040\nand its line of business\nthey're working with you?\n\n41\n00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.250\nWell, that's a little bit different.\n\n42\n00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.150\nNow we're not talking about\nsideloading the apps, but\n\n43\n00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.470\nactually getting those apps down from\nthe Windows Store when you have developers\n\n44\n00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.290\nthat decide that they wanna publish\ntheir applications up in that store.\n\n45\n00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.960\nNow they become available to you and\n\n46\n00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.600\nyour corporation, so\na little bit different of a concept there.\n\n47\n00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.428\nThe other thing that's really cool too, is\nthey have what's known as a private store.\n\n48\n00:02:28.428 --> 00:02:32.860\nWell what's a private store, you say,\nWes, is there a third store here now?\n\n49\n00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.740\nNo, not really, but what we're saying here\nis that every time your administrator\n\n50\n00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.010\npurchases an app they\ncreate a private store.\n\n51\n00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.045\nSo you as a user,\nas a consumer, as an employee,\n\n52\n00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:47.815\nyou log in, you don't see every\napplication in the Windows store, right?\n\n53\n00:02:47.815 --> 00:02:51.515\nThat's for the administrator\nto acquire those licenses and\n\n54\n00:02:51.515 --> 00:02:54.235\nmake sure that that's\navailable to the end users.\n\n55\n00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:57.525\nBut what is available to the end\nusers is their own little\n\n56\n00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:00.935\ntab that is really just\nwhat has been managed.\n\n57\n00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:03.825\nWhat's been published\nout to different users,\n\n58\n00:03:03.825 --> 00:03:07.290\nyou can assign license to users,\nso it's a little bit different.\n\n59\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.810\nThe other thing that's really cool is\nthey have something known as an offline\n\n60\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:12.660\nlicensing model.\n\n61\n00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.790\nWhich we'll talk a little bit more\nabout towards the end of this episode,\n\n62\n00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.760\nbecause we want you to be\nable to be aware about that.\n\n63\n00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.330\nImagine the ability to\npurchase applications,\n\n64\n00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.940\nput them in a repository, and\n\n65\n00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.200\nif you aren't online your users can still\nhave them available to the local network.\n\n66\n00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.380\nSo that is something that differs\nquite considerably from the consumer\n\n67\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.290\nside of the Windows Store.\n\n68\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.770\nThat most of us might be used to when\nwe log into our own personal Windows 10\n\n69\n00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.277\ndevices.\n\n70\n00:03:39.277 --> 00:03:41.779\nSome of the requirements\nthat you might need here,\n\n71\n00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:44.000\nlet's kind of talk about\nthese a little bit.\n\n72\n00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.340\nYou're gonna need Internet Explorer 10\nat least, probably be running 11 and\n\n73\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.990\nyou'd have the Edge browser.\n\n74\n00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.160\nAny of the current versions of Chrome or\nFirefox.\n\n75\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.273\nWindows, here's one that's specific,\n\n76\n00:03:55.273 --> 00:03:59.687\na lot of these newer features that you'll\nsee is features to the build 1511, right?\n\n77\n00:03:59.687 --> 00:04:01.935\nI don't know what happened in 1511,\n\n78\n00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:05.350\nbut it looks like they tied off\na lot of the loose ends and stuff.\n\n79\n00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.323\nSo keep in mind that your Windows\n10 version needs to be running 10.,\n\n80\n00:04:10.323 --> 00:04:11.040\nit's 1511.\n\n81\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.140\nAnd you can always find out the version\njust by going dropping down to\n\n82\n00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.070\nthe command prompt.\n\n83\n00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.950\nTyping V-E-R, and it'll let you know\nwhat version of Windows you're running.\n\n84\n00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.310\nNow you have to have an Azure AD\nsubscription because your user accounts,\n\n85\n00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.300\nthat's where they're controlled.\n\n86\n00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.005\nIn fact, anything in the cloud,\nbasically, today, for Microsoft,\n\n87\n00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:30.210\nyou create a user account, really is\nAzure Active Directory in the background.\n\n88\n00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.357\nBut keep in mind, know that you need that.\n\n89\n00:04:32.357 --> 00:04:37.690\nYou need the AD employee accounts\nto access the Store for Business.\n\n90\n00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.416\nThat is a prerequisite,\nhowever, offline licenses,\n\n91\n00:04:40.416 --> 00:04:42.156\nnow this is a little bit different.\n\n92\n00:04:42.156 --> 00:04:47.113\nWith your offline licenses, they do not\nrequire an Azure employee accounts.\n\n93\n00:04:47.113 --> 00:04:50.555\nBecause you're gonna be\ncaching the applications and\n\n94\n00:04:50.555 --> 00:04:55.100\nyou're gonna be caching the license\nlocally, so keep that in mind.\n\n95\n00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.585\nNow I'll tell you what, I've gone ahead\nand I pulled up the Windows Store for\n\n96\n00:04:59.585 --> 00:05:02.138\nBusiness app or actually the website here.\n\n97\n00:05:02.138 --> 00:05:06.323\nAnd it's fairly straightforward of\na process when you wanna get started\n\n98\n00:05:06.323 --> 00:05:06.876\nwith it.\n\n99\n00:05:06.876 --> 00:05:11.144\nYou have, on the left hand side here,\nyou have the SIGN UP NOW.\n\n100\n00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.635\nAnd I know my head's kind of covering\nit up, if you already have an account,\n\n101\n00:05:14.635 --> 00:05:17.500\nI could always sign in with\nan account right over here.\n\n102\n00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.790\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll choose SIGN UP NOW all right?\n\n103\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.730\nAnd it says what account\nwould you like to use,\n\n104\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.822\nwhat email address would you like to use?\n\n105\n00:05:26.822 --> 00:05:28.890\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna create a new account,\n\n106\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.720\nwe'll show you step by step\nthrough the process here.\n\n107\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.270\nAnd if it's a little slow I will tell you,\nsome times guys,\n\n108\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.020\nI've gone to this website it\ntakes a little bit to get loaded.\n\n109\n00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.971\nSo if it does, just be patient,\nmaybe try restarting your computer.\n\n110\n00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:43.230\nBut we're gonna go ahead,\n\n111\n00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.030\nfirst thing we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna pick our region.\n\n112\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.890\nRemember, this is a cloud based service so\nlocation is key in the cloud, right?\n\n113\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.370\nYou have a certain affinity to\nthe location that you're at so\n\n114\n00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.240\nit is important.\n\n115\n00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.290\nAll right, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll go ahead and sign up here, and\n\n116\n00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.260\nI think, today, let's see,\nwho are we gonna be today?\n\n117\n00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.748\nI would say say that we would be\nourselves here, but I'll tell you what,\n\n118\n00:06:09.748 --> 00:06:11.669\nlet's be George Washington.\n\n119\n00:06:14.482 --> 00:06:15.483\nIf I could spell George.\n\n120\n00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.756\nAll right,\ntoday we're gonna be the president.\n\n121\n00:06:22.577 --> 00:06:26.080\nWashington, [LAUGH] all right.\n\n122\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.873\nNow your business email address,\n\n123\n00:06:29.873 --> 00:06:34.058\nthat's exactly what it sounds like,\n\n124\n00:06:34.058 --> 00:06:38.384\nI'm gonna put wes@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n125\n00:06:38.384 --> 00:06:42.125\nBusiness phone number, we'll go ahead and\nput our business phone number here.\n\n126\n00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:46.360\n352, what is our business phone number,\nRonnie, you remember that?\n\n127\n00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.649\nThat's 600-6900, I believe it is?\n\n128\n00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:49.500\n>> Correct.\n\n129\n00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.200\n>> All right, and our company name,\nagain, whatever your company's name is.\n\n130\n00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.428\nI will tell you that this is\nkind of important to remember.\n\n131\n00:06:55.428 --> 00:07:00.048\nYou have to have, if you set this up,\nall right, if you're doing this in a test\n\n132\n00:07:00.048 --> 00:07:04.600\nenvironment, you have a free subscription\nguys, don't worry about that.\n\n133\n00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.140\nBut if you're doing this for your company,\n\n134\n00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.580\nyou have to have the authority to\nbind your company into the EULA.\n\n135\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.280\nThis isn't a consumer license here where\nyou, the person that's logging in and\n\n136\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.100\ncreating the account, are binding yourself\nto the end user license agreement.\n\n137\n00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.860\nUnderstand that when you sign up for\n\n138\n00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.180\nthese business related services\nyou must have the authority.\n\n139\n00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.830\nThat when you click the EULA,\n\n140\n00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.110\nyou're binding your whole entire company\nto that end user license agreement.\n\n141\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.600\nSo just keep that in mind,\nbusiness license agreement, if you will.\n\n142\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.720\nThen you choose the size of the company,\nright, we're relatively small right now,\n\n143\n00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.460\ngrowing every day.\n\n144\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.580\nWe'll say 50 to about just under\n250 people and we'll choose Next.\n\n145\n00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.115\nAll right, now, the next thing\nthat we get to do, all right,\n\n146\n00:07:48.115 --> 00:07:49.425\nwe can enter our username.\n\n147\n00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:53.355\nNow your username here is gonna\nbe exactly how it's displayed.\n\n148\n00:07:53.355 --> 00:07:59.837\nAgain, we'll just do\nour George Washington.\n\n149\n00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.984\nAll right, and our company again,\nwhatever your company might be that is\n\n150\n00:08:06.984 --> 00:08:10.081\nreally contingent on\nyour environment here.\n\n151\n00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:17.615\nAnd we'll go ahead and then we will\ncreate our super secret password.\n\n152\n00:08:17.615 --> 00:08:19.945\nNotice that it tells you if you are,\n\n153\n00:08:19.945 --> 00:08:22.805\nyou can bind this to your\nown company's domain.\n\n154\n00:08:22.805 --> 00:08:25.815\nIn this case,\nI'm using Microsoft here, and\n\n155\n00:08:25.815 --> 00:08:29.760\nknow that the end it puts on\nthe end there @microsoft.com.\n\n156\n00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.898\nSo it's gonna be your company's\nname dot on microsoft.com.\n\n157\n00:08:34.898 --> 00:08:39.950\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nlike I said we'll create that super\n\n158\n00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:46.769\nsecret password that nobody can guess\nunless they tried to unlock my luggage.\n\n159\n00:08:46.769 --> 00:08:54.250\nAll right, we'll choose Next,\nAnd oop, no spaces, no spaces.\n\n160\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.250\nThis is going to be by, I'll tell you what\nbe careful with your user ID there, too.\n\n161\n00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.210\nWe'll choose next and it says no spaces.\n\n162\n00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.515\nNow the next thing that it wants to do is\nit wants me to provide a phone number in\n\n163\n00:09:07.515 --> 00:09:09.417\norder to receive a text, right?\n\n164\n00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:10.614\nWe think of CAPTCHA, right?\n\n165\n00:09:10.614 --> 00:09:14.100\nThey wanna make sure all you can see\nright here that we're not a robot.\n\n166\n00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.050\nSo what I'm gonna go ahead,\n\n167\n00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.570\nwe're gonna do a couple of things here,\nwe're gonna use some TV magic here.\n\n168\n00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.350\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n169\n00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.980\nput in my cell phone number here,\nI'm gonna have it send me a text.\n\n170\n00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.560\nIt's gonna be a, it's either a six or\nseven digit numerical code that we'd have\n\n171\n00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.435\nto turn here and\nput in once we have received that text.\n\n172\n00:09:33.435 --> 00:09:34.430\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\n\n173\n00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.170\nwe're gonna take TV time out,\nwe'll be back just as soon as that's done.\n\n174\n00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.150\nNow depending on how you verify that you\nare not a piece of machinery is up to you.\n\n175\n00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.810\nIt could be done through email,\nI chose to go ahead and do a text.\n\n176\n00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.700\nI've received that code and\nI I did tell you, I think it was a six or\n\n177\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.910\nseven digit numerical code, it's six.\n\n178\n00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.560\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe'll throw that into our text box here.\n\n179\n00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.970\nIt is going to be unique\nto every install or\n\n180\n00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.410\nevery instance, I should say,\nwhen you're setting it up.\n\n181\n00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.420\nIf you wanna get a bunch of spam,\nyou could always opt for\n\n182\n00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.270\nMicrosoft Partners sending you stuff.\n\n183\n00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.070\nI'm gonna go ahead [LAUGH] and\nI'm gonna leave this unchecked.\n\n184\n00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.870\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nchoose Create my account.\n\n185\n00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.370\n>> Now it's my birthday.\n\n186\n00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.166\n>> That's right [LAUGH].\n\n187\n00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:21.113\nSo it tells you and it did this\nreally quick, it tells you that hey,\n\n188\n00:10:21.113 --> 00:10:23.510\nsave this info, you'll need it.\n\n189\n00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.430\nAnd notice down here in the bottom,\nit says Creating your account.\n\n190\n00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.710\nNow, that could take a little bit,\nI know it says that you're ready to go.\n\n191\n00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.610\nHowever, in some of the other\nthings that we wanna show you,\n\n192\n00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.930\nas far as the applications go.\n\n193\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:41.440\nWe don't want it to wait for the time that\nit takes to create your Azure account\n\n194\n00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.730\nin the background and some of the Office\n365 stuff that could take a little bit.\n\n195\n00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.066\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna take one more TV timeout.\n\n196\n00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:52.920\nAnd when we come back, we're gonna log\nin as an account that we've already\n\n197\n00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.890\nprovisioned beforehand that has\nthis information ready to go.\n\n198\n00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.374\nWell we went ahead and\nwe've logged in as a different account and\n\n199\n00:10:59.374 --> 00:11:00.892\nwe've got apps already provisioned.\n\n200\n00:11:00.892 --> 00:11:03.702\nAnd we don't have to wait for\nthat stuff to go ahead and\n\n201\n00:11:03.702 --> 00:11:05.710\nwork its way through the cloud there.\n\n202\n00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:07.260\nSometimes that'll happen.\n\n203\n00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.308\nKeep in mind, sometimes this could take\na half hour, could take a couple of hours,\n\n204\n00:11:10.308 --> 00:11:11.628\nit really depends on their volume.\n\n205\n00:11:11.628 --> 00:11:14.305\nUsually they're pretty good when it\ncomes to setting up your account,\n\n206\n00:11:14.305 --> 00:11:15.697\nusually you're in fairly quickly.\n\n207\n00:11:15.697 --> 00:11:20.014\nBut just in case, speed up time, we went\nahead and we're logging in with another\n\n208\n00:11:20.014 --> 00:11:23.390\naccount that's already been\nprovisioned the exact same way.\n\n209\n00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.940\nNow the on thing that if we go ahead,\nwe'll take a look here.\n\n210\n00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.340\nThat you have to remember is that\nthe moment you create your account and\n\n211\n00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.960\nyou will have to agree to that\nbusiness service-level agreement.\n\n212\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.100\nAnd it does bind your company to\nthat service-level agreement, so\n\n213\n00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:37.860\nkeep that in mind.\n\n214\n00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.760\nYou have to be the person that has that\nauthority inside of your organization.\n\n215\n00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.090\nNow this is pretty much it,\nthis is the Windows Store for Business.\n\n216\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.980\nAnd you can see the splash screen,\nthe first start screen here that we have.\n\n217\n00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.933\nIt shows you some different categories\nthat if you scroll all the way down,\n\n218\n00:11:51.933 --> 00:11:54.584\nyou've got your individual\ncategories as well.\n\n219\n00:11:54.584 --> 00:11:58.847\nWhat we're gonna look at here at the top,\nwithout giving you sea sickness here,\n\n220\n00:11:58.847 --> 00:12:00.550\nis we're gonna choose Manage.\n\n221\n00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.750\nAnd if we come up to the top, we choose\nmanage, you can see a few options here.\n\n222\n00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:08.050\nYou can see inventory, you can see\nnew line of business applications.\n\n223\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:12.170\nAnd again if you need to work with your\npartners publisher's page, you can\n\n224\n00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.400\ngo over, you can jump over there, and you\ncan manage your publisher relationships.\n\n225\n00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.560\nAnd again, this is with external\ndevelopers, a little bit different than\n\n226\n00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.190\nside loading individual apps that\nmaybe you're internally managing.\n\n227\n00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.764\nAll right, we can look at our order\nhistory and we'll come back and\n\n228\n00:12:26.764 --> 00:12:29.840\nlook at some of this too cuz we're\ngonna right to the inventory.\n\n229\n00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.100\nNow keep in your mind,\nyour inventory here, it shows you\n\n230\n00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.680\nall of your managed applications here and\nyou can see that we'll have a few of them.\n\n231\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.330\nAnd we're gonna come back to\nsome of these in a bit here.\n\n232\n00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.890\nBut let's go ahead and\nlet's show you how you would, if you were,\n\n233\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:51.850\nthe person making the decisions here how\nyou would purchase an app, all right?\n\n234\n00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.320\nSo we're gonna go ahead and choose Shop.\n\n235\n00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.792\nAnd we are going to put this\non Ronnie's credit card here,\n\n236\n00:12:56.792 --> 00:12:58.566\nhe just doesn't know it yet, all right?\n\n237\n00:12:58.566 --> 00:12:59.805\nAnd-\n>> Get the cheap one.\n\n238\n00:12:59.805 --> 00:13:00.937\n>> There we go.\nWe'll get a cheap one,\n\n239\n00:13:00.937 --> 00:13:02.049\nwe'll get one that says free [LAUGH].\n\n240\n00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:02.897\n>> Yeah.\n\n241\n00:13:02.897 --> 00:13:05.421\n>> We're gonna go down here to\nthe Categories at the bottom,\n\n242\n00:13:05.421 --> 00:13:07.142\nwhich is a little easier for me to find.\n\n243\n00:13:07.142 --> 00:13:09.370\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm going to click Business.\n\n244\n00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.220\nThe applications that you're looking for\nare really up to you.\n\n245\n00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.680\nAnd I'm gonna scroll down and\nyou can see they got a lot more here.\n\n246\n00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.740\nWe're gonna choose Productivity.\n\n247\n00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.110\nAnd we'll kinda scroll\nthrough the list here.\n\n248\n00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.195\nThere we go, Dropbox.\n\n249\n00:13:21.195 --> 00:13:23.250\nEverybody's gotta have Dropbox, right?\n\n250\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:27.730\nAnd you'll notice that it says\nLicense Type Online, right?\n\n251\n00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.690\nIt tells you a little bit\nabout the application itself.\n\n252\n00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.045\nIt gives you what is compatible for and\nthat's the other thing that's really cool.\n\n253\n00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:37.874\nYou can tell right away going out\nthe gate what application this supports,\n\n254\n00:13:37.874 --> 00:13:41.964\nright here from the Windows business\nstore to centrally managed environment.\n\n255\n00:13:41.964 --> 00:13:45.026\nYou say well, I need you to login\nwith your Microsoft account and\n\n256\n00:13:45.026 --> 00:13:46.567\nI need you to download Dropbox.\n\n257\n00:13:46.567 --> 00:13:48.972\nWell, after that you know if it\nis actually gonna be supported,\n\n258\n00:13:48.972 --> 00:13:51.030\nif hopefully you've done\nyour research beforehand.\n\n259\n00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.950\nBut in this case,\nyou can do it in a centralized manner.\n\n260\n00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.130\nAll right, so we'll got ahead and\nwe'll choose Get App.\n\n261\n00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.520\nAll right and notice that it says\nDropbox has been purchased and\n\n262\n00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.140\nadded to your inventory.\n\n263\n00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:08.440\nSo if I come back up here, let's get it,\nwe will go back to our inventory again.\n\n264\n00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.150\nYou'll notice that, hey,\nit was that easy, right?\n\n265\n00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.336\nDropbox is now ready to go for us.\n\n266\n00:14:15.336 --> 00:14:21.852\nNow what if we want to add this\nto our private store, right?\n\n267\n00:14:21.852 --> 00:14:25.407\nWe wanna make it available to users\nin its own little dedicated tab when\n\n268\n00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:27.771\nthey log into the Windows Store for\nBusiness.\n\n269\n00:14:27.771 --> 00:14:31.079\nWell, this is where, if you look\nunder the Actions location, right?\n\n270\n00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:34.833\nThere's this little ellipsis option here,\nand if I choose down or\n\n271\n00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:38.330\nif I choose that, I should say,\nI've got a few options here.\n\n272\n00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.180\nAnd I could add this to the private store.\n\n273\n00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.185\nNow, I want you to be careful on this bin.\n\n274\n00:14:42.185 --> 00:14:45.274\nThis is something if you need it for\nMonday and maybe you do it on Friday,\n\n275\n00:14:45.274 --> 00:14:47.503\n[LAUGH] because it could\ntake up to about 12 hours.\n\n276\n00:14:47.503 --> 00:14:50.907\nAnd you'll see here coming up that it\ncould take about 12 hours to add it to\n\n277\n00:14:50.907 --> 00:14:51.459\nthe store.\n\n278\n00:14:51.459 --> 00:14:53.330\nNaturally, this one says 24 hours.\n\n279\n00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.420\nI've seen some that say 12, I've seen\nsome that say 24, so keep that in mind.\n\n280\n00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.570\nIf this is something you needed yesterday,\n\n281\n00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.830\nyou don't wait til today to do\nit because it'll take awhile.\n\n282\n00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:06.720\nIn fact, I did these, Ronnie,\nI'll say probably about six hours ago and\n\n283\n00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.920\nyou can see the add is in progress.\n\n284\n00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.883\nNotice that this isn't\nin the private store and\n\n285\n00:15:10.883 --> 00:15:13.050\nI know my head's kind of\ncovering it up right there.\n\n286\n00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.974\nBut notice that it says Not in the private\nstore, and it says Add in progress.\n\n287\n00:15:16.974 --> 00:15:20.439\nThe difference here is exactly what it\nsounds like I don't wanna put this in\n\n288\n00:15:20.439 --> 00:15:21.599\nthe private store here.\n\n289\n00:15:21.599 --> 00:15:24.088\nUp here at top all the way at the bottom,\n\n290\n00:15:24.088 --> 00:15:28.110\nthese are a couple of apps\nthat are doing just that.\n\n291\n00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.989\nNow I also want you to notice\nthe product type here.\n\n292\n00:15:29.989 --> 00:15:35.304\nNotice it says Online, but if I scroll\ndown, I also have one that says Offline.\n\n293\n00:15:35.304 --> 00:15:37.130\nWell, what's that about?\n\n294\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.891\nRemember what I told you\nabout the offline modeling,\n\n295\n00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:44.914\nIf I want, I could make this\navailable offline to users.\n\n296\n00:15:44.914 --> 00:15:48.103\nLet me go ahead real quick before I do\nthat and don't get ahead of myself,\n\n297\n00:15:48.103 --> 00:15:49.374\nthat's the private store.\n\n298\n00:15:49.374 --> 00:15:52.284\nLet me show you could add an,\na user to an application,\n\n299\n00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:56.525\nbasically assigning it to user If I want,\nI can take one of these applications,\n\n300\n00:15:56.525 --> 00:15:59.249\nagain we're gonna look\nunder the Actions column,\n\n301\n00:15:59.249 --> 00:16:04.400\nwe're gonna choose the Ellipse here, and\nwe're gonna choose Assign to People.\n\n302\n00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.410\nAll right.\n\n303\n00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.490\nNow in this case, what I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna assign this to a user that\n\n304\n00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:12.020\nI've already created in\nAzure Active Directory.\n\n305\n00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.990\nAll right.\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n306\n00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.690\nwe'll assign this to good\nold Scott Summers here.\n\n307\n00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:17.970\nAnd he's already in the list.\n\n308\n00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.550\n[LAUGH] I got Ronny laughing in the\nbackground you can't really see him right\n\n309\n00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.170\nnow he knows the characters that\nI'm talking about right here, and\n\n310\n00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.090\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose Assign, all right?\n\n311\n00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.780\nAnd it looks like a second now and\nit is as simple as that.\n\n312\n00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.640\nNow when Scot Samers logs\ninto the Window Store for\n\n313\n00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:37.240\nbusiness he's gonna see that he has the\nPDF reader available to him for download.\n\n314\n00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.430\nAll right, so, again,\nfairly straightforward.\n\n315\n00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.070\nNot that big of a deal.\n\n316\n00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.750\nNow, let's go up and look at some of\nthe additional settings that we have too.\n\n317\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.180\nSo up here at the top we have settings.\n\n318\n00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.870\nAnd I'll get into some\nof these options here.\n\n319\n00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:53.180\nHere in a second, but I wanna go jump down\nto the private store here since we've been\n\n320\n00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.930\ntalking about it we've added some things.\n\n321\n00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:59.870\nYou should see that I have nothing here,\nif I click this, notice it says\n\n322\n00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.600\nuse the private store to distribute online\napps and then you have your display name.\n\n323\n00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.920\nNow that display name is what\nthe tab is gonna look like.\n\n324\n00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.810\nNow I don't have have anything yet here,\n\n325\n00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:12.570\nso I would have to wait probably another\n24 hours or so before I see that.\n\n326\n00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:16.820\nBut when your users log in whatever name\nyou put on the display name is going to be\n\n327\n00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:22.920\nthe tab that they use to go and\nclick to your private store.\n\n328\n00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.440\nNow, next thing that we have\nis account information.\n\n329\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.710\nNow, in account information we'd\nbeen talking a little bit about\n\n330\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.640\nthe offline licensing model, okay?\n\n331\n00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.360\nIf you wanna use offline licensing,\nyou have to turn it on first.\n\n332\n00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.280\nNotice it says offline licensing,\n\n333\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.762\nshow offline licence apps to\npeople shopping in the store.\n\n334\n00:17:44.762 --> 00:17:47.310\nAll right, if I want to make\nthat available to my users,\n\n335\n00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:52.660\nI'm going to have to check that off right\nthere so they can, view that information.\n\n336\n00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.970\nSo what is the benefit\nof the offline well,\n\n337\n00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:59.320\nthis gives you the ability to cache your\napplications locally so that they can be\n\n338\n00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.510\navailable to the local network even if\nthere isn't an Internet connection.\n\n339\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.150\nYou could also cache the licenses to the\nlocal network, so you could provision your\n\n340\n00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:12.080\nlicense beforehand, and you don't have to\nworry about a licensing compliance issue.\n\n341\n00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.090\nIf developers want, developers can\nactually flag their applications for\n\n342\n00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.920\nan offline licensing model and\nyou can just purchase them\n\n343\n00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.940\nlike every other application that\nalso has an offline licensing model.\n\n344\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.870\nNow you say,\n\n345\n00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:29.640\nwait a second, how would i know what\nan offline [LAUGH] licensing model is?\n\n346\n00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.220\nWell, I tell you what, let's go ahead and\nshow you where to go shopping here.\n\n347\n00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:36.260\nNow, this is one that I've already\nadded but I do want you to see this.\n\n348\n00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.360\nI'm gonna go ahead.\n\n349\n00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.720\nI'm gonna drop down back to Business here.\n\n350\n00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.670\nAnd we can do a search for it and\nmake it a little bit easier, but\n\n351\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.085\nI figure this kind of shows you around\nthe environment just a little bit,\n\n352\n00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:50.515\nand I'm gonna scroll down to Productivity.\n\n353\n00:18:52.545 --> 00:18:59.985\nI probably have to go to the search\nengine and make it a little bit easier.\n\n354\n00:18:59.985 --> 00:19:03.355\nI'll tell you what,\nlet's go ahead and do that,\n\n355\n00:19:03.355 --> 00:19:06.245\ncuz I figured it'd be\nright up here at the top.\n\n356\n00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:12.310\nIf you wanna provision, for\ninstance, your mobile devices, BYOD.\n\n357\n00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.960\nCompany portal for Windows Intune?\n\n358\n00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.800\nWell, that's okay.\n\n359\n00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.180\nJust go up here and type it.\n\n360\n00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.380\nCompany portal, all right.\n\n361\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.610\nAnd there it is.\n\n362\n00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.280\nNow, again, it's not so\n\n363\n00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.290\nmuch the application here\nthat I want you to look at.\n\n364\n00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.520\nMore so that I want you to pay\nattention to the licensing model here.\n\n365\n00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.660\nNotice that we've got two.\n\n366\n00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.230\nWe've got online and\nwe can choose Offline, right?\n\n367\n00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.510\nUnlimited licenses available also shows\nyou what your pool of licenses is\n\n368\n00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:36.750\nright here.\n\n369\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.280\nNow this is Unlimited pool cuz it's free.\n\n370\n00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.030\nSo there's nothing we really have to\npay here, but it is good to know and\n\n371\n00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.400\nsee that you can get that information.\n\n372\n00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.660\nAnd if I choose Manage, or\nin this case, it would say get the app,\n\n373\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.820\nI've already downloaded it,\nso it is inside my inventory.\n\n374\n00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.910\nI jump back over to my inventory, and\nin this case, I kind of know where it is.\n\n375\n00:19:55.910 --> 00:20:02.180\nIf I scroll all the way down, I can see\nit's at the Company Portal, Offline model.\n\n376\n00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.700\nI know that this is gonna be available\non the local network regardless of\n\n377\n00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.700\nthe Internet connection so that's specific\nto the application that you are using now,\n\n378\n00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.390\nin an offline licensing model\nhow can I do the installation?\n\n379\n00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.350\nWell you can do the installation fairly\neasy you can use the Windows Store for\n\n380\n00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.980\nbusiness if you want to.\n\n381\n00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.050\nYou can also use MDM solutions\nlike Windows Intune or\n\n382\n00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.200\nuse your own third Party mobile\ndevice management solution.\n\n383\n00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.450\nYou also have the ability that if you\nhave third party applications that your\n\n384\n00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:31.090\ncompany's already bought, you can come\nup here to the Settings option and\n\n385\n00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.990\nyou can choose Manage Tools.\n\n386\n00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.800\nAnd then the management tools here,\nI can add a management tool if I want.\n\n387\n00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.890\nSo you can also import\nthird party applications\n\n388\n00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:41.770\nright in here to the Windows Store.\n\n389\n00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:46.710\nFor business, more specifically, if you\nwant to use those for managing devices.\n\n390\n00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:47.790\nAll right.\nSo\n\n391\n00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.800\nthat's a little bit about\nthe management tools.\n\n392\n00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.780\nThe next thing I kinda wanna look at\nis I wanna look at the permissions.\n\n393\n00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.540\nNow, with the permissions, I've got\na little slide set up so that we can kinda\n\n394\n00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.320\ngo through these and then I wanna\nkinda jump back to the interface and\n\n395\n00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.700\nshow you where would you even find these,\nall right?\n\n396\n00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.560\nWell, with the roles and\n\n397\n00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.830\npermissions you have these administrators\nthat can do more global functions, right?\n\n398\n00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.780\nYou have the global administrator.\n\n399\n00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.730\nAnd the global administrator, just like\nin some of the other, in practically all\n\n400\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:18.210\nthe cloud based solutions that we talk\nabout, Azure, Office 365, Intune.\n\n401\n00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.190\nThey have full access.\n\n402\n00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.930\nAccess to the entire infrastructure\nincluding purchasing additional services\n\n403\n00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:25.930\nso you want to be careful with that role.\n\n404\n00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.660\nYou can sign up, you can assign roles, you\ncan even modify company profile settings.\n\n405\n00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.720\nNow for the exam here's a couple\nI want you to remember,\n\n406\n00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.625\nthe user administrator Administrator.\n\n407\n00:21:35.625 --> 00:21:40.565\nThey can assign roles to other users,\nprovided they have the admin role.\n\n408\n00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:42.575\nWe're gonna look at\nthe admin role coming up.\n\n409\n00:21:42.575 --> 00:21:46.045\nThis is what we can use to specifically,\nthat admin role?\n\n410\n00:21:46.045 --> 00:21:52.205\nWe're talking just to manage\nthe Windows Store for Business.\n\n411\n00:21:52.205 --> 00:21:54.365\nAll right?\nAnd then the Billing Administrator.\n\n412\n00:21:54.365 --> 00:21:58.025\nThe Billing Administrator has\nthe identical set of permissions as\n\n413\n00:21:58.025 --> 00:21:59.880\nthe Purchaser does, too.\n\n414\n00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.840\nAgain, those administrative roles.\n\n415\n00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.250\nright here, being specific to\nthe Windows store or business.\n\n416\n00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.050\nAll right, that's the admin, all right?\n\n417\n00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:14.280\nthis is the admin that can help IT just\nfor the Windows store for business, right?\n\n418\n00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.470\nThey can modify account settings,\nthey can acquire apps,\n\n419\n00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:22.150\nthey can distribute apps, they can also\nsign policies and catalogue.We'll come\n\n420\n00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:26.480\nback to what that means here in a second\na little bit more, as well as purchaser.\n\n421\n00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.330\nPurchaser does exactly\nwhat it sounds like.\n\n422\n00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.900\nGo into the Windows store,\nsays ok, you need Dropbox.\n\n423\n00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.850\nOkay, you need OneNote.\n\n424\n00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:32.950\nWe can purchase it.\n\n425\n00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.410\nAcquire the application and\ndistribute it if we want.\n\n426\n00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:40.840\nHere's where an interesting\npermission comes in to play for us.\n\n427\n00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.270\nAnd that is the device guard signer.\n\n428\n00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.380\nWell, what is that?\n\n429\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.990\nWell device guard is something that\nprotects your mobile byod devices which\n\n430\n00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.190\nmeans that an application that's\ninstalled on it has to be trusted and\n\n431\n00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:55.620\nhas to be digitally signed with\na code signing certificate.\n\n432\n00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.620\nWow, boy, isn't that a mouthful?\n\n433\n00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.060\nNow, who is it that can do that?\n\n434\n00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.580\nOnly two roles.\n\n435\n00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.810\nThe two roles that you have are gonna\nbe your admin that can do this and\n\n436\n00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.710\nthis device guards signer.\n\n437\n00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:11.140\nNow that's enough talking about it,\n\n438\n00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.080\nlet's show you where you\nwould do something like that.\n\n439\n00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.450\nAll right, if I go back to my settings\nlocation up at the top of the screen,\n\n440\n00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.340\nyou'll see permissions here.\n\n441\n00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.140\nNow if you can't,\nremember it for the exam.\n\n442\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.670\nBut if you can't remember it\nafter you take the exam and\n\n443\n00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.350\nyou're still using this technology.\n\n444\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.150\nWatch this.\n\n445\n00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.440\nClick Permissions.\n\n446\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.620\nAll right, and wow, wasn't that amazing?\n\n447\n00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.590\nGive it a second here.\n\n448\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.580\nWait for it.\n\n449\n00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.970\nAnd we choose Add people.\n\n450\n00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.740\nAnd here we go, we've got a nice list.\n\n451\n00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.390\nThe list that tells us exactly\nwhat can and can't happen.\n\n452\n00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.980\nAccount settings > Acquire\napps > Distribute apps.\n\n453\n00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.140\nI don't have to read these out to you.\n\n454\n00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:52.629\nBut if you look you will see the very\npermission sets that we just look that.\n\n455\n00:23:52.629 --> 00:23:57.477\nSo when you're practicing for the exam\nlook at these settings, memorize these.\n\n456\n00:23:57.477 --> 00:24:01.640\nWhen it comes to The more of\nthe global type administration.\n\n457\n00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.611\nThose are the three types.\n\n458\n00:24:02.611 --> 00:24:05.941\nRemember we got the global administrator,\nthe user administrator, and\n\n459\n00:24:05.941 --> 00:24:07.735\nthe billing administrator.\n\n460\n00:24:07.735 --> 00:24:09.300\nAnd know what they can do.\n\n461\n00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.930\nAll right, so\nif I wanted to I could say, all right,\n\n462\n00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.600\nI want to have a purchaser, right?\n\n463\n00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.120\nAnd we'll go ahead and\n\n464\n00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.870\nwe'll put Scott Summers as the purchaser,\nwe'll choose save.\n\n465\n00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:21.780\nAnd now we've delegated administrative\n\n466\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.080\nroles inside of the Windows Store for\nbusiness.\n\n467\n00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.400\nFairly easy process not really\nisn't to difficult to set up.\n\n468\n00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.470\nOne of the next things I kinda wanna\nshow you is go over just a little bit\n\n469\n00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.190\nof the device guard signing.\n\n470\n00:24:37.402 --> 00:24:41.030\nAll right now device guard signing does\nrequire you to have a couple of things.\n\n471\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.600\nIt requires you to have or\nhave purchased a certificate.\n\n472\n00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.460\nEither way you got to have it.\n\n473\n00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.460\nWhen I say well you have or purchase one,\nwell what's the difference.\n\n474\n00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.060\nYou could if your company already has\nan internal enterprise public key\n\n475\n00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:56.570\ninfrastructure and you got a code signing\ncertificate, just upload it to the cloud.\n\n476\n00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.660\nIf you don't have that and\nyou want it to be trusted and\n\n477\n00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.130\nyou want somebody else to manage\nthat infrastructure for you.\n\n478\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.242\nYou can go out to somebody like\nSymantec and you could purchase a code\n\n479\n00:25:04.242 --> 00:25:07.310\nsigning certificate and\nthen you could upload it here.\n\n480\n00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.250\nAll right?\n\n481\n00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.820\nNow, if you do have a public\nkey infrastructure,\n\n482\n00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:16.360\nnotice it says download your organizations\nroot certificate file for Device Guard.\n\n483\n00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.950\nNow what is that root certificate?\n\n484\n00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:18.960\nWell, there's a couple of things.\n\n485\n00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:23.210\nI need a code integrity certificate\nto sign the application and\n\n486\n00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.460\nI need my device to trust the Windows\nstore in order to download it.\n\n487\n00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.800\nSo there's a couple of things that\ngo on there so keep that in mind.\n\n488\n00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.870\nSo again, just wanted to kinda\nshow you those settings.\n\n489\n00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:38.300\nAgain, pretty straight forward if you\nknow where it is that you're looking.\n\n490\n00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.230\nOne of the last things that I might show\nyou here is just the account information.\n\n491\n00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:46.230\nAgain, this is something that you can\nsetup if you're the administrator you have\n\n492\n00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.270\nthe ability to do this.\n\n493\n00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:54.686\nAgain, we can edit your\nOrganization Information if we wanted now.\n\n494\n00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:56.819\nBy default when you create\nyour first account,\n\n495\n00:25:56.819 --> 00:25:58.760\nnone of this information is populated.\n\n496\n00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:04.250\nI went ahead and populated and then tried\nto erase it just so I could show you\n\n497\n00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.550\nguys it populating, but it won't let you\nerase it once you've already entered it.\n\n498\n00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.770\nIt'll only let you edit it after the fact,\nso that's why I really can't change this.\n\n499\n00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:12.280\nI wanted to show it to you.\n\n500\n00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.160\nBut just take my word for it guys, it's\njust blank fields that you turn around and\n\n501\n00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.990\nyou put your address in, so\nthat's pretty straightforward.\n\n502\n00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:22.490\nAll right we'll go ahead and\nchoose cancel to this, and let it update.\n\n503\n00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:26.290\nPayment options, this is where we put\nRonnie's credit card in, right, and\n\n504\n00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.370\nwe order all kinds of services.\n\n505\n00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:29.660\nAnd then last but not least,\n\n506\n00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.930\nwe've already mentioned this again,\nthe offline licensing apps.\n\n507\n00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:37.382\nIf we wanna make them viewable to\npeople inside of the Windows store,\n\n508\n00:26:37.382 --> 00:26:38.390\nwe can do that.\n\n509\n00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.100\nLet me just kinda look through here,\nmake sure that we didn't forget anything.\n\n510\n00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.150\nOther than that, I tell you what,\nlet's go back to our inventory.\n\n511\n00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.740\nCouple of more settings\nI want to mention here.\n\n512\n00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:51.290\nAll right, and\nlet's see here, there we go.\n\n513\n00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:56.366\nSo you do have the ability to get more\ninformation, like you've got license and\n\n514\n00:26:56.366 --> 00:26:59.946\nyou can see right here,\nI could do View License Detail.\n\n515\n00:26:59.946 --> 00:27:03.460\nAnd it tells me what\nthe licensing information is.\n\n516\n00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.990\nAll right, I don't,\nno licence had been assigned for this app.\n\n517\n00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:08.320\nI haven't assigned it to anybody.\n\n518\n00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.660\nI could assign it on an individual\nbasis like we just did before.\n\n519\n00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.370\nYou could also view\nthe individual app details and\n\n520\n00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:18.630\nit just takes you right back out to\nthe Windows store where we looked.\n\n521\n00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.330\nYou can also,\nif I get back to the Windows store here.\n\n522\n00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:27.230\nLet me get back to my\ninventory real quick.\n\n523\n00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:30.366\nWe also have the ability that we can\neven click on this information and\n\n524\n00:27:30.366 --> 00:27:32.218\nit takes us out to the Window store easy.\n\n525\n00:27:32.218 --> 00:27:36.909\nSo they make it really handy\nin the fact that you don't\n\n526\n00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:41.590\nhave to search for\na lot of different things here.\n\n527\n00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:42.810\nYou wanna view information.\n\n528\n00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.280\nYou wanna view the license detail.\n\n529\n00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.460\nYou wanna assign it to individual users,\n\n530\n00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.360\nif I could say that right,\nyou have the ability all from in here.\n\n531\n00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.050\nLast but not least, you can also look\nat your order history if you want.\n\n532\n00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.930\nAll right, and it shows me purchased.\n\n533\n00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:03.660\nIf I push the plus symbol I can see\nwhat the order number is I can see what\n\n534\n00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.790\nthe quantity is what the cost was.\n\n535\n00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.530\nAnd if there was ever something that\nmaybe you want to challenge and\n\n536\n00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.940\nyou want to refund that order,\nagain you could do that here.\n\n537\n00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.411\nSo you've got a lot of information\nthat you could see here,\n\n538\n00:28:15.411 --> 00:28:19.925\nagain it doesn't just fall by the wayside\nyou have specific order numbers for\n\n539\n00:28:19.925 --> 00:28:22.157\nevery single application you order.\n\n540\n00:28:22.157 --> 00:28:23.870\nAnd you can see that those\nnumbers are different.\n\n541\n00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:28.240\nSo if you're ever troubleshooting,\nand you need to dispute a charge, or\n\n542\n00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.560\nmaybe you just wanna find out\na little bit more about that,\n\n543\n00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.750\nyou've got all that information\nright here in your order history.\n\n544\n00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.760\nSo Ronnie It is different.\n\n545\n00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.180\nIt is different than what people\nsee in the Windows store,\n\n546\n00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.920\nwhen you log in with a Microsoft account.\n\n547\n00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.499\nAs far as the interface goes, for the most\npart, I mean, it's title based interface.\n\n548\n00:28:45.499 --> 00:28:46.730\nRight?\n\n549\n00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:49.840\nJust point and click not too difficult.\n\n550\n00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.330\nBut I would know some of the roles that\nwe've looked at, know a little bit about\n\n551\n00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:58.570\nthe offline licensing model, know about\nthe private store and what that entails.\n\n552\n00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:02.450\nSo that if they ask you on the exam,\nhow do you implement the Windows Store for\n\n553\n00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.350\nBusiness, you'll be prepared to do so.\n\n554\n00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.730\n>> All right Wes, well thank you again for\nhelping us to actually understand a little\n\n555\n00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.740\nbit more details about this\nidea of the Windows Store.\n\n556\n00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:15.640\nThat gives us the ability to control\nthe apps that we may want our users as\n\n557\n00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.900\nenterprise customers\nare going to want to control.\n\n558\n00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.780\nSo a lot of times we don't want\nour users to actually just be able\n\n559\n00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.200\nto click on the Windows store and\nactually download anything.\n\n560\n00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.600\nBut we may actually redirect them\nto our own private store, in which\n\n561\n00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.620\nwe have a number of apps that are right\nthere for them to be able to also use.\n\n562\n00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.320\nAnd then we can also upload apps there\ntoo, that maybe line of business,\n\n563\n00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.370\nspecifically for our industry as well.\n\n564\n00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:41.600\nSo getting to know that particular\napparatus is going to be key.\n\n565\n00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.310\nAnd getting to be able to administrate\nthat in the way that Wes talked about\n\n566\n00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:49.100\nin terms of the different admins\nthat you can actually create and\n\n567\n00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.380\nbe able to assign are also going\nto be important too on the exam.\n\n568\n00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.560\nYou do want to spend a little bit of time,\nmake yourself one of these accounts and\n\n569\n00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.520\nget familiar with those different rules,\nunderstand how to assign an app to users,\n\n570\n00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.710\nunderstand how to actually add\nin an app to the private store\n\n571\n00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:09.810\nas well as to assign different add\nminerals to different users too.\n\n572\n00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.010\nAll that’s gonna be important as well.\n\n573\n00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.340\nSo not only take a look at this one, but\nif you need a little bit more basics,\n\n574\n00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:20.820\ngo back to that 70/697 show as well,\nmake sure you take a look at that one too.\n\n575\n00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.410\nAnd both together should help you to feel\na bit more comfortable when working with\n\n576\n00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:27.320\na Window store, whether you're actually\ndoing it as an individual user or\n\n577\n00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.830\nyou're doing it for your business.\n\n578\n00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:32.110\nWell that's a great place for\nus to also then sign off then, for\n\n579\n00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.670\nITProTV, I've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n580\n00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:35.680\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n581\n00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.842\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows

00:00:18.443\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today,\nwe're actually taking a look at what\n\n4\n00:00:18.443 --> 00:00:21.330\nWindows 10, installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n5\n00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.740\nWe're taking a look specifically,\ninto the 70-698 exam objectives,\n\n6\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.970\nand we're gonna be moving into the realm\nof well, configuring remote management.\n\n7\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.820\nAnd who better to help us than Mr.\nWindows 10 himself, Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.900\nWes, welcome back to our show.\n\n9\n00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.670\n>> Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.245\nAs always, it's great to be here with\nthe ITProTV Crew, and that's right,\n\n11\n00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:42.390\nwe're gonna be looking at configuring\nsome of remote management.\n\n12\n00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.300\nNow, there are a series\nof tools that we there.\n\n13\n00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.280\nThere are a few tools and utilities that\nyou can do to manage a Windows machine\n\n14\n00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.150\nwhen you're not in the same physical\nlocation of the machine itself.\n\n15\n00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.640\nAnd what they call that on\nthe exam is the ability to\n\n16\n00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.040\nchoose a couple of these utilities and be\nable to recognize them for what they are.\n\n17\n00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.680\nSo we're gonna ahead and dive in and\n\n18\n00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.780\ntalk a little bit about\nthe options that you have.\n\n19\n00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.740\nOne of the first ones that we'll talk\nabout is, well, one that's been around for\n\n20\n00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.060\na while, and\nthat's called Windows Remote Management.\n\n21\n00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.240\nAnd this is combination of a service,\nit's a utility as well as a protocol.\n\n22\n00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.750\nAnd it's been in Windows for a while.\n\n23\n00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.140\nThe other one that we have is\nrelatively newer, I say relative in\n\n24\n00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.210\nthe larger Windows scheme of things,\nand that's called PowerShell Remoting.\n\n25\n00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.910\nAnd this is the way you can take your\nPowerShell command line interpreter and\n\n26\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.220\nyou can connect to another machine, you\ncan send commands to that machine and you\n\n27\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.880\ncan get information as well, so we'll look\na little bit in to PowerShell remoting.\n\n28\n00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.112\nThe other one that we have are,\nwell Microsoft Management Consoles,\n\n29\n00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:42.302\nyou might have heard them\nin other episodes, or\n\n30\n00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.569\nmaybe even somebody talking about them,\nMMCs.\n\n31\n00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.383\nWe're gonna show you how you\ncan launch up an MMC and\n\n32\n00:01:47.383 --> 00:01:51.642\nmake a remote connection to another\ncomputer, so you can do, for instance,\n\n33\n00:01:51.642 --> 00:01:54.020\nmaybe view the event logs on that machine.\n\n34\n00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.270\nWe got a couple, one of these\nwas covered in 697, but just for\n\n35\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.190\nthe sake of continuity, we wanna go\nahead and just mention it here, and\n\n36\n00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.680\nthat is Remote Desktop,\nas well as Remote Assistance.\n\n37\n00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.850\nRemember, if you're not sure\nwhat Remote Desktop is,\n\n38\n00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.610\njump back over to 7697 cuz\nthey do talk about it.\n\n39\n00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.280\nBut keep in mind that it's a way that I\ncan connect to another machine through\n\n40\n00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.510\nthe graphical user interface, and\nI can connect and control the desktop.\n\n41\n00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.600\nTake control of the desktop of another\nmachine if we need to do administration,\n\n42\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.740\nwe use this a lot in our servers for sure.\n\n43\n00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.680\nThe last one is part of\nthe Remote Assistance technology.\n\n44\n00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.510\nNow remote assistance has been around for\nawhile and\n\n45\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.540\nit allows you to connect to another\ncomputer much like Remote Desktop is, but\n\n46\n00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.820\none of the biggest things is that\nboth end parties or end points,\n\n47\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.420\nboth users that are sitting at\nthe computers can see what's going on.\n\n48\n00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.080\nSo we usually say that sharing\ncontrol of the desktop because\n\n49\n00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.540\ntwo people can be looking at\nthe desktop at the same time.\n\n50\n00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.180\nIt's a great way that if you wanna show\nsomebody how to do something step-by-step,\n\n51\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.670\nmaybe a little bit of proactive\nat maintenance or administration,\n\n52\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.650\nyou can do that.\n\n53\n00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.160\nEasy Connect, I'll tell you,\nEasy Connect is an option inside\n\n54\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.440\nof Remote Assistance that says if you're\non the same subnet and you've got a few of\n\n55\n00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.310\nthese technologies that we'll explain\nhere coming up, you can connect and you\n\n56\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.420\ndon't have to do things like constantly\nsending remote assistant invitations.\n\n57\n00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.470\nThey have to send an invitation one time,\nthey click on the invitation file,\n\n58\n00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.580\njust like in Remote Assistance, but\nthen the next time they won't have\n\n59\n00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.810\nto constantly keep allowing the end user,\nbasically you don't have to have\n\n60\n00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.180\nan end-user at the endpoint every time you\nwanna do some remote assistance to it.\n\n61\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.793\nIt allows that user to get up and\nwalk away, and\n\n62\n00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:36.480\nthen you can basically\nuse Remote Assistance.\n\n63\n00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.190\nSo let's go ahead, and the first one we\nwanna look at is Remote Management, WinRM.\n\n64\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.980\nNow, I've got a command prompt,\nor a PowerShell in this case.\n\n65\n00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.730\nActually, this is a command prompt,\nisn't it?\n\n66\n00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.999\nLet me log back in here.\n\n67\n00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:52.770\nAnd, I'm gonna go ahead and\nexit out of this again,\n\n68\n00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.934\njust because I really do like\nhaving my PowerShell open.\n\n69\n00:03:56.934 --> 00:04:01.520\nNow WinRM, again, it is an executable,\nit's a program that you can run inside of\n\n70\n00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.640\nyour system, keep in mind that\nit relies on a few things.\n\n71\n00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.640\nSo, if we wanted to test out where\nWinRM is enabled on a computer it's\n\n72\n00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.055\nas simple as just typing win,\nand that's W-I-N-R-M space,\n\n73\n00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:19.030\nand we can run something known\nas quickconfig if we wanted to.\n\n74\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.084\nNow, it also takes an abbreviation and I\nmentioned there are abbreviation guys just\n\n75\n00:04:25.084 --> 00:04:30.217\nfor the purposes of the exam, so\nI can type quickconfig or I can type qc.\n\n76\n00:04:30.217 --> 00:04:33.890\nLet me kinda zoom in there so\nyou guys can see that a little bit.\n\n77\n00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.300\nRemember, you can't type it out like\nthis inside of the command prompt,\n\n78\n00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.595\nbut I want you to know\nthat the full parameters\n\n79\n00:04:42.595 --> 00:04:46.510\nquickconfig the abbreviation is qc and\nboth of them work.\n\n80\n00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.250\nSo keep in mind they're exact same thing\nand I just want you to know they're,\n\n81\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.330\njust in case the exam asks you for\neither/or, you'll be ready.\n\n82\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.520\nSo if I run quickconfig and\n\n83\n00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.800\nI hit Enter, notice it's gonna\nask me a couple of things.\n\n84\n00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.936\nIt's gonna ask me,\ndo you wanna start the WinRM service?\n\n85\n00:05:01.936 --> 00:05:02.608\nAll right.\n\n86\n00:05:02.608 --> 00:05:05.120\nWell, what do they mean\nby the WinRM service?\n\n87\n00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.630\nLet me go ahead and\njust show you this here real quick.\n\n88\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.800\nWe'll open our Computer Management\nnode and we're gonna go\n\n89\n00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.060\ninto our services and we will look\nat what they're talking about, here.\n\n90\n00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.990\nCuz it is good to know,\n\n91\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.140\nfrom the graphical user interface,\nwhat service they're mentioning.\n\n92\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.180\nNotice we have up here,\n\n93\n00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.380\nif you see, we have that Windows\nRemote Management, WS-Management, and\n\n94\n00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.630\nwe could start the service from here if\nyou wanted to, we're not gonna do that.\n\n95\n00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.110\nBut I want you to know that this is\nthe service that it's gonna start, and\n\n96\n00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.840\nI also want you to know where\nto find it if you ever had to.\n\n97\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.906\nNow, if I want the WinRM,\nthe executable, to run this service,\n\n98\n00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:45.328\nall I have to do is go ahead and\ntype y for yes.\n\n99\n00:05:45.328 --> 00:05:46.266\nAll right.\n\n100\n00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:48.025\nNow here's the next component.\n\n101\n00:05:48.025 --> 00:05:53.612\nNow the next component in here is what is\nknown as a listener service, all right.\n\n102\n00:05:53.612 --> 00:05:57.696\nThis listener service can be\nconfigured to listen on HTTP,\n\n103\n00:05:57.696 --> 00:06:01.640\nit can also be configured to\nlisten on HTTPS, all right.\n\n104\n00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.490\nAnd also, if we look,\nit's gonna enable a firewall exception.\n\n105\n00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.300\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and say yes to this.\n\n106\n00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.170\nAnd then what I wanna do real quick is\nI'm gonna drop down to the firewall and\n\n107\n00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.140\njust kinda show you that, all right.\n\n108\n00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.064\nIf I type in my little search\nfield here that's probably\n\n109\n00:06:20.064 --> 00:06:25.840\nthe smallest run line command\nin Windows today, it's wf.msc.\n\n110\n00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.890\nAnd what that does is it launches up the\nWindows firewall with advanced security.\n\n111\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.378\nAnd if I check out my inbound rules,\nI can filter through here and\n\n112\n00:06:35.378 --> 00:06:39.284\none of the things that I will see,\nmore close to the top,\n\n113\n00:06:39.284 --> 00:06:44.795\nis notice this inbound rule, it says\ndomain environment, and it is allowed.\n\n114\n00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:50.848\nThat is the firewall rule that needs to be\nthere if you're gonna allow the inbound\n\n115\n00:06:50.848 --> 00:06:57.096\ntraffic when somebody is doing the remote\nmanagement functionality, all right.\n\n116\n00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.750\nSo, three components, keep that in mind.\n\n117\n00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.080\nNow, we can jump over to\nour other machine, and\n\n118\n00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.460\nwe can start to prep it as well.\n\n119\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.710\nSo, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll jump over here.\n\n120\n00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.000\nAnd we'll get this machine,\nit looks like it went to sleep on me here.\n\n121\n00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.360\nWe'll get this machine resumed back up,\nwe'll go ahead and log back in.\n\n122\n00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.630\nAnd we're gonna do this\non this machine as well.\n\n123\n00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.960\nNow, very simple, all we're gonna\ndo is launch our PowerShell.\n\n124\n00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.220\nThis could be in the command prompt\nas well guys, it works the same way.\n\n125\n00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.520\nAnd we're gonna run winrm, and\n\n126\n00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.560\nthis time I'm gonna do the qc just to\nshow you that the abbreviation works.\n\n127\n00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.020\nAnd now it asks me the same question,\ndo I wanna start the service?\n\n128\n00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.140\nDo I wanna set up that\nlistener to listen to\n\n129\n00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.070\ninbound communications when we\nmake a remote management request.\n\n130\n00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.295\nAnd well go ahead and say yes to that.\n\n131\n00:07:45.295 --> 00:07:46.274\nAll right.\n\n132\n00:07:46.274 --> 00:07:50.468\nNow that has got us pretty much set up for\nRemote Management.\n\n133\n00:07:50.468 --> 00:07:55.093\nBut I do wanna take a second because a lot\nof times we talk about how to configure\n\n134\n00:07:55.093 --> 00:07:57.028\nand turn on Remote Management.\n\n135\n00:07:57.028 --> 00:08:00.902\nBut what if you performed your\nremote management and you're done?\n\n136\n00:08:00.902 --> 00:08:04.661\nYou don't need a remote management well,\nwe tell you security if best practice if\n\n137\n00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:08.200\nyou don't need that service,\nwe tell you to disable it, right?\n\n138\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.150\nWe can do that but\nit does take a few steps, all right?\n\n139\n00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.910\nOne of the first steps we gotta do\nis we gotta delete the service, or\n\n140\n00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.780\ndelete that listener, all right?\n\n141\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.820\nSo I'm gonna show you real quick\nhow to do that, all right?\n\n142\n00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.600\nAnd let me go ahead and mention this.\n\n143\n00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.210\nIf you want to find out\nsome of these commands,\n\n144\n00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:30.024\nall you have to do is do a winrm /?.\n\n145\n00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.362\nAnd you can see the various\noptions here that we could use.\n\n146\n00:08:34.362 --> 00:08:38.850\nNow, we're gonna go ahead and use\na little bit more of these options here.\n\n147\n00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.790\nSo what I'm gonna do is winrm and\nthen I'm gonna do a delete.\n\n148\n00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.161\nAll right, and then here's where some\nof those options come into play.\n\n149\n00:08:47.161 --> 00:08:50.529\nWe're gonna do a winrm/config/listener.\n\n150\n00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:57.311\nKeep in mind that's what we're deleting,\nthe listener, here.\n\n151\n00:08:57.311 --> 00:09:01.582\nAnd it's gonna be a?\n\n152\n00:09:01.582 --> 00:09:08.660\nAddress and then that's =*+transport.\n\n153\n00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.190\nAll right, and then transport=http\nif we had set up HTTPS and\n\n154\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.650\nwe bound a certificate to this,\nwell guess what, we would do HTTPS.\n\n155\n00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.560\nAnd we're gonna run that And it's gonna\nsay, doesn't look like it did anything.\n\n156\n00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.926\nHow I can tell if it did something?\n\n157\n00:09:23.926 --> 00:09:26.130\nWell, I can always run\nthat winrm qc again.\n\n158\n00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:31.560\nAnd it's gonna tell me\nthat service is running,\n\n159\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.720\nand it just says,\ndo you want me to create the listener?\n\n160\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.398\nI'm gonna say no to that.\n\n161\n00:09:35.398 --> 00:09:39.766\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\njust forget about that for a second.\n\n162\n00:09:39.766 --> 00:09:42.689\nNow the next thing that we would have\nto do is we would have to go into\n\n163\n00:09:42.689 --> 00:09:43.760\nthe services console.\n\n164\n00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.316\nSo if I do services.msc,\n\n165\n00:09:48.316 --> 00:09:53.130\nI can alphabetically cycle these back\nby clicking the name field here.\n\n166\n00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.560\nAnd scroll down and you will see\nWindows Remote Management, right?\n\n167\n00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:04.180\nAnd we can disable this service and\nwe can choose stop, all right.\n\n168\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.916\nNow that has got the service\nstop that's the second part.\n\n169\n00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:08.970\nLast part is close the firewall down,\nright?\n\n170\n00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.455\nRemember that we open the firewall to\nallow the incoming traffic to respond or\n\n171\n00:10:13.455 --> 00:10:15.249\nthe listener to respond to it.\n\n172\n00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:17.560\nSo that will be the next\nplace that we're gonna go.\n\n173\n00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.580\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ntype a wf.msc and, again,\n\n174\n00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.140\nthat's gonna launch our Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security.\n\n175\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.700\nAll right, and we'll go ahead and\n\n176\n00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.690\nlook down through here for\nour Windows Remote Management.\n\n177\n00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.410\nYou can see there's the rule that we have,\nit is turned on.\n\n178\n00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.340\nYou can see that it's enabled.\n\n179\n00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.730\nWe're just gonna right click on it.\n\n180\n00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.650\nWe're gonna choose disable, all right.\n\n181\n00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.430\nAnd when we do that, we've\nessentially reversed what we've done.\n\n182\n00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.660\nAnd, I said, I just make a mention of\nthat to show you some of the options you\n\n183\n00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.130\nhave as well, because, from a security\nstandpoint, if you're no longer gonna\n\n184\n00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.780\nperform any remote management on\nthe system, you want to close it down.\n\n185\n00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.192\nSo just to show you guys so\nyou know how to do that.\n\n186\n00:10:56.192 --> 00:11:00.910\nWe're gonna go ahead and go winrm qc and\nwere gonna v set this up again or\n\n187\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.655\nthis would be a very short episode.\n\n188\n00:11:02.655 --> 00:11:07.150\n[LAUGH] All right there we go,\nso now what do we have?\n\n189\n00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.760\nWell we've got Client 01 and\nwe've got Client 02 both set up for\n\n190\n00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.460\nremote management.\n\n191\n00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.960\nNow, we don't have to\njust stop with win rm,\n\n192\n00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.720\nwe also talked a little bit about\nthe Windows Power Show, right?\n\n193\n00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.780\nWe can do Windows PowerShell remoting.\n\n194\n00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.460\nNow understand that it falls,\n\n195\n00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.160\nbasically piggybacks off of\nthe Windows Remote Management Service.\n\n196\n00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.300\nSo what I could do here is\nsince I'm in the PowerShell,\n\n197\n00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:39.240\nI could do Enable-PSRemoting, all right?\n\n198\n00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.410\nNow there's an option\nthat we can throw out,\n\n199\n00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:45.640\nbut I kind of want you to see all of the\ninformation that it's gonna throw at you.\n\n200\n00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.520\nAnd then when we switch over to the other\nclient I'll show you a way that you don't\n\n201\n00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.520\nhave to worry about hitting yes, yes, yes,\n\n202\n00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.690\nyes a whole bunch of times like\nyou're gonna see here in a second.\n\n203\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.950\nSo if I choose enable PS remoting,\nall right.\n\n204\n00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.995\nNow one of the first things that's\ngonna do is that it's gonna check and\n\n205\n00:12:01.995 --> 00:12:05.043\nsee is that Windows RM service turned on,\nall right.\n\n206\n00:12:05.043 --> 00:12:07.603\nAnd notice it says to enable remote\n\n207\n00:12:07.603 --> 00:12:12.475\nmanagement to this computer use\nthe Windows RM service, right?\n\n208\n00:12:12.475 --> 00:12:13.610\nDo you want to continue?\n\n209\n00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.020\nWell I can choose yes, all right.\n\n210\n00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.193\nAnd notice how it said,\nwell that's already set up.\n\n211\n00:12:18.193 --> 00:12:22.300\nLet me just make mention of this, not only\nfor the real world, but for the exam.\n\n212\n00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.630\nIf you run this enable\ndash ps remoting you do,\n\n213\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.890\nyou don't you don't have to\nrun win rm quick config, why?\n\n214\n00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.510\nBecause it's gonna ask you when\nit's goes into enable ps remoting\n\n215\n00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.775\nnotice how I checked\nthis service right here.\n\n216\n00:12:35.775 --> 00:12:37.655\nIt said it's already running.\n\n217\n00:12:37.655 --> 00:12:40.495\nIf it wasn't running, it would go through\nthe same process that we've just seen.\n\n218\n00:12:40.495 --> 00:12:42.945\nIt'd say, well,\nwe've gotta turn the service on,\n\n219\n00:12:42.945 --> 00:12:46.725\nwe've gotta create the listener,\nand the exception to the firewall.\n\n220\n00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:49.145\nNext thing you'll get is\nwhat we see right here.\n\n221\n00:12:49.145 --> 00:12:51.385\nIt'll ask us do you want\nto perform this option.\n\n222\n00:12:51.385 --> 00:12:52.765\nWe can choose yes, and\n\n223\n00:12:52.765 --> 00:12:56.841\nthen it gives you a few other\ncommandlets that it's gonna turn on.\n\n224\n00:12:56.841 --> 00:13:00.027\nAnd you notice I believe it's about\nfour times here that we say yes.\n\n225\n00:13:00.027 --> 00:13:05.550\nAnd then finally after we've confirmed\neverything we're ready to go, right.\n\n226\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.500\nPS or PowerShell remoting is\nnow enabled on this computer.\n\n227\n00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.010\nBut you don't really have to go\nthrough that whole entire process and\n\n228\n00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.610\nyou can make it a lot easier for\nyourself, and this also goes for\n\n229\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.650\nsetting up the WINRM service.\n\n230\n00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:22.365\nIf I jump back to my other machine here,\nall I have to do is run\n\n231\n00:13:22.365 --> 00:13:27.470\nenable-psremoting and\n\n232\n00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.340\nI can do the -force option.\n\n233\n00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.580\nWhen I run that, notice what will happen.\n\n234\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.960\nAll right, and we wait for it,\nwe wait for it, notice that it\n\n235\n00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.390\nchecked WINRM just like we said before\ncuz it runs on the surface of that.\n\n236\n00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.590\nThat's the protocol, if you will,\nin the background, the whole platform or\n\n237\n00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.630\nfoundation that PowerShell\nremoting runs on.\n\n238\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.230\nNotice it didn't give me any options.\n\n239\n00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.670\nIt didn't say, yes do you want to do that.\n\n240\n00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:55.040\nSo the forced option, even with WINRM,\nwould turn that on and\n\n241\n00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:01.720\nit doesn't warn us or\ngive us any options here.\n\n242\n00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.040\nNow that we've got some\nWindows Remote Management turned on,\n\n243\n00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.750\nnow we can do a little bit\nof this PS remoting, okay?\n\n244\n00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.830\nNow there are three different\ntypes of PS remoting, all right?\n\n245\n00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.920\nThere's two of them I want\nyou to worry for the exam.\n\n246\n00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.640\nOne I'm gonna mention here just\nbecause it's not quite as common as\n\n247\n00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.260\nthe first two, all right?\n\n248\n00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.090\nI want you to think about your\nnetwork communications, right?\n\n249\n00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.340\nWhen we have two servers communicating\nback and forth, what do we call that?\n\n250\n00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.620\nA one to one communication, right?\n\n251\n00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.660\nWell PowerShell Remoting when\nyou have a single computer,\n\n252\n00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.400\nin this case let's go\ndown the analogy route.\n\n253\n00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.030\nI'm sitting right here\nat this computer and\n\n254\n00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.850\nI'm gonna send some commands\ndirectly to a server or\n\n255\n00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:44.060\ndirectly to a client out there, that's\ncalled a one to one PowerShell Remoting.\n\n256\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.790\nIt's by far the most common, all right.\n\n257\n00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.397\nIt's basically a single\ncommand that's fired off.\n\n258\n00:14:49.397 --> 00:14:53.947\nFrom the remote management machine to\nthe source that you're gonna manage,\n\n259\n00:14:53.947 --> 00:14:58.640\nit executes and you get the output comes\nback to your local machine, one to one.\n\n260\n00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.267\nLet me know show you what I mean here,\nso if we jump down to my computer,\n\n261\n00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:06.336\nI can run something, tell you what,\nlet me figure out now which computer I am.\n\n262\n00:15:06.336 --> 00:15:08.611\nWe've kind of jumped around\nhere a little bit, okay.\n\n263\n00:15:08.611 --> 00:15:09.629\nSo I'm on client one,\n\n264\n00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:13.530\ngotta remember because it's gonna come\nup when we put our computer names in.\n\n265\n00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.595\nThat does matter for us.\n\n266\n00:15:15.595 --> 00:15:18.402\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we're gonna do something known as\n\n267\n00:15:18.402 --> 00:15:20.550\nthe invoke command.\n\n268\n00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.800\nCommand, if that is not redundant.\n\n269\n00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.100\nAnd when you do this you're gonna\nspecify the computer name, all right?\n\n270\n00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.350\nSo the parameter is computer\nname dash computer name.\n\n271\n00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:35.681\nAnd then after the space, I'm gonna put,\nif I can spell it right, client02.\n\n272\n00:15:35.681 --> 00:15:40.740\nNow here is an important parameter.\n\n273\n00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.430\nMost of these parameters are important\nthat I'm gonna show you here.\n\n274\n00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.797\nComputername, I want you to remember that.\n\n275\n00:15:44.797 --> 00:15:46.605\nIt specifies, like it says,\nthe computer name.\n\n276\n00:15:46.605 --> 00:15:51.057\nNow, any of the commandlets that you\nwanna run on the remote computer\n\n277\n00:15:51.057 --> 00:15:54.994\nAre followed after a parameter\ncalled ScriptBlock, okay.\n\n278\n00:15:54.994 --> 00:15:58.448\nSo if we type ScriptBlock and\nthen we close it off,\n\n279\n00:15:58.448 --> 00:16:03.896\nwe can do things like would really just\nabout any PowerShell command, right.\n\n280\n00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:08.213\nSo I can do get-ChildItem and\nI can do a space c: and\n\n281\n00:16:08.213 --> 00:16:10.934\nI can do Program files, right.\n\n282\n00:16:10.934 --> 00:16:15.520\nMaybe I want to find out what programs\nare installed on the remote machine.\n\n283\n00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.180\nNow, there's other ways you can do this,\nbut\n\n284\n00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.880\nthis is just one of the ways\nthat I like to do this, right.\n\n285\n00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.600\nAnd I can run this, and looks like I\nmissed a positional parameter here.\n\n286\n00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.852\nLet me just make sure here.\n\n287\n00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:29.210\nAnd you know what, I know what it's doing.\n\n288\n00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.650\nNotice my syntax here, guys?\n\n289\n00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:36.070\nLet me go ahead and just rerun the,\nlooks like it's not gonna let me run that,\n\n290\n00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.220\nlet me try that again.\n\n291\n00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.990\nInvoke-command -ComputerName.\n\n292\n00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.012\nIt didn't like the way, I've got that\nlittle, small little parenthesis over\n\n293\n00:16:45.012 --> 00:16:48.270\nthere, so, quotation mark,\nI gotta take that out real quick.\n\n294\n00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.285\nAll right, so we'll try that again.\n\n295\n00:16:51.285 --> 00:16:56.572\nGet-ChildItem, and then this time I'll\njust type it out, c:\\Program Files,\n\n296\n00:17:00.249 --> 00:17:04.315\nMaking sure that the quotes\nare on both sides.\n\n297\n00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:05.255\nThat is important.\n\n298\n00:17:05.255 --> 00:17:09.380\nIt did not like that missing quote there.\n\n299\n00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.718\nThat's why we don't really particularly\ncare for spaces in the name.\n\n300\n00:17:14.718 --> 00:17:20.612\nAll right, and then we'll close\nthat off there and we'll try that.\n\n301\n00:17:20.612 --> 00:17:24.612\nAll right and when it, it was waiting for\nsomething on that first time, it was like,\n\n302\n00:17:24.612 --> 00:17:27.272\nwell wait a second Wes, [LAUGH] you\nforgot part of the command there.\n\n303\n00:17:27.272 --> 00:17:28.730\nSo, there you can see.\n\n304\n00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:29.900\nNow what happened here?\n\n305\n00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.200\nAll right,\nit reached over across the network,\n\n306\n00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.620\nit looked at Client02, I'm on Client01.\n\n307\n00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.550\nIt reached over the network and it said,\nokay, I need you to run this cmdlet.\n\n308\n00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.176\nAnd it runs the cmdlet,\nonce the cmdlet is done,\n\n309\n00:17:43.176 --> 00:17:47.960\nit basically sends back the response over\nthe network, and I see it locally, right.\n\n310\n00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.120\nNotice what it says what the PowerShell\ncomputer name is here, right.\n\n311\n00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.550\nIt's Client02.\n\n312\n00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:57.130\nWell, if I come back here and\nclear this out, do another host name, so\n\n313\n00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.200\nI can figure out who I am,\nnotice I'm on Client01.\n\n314\n00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.490\nNow, there's a lot of\noptions that you can run.\n\n315\n00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:09.880\nLot of different of these\ncmdlets that you can run.\n\n316\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.830\nNow that is a one to one, all right.\n\n317\n00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.060\nWell, can we do something\nlike maybe a one to many?\n\n318\n00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.000\nWhat I'm gonna do here is, I'm gonna go\nahead and I'm gonna switch over to my\n\n319\n00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.440\nDC here and get logged into my DC and\nwhat I'd like to show you is that\n\n320\n00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.992\nyou can also do the second most popular\none would be what's known as one to many.\n\n321\n00:18:28.992 --> 00:18:31.710\nAll right, one to many,\nI think about communications, right.\n\n322\n00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.120\nI think about, for instance,\nmulti-cast, right.\n\n323\n00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.700\nThat's one to many different endpoints.\n\n324\n00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.940\nWell that's essentially what\nyour remote PowerShell or\n\n325\n00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.440\nPowerShell remoting one to many is, right.\n\n326\n00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:50.310\nNow I'm on the DC and if I launch up\nmy PowerShell, clear the screen here.\n\n327\n00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:55.240\nAnd this time I decide that I'm gonna\ndo an Invoke-Command, same one, right?\n\n328\n00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.470\nWe're gonna do ComputerName.\n\n329\n00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:04.915\nBut this time I'm gonna do Client01, and\nthen a space, and I'm gonna do Client02.\n\n330\n00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:11.515\nAll right, well now maybe I wanna\nfind out what are the programs that\n\n331\n00:19:11.515 --> 00:19:13.070\nare installed on both machines?\n\n332\n00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.350\nWell, we can do that.\n\n333\n00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.800\nRemember your ScriptBlock, all right?\n\n334\n00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.924\nWe're gonna close this off, all right.\n\n335\n00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:25.507\nAnd we're gonna do a Get-ChildItem and\nthen we're gonna do C:\\Program files,\n\n336\n00:19:25.507 --> 00:19:30.750\nand then we're gonna go ahead and\nclose that off again.\n\n337\n00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.670\nAnd when we run this,\nnotice that it's running.\n\n338\n00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:36.200\nIt's gonna take a second, but\nnow I got a lot more output.\n\n339\n00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.480\nNow I know my head's kinda covering\nit up here, but if you look, well,\n\n340\n00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.310\nwe've got Client01 and Client02 there.\n\n341\n00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.650\nSo both of these computers.\n\n342\n00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.560\nWhat happened?\n\n343\n00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.610\nWell the one is the DC here.\n\n344\n00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:47.850\nI'm on the Domain Controller.\n\n345\n00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:51.388\nNow, probably not gonna do this from a\nDomain Controller just giving the security\n\n346\n00:19:51.388 --> 00:19:53.830\nnature of protection of\nthe Domain Controller, but\n\n347\n00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.970\nI can have a dedicated work\nstation do the same thing, right?\n\n348\n00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:03.590\nAnd if I wanted to, I could make\nthis one to as many as I want.\n\n349\n00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.850\nIf I had another client here,\nI could just put client, Client03, right.\n\n350\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:13.139\nAnd then Client04 and then Client05 and\nwe could continually run this until well,\n\n351\n00:20:13.139 --> 00:20:16.047\nwe have all the computers\nthat we wanna manage.\n\n352\n00:20:16.047 --> 00:20:17.969\nSo that is a one to many.\n\n353\n00:20:17.969 --> 00:20:24.210\nNow that is, keep in mind the next one I\ntalked about is not that really popular.\n\n354\n00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.170\nThis is a many to one, all right.\n\n355\n00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.690\nNow your source is gonna\nbe multiple administrators\n\n356\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.529\nsending multiple different\nPowerShell cmdlets\n\n357\n00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:37.410\nfrom multiple PowerShell sessions all\nthe way back to a single computer.\n\n358\n00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.770\nNow, that one is out there.\n\n359\n00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.220\nI mentioned it for the sake of the exam so\nyou'll be aware of it.\n\n360\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.260\nIt's not as common as the first two.\n\n361\n00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.430\nThe first two are the most common, even\nwhen you look at, go out there to Technet,\n\n362\n00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.700\nyou read some of Microsoft's articles,\nthey'll tell you,\n\n363\n00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.930\nthe many to one is not as common.\n\n364\n00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.180\nAll right, so, let's give you an example\nof some of the other things that you can\n\n365\n00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.000\nrun in here, if you are doing\nthe Powershell remoting, right.\n\n366\n00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.660\nSo if I want, I can do things like, for\ninstance, I can get my event logs, right.\n\n367\n00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:11.130\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna do\na many or a one to one on this one guys,\n\n368\n00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.840\nbecause you could start getting a lot\nof information up on your screens here.\n\n369\n00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.390\nKeep in mind this works, too,\nwith a one to many remoting as well.\n\n370\n00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:25.760\nBut if I change this Get-ChildItem,\nI can say Get-EventLog, right?\n\n371\n00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.430\nAnd then what I can do is I can tell it,\nwell, gotta be careful too,\n\n372\n00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.930\nby the way,\nhow much of the event logs you wanna get.\n\n373\n00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.910\nCuz it could take a very,\nvery long time to process this.\n\n374\n00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:42.173\nLike, for instance, I could say,\nget event log, and I could do list, and\n\n375\n00:21:42.173 --> 00:21:43.710\nI could run that.\n\n376\n00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.570\nAnd, well, that didn't actually,\n\n377\n00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.590\nthat really didn't take too\nlong I'm actually surprised.\n\n378\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.540\nSome of these can take a good long while,\nright.\n\n379\n00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.070\nNow what if I want to get\nnewer entry logs, right?\n\n380\n00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.715\nWell I can also filter this too.\n\n381\n00:21:55.715 --> 00:21:58.142\nSo for instance,\nI can in here in the ScriptBlock,\n\n382\n00:21:58.142 --> 00:22:01.369\njust past the ScriptBlock parameter,\nremember that for the test.\n\n383\n00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:09.000\nRight, I could say instead of list,\nI can say newest, and I could say 5,\n\n384\n00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.300\nand then I could put another parameter\nin there for LogName, right?\n\n385\n00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.700\nAnd I can say application.\n\n386\n00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.670\nYeah, application does tab.\n\n387\n00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:19.940\nSome of them don't tab, some of them do.\n\n388\n00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.710\nAnd then I could run this.\n\n389\n00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.733\nAll right, now when we run this,\nnotice what it did, right.\n\n390\n00:22:24.733 --> 00:22:29.640\nIt said it gave me the newest\n5 information logs resource\n\n391\n00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.330\nfrom the application logs on Client01.\n\n392\n00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.199\nKeep in mind I'm on the DC here.\n\n393\n00:22:35.199 --> 00:22:38.566\nSending that over the network,\nit's firing off the command and\n\n394\n00:22:38.566 --> 00:22:41.640\nthen the output is set back\nto my computer, right.\n\n395\n00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.470\nAnd I could do, if I wanted to,\nI could put 10 in here.\n\n396\n00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.220\nRerun it,\nnow it's gonna give me 10, right?\n\n397\n00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.070\nSo, again you could modify\nwith these parameters.\n\n398\n00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.150\nNow, what if I want to get a process,\nright?\n\n399\n00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:54.860\nWell, we can do that likewise.\n\n400\n00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:59.380\nI can change this from application, right?\n\n401\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.950\nAnd instead of application I\ncould say Get-Process, right.\n\n402\n00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.680\nAnd from here I could say what\nprocess is it that you want to get?\n\n403\n00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.830\nWell, I could say explorer, right.\n\n404\n00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.790\nAnd then I could pipe this out if\nI wanted to, to the format list.\n\n405\n00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:19.300\nNow you can spell out\nformat list if you want.\n\n406\n00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.690\nAnd I can just do an asterisk\nsymbol after that, or\n\n407\n00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:24.887\nif I wanted to I could just do FL.\n\n408\n00:23:24.887 --> 00:23:26.520\nAll right, so we'll run this.\n\n409\n00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.590\nAnd look at the process, right?\n\n410\n00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.680\nLook at the process that we got.\n\n411\n00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.740\nThis is Windows Explorer,\nright, running on that machine.\n\n412\n00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.830\nAnd I got a lot of detailed information.\n\n413\n00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.170\nI got the product version, right.\n\n414\n00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:40.420\nWe can see what product version\nwe're running right now.\n\n415\n00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.760\nAnd again, just a lot of\ndifferent information on this.\n\n416\n00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.759\nSo you can get processes as well.\n\n417\n00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:50.047\nAll right, now we can also do this with\nsomething like services if I wanted to.\n\n418\n00:23:50.047 --> 00:23:55.012\nSo for instance, If I want,\nwe'll go ahead, and\n\n419\n00:23:55.012 --> 00:23:57.860\nlet's do another one here.\n\n420\n00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.140\nAll right, so we'll do a Get-Service.\n\n421\n00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.907\nAnd I'm gonna to say s with\nwith an asterisk here, and\n\n422\n00:24:04.907 --> 00:24:08.024\nI'm gonna pipe that out\nto the sort object.\n\n423\n00:24:09.719 --> 00:24:12.445\nAnd we're gonna do status.\n\n424\n00:24:12.445 --> 00:24:14.545\nAll right, and we're gonna run that.\n\n425\n00:24:14.545 --> 00:24:17.807\nRight, so, now get me the service,\nall right?\n\n426\n00:24:17.807 --> 00:24:21.287\nIt starts with an s, I don't care what's\nbehind it right with asterisk symbol and\n\n427\n00:24:21.287 --> 00:24:22.977\nreport that back to me, right?\n\n428\n00:24:22.977 --> 00:24:25.557\nWell you say, well,\nwhy would I need something like that?\n\n429\n00:24:25.557 --> 00:24:29.467\nWell, here give you a scenario, somebody\ncalls in and says, hey I can't print.\n\n430\n00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:31.207\nMy printer's not printing.\n\n431\n00:24:31.207 --> 00:24:34.417\nWell, is your prints\nspooler service running?\n\n432\n00:24:34.417 --> 00:24:36.007\nDoes it need to be restarted?\n\n433\n00:24:36.007 --> 00:24:38.080\nYour end users aren't gonna know that,\nright?\n\n434\n00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.220\nSo, if I look down here at the bottom,\n\n435\n00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.370\nlook what servers I just returned,\nspooler.\n\n436\n00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.580\nI can see that it's running, right?\n\n437\n00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.530\nSo I have the ability to do exactly that.\n\n438\n00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.330\nSo, we see in a single server, right?\n\n439\n00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.110\nWe looked at the print spooler service,\nif we needed to\n\n440\n00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:56.930\nhelp somebody with the printing aspect of\ntheir computer, we can do it remotely.\n\n441\n00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.490\nWell what if you don't know maybe\na service has dependencies.\n\n442\n00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.690\nMost of your services do,\nnot all services, do but\n\n443\n00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.990\na lot of services do have dependencies.\n\n444\n00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:11.250\nWell we can also do that too, so let's go\nahead and let's rerun our invoke command.\n\n445\n00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:15.010\nAnd we're still gonna go ahead and\ndo a Get-Service, but\n\n446\n00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:16.580\na little bit different this time.\n\n447\n00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.640\nWhat I'm gonna do here is I'm\ngonna say winRM, and then\n\n448\n00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.770\nI'm gonna put a dash RequiredsServices,\nand we'll close that off and we'll run it.\n\n449\n00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.300\nNow when I do this, what's gonna happen\nis it's gonna tall me okay when RM is\n\n450\n00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.510\nrunning, right, but yeah we know it's\nrunning, cuz we had to configure\n\n451\n00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:37.220\nit to even run these commandlets, but more\nimportantly the dependencies here, right?\n\n452\n00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.222\nThe required services,\nI can see that, well,\n\n453\n00:25:40.222 --> 00:25:43.625\njust about 75% of Windows\nruns on the RPC service.\n\n454\n00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:46.610\n[LAUGH] But no surprise here,\nthis is another one.\n\n455\n00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.680\nBut also the HTTP service, right,\nwell you said why the HTTP service?\n\n456\n00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.742\nRemember the listener, right?\n\n457\n00:25:51.742 --> 00:25:55.520\nThe listener's what's listening out for\nthis incoming remote commandments.\n\n458\n00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.660\nAlright, now I can also do\nthings like getting event logs.\n\n459\n00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:03.030\nLike for instance I can do,\nwe'll rerun our invoke command.\n\n460\n00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.720\nRemember, again, I can't stress enough,\nremember computer name and script block.\n\n461\n00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.690\nAnd what we're gonna do\nnow is get event log.\n\n462\n00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:20.170\nWe'll say log name is going to be system,\nand then we're gonna do entry type.\n\n463\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:25.320\nSo, now what I'm doing is\nsaying give me just the errors.\n\n464\n00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.140\nI'm gonna really filter this down.\n\n465\n00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:32.850\nI'm gonna say just entry type is gonna\nbe error, and we're gonna run that.\n\n466\n00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:35.380\nAnd holy goodness.\n\n467\n00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.790\nDo we have some errors?\n\n468\n00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.270\nSee, and this is another thing.\n\n469\n00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:41.810\nLike I said, be very careful when\nyou're doing a many to one here.\n\n470\n00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.420\nNotice how many errors we have.\n\n471\n00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.240\nCan we imagine if we were doing four,\nfive, six computers on here?\n\n472\n00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.310\nRight?\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n473\n00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.050\nAll right.\n\n474\n00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:52.370\nSo that's some of\nthe things that you can do.\n\n475\n00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.905\nThe other thing I might want to do\nis I might want to clear the log.\n\n476\n00:26:54.905 --> 00:26:56.360\n[INAUDIBLE] Well, can we do that?\n\n477\n00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.140\nYes we can.\n\n478\n00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.370\nLet's go ahead, and let's do exactly that.\n\n479\n00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:04.370\nBecause not only knowing it, they might\nwant you to actually configure it.\n\n480\n00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:05.000\nRight?\n\n481\n00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.130\nDo some configuration.\n\n482\n00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:11.970\nSo I can do a Clear-Eventlog.\n\n483\n00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.919\nWe've gotta name what log it is.\n\n484\n00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:20.900\nAnd that's gonna be application,\nwe're gonna do system,\n\n485\n00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:25.220\nand then what we're gonna\ndo here is put a confirm.\n\n486\n00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:31.032\nAnd then we'll run that,\nnow it's warning us,\n\n487\n00:27:31.032 --> 00:27:35.400\nremember, you're clearing your logs\nhere those could be important.\n\n488\n00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.680\nNow we can say, we can sit here and\nclick yes a couple of times,\n\n489\n00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.720\nor we can type the letter A,\nand it clears the logs.\n\n490\n00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.110\nAll right, so\nfairly straightforward process.\n\n491\n00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.550\nNow, we've got some more to go.\n\n492\n00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:51.570\nWe've got some other technologies\nthat we wanna look at,\n\n493\n00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.870\nand Ronnie you wanna take\ncare of it in this show here?\n\n494\n00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:59.270\n>> Well, let's go ahead and make a part\ntwo on this, in that way we'll actually\n\n495\n00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.620\ntake a little bit more time that we\nneed to, to make sure that we covered\n\n496\n00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.960\neverything that we have, instead of\ntrying to rush it and get it all in here.\n\n497\n00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:10.110\nNow, remember that as we actually take\na look at all of this information,\n\n498\n00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:13.280\nyou do wanna make sure that you understand\nsome of those different options for\n\n499\n00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.620\nremote management.\n\n500\n00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.540\n>> Make sure you take a look at\nthose configurations Wes showed us\n\n501\n00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:20.580\na lot of information in this episode.\n\n502\n00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.170\nNow these are important especially when\nyou need to know, are you going to be\n\n503\n00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:28.630\nrunning again those remote management\nthings not on that remote computer, but\n\n504\n00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.420\nwhich one do you actually need?\n\n505\n00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.510\nAre you going to end up using the WRM?\n\n506\n00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.490\nAre you gonna end up using PS remoting?\n\n507\n00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:37.020\nMake sure you go back and\ntake a look at that information.\n\n508\n00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.920\nIf you're gonna be running PowerShell\nscripts, use the PS remoting.\n\n509\n00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.250\nIf you know that you're actually\ngonna be running applications and\n\n510\n00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.650\ntrying to get those things\ninstalled on a remote computer,\n\n511\n00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:51.050\nthink about that idea of using that WIN RM\nas well to help you connect that way, too.\n\n512\n00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.010\nAnd there's a few more that\nwe want to take a look at,\n\n513\n00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.600\nbut that's a great place for\nus to end this episode.\n\n514\n00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.697\nSo signing off for ITPRO TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n515\n00:28:58.697 --> 00:28:59.705\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n516\n00:28:59.705 --> 00:29:02.630\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows 10 shows.\n\n",

I'm your host\n\n3\n00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.480\nRonnie Wong and today we're\nactually diving into Windows 10.\n\n4\n00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.516\nWe're taking away and implementing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n5\n00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:24.770\nMore specifically in a Part Two\ntalking about some of the remote\n\n6\n00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.010\nmanagement features that you can\nactually go ahead and put in place.\n\n7\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.590\nBut we've got a few more to go.\n\n8\n00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.380\nAnd so we have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.920\nWes Bryant here to help us to understand\nwhat those other options are.\n\n10\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.040\nWes welcome back to our studio.\n\n11\n00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.930\n>> Thank you.\nThat's right we're going into a Part Two\n\n12\n00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.060\nto because like Ronnie says,\nhe let me talk way too long that's right.\n\n13\n00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.430\nWe were pretty heavy into the command line\nright, the PowerShell if you will, but\n\n14\n00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.070\nnow what we're gonna do is we're going to\njump over the graphical user interface and\n\n15\n00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.410\nwe're gonna talk a little bit about\nanother option that we have and\n\n16\n00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.700\nthat is the long oldie but goodie,\nthe Microsoft Management Console.\n\n17\n00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.100\nSo I've actually got my\nPowerShell pulled up here and\n\n18\n00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.900\nlet me do real quick here make\nsure what computer I'm on.\n\n19\n00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.890\nOkay I'm on client 01.\n\n20\n00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.600\nWe'll type mmc here and here it is.\n\n21\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.300\nHere's your Microsoft Management Console.\n\n22\n00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.730\nRemember this is a blank framework.\n\n23\n00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.510\nLike a lot of the system utilities\nyou have inside of Windows,\n\n24\n00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.370\nthey are based on\nMicrosoft Management Consoles.\n\n25\n00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.820\nThis one here,\nyou define what snap-ins you want.\n\n26\n00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.880\nNow we can do a file, choose file here,\nand we can choose Add or Remove Snap-in.\n\n27\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.740\nI personally like Ctrl-M,\njust gets me there a little bit quicker.\n\n28\n00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.370\nNow, the next thing that we're gonna do\nis, we're gonna select, say, Event Viewer.\n\n29\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.350\nKeep in mind that this is going to rely on\nthat Windows Remote Management technology.\n\n30\n00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.830\nIt is important so we're gonna go ahead\nand we're gonna add Event Viewer.\n\n31\n00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.110\nAnd notice that it tells me,\nwell, you want to do this for\n\n32\n00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.820\nthe local computer or do you wanna\ndo this for a remote computer?\n\n33\n00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.690\nNow if it's the local computer,\nwhat you're saying is,\n\n34\n00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.800\njust load in the snap-in for\nEvent Viewer and\n\n35\n00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.960\nthen show me local event logs that\nare on the hard drive of this machine.\n\n36\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.808\nBut in this case what we want to do is\nwe want to connect to another machine.\n\n37\n00:01:58.808 --> 00:02:02.630\nSo we're gonna say, another computer,\nand we could type the name in here, but\n\n38\n00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.090\nwe could also choose Browse.\n\n39\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.030\nKeep in mind that if you are in\nan Active Directory environment,\n\n40\n00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.860\nyour computer has to be able to connect\nto the domain controller in order to\n\n41\n00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.530\nget that entire directory,\nright, to use that directory.\n\n42\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.930\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna type,\nmaybe type, Client02, and what\n\n43\n00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.220\nwe'll do here is we'll do a check names\nand notice that it is underscored there.\n\n44\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.280\nUnderlined so that we do see\nthat machine is available to us.\n\n45\n00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.980\nAnd we're gonna go ahead,\nand we're gonna add it.\n\n46\n00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.750\nAnd notice that it is connecting.\n\n47\n00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.670\nAll right, and we'll wait for a second,\nand we'll wait for it to connect, and\n\n48\n00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.200\nwe'll wait for it to connect.\n\n49\n00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.270\nKeep in mind in a previous episode,\nwhat we did is we showed you how to enable\n\n50\n00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.150\nthe WinRM service right,\nyou run your WinRM space quick config or\n\n51\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.600\nyou run WinRM space and then QC and\nthen we go through a few steps.\n\n52\n00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.400\nNow notice that I got an error okay.\n\n53\n00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.910\nUnderstand that there's\nmultiple components here.\n\n54\n00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.760\nJust because we have a listener\nservice listening out for\n\n55\n00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.280\na remote management command doesn't mean\nthat we have everything we need set up.\n\n56\n00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.210\nSo what we're gonna do here is we're\ngonna ignore this error for a second.\n\n57\n00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.400\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\njump over to our Client02.\n\n58\n00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.460\nNow I've launched up the Windows\nfirewall with advanced security.\n\n59\n00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.220\nThere are a couple of rules in here\nthat we have to make sure that we\n\n60\n00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.750\nturn on in order to allow this to happen.\n\n61\n00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.270\nAnd what we're looking for,\nI should say, is the remote management.\n\n62\n00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.810\nWhere is it there?\n\n63\n00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.690\nYeah, Remote Event Log Management,\nif I can say that.\n\n64\n00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.240\nAnd we're gonna basically enable\n\n65\n00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.770\nall of these Remote Event Log Management\nrules, all right?\n\n66\n00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.190\nSo we're just gonna go down through here.\n\n67\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.640\nWe're right-clicking on them.\n\n68\n00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.700\nWe're choosing Enable.\n\n69\n00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.360\nAll right.\n\n70\n00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.670\nNow we've got all of the ones\nthat we needed enabled right,\n\n71\n00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.490\nremote event log management.\n\n72\n00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.660\nNow let's switch back to Client01 and\n\n73\n00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.180\nsee if we can get this lovely\nlittle error to disappear.\n\n74\n00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.340\nWe're gonna have to start over again,\nwe're gonna choose Add, and\n\n75\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.690\nI've already browsed, I know that\nthe computer's there, I know it by name.\n\n76\n00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.190\nIf you didn't it's nice to have\nthe search dialog box, but\n\n77\n00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.160\nin this case I'll just go ahead and\ntype Client02, and we'll choose OK.\n\n78\n00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.310\nNow, notice the difference here,\nnotice it added it right away,\n\n79\n00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.300\nin fact I'm gonna go ahead and\nremove it here a second,\n\n80\n00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.300\nbecause, you might not\nhave seen that right.\n\n81\n00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.610\nYou blink, you miss it.\n\n82\n00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.540\nI'm gonna go ahead.\n\n83\n00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.570\nWe'll do this one more time.\n\n84\n00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.180\nChoose Add, we'll chose another computer.\n\n85\n00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.390\nAgain, we're gonna choose Client02.\n\n86\n00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.190\nI'm gonna choose OK.\n\n87\n00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.476\nAnd just like that it adds it.\n\n88\n00:04:38.476 --> 00:04:40.990\nSo it's a little bit more\nthan just Windows RM.\n\n89\n00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.700\nAnd that's one of the reason we kinda want\nto show you this to make sure that you\n\n90\n00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.680\nrealize that the Remote Event\nLog Management firewall rules\n\n91\n00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.220\nare a necessity in order to do this here.\n\n92\n00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.300\nAnd we'll go ahead and choose OK.\n\n93\n00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.890\nAll right.\n\n94\n00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.960\nNow that we know that we have connected.\n\n95\n00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.560\nWell, what could we do here?\n\n96\n00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.900\nWell, I can actually open up Event Viewer.\n\n97\n00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.070\nAnd I want you to see something\nthat's kind of interesting.\n\n98\n00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.960\nNotice what Event Viewer says.\n\n99\n00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.770\nIt says client 02.lab.itprotv.\n\n100\n00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.350\nLet me go ahead and\n\n101\n00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.950\nshow you what it would look like if\nit's the local event viewer, right?\n\n102\n00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.510\nNothing really fancy about this one,\nand it does tell you that it's local.\n\n103\n00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.210\nSo this is remote, and this is local.\n\n104\n00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.810\nNotice that if I wanted, for instance,\n\n105\n00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.240\nmaybe I wanted to find out if\na group policy was operational.\n\n106\n00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.160\nI'd go to the operational logs\nhere on Client02 from Client01.\n\n107\n00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.220\nRemember the Remote Management part.\n\n108\n00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.770\nWe can expand out the Applications and\nServices log.\n\n109\n00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.440\nAnd it takes a second,\ncuz now what it's doing,\n\n110\n00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.220\nI don't know if missed it there\nwith the little hour glass.\n\n111\n00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.780\nIt takes a second and what it does is it\ncommunicates over the network it says,\n\n112\n00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.250\nhey, I need those event logs,\nI need to see those.\n\n113\n00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.620\nNow I get down here into Microsoft,\nopen up Windows, and\n\n114\n00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.570\nboy a whole bunch of stuff in here.\n\n115\n00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.960\nAnd if I scroll down, somewhere in this\nmassive list should be Group Policy.\n\n116\n00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.128\nThere it is, and\nI can choose the Operational Logs.\n\n117\n00:05:59.128 --> 00:06:03.940\nAnd just like viewing it locally.\n\n118\n00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.940\nBut if I double click on any\none of these policies here or\n\n119\n00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.610\nthese events, notice what it tells me.\n\n120\n00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.135\nNotice the source,\nthe source computer, right.\n\n121\n00:06:13.135 --> 00:06:22.151\nIt tells me right there,\nthat this is a Client02.lab.itpro.tv,\n\n122\n00:06:22.151 --> 00:06:27.490\nif I get that right here.\n\n123\n00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.890\nNow the next one I wanna just mention real\nquick is something that needs some set up,\n\n124\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.860\nand I'm not gonna save the console here.\n\n125\n00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.950\nAnd this is something called Easy Connect.\n\n126\n00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:42.330\nNow Easy Connect is a part of the Windows\nRemote Assistance, so if I drop down,\n\n127\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.890\nand I decide that I wanna type MSRA and\nrun that command, that command is just\n\n128\n00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.580\nthe run line command, if you will,\nfor Microsoft Remote Assistance.\n\n129\n00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.930\nAnd if I wanna invite somebody,\nI could do a couple of things here, right?\n\n130\n00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.970\nIf somebody's already sent me\nan invitation, I would be the helper, so\n\n131\n00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.000\nit says, Help,\nwant somebody who has invited you?\n\n132\n00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.810\nOr I could say Invite\nsomebody you trust to help.\n\n133\n00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.460\nRight?\nAnd when I click this,\n\n134\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.980\nnotice it gives me this option,\nUse Easy Connect.\n\n135\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:09.880\nAll right?\n\n136\n00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.420\nWe have saved the invitation as a file,\nand if I wanted to do this, and\n\n137\n00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.880\nI'm like Ronnie, I have looked and looked\nand looked and I cannot find this issue.\n\n138\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.800\nWell Ronnie can say well just\nemail me the invitation file and\n\n139\n00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.800\nwhen Ronnie clicks on it he just puts\nin the password and now he can connect.\n\n140\n00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.935\nNow we can also use\nWindow Easy Connect here.\n\n141\n00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:32.895\nEasy Connect is a little bit different,\nbecause you are gonna go ahead, and\n\n142\n00:07:32.895 --> 00:07:35.315\nyou're gonna do this first\nprocess where you set it up, and\n\n143\n00:07:35.315 --> 00:07:40.760\na person has to be at the end point, the\ncomputer that you're gonna help assist.\n\n144\n00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.130\nAnd they're gonna authorize the helpee or\nthe helper I should say,\n\n145\n00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.480\nthe first time and then after that\nthey don't have to be there again.\n\n146\n00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.380\nAll right, so if I say hey well Ronnie,\nthis is an ongoing situation.\n\n147\n00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.750\nI have to leave for a little bit.\n\n148\n00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.610\nWell now if Ronnie's\nusing remote assistance,\n\n149\n00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.390\nhe's like well Wes I\ncan't help you with that.\n\n150\n00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.290\nHe's got other options.\n\n151\n00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.760\nSome of the options that we've looked at\nhere but in this aspect, once Easy Connect\n\n152\n00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.290\nis set up he just clicks on it and now I\ndon't have to be there and he doesn't have\n\n153\n00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:09.640\nto worry about an end user being there\nat the computer validating the request.\n\n154\n00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.480\nNow there are a couple of things\nthat this does rely on, and\n\n155\n00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.150\nif I jump down to my Services console.\n\n156\n00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.480\nLet me just,\nI was gonna open up a computer management.\n\n157\n00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.130\nLet's go ahead and\njust open the Services console by itself.\n\n158\n00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.440\nAll right.\n\n159\n00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.800\nThere's a few things that you have to make\nsure that are running here in order for\n\n160\n00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.755\nthis to work.\n\n161\n00:08:29.755 --> 00:08:33.035\nAll right, let me see if I can find,\nthe first one on the list.\n\n162\n00:08:33.035 --> 00:08:34.125\nYeah, there we go.\n\n163\n00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:35.049\nMake sure I got this one.\n\n164\n00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:35.775\nThis is the PNR PNRP service,right?\n\n165\n00:08:35.775 --> 00:08:43.830\nThis is the Peer Name Resolution Protocol\nand it needs to be running.\n\n166\n00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.840\nNow, I will tell you, the other\nthing that this requires, is IPv6.\n\n167\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.060\nSo if we drop down to\nour Network Properties,\n\n168\n00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.570\nwe open up our network here,\nnetwork adapter.\n\n169\n00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.750\nRight click on our network adapter.\n\n170\n00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.880\nChoose properties, you should see\nscrolling down to the bottom that yes,\n\n171\n00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.950\nwe do have IPv6.\n\n172\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:07.560\nNow, we could verify that we have an IPv6\naddress as well, but I will tell you,\n\n173\n00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.530\nthe type of IPv6 address that\nwe have right now is an FE80.\n\n174\n00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.010\nIt's a link local address,\nand that isn't going to work.\n\n175\n00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:14.630\nWhy?\n\n176\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.230\nWell, because a lot of times this\nis gonna be traversing NATs,\n\n177\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.620\nNetwork Address Translations.\n\n178\n00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.510\nSo what we need is a translational\ntechnology called Torito in order to\n\n179\n00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.360\nuse this.\n\n180\n00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.750\nSo there are a few things that you end up\nhaving to use to get this in place and\n\n181\n00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.740\nget it working.\n\n182\n00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.550\nWe're not gonna really configure it here.\n\n183\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.542\nUnderstand that it is\nsomething that you can use.\n\n184\n00:09:33.542 --> 00:09:38.184\nTorito is just a translational technology\nthat allows your IPv6 information to\n\n185\n00:09:38.184 --> 00:09:40.100\ntraverse an IPv4 network.\n\n186\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.410\nAnd more specifically one that's behind\na devise that's providing network address\n\n187\n00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.760\ntranslation.\n\n188\n00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.660\nNow, those essentially\nare the technologies that we have.\n\n189\n00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.330\nRemember, some of the things\nthat we showed you in\n\n190\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.940\nthe first part of this episode\nwas Windows Remote Management.\n\n191\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.820\nWindows Remote Management is very,\nvery important and remember WinRM.\n\n192\n00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.960\nWinRM quick config or WinRM QC.\n\n193\n00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:08.643\nIf you're not familiar with what\nthose commands are, type in WinRM /?\n\n194\n00:10:08.643 --> 00:10:10.870\nand go through them.\n\n195\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.580\nOne of the great things I like about\nWinRM is it does have pretty good\n\n196\n00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.290\nhelp menu, too.\n\n197\n00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.880\nAnd you can find the different\nswitches that you need\n\n198\n00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.450\nto perform whatever task it is.\n\n199\n00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.450\nThe next thing is PowerShell remoting.\n\n200\n00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.760\nAll right?\nRemember, vote dash command.\n\n201\n00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.070\nAnd remember the dash computer name\noption, parameter, I should say.\n\n202\n00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.740\nAnd also,\nremember the script block parameter.\n\n203\n00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.210\nEvery one of the computer names and\nafter script block is gonna\n\n204\n00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:39.070\nbe really contingent on the scenario\nthat they put you in on the exam, right.\n\n205\n00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.030\nSo pay attention to those,\nbecause what follows script block\n\n206\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.160\nis the commandlet that you want PowerShell\nremoting to send over the network, and\n\n207\n00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.950\nit's gonna execute on the remote machine\nand send the output back to you.\n\n208\n00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.580\nThe other one that we looked at,\nin this episode,\n\n209\n00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.660\nwas the Microsoft Management Console.\n\n210\n00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.150\nKeep in mind that if you are using\nthe Microsoft Management Console,\n\n211\n00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.750\nnot only does it need the Windows RM\nservice, you need to make sure that\n\n212\n00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.580\nthe firewall has enabled your\ninbound exceptions, I should say.\n\n213\n00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.320\nRemember implicit deny is how\nthe Windows firewall works.\n\n214\n00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.370\nWe deny everything unless you\nexplicitly allow it, okay?\n\n215\n00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:17.630\nSo the Remote Event Log Management\nfirewall rules for\n\n216\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.910\ninbound communications were disabled,\nand we had to turn them on.\n\n217\n00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.240\nOnce we turned them on,\nnow we can connect.\n\n218\n00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.910\nYou can do this with computer management.\n\n219\n00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.990\nIt's up to you as well.\n\n220\n00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.749\nI went ahead and just showed you\none of them, the Event Viewer.\n\n221\n00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:36.060\nOne of them, again,\nwe did talk about pretty heavily in 7697,\n\n222\n00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.440\nthat's remote desktop,\nallows me to connect to another computer,\n\n223\n00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.240\ntake control of the desktop,\nand do remote management.\n\n224\n00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.230\nRemember also that Easy Connect.\n\n225\n00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:50.020\nEasy Connect is a characteristic\nof remote assistance\n\n226\n00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.610\nthat allows you to connect\na little bit easier and\n\n227\n00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:56.530\none of the main points is once it's\nset up the user on the other end\n\n228\n00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:01.020\nno longer needs to be there when the\nhelper wants to perform remote assistance.\n\n229\n00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.320\nTake Easy Connect and throw it out for\nnow just for a second,\n\n230\n00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.550\nwhat would happen if\nEasy Connect's not there?\n\n231\n00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.320\nWell every single time you connect or\n\n232\n00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.520\nwant to connect somebody's gonna\nhave to send you an invitation file.\n\n233\n00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.170\nDepending on how long the invitational\nfiles are valid for, it still requires\n\n234\n00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:20.460\nsomebody to be on the other side,\naccepting the incoming connection.\n\n235\n00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.000\nI set up Easy Connect.\n\n236\n00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.550\nWe set it up the first time.\n\n237\n00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.000\nWe set it and forget it, and\nthe next time somebody comes back and\n\n238\n00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.060\nneeds to provide assistance,\nthey can use Easy Connect, and\n\n239\n00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.980\nthe person doesn't have to be there\nIn order to allow that connection.\n\n240\n00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.610\nSo we got a lot of different\ntechnologies here Ronnie.\n\n241\n00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:38.120\nThese are some of them.\n\n242\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.350\nBe aware of them on the exam and\nwe want you to do well.\n\n243\n00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.470\n>> All right, well Wes, thank you again\nfor showing us all these tools that\n\n244\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.430\nare actually available inside of Windows\n10 to help us with remote management.\n\n245\n00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.360\nYou do need to be familiar with\nthem before you go into the exam.\n\n246\n00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.980\nThis is not one of those things that's\nactually gonna be fairly easy for\n\n247\n00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.920\nyou to just say I can muddle through it.\n\n248\n00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.000\nYou want to make sure that you go through\neach of these options that Wes has told\n\n249\n00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.040\nyou about because you're gonna see\nthat there may be multiple steps\n\n250\n00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.090\nfor you to take.\n\n251\n00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.330\nDon't overlook this.\n\n252\n00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.850\nTake a bit of time.\n\n253\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.430\nMake sure you feel confident and\n\n254\n00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.660\nknowing which tool that you might use\ngiven a particular scenario as well.\n\n255\n00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.990\nBut thank you, Wes, again, like we said,\nfor helping us in those different topics.\n\n256\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.570\nThat's a great place for\nus to end this episode as well.\n\n257\n00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.580\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n258\n00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.660\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n259\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.325\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows 10 episodes.\n\n260\n00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:35.624\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.855\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\ntoday's episode, well,\n\n4\n00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:20.500\nit's more Windows 10 for you.\n\n5\n00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.765\nAnd coming back into the studio to help us\nout with that very endeavor is our good\n\n6\n00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:24.761\nfriend, Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:25.642\nWes, welcome come back sir.\n\n8\n00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:26.620\nHow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.931\n>> Man, it's going great and\n\n10\n00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:30.610\nas always it is great to be\nhere with the ITPRO.TV crew.\n\n11\n00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.883\n>> That's right.\nWe're coming back at you with more of\n\n12\n00:00:32.883 --> 00:00:33.877\nthe 7698 exam.\n\n13\n00:00:33.877 --> 00:00:36.940\nWe're gonna be looking at\nconfiguring updates today.\n\n14\n00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.337\nNow, I know what you might be saying,\nwell, updates,\n\n15\n00:00:39.337 --> 00:00:40.765\nI know how to configure updates.\n\n16\n00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:43.440\nYou just turn it on and walk away.\n\n17\n00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.470\nWell, that's great for\nsome of your consumer editions, but\n\n18\n00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.090\nthere are some things that they call out.\n\n19\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.070\nThey want you to be aware\nof inside of Windows.\n\n20\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.540\nBut before we dive into\nsome things that are new,\n\n21\n00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.330\nlet's talk about where we've come from and\nwhere potentially we're going to.\n\n22\n00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.490\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n23\n00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.140\nI've got a little diagram here made up,\n\n24\n00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.350\nand let's talk a little bit about\nthe Classic Servicing Model.\n\n25\n00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.390\nThat we really been using,\npretty much up until Windows 10, right?\n\n26\n00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.700\nThe Classic Servicing Model,\nwe use things like Windows Update, right?\n\n27\n00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.760\nWindows Update.\n\n28\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.530\nYou can set it.\n\n29\n00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.670\nYou can turn it off if you want to,\nby default recommended settings.\n\n30\n00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.420\nIt goes out to Windows Update servers.\n\n31\n00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.570\nSecond Tuesday of every month\nis the legendary patch Tuesday.\n\n32\n00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.730\nWe pulled down all of\nthose security updates and\n\n33\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.780\nthe patches that have been\nmade available to us.\n\n34\n00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.919\nNow, you'll probably be aware that\nin the Classic Servicing Model,\n\n35\n00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:39.848\nyour operating systems go through\nnot quite enough new features to\n\n36\n00:01:39.848 --> 00:01:43.377\nroll out a brand new edition of Windows,\nso what do they do?\n\n37\n00:01:43.377 --> 00:01:46.604\nA little bit smaller than a full and\ncomplete operating system,\n\n38\n00:01:46.604 --> 00:01:48.347\nis they implement Service Packs.\n\n39\n00:01:48.347 --> 00:01:51.994\nAnd you might have seen some operating\nsystems that have gone through, well,\n\n40\n00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:53.387\nmany Service Packs, right?\n\n41\n00:01:53.387 --> 00:01:58.583\nAnd again, these are little incremental\nbuilds, if you will, newer features,\n\n42\n00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:03.370\nbut it's not really enough to install or\ncome out with a whole new edition.\n\n43\n00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.558\nNow, they're typically Internet based,\nright.\n\n44\n00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:08.570\nWe connect out down to Microsoft servers,\nand\n\n45\n00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.040\nif you are in a managed environment\npretty much you can use WSUS.\n\n46\n00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.310\nSo that's the classic model, all right?\n\n47\n00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.900\nNow, there's another model too, when\nwe talk about things like updating and\n\n48\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.420\nupgrading, and that model is the Upgrade\nand Deployment Model, right?\n\n49\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.308\nNow, with the Upgrade and Deployment\nModel, when you get new features, or\n\n50\n00:02:27.308 --> 00:02:31.652\nyou get a new operating system, you have\nto go through a migration process, right?\n\n51\n00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:35.556\nAnd this Migration process can be very,\nvery Time Consuming.\n\n52\n00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:40.045\nSo, for instance, let's kinda walk through\na couple steps of what we have to do\n\n53\n00:02:40.045 --> 00:02:43.605\nif we are gonna go and\nroll out a new edition of Windows, right?\n\n54\n00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:47.160\nSo let's take this computer right here and\nif I decide, you know what?\n\n55\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.200\nI think this computer is\ngoing to be upgraded.\n\n56\n00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.504\nWell, then, what do we do?\n\n57\n00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.167\nWell, the first thing we\ndo is if we're doing,\n\n58\n00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:55.421\nlet's say we're doing something\nlike a Wipe and Load, right.\n\n59\n00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:59.998\nWe're gonna take an intermediate\nFile Server, or an intermediate share, and\n\n60\n00:02:59.998 --> 00:03:03.940\nwe're gonna take all of the users\nsettings off of it, right?\n\n61\n00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.450\nOnce we take all of those user\nsettings off, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n62\n00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.760\nwe're gonna format the hard drive, right?\n\n63\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.185\nAnd we're gonna reinstall or\nupgrade the new installation.\n\n64\n00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:15.305\nBut then, what do we have to do?\n\n65\n00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:17.703\nThen we turn around,\nwe take from that File Server,\n\n66\n00:03:17.703 --> 00:03:19.669\nwe pull down those user settings, right?\n\n67\n00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.915\nSo, it's a fairly long,\ndrawn out process, right?\n\n68\n00:03:22.915 --> 00:03:25.235\nThat's what's known as a Wipe and\nLoad because a Wipe and\n\n69\n00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:26.451\nLoad takes a single machine.\n\n70\n00:03:26.451 --> 00:03:29.185\nIt says, let's back up,\nnot back up that data.\n\n71\n00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:31.120\nLet's migrate the user data up.\n\n72\n00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.080\nLets go ahead and\nformat the operating system and\n\n73\n00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.140\nthen we'll bring that data back down, the\nuser settings back down to the machine.\n\n74\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.213\nWell, you can also do the other one there\nis a Side-by-Side Migration, right?\n\n75\n00:03:44.213 --> 00:03:48.327\nMaybe this first computer that we have\nright here is going to be, is the brand\n\n76\n00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:53.610\nnew computer, maybe this old one out here\nis the computer that we're moving from.\n\n77\n00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.824\nWell, in this case,\nwe still got the same process, right?\n\n78\n00:03:55.824 --> 00:04:01.430\nWe migrate the user data\nto that File Server, right.\n\n79\n00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.000\nAnd then, from there, we pull down\nthat user data to the new machine.\n\n80\n00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.081\nSo there's still work involved, right?\n\n81\n00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.110\nWe still have to back up the data.\n\n82\n00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.760\nWe still have to make sure\nthat we migrate the data.\n\n83\n00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.500\nWe gotta format the hard drive, and\n\n84\n00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.940\nwe've gotta do the installation\nof the operating system.\n\n85\n00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.020\nNow, when you're doing upgrades too,\nyou also have Clean Installations and\n\n86\n00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.320\nyou have In-place Upgrades.\n\n87\n00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.754\nA Clean Installation is when maybe your\nmachine prior doesn't support the new, or\n\n88\n00:04:26.754 --> 00:04:30.994\nmaybe your operating system is too far\nback, if you will, to do what's known as\n\n89\n00:04:30.994 --> 00:04:34.542\nan In-place Upgrade, where you\ntake the old operating system and\n\n90\n00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:38.191\nthen you just install the new\noperating system on top of it, right.\n\n91\n00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:42.043\nSo in those situations, right,\nyou're gonna go ahead and\n\n92\n00:04:42.043 --> 00:04:44.585\nyou're gonna take the old hard drive,\n\n93\n00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:49.070\nmuch like the Wipe and Load,\nit's pretty much what that is, right?\n\n94\n00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.104\nAnd you're gonna migrate the user\nsettings off of it, right?\n\n95\n00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:56.640\nYou're gonna format the hard drive and\nyou're gonna do a Clean Install.\n\n96\n00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.440\nNow, it's close to the Clean Installation\nbut the difference is because you already\n\n97\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.150\nhad a prior licensed copy of Windows,\na lot of times you'll get a reduced price.\n\n98\n00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.440\nNow, you also had the other one\nwhere it's an In-place Upgrade.\n\n99\n00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.410\nAnd your In-place Upgrade does\nlead some remnants behind, right?\n\n100\n00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.571\nSo you have your old hard drive\nwith your old operating system.\n\n101\n00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:18.420\nLet me see if I can grab that there.\n\n102\n00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.290\nAnd then, what do you do?\n\n103\n00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.674\nYou take and you install the new\noperating system on top of the old.\n\n104\n00:05:23.674 --> 00:05:27.060\nStill leaves some remnants of\nthe old operating system behind.\n\n105\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.120\nSome things that you have to deal with,\nright?\n\n106\n00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.300\nNow, it's very Time Consuming.\n\n107\n00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.950\nA lot of research has to be done.\n\n108\n00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.230\nA lot of compatibility\nissues that might come in.\n\n109\n00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.850\nAnd these compatibility issues a lot of\ntimes have to be researched beforehand.\n\n110\n00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.590\nAnd then, hopefully, once we get\nsome kind of stability out of it,\n\n111\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.130\nwe can roll out the new operating system.\n\n112\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.568\nThe other thing is, for instant,\nlike your Deployment Services.\n\n113\n00:05:49.568 --> 00:05:53.892\nWhen we look at your Deployment Services,\nright, I have an image up there and\n\n114\n00:05:53.892 --> 00:05:57.960\nif it goes through a series of updates,\nwell, how often does it update?\n\n115\n00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.120\nWell, it pretty much updates second\nTuesday of every month, right.\n\n116\n00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.775\nSo we're gonna do a lot of\nImage Servicing, right?\n\n117\n00:06:04.775 --> 00:06:07.650\nWe got employees down here that are gonna\nhave to pull down these images.\n\n118\n00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.820\nThey're gonna have to do all their\nupdates, all their upgrades, right?\n\n119\n00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.180\nThen they're gonna have\nto reimage the machine,\n\n120\n00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.710\nrecapture that image put it back up\non the deployment server, right.\n\n121\n00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.050\nSo these are some of the classic models\nthat we've had in the past, right?\n\n122\n00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.660\nAnd we're still gonna use\ndeployment models but\n\n123\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.860\nthey do have a new way to maintain\nthe servicing of Windows.\n\n124\n00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.782\nNow, this is where something known as\nWindows as a Service comes in, yes,\n\n125\n00:06:33.782 --> 00:06:37.703\nleave it to Microsoft to put\nthe WaaS into Windows, right?\n\n126\n00:06:37.703 --> 00:06:41.693\nI'm sitting here thinking it reminds me of\nthat old commercial where they used to say\n\n127\n00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:42.544\nwaasup, right?\n\n128\n00:06:42.544 --> 00:06:44.210\nW-A-A-S there.\n\n129\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.230\nSo what is Windows as a Service?\n\n130\n00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.130\nThis is their new servicing model, right?\n\n131\n00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.770\nAnd what this does is it says, rather\nthan do things like service patch, right?\n\n132\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.240\nWe'll do these ongoing,\nrolling updates, if you will.\n\n133\n00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.920\nAnd the updates can be deferred, too.\n\n134\n00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.820\nWe could say, you know what?\n\n135\n00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.440\nIn a new system,\nmaybe you don't want those updates going\n\n136\n00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.650\nright out to your machines because\nyou don't have a predictability over.\n\n137\n00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.130\nGives your IT admins the time that they\ncan do a little bit more research before\n\n138\n00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.400\nthey're ever applied to the machines,\nright?\n\n139\n00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.640\nSo four months is the minimum for some,\nup to about eight months maximum.\n\n140\n00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.480\nWe also have machines out\nthere that depending on\n\n141\n00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.600\nwhat kind of servicing branch,\nthat we'll talk about coming up it is,\n\n142\n00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.110\nthat don't update new features at all,\nright?\n\n143\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.790\nMaybe you've got some kind of system\nhere that is like factory machinery.\n\n144\n00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.420\nA point of sales system maybe\nthat you got out there.\n\n145\n00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.640\nWell, these systems need to be\nas minimalistic as possible, and\n\n146\n00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.520\nyou certainly don't need all\nof those features, right?\n\n147\n00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.521\nMaybe you got ATM manufacturing\nfacilities right?\n\n148\n00:07:47.521 --> 00:07:50.637\nThat might be running\na Windows operating system.\n\n149\n00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:53.703\nAnd I certainly don't want them\nconnecting to Windows Update and\n\n150\n00:07:53.703 --> 00:07:56.700\nbring down my whole entire\nmachinery floor, all right.\n\n151\n00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.370\nWell, this is were this\nWindows as a service comes in,\n\n152\n00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:03.440\nbecause you can go with what\nare known as servicing branches.\n\n153\n00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.340\nAnd the servicing branches give you the\nability to defer the updates, all right.\n\n154\n00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.620\nSo lets go ahead and\n\n155\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.800\ntalk a little bit more about what\nthe deferment means for us, right.\n\n156\n00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.270\nIt also introduces, and\nI want to make mention of this too,\n\n157\n00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.710\nsomething called Windows Update for\nBusiness, all right.\n\n158\n00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.540\nAnd again, this gives your IT staff,\nyour IT administration,\n\n159\n00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.270\nmore granular control over what updates\nare going to be applied to your machine.\n\n160\n00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.690\nSee, when we use WSUS it's an all or\nnothing, right?\n\n161\n00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:34.080\nYou download all the updates and\nyou either approve or deny them.\n\n162\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.890\nThis way, they're not going to be\nreleased to you right away, and\n\n163\n00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.400\nagain, it gives your IT staff more time.\n\n164\n00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.880\nNow, let's talk a little\nbit about the media, and\n\n165\n00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.720\nwhat they mean whey they talk\nabout deferring updates.\n\n166\n00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.240\nAll right, so we've got a computer\nover here on the left hand side, and\n\n167\n00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.550\nthis computer has been marked as one\nof the servicing branches that defers\n\n168\n00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.650\nits updates.\n\n169\n00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.050\nSo what you do is you do the original\ninstallation media, right?\n\n170\n00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.860\nWhen the operating system first comes out.\n\n171\n00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.800\nThat grace period of about\nfour months deferment.\n\n172\n00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.780\nYou can defer depending on what edition\nyou have, up to about eight months.\n\n173\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.910\nAll right, happens, and then they\nroll out some kind of new features.\n\n174\n00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.910\nWell, how does Microsoft do this today?\n\n175\n00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.720\nWell, they take the original installation\nmedia and they take the new features and\n\n176\n00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.890\nthey bundle them together, and they\ncome up I put new installation media and\n\n177\n00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.820\nthey rolled that out on Windows Update for\nBusiness.\n\n178\n00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:31.600\nNow what Windows Update for Business\ndoes is it looks basically it targets.\n\n179\n00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.790\nIf you will the devices that\nhave been flagged for deferment.\n\n180\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.090\nAnd it says, okay, that's their state.\n\n181\n00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.050\nThey said defer updates,\nthat grace period is gone.\n\n182\n00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.950\nThat time, that wait period is gone.\n\n183\n00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.900\nWe'll take the new installation media,\nwe'll target those devices that\n\n184\n00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.330\nhave deferred the updates and now I'll get\nthe new installed media and they apply it.\n\n185\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:54.450\nSo it gives you a little bit of time\nbefore you do the updated new features.\n\n186\n00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.860\nNow there's some different\nbranches that web talked about.\n\n187\n00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.480\nThese are called the Windows\n10 servicing branches.\n\n188\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.390\nAnd with the Windows 10 servicing\nbranches these are different than\n\n189\n00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.970\nsome of your basic editions that\nwe've talked about in the past.\n\n190\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.220\nRight?\nWe've talked about Windows 10,\n\n191\n00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.420\nthe Home Edition.\n\n192\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.140\nIt's not really Home Edition but\nWindows 10 just basic right?\n\n193\n00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.010\nAnd then we talked about Windows 10 Pro,\nand\n\n194\n00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.100\nwe've also talked about\nWindows 10 Enterprise.\n\n195\n00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:23.510\nAs soon as otherwise models that you have\nout there, these servicing branches.\n\n196\n00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.440\nNow maybe some of you have all\nready seen the very first one here,\n\n197\n00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.820\nthe Windows Insider Preview.\n\n198\n00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:34.660\nI know that one of our guys back there\nhas been on that Windows Insider Preview,\n\n199\n00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.000\nthe moment it first was\nreleased to market, right?\n\n200\n00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.020\nWe were still on Windows 8 and\nWindows 10 Insider preview came out.\n\n201\n00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.080\nNow, what is it about\nWindows Insider preview?\n\n202\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.760\nWell, the Windows Insider preview, if you\never messed around with your phones and\n\n203\n00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.030\nstuff like that in the ROMs, right?\n\n204\n00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.490\nThey talk about nightly builds, right?\n\n205\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.450\nThat is the latest and greatest.\n\n206\n00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:55.410\nAll right with all of its\nincompatibility that comes with it.\n\n207\n00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.420\nAll that loveliness that we have.\n\n208\n00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.740\nIt deploys to your machine and\nit breaks your machine.\n\n209\n00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.080\nWell that's part of the insider Preview,\nright?\n\n210\n00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.710\nYou get the newest features and builds and\n\n211\n00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.370\nyou get them before anybody else gets\nthem; before they're checked for\n\n212\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.190\nstability and compatibility, before\nthey're ever released to the market.\n\n213\n00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:12.830\nRight?\n\n214\n00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:13.890\nYou get those.\n\n215\n00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.770\nWell, that's the insider preview.\n\n216\n00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:20.101\nNow I want to talk a little bit about some\nof the other branches here that we have.\n\n217\n00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:23.369\nNow we start getting\ninto the current branch.\n\n218\n00:11:23.369 --> 00:11:28.064\nNow, the current branch is an addition,\nthat yes, you get the newest features and\n\n219\n00:11:28.064 --> 00:11:31.767\nbuilds, but that's not until\nthey're released to the public.\n\n220\n00:11:31.767 --> 00:11:32.744\nOnce they're released, and\n\n221\n00:11:32.744 --> 00:11:35.390\nthat doesn't mean they're going to\nbe compatible with your system.\n\n222\n00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:40.460\nBut, current branch servicing model says\nthe moment we release these to the market,\n\n223\n00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.250\nyou're gonna get them.\n\n224\n00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.822\nYou're gonna get them just as soon\nas they come out to the public.\n\n225\n00:11:43.822 --> 00:11:47.130\nProbably actually get them even a little\nbit sooner than the public does because\n\n226\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.268\nthe moment they come out to the public,\nyou're gonna get them.\n\n227\n00:11:50.268 --> 00:11:54.430\nNow that might not be\nrelevant to your environment.\n\n228\n00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.100\nThat might not even be something\nthat you want when it comes to your\n\n229\n00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.280\nenvironment, all right?\n\n230\n00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.890\nSo what can we do?\n\n231\n00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.450\nAll right, what other option do we have?\n\n232\n00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.240\nWell, we have something known,\nanother one here,\n\n233\n00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.440\nthat is called\nthe Windows Current Branch for Business.\n\n234\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.120\nNow this one changes it up\njust a little bit, all right?\n\n235\n00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.610\nWhat this does, the Windows Branch for\nBusiness, this says okay, now we have\n\n236\n00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.680\nthis deferment period and we're not\ngonna apply any new features at all.\n\n237\n00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.990\nWe're gonna give you that\nwindow of opportunity that says\n\n238\n00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.660\nif it goes to insider preview,\nthen it goes to the current branch,\n\n239\n00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.760\nIt's not gonna hit your computer.\n\n240\n00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.260\nAll right?\nAnd\n\n241\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.840\nagain, it goes back to that new servicing\nmodel, that Windows is a service that\n\n242\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.020\nnow the IT staff can say okay let's\nlook at current branch, right?\n\n243\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.980\nCurrent branch is kind of like\nthe second validation of what we see\n\n244\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.950\nin the insider preview, right?\n\n245\n00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.240\nIn the insider preview,\nthey might have features that they say,\n\n246\n00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.790\nno, that's the worst thing, you know?\n\n247\n00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.490\nIt's horrible, right?\n\n248\n00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:50.490\nLet's take it out, right?\n\n249\n00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.840\nWell, it never makes it to current branch.\n\n250\n00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.270\nIt did make it to the insider preview, but\nit never made it to the current branch.\n\n251\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.810\nBut then I have a feature inside\nof the insider preview that says,\n\n252\n00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.670\nthat's the best thing since sliced bread.\n\n253\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.560\nRight?\nEverybody loves it.\n\n254\n00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.800\nWell, we put it in the current branch.\n\n255\n00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.620\nNow, that current branch is kinda like\nyour second validation that says hey,\n\n256\n00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.820\nthis is the feature we're gonna keep.\n\n257\n00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.740\nAnd the current branch for business,\nit doesn't get rolled out.\n\n258\n00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.980\nNow, you can defer this up to\neight months, with group policy.\n\n259\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.020\nAnd we're gonna show you how\nto configure that, coming up.\n\n260\n00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.160\nBut you do have that option.\n\n261\n00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.970\nNow the last one here\nis kinda interesting.\n\n262\n00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.820\nYou might see this on\nthe exam abbreviated LTSB.\n\n263\n00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.720\nI want you to know that acronym it just\nmeans long term servicing branching,\n\n264\n00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.760\nservicing branch.\n\n265\n00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.210\nAnd they might have it\nmarked that way on the exam.\n\n266\n00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:40.500\nNow what's up with that one?\n\n267\n00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.960\nWhat does that mean?\n\n268\n00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:48.792\nWell understand that this doesn't\nreceive new features at all.\n\n269\n00:13:48.792 --> 00:13:51.820\nNever, not one bit all right.\n\n270\n00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.850\nWhat this says is you'll receive\nsecurity patches, right.\n\n271\n00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.100\nNow you're gonna security patch the system\nso you'll still receive those, right.\n\n272\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.980\nOr those could be exploited.\n\n273\n00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.700\nIf you have any functionality\nflaws that they update right,\n\n274\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.645\nyou're gonna go ahead and get that.\n\n275\n00:14:03.645 --> 00:14:06.550\nBut you aren't gonna\nget the full features.\n\n276\n00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.450\nAll right, so what does that do?\n\n277\n00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:13.650\nSo, for systems, if you will,\nthat are, like I said,\n\n278\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.620\nthe four machinery type of systems if\nyou have point of sale systems, ATM,\n\n279\n00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.670\nmanufacturing facilities,\nyou might need these.\n\n280\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:26.207\nAnd what they wanna do is they wanna\nreduce the amount of non-essential\n\n281\n00:14:26.207 --> 00:14:28.870\nupdates, or non-essential features.\n\n282\n00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.560\nAll right?\n\n283\n00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.600\nNow that's another thing to talk about,\nthe Windows features.\n\n284\n00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.750\nAll right?\n\n285\n00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.750\nThere are certain features that aren't\nin the long term servicing branch.\n\n286\n00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:38.960\nRight?\nBecause these are usually\n\n287\n00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.270\ndedicated devices.\n\n288\n00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.620\nWe don't have Cortana.\n\n289\n00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.980\nCortana's not there.\n\n290\n00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.680\nAll right.\nYour Microsoft Edge.\n\n291\n00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.750\nNot there.\n\n292\n00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:46.770\nYour Windows Store.\n\n293\n00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:47.370\nNot there.\n\n294\n00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:53.880\nIn fact the majority of your Windows Store\napps completely absent from this build.\n\n295\n00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.800\nNot there at all right?\n\n296\n00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.640\nThe only thing you do have by default is a\nlittle tile interface that says One Drive.\n\n297\n00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.500\nBecause well you might need Cloud storage.\n\n298\n00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.780\nSo keep in mind, that those Windows\nstore features aren't present at all.\n\n299\n00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.020\nIn fact let's go ahead\nrather than talk about it,\n\n300\n00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.610\nI know I've done a lot of talking here.\n\n301\n00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.690\nLet's kind of show you what I mean.\n\n302\n00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.880\nSo I've got a normal client right.\n\n303\n00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.820\nAnd if I look at the start menu,\nafter I log back in.\n\n304\n00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.290\nAnd if I look at the start menu,\n\n305\n00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.820\nyou'll notice that I have all\nof these tile over here, right?\n\n306\n00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.420\nThese are the Windows store type apps,\nbut if I switch back over to the long,\n\n307\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.580\nthis is our long term servicing branch.\n\n308\n00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.080\nNotice a difference between the task bar?\n\n309\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.225\nI'm gonna switch back just,\nLook at that, right?\n\n310\n00:15:37.225 --> 00:15:40.340\nI got the Windows store; I got\nEdge; I got Internet Explorer.\n\n311\n00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.265\nI don't know whether I would put\nInternet Explorer down there; but,\n\n312\n00:15:43.265 --> 00:15:46.504\nwhen I look over here, I don't even\nhave the search functionality, right?\n\n313\n00:15:46.504 --> 00:15:48.058\nThe search icon isn't even there.\n\n314\n00:15:48.058 --> 00:15:49.922\nI see that being their\nnumber one seller very soon.\n\n315\n00:15:49.922 --> 00:15:52.988\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely stripped down to nothing\n\n316\n00:15:52.988 --> 00:15:54.780\nmakes it more efficient.\n\n317\n00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.490\nThat's right, and Dan jokes,\nbut he's absolutely right.\n\n318\n00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:02.009\nIf I've a dedicated device that's\ncontrolling the entire floor of my\n\n319\n00:16:02.009 --> 00:16:04.467\nmachinery, some kind of\nautomated machinery.\n\n320\n00:16:04.467 --> 00:16:08.366\nI certainly don't want it\nto update minesweeper and\n\n321\n00:16:08.366 --> 00:16:11.206\nthen crash the entire machine floor.\n\n322\n00:16:11.206 --> 00:16:12.340\nIf I look at the start menu.\n\n323\n00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.650\nWow.\n\n324\n00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:14.810\nIt's really stripped down.\n\n325\n00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.620\nYou say, that's okay.\nThey just don't have it on the start menu.\n\n326\n00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.490\nYou can still find them.\n\n327\n00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.820\nWell, lets go to all apps.\n\n328\n00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.610\nNot a single one there.\n\n329\n00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.440\nYou've got the search\nfunctionality on the start menu.\n\n330\n00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.690\nYou've got OneDrive here.\n\n331\n00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:28.780\nIf I switch back over.\n\n332\n00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.800\nLook at the start menu on an Enterprise\nedition, and I look at All apps.\n\n333\n00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:39.010\nIt is just loaded with\nall kinds of fun stuff.\n\n334\n00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.076\nSo keep in mind,\n\n335\n00:16:40.076 --> 00:16:44.895\nthat's one of the difference between\nthe long-term service branching.\n\n336\n00:16:44.895 --> 00:16:49.336\nThe other thing that I also mentioned\nis that you can defer updates.\n\n337\n00:16:49.336 --> 00:16:50.540\nHow do you defer updates?\n\n338\n00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.290\nThere's a couple of ways\nthat you can do this.\n\n339\n00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:58.788\nIf you're in an edition that isn't\nlong-term service branching,\n\n340\n00:16:58.788 --> 00:17:02.663\nall I have to do is I'll\nopen up the action center.\n\n341\n00:17:02.663 --> 00:17:06.660\nWe'll choose All Settings, and\nI'm gonna go to Update & security.\n\n342\n00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.350\nNow when I go to Update & security,\nnotice Windows Update.\n\n343\n00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:11.595\nI could check for updates.\n\n344\n00:17:11.595 --> 00:17:12.210\nWe're not gonna do that.\n\n345\n00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.992\nWe certainly don't wanna waste any time\nin the episode cuz it could take a while.\n\n346\n00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:16.867\nIf I go to the Advanced options,\n\n347\n00:17:16.867 --> 00:17:19.929\nI want you to notice another\noption that I have here.\n\n348\n00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.770\nNotice that I can defer upgrades.\n\n349\n00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.834\nWhy might I want to defer upgrades?\n\n350\n00:17:25.834 --> 00:17:28.722\nMaybe you've got a gaming platform and\nyou're like, no,\n\n351\n00:17:28.722 --> 00:17:31.104\nI don't want the latest and\ngreatest right yet.\n\n352\n00:17:31.104 --> 00:17:32.650\nI don't want to crash it.\n\n353\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.200\nFor whatever reason, in a consumer\nenvironment, you can do this.\n\n354\n00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.210\n>> Now, Wes, does this include security\npatches and critical updates as well?\n\n355\n00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.660\n>> I'm glad you said that.\n\n356\n00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.840\nWhen you defer the updates you can\nstill receive the security patches, but\n\n357\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.840\nall those new features,\nthose features that\n\n358\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.240\nyou're not sure if you actually want\nthose, those are gonna be deferred.\n\n359\n00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.934\n>> These are just the bells and\nwhistles they're coming out with.\n\n360\n00:17:52.934 --> 00:17:56.150\nNot necessarily critical things\nthat'll keep your computer secure.\n\n361\n00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.750\n>> Very good.\n\n362\n00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:58.750\nAnother great question.\n\n363\n00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.163\nThat's right.\nWe still wanna keep functionality to where\n\n364\n00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:01.940\nit needs to be.\n\n365\n00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.710\nWe still wanna keep security\nwhere it needs to be.\n\n366\n00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:06.193\nSo you will get those.\n\n367\n00:18:06.193 --> 00:18:11.050\nYou might remember in the days when you\nhad the traditional Windows Update.\n\n368\n00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.542\nYou could choose recommended,\nlike it shows, automatically update.\n\n369\n00:18:14.542 --> 00:18:17.670\nBut you could also say\ndon't download updates.\n\n370\n00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:18.700\nDon't install updates.\n\n371\n00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.930\nSometimes it would just notify me.\n\n372\n00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.340\nNow, here's all that you can get.\n\n373\n00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.895\nI can defer it.\n\n374\n00:18:22.895 --> 00:18:27.080\nWhen I defer it, doesn't change anything.\n\n375\n00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.340\nIt just defers it for a little bit.\n\n376\n00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.718\nLet me show you the difference here\nin the long-term service branching.\n\n377\n00:18:33.718 --> 00:18:36.340\nAnd we're gonna go to that same location,\nno different.\n\n378\n00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.868\nAction center, and\neven if you look at the action center,\n\n379\n00:18:39.868 --> 00:18:42.537\nthe action center is reduced as well, too.\n\n380\n00:18:42.537 --> 00:18:44.980\nWe'll choose All settings.\n\n381\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.084\nWe'll go back to Update & security.\n\n382\n00:18:49.084 --> 00:18:54.230\nAnd we'll go to Advanced options,\nand I got Defer updates there.\n\n383\n00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.245\nSo it really doesn't look like\nit is too much different.\n\n384\n00:18:57.245 --> 00:18:59.137\nLong-term service branching,\nas far as we've seen,\n\n385\n00:18:59.137 --> 00:19:00.436\nyou guys can't tell the difference.\n\n386\n00:19:00.436 --> 00:19:02.870\nIn fact, I can't tell the difference.\n\n387\n00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.000\n>> I actually do like the fact\nthat they make it to where you,\n\n388\n00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.080\nunless you know some finagling,\nyou can't really shut off Windows Update.\n\n389\n00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.560\nI've dealt in tech support and\nworkstation support for a long time now.\n\n390\n00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.570\nPeople love to not install their updates.\n\n391\n00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.422\nAnd then they call and complain, well,\nmy computer's running so slowly.\n\n392\n00:19:19.422 --> 00:19:21.702\nWell, yeah,\nyou have 900 updates down here.\n\n393\n00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:23.930\nWell, I thought they\nwould hurt my computer.\n\n394\n00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:28.060\nOn what planet did you think that your\nupdates are going to hurt your computer?\n\n395\n00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.770\nI'm not saying that doesn't happen\nwhere you get an update where it causes\n\n396\n00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.860\nissues with maybe a third-party app,\nor even Windows itself.\n\n397\n00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.622\nAnd you have to roll back.\n\n398\n00:19:35.622 --> 00:19:38.118\nBut that's something\nadministrators take care of, and\n\n399\n00:19:38.118 --> 00:19:40.680\nit's really not gonna cause\na lot of business down time.\n\n400\n00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.200\nAs least as far as you're\nconcerned as an end user.\n\n401\n00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.287\nSo the fact that they're taking that\nout of their hands, and just saying,\n\n402\n00:19:46.287 --> 00:19:47.423\nyou're getting updates.\n\n403\n00:19:47.423 --> 00:19:51.949\nI think the only way you can actually\nshut updates off is to actually create\n\n404\n00:19:51.949 --> 00:19:57.300\na mobile data type of internet connection,\nand tell it that's what you're on.\n\n405\n00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:02.035\nAnd because there's charges and fees that\nare inferred with those mobile plans,\n\n406\n00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:05.068\nthey'll allow you to shut\nthem off if you have that.\n\n407\n00:20:05.068 --> 00:20:08.330\nBut other than that, they keep this going,\nyour average user's not gonna know that.\n\n408\n00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:12.294\nThey're not gonna know, I'll just put\nthis on a mobile type of network and\n\n409\n00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:13.788\nI can shut off those updates.\n\n410\n00:20:13.788 --> 00:20:15.220\nThis is a good thing.\n\n411\n00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.160\n>> Absolutely.\n\n412\n00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.010\nYou're talking about\nthe metered connection.\n\n413\n00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.020\nThat is one way that you\ncould stall those updates.\n\n414\n00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.290\nYou say a metered connection,\nit says, well, you got a data plan.\n\n415\n00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.660\nI'm gonna help you out with your\ndata plan before the updates.\n\n416\n00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.450\nDan's right.\n\n417\n00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:30.953\nAnd that's another thing about the new\nservicing models it gives the IT staff,\n\n418\n00:20:30.953 --> 00:20:32.196\nnot the end user.\n\n419\n00:20:32.196 --> 00:20:36.540\nBecause how many times, I've seen one\nwhere they've turned off updates.\n\n420\n00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.230\nI'm right there with Dan.\n\n421\n00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.560\nAnd you come in there and\nyou're wondering,\n\n422\n00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.430\nwell, now you know why you've got\n15 gazillion viruses on there.\n\n423\n00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:48.082\nThere was 50 security patches that you\nsaid, don't do anything with those.\n\n424\n00:20:48.082 --> 00:20:50.130\nWe're still on the LTSB, here.\n\n425\n00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.240\nYou know, the long-term service branching.\n\n426\n00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.512\nBetter make sure when I say that.\n\n427\n00:20:53.512 --> 00:20:56.570\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> Gotta make sure I'm\non the right one cuz the interfaces don't\n\n428\n00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.400\nlook any different.\n\n429\n00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.318\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna switch back over.\n\n430\n00:20:59.318 --> 00:21:03.040\nWhat I'm gonna do is I am going\nto launch the local group policy.\n\n431\n00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:09.850\nSo we're gonna do our gpedit.msc.\n\n432\n00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.195\nWhen I launch the Local Security Policy,\nhere.\n\n433\n00:21:13.195 --> 00:21:17.773\nIf I go into the Administrative Templates\n> Windows Components.\n\n434\n00:21:17.773 --> 00:21:20.324\nAnd if you scroll all\nthe way down to the bottom.\n\n435\n00:21:20.324 --> 00:21:22.570\nOne up from the bottom\nshould be Windows Update.\n\n436\n00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.220\nUsed to be it was\nthe last one on the list.\n\n437\n00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.464\nWhen they came out with Work Folders\nin Windows 8, that changed.\n\n438\n00:21:27.464 --> 00:21:30.430\nIf I select Windows Update,\nI want you to notice something.\n\n439\n00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.920\nNotice that right in the middle of\nthe group policy settings, and again,\n\n440\n00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.620\nkeep in mind, this is local group policy.\n\n441\n00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.890\nSo it's local to this machine.\n\n442\n00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.510\nIt doesn't affect multiple machines\ninside of a domain environment.\n\n443\n00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.350\nWe're going to look at that coming up.\n\n444\n00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.300\nNotice that I have the Defer Upgrade,\nand if I click that.\n\n445\n00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.510\nRemember that I told you that\nyou could defer upgrades and\n\n446\n00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.660\nyou could modify them for\na certain bit of time?\n\n447\n00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.810\nNot here.\n\n448\n00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.820\nNot on this machine.\n\n449\n00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.370\nThis is my Windows 10 client.\n\n450\n00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:59.765\nI can enable it.\n\n451\n00:21:59.765 --> 00:22:03.249\nThat's doing nothing different than\nwhat I seen on the other machine.\n\n452\n00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.280\nLike I said, we'll show you here\nwhere you can change that, coming up.\n\n453\n00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.460\nIf I switch back over to\nthe long-term servicing branch.\n\n454\n00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.610\nAnd we say, okay, you know what?\n\n455\n00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.548\nWe're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're going to launch gpedit and\n\n456\n00:22:16.548 --> 00:22:22.502\nwe'll find out What we see there.\n\n457\n00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:31.059\nSo if I open this up, and\nI go to Administrative Templates.\n\n458\n00:22:31.059 --> 00:22:32.539\nAnd I go to Windows components.\n\n459\n00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:34.005\nAnd I scroll all the way\ndown to the bottom.\n\n460\n00:22:34.005 --> 00:22:36.270\nAnd I click Windows updates.\n\n461\n00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.080\nHere I have Defer Upgrade.\n\n462\n00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.035\nLook at this.\nI can enable it, but\n\n463\n00:22:42.035 --> 00:22:45.621\nI really don't have any option.\n\n464\n00:22:45.621 --> 00:22:48.264\nAnd you can see that in Pro and\nEnterprise, it tells you.\n\n465\n00:22:48.264 --> 00:22:52.650\nThis can defer upgrades until the next\nupgrade period, a few months.\n\n466\n00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.060\nSo you can defer them for a little bit,\n\n467\n00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.420\nbut you really don't have\nmuch control past that.\n\n468\n00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.120\nSo how can we control\nthis a little bit more?\n\n469\n00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.810\nWell, with group policy.\n\n470\n00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:06.930\nWith group policy we can control this, but\nthere are a few things that we have to do\n\n471\n00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.930\nto get your active directory set up so\nthat you can control this.\n\n472\n00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.180\nLet me go ahead, I'm gonna switch\nover to my domain controller here.\n\n473\n00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.350\nGet loged back in, and\nlet me show you what you have to do.\n\n474\n00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:19.618\nYou have to browse to Microsoft's website,\nand\n\n475\n00:23:19.618 --> 00:23:25.670\nyou're gonna look for\nWindows 10_version 1511 admx files.\n\n476\n00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.366\nAnd you say,\nwhy would I need those admx files?\n\n477\n00:23:28.366 --> 00:23:31.092\nI've gone ahead and\nI've made a little GPO here, and\n\n478\n00:23:31.092 --> 00:23:33.647\nthis GPO's called\nWindows Servicing Branches.\n\n479\n00:23:33.647 --> 00:23:36.452\nIf I go ahead, what we're going to\ndo is I'm going to open that up.\n\n480\n00:23:36.452 --> 00:23:40.764\nWe're going to choose Edit, and I'm going\nto go back to those same locations.\n\n481\n00:23:40.764 --> 00:23:41.515\nThat we were before.\n\n482\n00:23:41.515 --> 00:23:44.785\nNow, remember,\nwith Group Policy in Active Directory,\n\n483\n00:23:44.785 --> 00:23:48.800\nwe go to Policies > Administrative\nTemplates > Windows Components.\n\n484\n00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:53.830\nScroll all the way down to the bottom,\nand you have Windows Update.\n\n485\n00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.900\nNow, Dan, you've seen in\nthe last Local Group Policy,\n\n486\n00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.778\nthat we had a setting in\nhere that's missing here.\n\n487\n00:24:00.778 --> 00:24:04.120\nI don't see any defer updates.\n\n488\n00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.150\nAll right, that isn't included by default.\n\n489\n00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:08.560\nOkay, so here's what you have to do.\n\n490\n00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.210\nOnce you download the ADMX files,\nit will give you an MSI file, and\n\n491\n00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.109\nI've got that MSI file right here.\n\n492\n00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.850\nWe can look at the properties so\nthat you can see what the name is, right,\n\n493\n00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:19.800\nversion 10.\n\n494\n00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:24.910\nI get Windows10_version_1511,\nthat's the build that we're looking for.\n\n495\n00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:30.110\nNow, we're gonna go ahead and\nrun this and it's just an MSI file so\n\n496\n00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.769\nit's gonna start at\nthe Windows installer service.\n\n497\n00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.030\nAnd we'll go ahead,\ngive this a second, and let it run.\n\n498\n00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.300\nNow, what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna create a directory, and\n\n499\n00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.900\nthe directory is going to be\ninside of your programX86 folder.\n\n500\n00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.010\nSo we're gonna choose next.\n\n501\n00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.790\nWe'll accept the end\nuser license agreement.\n\n502\n00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:49.910\nOf course, we'll scroll through and\n\n503\n00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:54.210\nread all this really fast, and we'll ask\nDan about it at the end of the show.\n\n504\n00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:54.950\nAnd we'll choose next.\n\n505\n00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:55.780\nNo, just kidding.\n\n506\n00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.580\nAll right and we're gonna, I'm gonna go\nahead and I'll apply this to everyone,\n\n507\n00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.540\nnot just me.\n\n508\n00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.670\n>> You can ask me about it,\nI'm not gonna give you the right answers.\n\n509\n00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.610\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n510\n00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.070\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna choose next here.\n\n511\n00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:10.320\nAnd then we'll choose next,\nand next, next, next, next.\n\n512\n00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.470\nSo, what's next?\n\n513\n00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:12.550\nMore next.\n\n514\n00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:13.580\nWe'll let that go.\n\n515\n00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.890\nAnd again, I'll go ahead and\nwe'll be a little proactive here.\n\n516\n00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.480\nI'll get down into local disk C,\nprogram x86 files.\n\n517\n00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.010\nWe'll wait a second.\n\n518\n00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:25.480\nAnd once this finishes, I'll do\na refresh on our file explorer here.\n\n519\n00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.380\nWhat it's doing is it's\ncreating a directory there.\n\n520\n00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.920\nNow when it creates that directory,\nwhat is it doing?\n\n521\n00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.530\nIt is dumping in that\ndirectory your ADMX files,\n\n522\n00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:37.440\nwhich are your settings that\nyou see inside a group policy.\n\n523\n00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.530\nAnd it also has your ADML files,\nwhich are your language files.\n\n524\n00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:47.305\nYou need this to be able to configure\nthese deferments of upgrades.\n\n525\n00:25:47.305 --> 00:25:48.380\nWe'll go ahead and choose close.\n\n526\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.780\nWe'll open this up and sure enough,\nright there in the middle,\n\n527\n00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.940\nyou see Microsoft Group Policy, all right?\n\n528\n00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.780\nOpen that up, right?\n\n529\n00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.360\nNotice I have that Policies and\nDefinitions folder.\n\n530\n00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.440\nWell, let me show you a couple of things\nthat might make it easier for you.\n\n531\n00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.890\nBy default if you try to\nput these ADMX files and\n\n532\n00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:09.260\nyou try to overwrite the existing files,\nit starts to give you a problem and\n\n533\n00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.630\nit says try this again,\ntry this again, you need permission.\n\n534\n00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.590\nAnd before you know it,\nyou're not really doing anything.\n\n535\n00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:18.410\nSo I'm gonna go into Windows, I'm going\nto look for my policies and definitions\n\n536\n00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:22.720\nfolder, and I'm actually going to cut this\nand I'm going to copy it to the desktop.\n\n537\n00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:24.950\nAll right, notice it's gone.\n\n538\n00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.420\nIf you try to paste over it,\nyou're not going to have any luck.\n\n539\n00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:33.040\nSo now that I've got that,\nI'm going to come back here and\n\n540\n00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.450\nI'm going to copy the policies and\ndefinitions folder and\n\n541\n00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.480\nI'm going to put it right\nback in this location.\n\n542\n00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.230\nBelieve me,\nyou want to cut that first one out.\n\n543\n00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:49.090\nYou will get all these warnings that say,\ntry again, try again, try again.\n\n544\n00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:52.090\nAnd then eventually you will hit cancel.\n\n545\n00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:56.940\nNow if I go back to, and let me, I did\nthat really quick, let me kind of explain.\n\n546\n00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.230\nCuz I said, hey, we got ADMX files and\nwe got ADML files.\n\n547\n00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.410\nLet me show you what I mean, guys,\nrather than just tell you and\n\n548\n00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:05.180\nnot actually show you, all right?\n\n549\n00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.170\nSo, what it did is it copied\nall of our ADMX files, and\n\n550\n00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:11.412\nthese are our settings inside of\na group policy that we configure.\n\n551\n00:27:11.412 --> 00:27:14.350\nIf that seems a little bit foreign to you,\njump over to our group\n\n552\n00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:20.080\npolicy inside of Windows Server 2016 and\nyou can learn a lot more about that.\n\n553\n00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.140\nThe ADML files that we have in here, and\nyou can see there's a lot more languages\n\n554\n00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:29.500\nthan just English, so\nit could be a different region.\n\n555\n00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.020\nWhatever the language is, if it's\nappropriate for you, you'll be covered.\n\n556\n00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.880\nI noticed that we have ADML files in here.\n\n557\n00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.640\nThese render it in a specific language.\n\n558\n00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.560\nNow that that's done, let me go ahead and\n\n559\n00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.610\nI'll close down this group\npolicy that we're editing.\n\n560\n00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:44.950\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and\nI'm going to right click and\n\n561\n00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:46.669\nI'm going to choose edit again.\n\n562\n00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:53.650\nNow we're gonna go back to policies, we're\ngonna expand out administrative templates\n\n563\n00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.550\nand we're gonna expand\nout Window's components.\n\n564\n00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.220\nAgain, scrolling all the way down to\nthe bottom and you'll see Windows update.\n\n565\n00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.980\nNow I want you to check this out.\n\n566\n00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:10.460\nNotice that now in the middle we\nhave defer upgrades and updates.\n\n567\n00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.150\nAnd if I double-click this,\nyou'll see that we've got some\n\n568\n00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:18.120\noptions that we didn't have in\nthe long-term service branching.\n\n569\n00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.100\nIf I choose enable,\nI can say, defer upgrades for\n\n570\n00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.390\nthe following duration\nof months if I want.\n\n571\n00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:25.800\nI could pause them, right?\n\n572\n00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.650\nAnd I believe,\nI think this goes up to eight.\n\n573\n00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:29.860\nYeah, maximum is eight.\n\n574\n00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.440\nBy default, if you don't configure it and\nyou defer it, it's four months.\n\n575\n00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.900\nBut you can actually bump this up\na little bit farther if you want.\n\n576\n00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:42.840\nIf you have an issue that arises during\none of your machines doing an upgrade,\n\n577\n00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.890\njust pause it.\n\n578\n00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.730\nPause upgrades and updates.\n\n579\n00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.100\nMake it a little bit easier for you.\n\n580\n00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.220\nSo Dan, this is a new servicing model.\n\n581\n00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.230\nIt's come into Windows, and\n\n582\n00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.620\nit's pretty much shaken up\nthe whole Windows environment.\n\n583\n00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:02.110\nWe're used to our Windows updates,\nwe're used to using things like WSUS.\n\n584\n00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.810\nHere, they've kind of launched\nus into a new servicing model.\n\n585\n00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.620\nAnd one of the reasons\nwe're explaining it,\n\n586\n00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.520\nI know it's not probably the fun stuff.\n\n587\n00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.560\nAt least we can get in and\nshow you some of the things,\n\n588\n00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.010\nrather than just talk about them.\n\n589\n00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.910\nBut I do want you to keep this in mind for\nthe exam.\n\n590\n00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.750\nThe other thing that they call\nout are the Windows Store apps.\n\n591\n00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:18.990\nUpdating Windows Store apps.\n\n592\n00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:22.850\nNow I wish I have something fancy to show\nyou on this, but this is nothing more than\n\n593\n00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:26.040\nlogging in with your Microsoft account,\nlaunching the Windows Store.\n\n594\n00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.370\nAnd if you have existing Windows apps\ninstalled uou'll see little flags in there\n\n595\n00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:34.120\nthat'll tell you in the upper right-hand\ncorner hey, you've got two, maybe three,\n\n596\n00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.370\nfour updates.\n\n597\n00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:39.190\nYou click Update and it'll go through and\nit'll update all of the Windows Store\n\n598\n00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:43.220\napps, no different than some of the other\nmobile markets that you've probably seen.\n\n599\n00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.000\n>> Yeah, it's an interesting\nnew model they've got here.\n\n600\n00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:52.040\nI'll be looking forward to seeing how\nwell it plays out in the culture of IT.\n\n601\n00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.912\nCuz you know, a lot of times we\nrail against new things, and\n\n602\n00:29:54.912 --> 00:29:58.606\nthen by the time it's five years old,\nwe don't know how we live without it.\n\n603\n00:29:58.606 --> 00:30:02.179\nEverybody might be hating it now, but ten\nyears from now, that's how we do it man.\n\n604\n00:30:02.179 --> 00:30:04.905\nDon't you change it,\ncuz that's the way I like it.\n\n605\n00:30:04.905 --> 00:30:06.244\nI guarantee that's how it's gonna go.\n\n606\n00:30:06.244 --> 00:30:08.627\nWes, we thank you for\nexplaining it to us so\n\n607\n00:30:08.627 --> 00:30:12.813\nthat we are now up on top of the bleeding\nedge of Microsoft and Windows 10.\n\n608\n00:30:12.813 --> 00:30:15.568\nThat being said, it looks like we've come\nto the end of another great episode.\n\n609\n00:30:15.568 --> 00:30:16.395\nWe thank you for stopping by.\n\n610\n00:30:16.395 --> 00:30:17.686\nWe thank you for watching.\n\n611\n00:30:17.686 --> 00:30:18.610\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n612\n00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.966\nFor IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery,\n\n613\n00:30:20.966 --> 00:30:21.895\n>> And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n614\n00:30:21.895 --> 00:30:23.591\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n615\n00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:29.566\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.070\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today,\nwe're actually going in to Windows 10.\n\n4\n00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.635\nWe're taking a look installing and\nconfiguring, and\n\n5\n00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:25.142\nwhat we want to do today of course, is\ntake a look at how we can monitor some of\n\n6\n00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:28.229\nthe different things that\nare happening inside of Windows 10.\n\n7\n00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:32.983\nAnd who better to help us other than\nwell Windows 10 man himself, Wes Brian.\n\n8\n00:00:32.983 --> 00:00:34.938\nHow are you doing?\n>> I'm doing okay, thanks Ronnie for\n\n9\n00:00:34.938 --> 00:00:35.629\nhaving me here.\n\n10\n00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.981\nAs always, great to be with ITPro.TV crew.\n\n11\n00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:42.005\nThat's right, we're probably gonna be\nworking on a small mini series here when\n\n12\n00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:43.670\nit comes to monitoring Windows.\n\n13\n00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.590\nWell why is that?\n\n14\n00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.530\nWell when it comes to monitoring Windows,\nyou have a lot of options.\n\n15\n00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.556\nAnd we're gonna go through some of the\nobjectives if you will that they call out.\n\n16\n00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:55.452\nSo you'll know what are some of the\ncomponents you'll be required to know when\n\n17\n00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:57.705\nyou get in there and\nyour gonna take the exam.\n\n18\n00:00:57.705 --> 00:01:01.445\nSo one of the very first ones that we're\ngonna look at is we're gonna look at\n\n19\n00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:02.226\na Event Viewer log.\n\n20\n00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:05.140\nOne of things is being able to configure\nand analyze a Event Viewer logs.\n\n21\n00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.724\nSo I'll tell you what rather than just\ntalk about it why don't we go ahead and\n\n22\n00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:10.462\ndive in and see what we can find here?\n\n23\n00:01:10.462 --> 00:01:11.960\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nopen Event Viewer.\n\n24\n00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.973\nAnd from the desktop here we're just gonna\nright-click on our little start icon here.\n\n25\n00:01:15.973 --> 00:01:18.620\nAnd from the click links we're\njust gonna choose Event Viewer.\n\n26\n00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.710\nNow this is the event viewer console here.\n\n27\n00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.454\nYou'll see you've got\na couple of panes here.\n\n28\n00:01:25.454 --> 00:01:30.280\nOn the left hand side here we have the\ndifferent various logs and subscriptions.\n\n29\n00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.590\nWe'll get into that here in a second.\n\n30\n00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.102\nWe've got the central pane, central\npane here is the summary pane as well as\n\n31\n00:01:36.102 --> 00:01:38.514\nwhat's known as the Actions pane here.\n\n32\n00:01:38.514 --> 00:01:41.989\nWhich really can do a lot of the same\nthings that a right-click can do for you,\n\n33\n00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:44.250\nin different locations\nwithin Event Viewer.\n\n34\n00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.799\nAnd really when it comes down to it,\n\n35\n00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.014\na lot of the other Microsoft management\nconsoles that you're gonna use.\n\n36\n00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:51.047\nSo one of the first things\nI wanna look at for\n\n37\n00:01:51.047 --> 00:01:53.430\ninstance you have what\nare known as Custom Views.\n\n38\n00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.050\nAnd in the Custom Views events\nlogs you have what are called as\n\n39\n00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.690\nAdministrative Events.\n\n40\n00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.810\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and just kind\nof move this down so you guys can see.\n\n41\n00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.148\nAnd we've got all different\ntypes of events here.\n\n42\n00:02:05.148 --> 00:02:06.920\nIf I double-click on one of these events,\n\n43\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.050\nyou can get a little\nmore information on it.\n\n44\n00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.438\nIf I want to, I can always filter\nthe Custom View here from the Action pane,\n\n45\n00:02:13.438 --> 00:02:14.356\nif I wanted to.\n\n46\n00:02:14.356 --> 00:02:17.584\nIt doesn't look like they give\nyou too many options there,\n\n47\n00:02:17.584 --> 00:02:21.654\nbut remember that in the Action pane\nyou always have the Filter Current View\n\n48\n00:02:21.654 --> 00:02:24.898\nif you're trying to find maybe\none specific type of event.\n\n49\n00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:29.548\nNow, the ones that we really look at\na lot is the next one on the list here,\n\n50\n00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:32.020\nand that is well the Windows Logs.\n\n51\n00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.070\nIf we expand that out, we've got a common\nset of logs that we need to be aware of.\n\n52\n00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.102\nApplication, Security, System,\nSetup and Forwarded Events.\n\n53\n00:02:40.102 --> 00:02:43.685\nThe Application,\nif you click on that, you can see,\n\n54\n00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:47.358\ngive it a second here and\nit should show us some events.\n\n55\n00:02:47.358 --> 00:02:50.731\nSometimes you'll get some events, if you\ndon't have any applications installed\n\n56\n00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:52.380\nwhich might be the case on this machine.\n\n57\n00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.034\nI don't think I really [LAUGH]\nhave any applications installed so\n\n58\n00:02:55.034 --> 00:02:56.860\nyou might not see any\ninformation in there.\n\n59\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.660\nYou also have Security logs.\n\n60\n00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.340\nNow Security logs, keep in mind what they\ndo is they audit things like file object\n\n61\n00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.040\naccess, resource access if you will,\nlog ons, log offs.\n\n62\n00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.540\nWhen certain systems services perform\nelevated functions even though we're not\n\n63\n00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.530\nreally dealing with them too much,\nthere happen in the background.\n\n64\n00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.060\nWe can save this information\nright here if we want.\n\n65\n00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.050\nAnd again, if you'll notice over here on\nthe right hand side, just above my head\n\n66\n00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.240\nthere, there's that Filter Current Log and\nwe could always do that too depending on\n\n67\n00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.770\nwhat is available for us,\nwhat kind of logs we're looking at.\n\n68\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.195\nWe could filter it out\nif we wanted as well.\n\n69\n00:03:33.195 --> 00:03:36.930\nThe next thing that we have\nare set up information here too.\n\n70\n00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.788\nThese are informational type events here,\nand you can see different for\n\n71\n00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:45.936\ninstance, packages and\nif you double-click on them there.\n\n72\n00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:48.435\nAgain, we can notice that\nit's the information,\n\n73\n00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:52.107\nthe generalized information that they\ngive you and even go to the details.\n\n74\n00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:56.167\nAnd they give you more text based\ninformation that you can also switch\n\n75\n00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:57.783\nbetween that and XML view.\n\n76\n00:03:57.783 --> 00:03:59.502\nOr you can copy this information,\n\n77\n00:03:59.502 --> 00:04:02.526\nif for instance you needed to copy and\npaste it to a notepad and\n\n78\n00:04:02.526 --> 00:04:06.270\nmaybe send it to somebody,\nyou would have that option as well.\n\n79\n00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.260\nAnother one that's very important is\nthe System logs under Windows logs,\n\n80\n00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.820\nwe look at System logs here.\n\n81\n00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.091\nNow in a previous episode, one of the\nthings that we did is we cleared the logs,\n\n82\n00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:17.408\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n83\n00:04:17.408 --> 00:04:18.549\nIf the logs are cleared, well,\n\n84\n00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.310\nyou're not gonna have a lot of\ninformation here to look at.\n\n85\n00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.410\nAgain we could filter these logs,\nand I'll tell you,\n\n86\n00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.500\nI like to filter these logs myself\nwhen I go into the Filter log option.\n\n87\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.990\nAnd then what I'll say, for\n\n88\n00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.830\ninstance for me, maybe I don't want to\nlook at informational information or\n\n89\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.210\ninformational event levels, but maybe I\nwanna look for critical error and warning.\n\n90\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.663\nWell I can do that, I can filter this,\n\n91\n00:04:40.663 --> 00:04:43.753\nI can say what are the event\nsources if I want to.\n\n92\n00:04:43.753 --> 00:04:47.499\nFor instance .NET runtime,\nI could put that in the list,\n\n93\n00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:49.880\nI could say all event IDs if I wanted.\n\n94\n00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.280\nThe user, all users, computer source here\nso again, I like to use that filter a lot.\n\n95\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.258\nNow Forward Events,\nwith the Forward Events,\n\n96\n00:04:58.258 --> 00:05:01.315\nyou can see a lot of\ndifferent information here.\n\n97\n00:05:01.315 --> 00:05:05.621\nYou'll notice that it looks like we got\na lot of errors in here as well, but\n\n98\n00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:09.024\nForward Events is also a location\nthat you'll see when for\n\n99\n00:05:09.024 --> 00:05:12.440\ninstance you have what are known\nas subscriptions set up.\n\n100\n00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.500\nWe're gonna show you event subscriptions\nand how to set that coming up.\n\n101\n00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.468\nAnother one that I would be aware of too\nis the Application and Services log.\n\n102\n00:05:21.468 --> 00:05:24.397\nWhen it comes to the Applications and\nServices logs,\n\n103\n00:05:24.397 --> 00:05:29.018\nthis is where you get many different logs\nfor instance like Key Management Systems,\n\n104\n00:05:29.018 --> 00:05:34.220\nthings related for instance your curviros,\nInternet Explorer, hardware events.\n\n105\n00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.200\nOne of the places that I go a lot\nhere is down in the Microsoft,\n\n106\n00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.930\nyou expand this on to say Microsoft,\nit will say Windows for instance.\n\n107\n00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.950\nAnd then you've got a lot of the\ncomponents inside of Windows that you can\n\n108\n00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.220\nlook at for instance,\nif you had Branch Cash or\n\n109\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.710\nmaybe you're implementing\nBitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n110\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.700\nYou can go in here and you can look\nat the Management around BitLocker.\n\n111\n00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.311\nNow I don't have BitLocker turned on, so\n\n112\n00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:01.304\nwe would expect that these\nlogs would be empty.\n\n113\n00:06:01.304 --> 00:06:07.477\nNow I wanna talk a little bit about\nthe log structure in and off itself.\n\n114\n00:06:07.477 --> 00:06:10.339\nFor instance, let's go back to System.\n\n115\n00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:13.335\nIf System didn't have a lot\nof information for me,\n\n116\n00:06:13.335 --> 00:06:17.950\nI wanna take maybe one of these errors so\nyou can see it, and we double click it.\n\n117\n00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:25.140\nNow if we look at the structure of a log,\nthis is important, you'll see the name,\n\n118\n00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.767\nLog Name, the Source, again what was\nthe service, what was the component\n\n119\n00:06:30.767 --> 00:06:35.803\nthat caused this event to happen,\nfor the purposes of logging it.\n\n120\n00:06:35.803 --> 00:06:37.510\nWhat is the Event ID?\n\n121\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.998\nAnd again it's level.\n\n122\n00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:42.568\nI can also see the User that was logged\ninto the machine at the time that this\n\n123\n00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:44.713\nerror in this case it's an error happened.\n\n124\n00:06:44.713 --> 00:06:46.200\nWe can also see the Source.\n\n125\n00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.224\nNow this is actually coming from an event\nsubscription this is not on the local\n\n126\n00:06:49.224 --> 00:06:51.237\nmachine this is coming\nfrom another machine here.\n\n127\n00:06:51.237 --> 00:06:55.743\nBut we could also see that like for\ninstance let me get into System.\n\n128\n00:06:55.743 --> 00:06:58.911\nThis will be the local system here too,\nand\n\n129\n00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:03.640\nI can see that one of the task\ncategories was a Log clear.\n\n130\n00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.280\nIn another episode,\nwe showed you how to do remote management.\n\n131\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.745\nAnd one of the things we did\nwas with PowerShell remoting,\n\n132\n00:07:08.745 --> 00:07:10.721\nwe connected to a machine,\nand what did we do?\n\n133\n00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:13.880\nWe cleared the logs, and\nyou can see that right here.\n\n134\n00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.610\nI can see that event that happened.\n\n135\n00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.190\nIt's not necessarily a warning.\n\n136\n00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.835\nIt's not really an error,\nit's information.\n\n137\n00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:24.050\nIt means that well,\nsomething that we might need to look at.\n\n138\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.070\nNow I say that I like to filter\nwith current or excuse me,\n\n139\n00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.910\nwith go back to this Filter option.\n\n140\n00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.533\nI say that I like to Filter with Error,\nCritical, or Warning.\n\n141\n00:07:31.533 --> 00:07:35.798\nAnd you might say, well West, does that\nmean information logs aren't important?\n\n142\n00:07:35.798 --> 00:07:36.834\nAbsolutely not.\n\n143\n00:07:36.834 --> 00:07:39.969\nIf you need to know for instance,\nif group policy is processing,\n\n144\n00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:42.822\nif it processes successfully,\nwell you need to know that.\n\n145\n00:07:42.822 --> 00:07:45.206\nYou might need to know that,\nand that's an information log.\n\n146\n00:07:45.206 --> 00:07:47.307\nIt's not generating an error,\nit's not generating a warning.\n\n147\n00:07:47.307 --> 00:07:51.427\nSo If I am getting errors,\nI might wanna find informational logs\n\n148\n00:07:51.427 --> 00:07:55.256\nthat are right before it to kinda\nfind out if theres a trend.\n\n149\n00:07:55.256 --> 00:08:02.250\nSo for instance I can also filter a log\nbased on its time and date, as well.\n\n150\n00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.160\nNow the other thing I want to mention\nhere, and I don't believe I did.\n\n151\n00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.620\nLet me look, lets go back to\nthe structure there real quick of these,\n\n152\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.630\nof the event properties themselves.\n\n153\n00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.300\nIs also the task category here.\n\n154\n00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.090\nI mentioned real quick that this\nwas based clearing of the log.\n\n155\n00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.270\nWell that's the task category, and\nI do want to make mention of that.\n\n156\n00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:29.620\nNow, when it comes to event levels,\nif we go back to Filter Current Log,\n\n157\n00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:35.090\nI'm just gonna use this to show you\nthere are four different event levels.\n\n158\n00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.580\nYou have informational,\n\n159\n00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.020\nwhich informational doesn't really denote\nthat anything's wrong by any means.\n\n160\n00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.530\nIt just says, well maybe a service\nstarted, maybe a service stopped.\n\n161\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.650\nFor instance if I decided I wanted\nto reboot the principle or service.\n\n162\n00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:48.940\nThere's not a warning,\nthere's not an error.\n\n163\n00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.620\nThere's nothing wrong with doing that.\n\n164\n00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.530\nBut it gave me two operational or\ninformational logs in here.\n\n165\n00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.460\nOne that says the principle\nhad entered the stop state.\n\n166\n00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.790\nAnd then one says that maybe the principle\nentered the operational or start state.\n\n167\n00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.825\nSo you could see that as well.\n\n168\n00:09:03.825 --> 00:09:09.810\nAlright now, the other ones that we have,\nnot just information.\n\n169\n00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.650\nWe have Error, we have Critical,\nand, we have Warning.\n\n170\n00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.470\nThank you, yep, that's right.\n\n171\n00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.200\nSo at anytime,\nyou could filter again like this.\n\n172\n00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.250\nFilter these events if you want to based\non what it is that you're checking,\n\n173\n00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.390\nwhat you're looking for.\n\n174\n00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.190\nKeep in mind I double-clicked on them.\n\n175\n00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.770\nIf I right-click on an event and I choose\nEvent Properties it does the same thing,\n\n176\n00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:38.440\nso even though I'm double-clicking here\nguys, notice it says Event Properties.\n\n177\n00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.810\nAnd if I turn around and I decide,\nwell, I wanna right-click and\n\n178\n00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.056\nchoose Event Properties,\nwe're looking at the same thing.\n\n179\n00:09:45.056 --> 00:09:48.680\nAlright, now the other thing that\n\n180\n00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.950\nyou have are these event ID's that\nI mentioned just briefly, right?\n\n181\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.580\nLet me give you an example,\nwe had a couple that were I\n\n182\n00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.890\ndon't think applications got one,\nwell, I'll tell you what.\n\n183\n00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.991\nI'll use one of these\nforward events that we have.\n\n184\n00:10:01.991 --> 00:10:07.040\nAnd notice here, that we have Level,\nDate and Time, Source.\n\n185\n00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.870\nWe have the Event ID, Task Category,\nand the Log, alright.\n\n186\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.060\nWhere is the log at, right?\n\n187\n00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.010\nSo I get a lot of information right here\nfrom the centralized pane if I want.\n\n188\n00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.760\nBut these event IDs are important.\n\n189\n00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.870\nI have absolutely no\nclue what an 1898 means.\n\n190\n00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.360\nOr a 8198, excuse me,\nlet me get that right.\n\n191\n00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.480\nI have no clue what a 5973 looks like,\nright?\n\n192\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.990\nWell what I can do is I\ncan take these event IDs.\n\n193\n00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:39.090\nI can go up to TechNet,\nMicrosoft's repository of knowledge for\n\n194\n00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.400\nevery operating system and\nsoftware that they provide.\n\n195\n00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:48.540\nAnd I can plug it in and\nsay Event ID 5973.\n\n196\n00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.517\nWhen I plug that in, well,\nwhat's it going to do?\n\n197\n00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:54.557\nIt's gonna tell me what potentially\ncould have cause this problem and\n\n198\n00:10:54.557 --> 00:10:57.100\nmaybe even give me some\nsteps to resolve it.\n\n199\n00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.260\nThose are called knowledge base articles.\n\n200\n00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.090\nA lot of times you'll see\nthem when you do an update.\n\n201\n00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:05.250\nIf you check your update, you'll see\nKB and then a string of numerical,\n\n202\n00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.730\neven alphanumerical characters next to it.\n\n203\n00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.220\nAnd it tells you that you can look\nup that knowledge based article, and\n\n204\n00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.920\nyou can find more information based\non whatever the problem might be.\n\n205\n00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.820\nNow, I've mentioned subscriptions and\nthat we can set up subscriptions.\n\n206\n00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.090\nSo what does this mean, all right, for us?\n\n207\n00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.600\nWell subscriptions are when I decide\nthat with event viewer, I want another\n\n208\n00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.290\ncomputer called the source computer\nto send me their event logs, right.\n\n209\n00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:36.039\nAnd I can set up a subscription and\nI can dictate what\n\n210\n00:11:36.039 --> 00:11:40.801\ncharacteristics of\nthe subscription that I want.\n\n211\n00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:43.030\nWhat information is it that I want to get?\n\n212\n00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.440\nIt is a fairly easy process.\n\n213\n00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.115\nOne of the things you have to do is\njump down to your power shell, or\n\n214\n00:11:49.115 --> 00:11:50.330\nyour command prompt.\n\n215\n00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.630\nAnd on the computer that's going\nto collect the information,\n\n216\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.650\nIt's already run on this one.\n\n217\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.160\nI'm going to show you on another computer,\nbut you would just run WEC util.\n\n218\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.530\nThat's just short for\nWindows Event Collector Utility.\n\n219\n00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:07.115\nAnd just like we did when we run WinRM,\nwe just do a qc.\n\n220\n00:12:07.115 --> 00:12:08.770\nAlright, and\n\n221\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.240\nit's asking the server startup mode\nwill be changed to Delay-Start.\n\n222\n00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.550\nWould you like to proceed with this?\n\n223\n00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:20.150\nSo yes, the Event Collector service\nwas configured correctly, all right?\n\n224\n00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:24.770\nNow, understand that the Event Collector\nservice was already started on this\n\n225\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.210\nmachine, so\nI just want you to be aware of that.\n\n226\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:32.050\nNow, this is the machine that will\ncollect all of that information.\n\n227\n00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.810\nSo what is it that we have to\ndo on the source computer?\n\n228\n00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.035\nThe source of the events\nwe want to monitor.\n\n229\n00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:41.440\nIf we switch over to the next\ncomputer here, let me logged in,\n\n230\n00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.885\nthere´s a couple of things\nthat we have to do.\n\n231\n00:12:44.885 --> 00:12:47.335\nFirst of all,\nI have to check what is the state?\n\n232\n00:12:47.335 --> 00:12:52.265\nWhat is the current state of the WinRM\nservice that this is gonna piggyback on?\n\n233\n00:12:52.265 --> 00:12:53.675\nSo I'd have to type in,\n\n234\n00:12:53.675 --> 00:12:57.005\nlike we showed you in a previous episode\nwhere we looked at remote management.\n\n235\n00:12:57.005 --> 00:13:01.672\nWe did winrm and we did QC or quickconfig.\n\n236\n00:13:01.672 --> 00:13:03.602\nEither one will work.\n\n237\n00:13:03.602 --> 00:13:06.502\nAnd notice that it tells us that's\nit's always running on this machine,\n\n238\n00:13:06.502 --> 00:13:07.812\nits already set up.\n\n239\n00:13:07.812 --> 00:13:13.070\nI know that that's the first process that\nI need and that's already set up for me.\n\n240\n00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.490\nSo what we can do is we\ncan go into the next step.\n\n241\n00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.600\nNow remember that the Win RM\nquick config has to be run on\n\n242\n00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.110\nthe computers that you're gonna\ncollect the events from, right.\n\n243\n00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.000\nOn the collector,\nthe one that's gonna receive\n\n244\n00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.650\nall of these events that you're\ngonna review, that's wecutil qc.\n\n245\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.880\nOn the computer that actually\ngoing to send the events,\n\n246\n00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.410\nyou're on your Win rm quick config.\n\n247\n00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.530\nThat's step one, but there is a step two.\n\n248\n00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:47.590\nYou do have to remember that you have\nto enter the collector computer name.\n\n249\n00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:52.220\nYou have to add it to a group on this\nmachine so that this machine will\n\n250\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.190\nallow it to connect and say hey,\nyou got any events I need to look at?\n\n251\n00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.660\nLet's go ahead and\nshow you how we would do that.\n\n252\n00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.460\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust fire up our computer management here.\n\n253\n00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.190\nAnd when we look in computer management,\nwe're gonna go to the Local Users and\n\n254\n00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.760\nGroups Node.\n\n255\n00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.590\nAnd, I know that's kind of hard to\nsee here guys, I gotta zoom in,\n\n256\n00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.510\nmake it a little easier for\nyou guys to see there.\n\n257\n00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.880\nAnd I'm gonna go to Local Users and\n\n258\n00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.180\nGroups, and\nthen I'm gonna go to Groups, all right?\n\n259\n00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:25.680\nNow, in Groups, you have Event Log\nReaders, notice this group right here.\n\n260\n00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.140\nAnd if I hover over that a little bit,\nyou might be able to see it.\n\n261\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.790\nMembers of this group can read\nevent logs from the local machine.\n\n262\n00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.460\nAlright, now, remember I'm not\ngoing to be on the local machine.\n\n263\n00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.010\nRemember I'm going to be\non a remote computer,\n\n264\n00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.280\nI'm going to be on another computer.\n\n265\n00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.550\nSo what I have to do is I\nhave to go into this group.\n\n266\n00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.570\nAnd I have to add the computer.\n\n267\n00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:44.440\nNotice it's added for me.\n\n268\n00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.490\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust select that computer and remove it so\n\n269\n00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.070\nwe can just show you the whole step here,\nguys.\n\n270\n00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.300\nBut it was already there.\n\n271\n00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.710\nI just choose Add.\n\n272\n00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:54.600\nAnd notice that, and\nlet me be very clear on this one.\n\n273\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:01.280\nIf you don't have connectivity to Active\nDirectory, this will not work, okay?\n\n274\n00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.780\nThat's because it's searching and\nit will only search the local computer for\n\n275\n00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.420\nthose groups.\n\n276\n00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.770\nIn this case, it's not a local account.\n\n277\n00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.760\nIt's an account that's stored\nin an active directory.\n\n278\n00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.308\nI have to have access to the active\ndirectory database in order for\n\n279\n00:15:14.308 --> 00:15:15.090\nthis to work.\n\n280\n00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:19.140\nAnd you can see ensuring that\nit says from this location.\n\n281\n00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.990\nNow, the other thing that's kinda,\nand Ronnie,\n\n282\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.890\nI know you've had to deal with\nthis on quite a few occasions.\n\n283\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.400\nAbout this dialog box that\nI just can't understand for\n\n284\n00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.110\nthe life of me,\nof why they've coded it this way.\n\n285\n00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.970\nSelect Users, Computers,\nService Accounts, or Groups.\n\n286\n00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.221\nOkay, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'll type in Client 01.\n\n287\n00:15:37.897 --> 00:15:40.310\nAnd then what we'll do,\nis we'll choose Check Names.\n\n288\n00:15:42.722 --> 00:15:43.900\nIt doesn't find it.\n\n289\n00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.590\nWell why doesn't it find it?\n\n290\n00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.870\nWell I want you to be careful.\n\n291\n00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.980\nEven though this says Select Users,\nComputers, Service Accounts, or Groups.\n\n292\n00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.130\nIf I check object types,\nnotice what isn't checked.\n\n293\n00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.934\nNotice that Computers doesn't\nhave a checkmark in it.\n\n294\n00:15:57.934 --> 00:16:02.887\nThis is one of those ones that\nthe information title bar there is\n\n295\n00:16:02.887 --> 00:16:04.430\nvery misleading.\n\n296\n00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.233\nSo you have to select the Computer object,\nchoose OK.\n\n297\n00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:12.490\nAnd if I choose Check Names now,\nnotice how it's underlined.\n\n298\n00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:13.510\nAnd we'll choose OK to that.\n\n299\n00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:17.130\nAll right, and we'll choose OK.\n\n300\n00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:23.300\nNow that is what we have to do in\norder to get the subscriptions set up.\n\n301\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.260\nNow it could take a bit in\norder to get these set up, but\n\n302\n00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.560\nlet's jump back to our event collector and\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n303\n00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.510\nwhat we're gonna do is\nset up that subscription.\n\n304\n00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.210\nAll right, now, I've already got.\n\n305\n00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.440\nDo I have a subscription?\n\n306\n00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.625\nOkay, good.\nWe don't have a subscription there even\n\n307\n00:16:38.625 --> 00:16:40.276\nthough it was set up on the other side.\n\n308\n00:16:40.276 --> 00:16:42.590\nCuz I really wanna walk you\nthrough this part step by step.\n\n309\n00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.829\nNotice down here at the bottom if I\ncollapse some of these on themselves,\n\n310\n00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.090\nprobably be able to see\nthat a little bit easier.\n\n311\n00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.140\nSo we're working with subscriptions here.\n\n312\n00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:56.230\nIf I right-click on that,\nnotice this Create Subscriptions option.\n\n313\n00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:00.630\nAll right,\nif I choose Create Subscription,\n\n314\n00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.810\nit's gonna give me the subscription\nproperties dialogue box.\n\n315\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:04.870\nI can name it, right.\n\n316\n00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.553\nSome of these are obvious, guys, so\n\n317\n00:17:07.553 --> 00:17:13.009\ncertainly don't want to insult your\nintelligence here, but I might say,\n\n318\n00:17:13.009 --> 00:17:17.789\nfor instance, this might be\nClient02 Subscription, right.\n\n319\n00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:21.909\nAnd I might give it maybe options here,\nI don't really have to, but\n\n320\n00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:23.730\nnotice the destination log.\n\n321\n00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.890\nBy default, it's Forward Events.\n\n322\n00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.161\nRight, Forward Events,\nthat means it's gonna show up,\n\n323\n00:17:29.161 --> 00:17:30.980\nprobably can't expand it out.\n\n324\n00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.780\nBut under Windows Logs, the last\none in the list is Forward Events.\n\n325\n00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.310\nAll right, but now, I've got the option.\n\n326\n00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:42.050\nI've got a collector initiated, or\nI've got a source computer initiated.\n\n327\n00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.240\nAnd I just want you to know\nthe difference between the two.\n\n328\n00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.010\nIn this case,\nwe're gonna do a collector initiated,\n\n329\n00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:50.600\nwhich means this computer here that's\nrunning the event collector, it's gonna\n\n330\n00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.910\nreach out with WinRM and it's gonna\nsay hey, I need some of these events.\n\n331\n00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.160\nCan you send them to me?\n\n332\n00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:00.330\nSource initiated just puts that task\non the opposite side of the tracks.\n\n333\n00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:05.160\nThat's where the computer that we said,\nlet's run WinRM quick config on it when\n\n334\n00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.680\nit says here,\nlet me send you some of these events.\n\n335\n00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.210\nAnd again,\nyou can determine which one you wanna do.\n\n336\n00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.300\nIn this case, I'm just gonna do\nthe collector initiated one.\n\n337\n00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:18.550\nBe aware of the two different types\nof subscriptions, if you will.\n\n338\n00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.020\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nchoose Select Computer.\n\n339\n00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.440\nAgain, notice it says\nadd domain computers.\n\n340\n00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.950\nI can't stress this enough.\n\n341\n00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.580\nNotice that, where the location is,\nthe entire directory,\n\n342\n00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.460\nyou have to have access to your active\ndirectory in order for this to work.\n\n343\n00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.660\nSo we're gonna do Client02.\n\n344\n00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.984\nWe'll do a Check Names.\n\n345\n00:18:38.165 --> 00:18:40.160\nAll right, and it's there.\n\n346\n00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.800\nIt found it.\n\n347\n00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.600\nIt's underscored, it knows it's there, and\n\n348\n00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.370\nI have the ability now that if I want,\nmaybe I want to test it beforehand.\n\n349\n00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:50.070\nSo I click Test,\nit says connectivity test has succeeded.\n\n350\n00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.530\nSo I know it's got communication.\n\n351\n00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.040\nWe'll choose OK, okay.\n\n352\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.670\nAnd now I have the option that if I want,\nI could say okay,\n\n353\n00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.920\nwell, what events do I want?\n\n354\n00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.540\nWhat events do I wanna look at?\n\n355\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:06.530\nWell, maybe for this, maybe we've got, who\nknows, a help desk called and said hey,\n\n356\n00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.430\nwe're gonna have to do\nsome proactive monitoring.\n\n357\n00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.010\nThere's something going\non with the system.\n\n358\n00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.730\nWe really don't know exactly what it is.\n\n359\n00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:14.800\nWell, guess what?\n\n360\n00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.840\nI can choose Select Events.\n\n361\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.180\nNotice I can change the time, all right.\n\n362\n00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.310\nI can do Critical and Error if I want,\nmaybe Critical Error and Warning.\n\n363\n00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.230\nAnd then I could say By Log or By Source.\n\n364\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.490\nSo the event logs, right,\nthat's what I want.\n\n365\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.540\nI expand out,\nremember these logs that we talked about.\n\n366\n00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.600\nI can choose System in this case.\n\n367\n00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.460\nNow, be very careful.\n\n368\n00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.050\nI'm not sure if it'll\ngive you this warning.\n\n369\n00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:39.629\nLet me see if it will\ngive this warning here.\n\n370\n00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:45.330\nIf not, we're gonna have\na long wait on the refresh.\n\n371\n00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.500\nOkay, there we go.\n\n372\n00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.250\nI wanted to show you this just\nbecause it'll warn you for\n\n373\n00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.830\nthe purposes of this subscription.\n\n374\n00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:57.020\nIt says, man,\nyou just selected a ton of event logs.\n\n375\n00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.240\nDo you really wanna do this?\n\n376\n00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.680\nCuz all of these logs are going\nover your network bandwidth and\n\n377\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.430\nthe performance is gonna\ndegrade very severely.\n\n378\n00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.590\nI'm not gonna do that so I'm gonna say no,\nI don't wanna continue and\n\n379\n00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.380\nwe're gonna reconfigure that real quick.\n\n380\n00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.040\nAll right, so I've got event logs.\n\n381\n00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:20.240\nI'm gonna uncheck the Applications and\nServices log.\n\n382\n00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.860\nAnd we're going to deselect, I guess I\nshould say, all of these but system.\n\n383\n00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.950\nAll right,\nwe could do keywords if we wanted.\n\n384\n00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.570\nFor instance,\nmaybe we're auditing security logs.\n\n385\n00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.440\nI could do audit failures and\naudit success,\n\n386\n00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.920\nif maybe I'm doing the security log.\n\n387\n00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.690\nIn this case,\nwe'll just leave it where it is.\n\n388\n00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:40.210\nAll users, all computers, and\nit looks like I just cleared it here, so\n\n389\n00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.400\nlet's try that one more time.\n\n390\n00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.500\nAnd again, we'll do Error,\nCritical, and Warning.\n\n391\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:50.850\nAnd Anytime, and\nmake sure I've got that, choose OK.\n\n392\n00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:55.930\nNow you have the option to change what\n\n393\n00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:00.710\nis the account, if you will,\nthat's gonna be asking for this event.\n\n394\n00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.646\nSo I can go into Advanced if I want and\nI can say that it's gonna be a machine\n\n395\n00:21:03.646 --> 00:21:05.633\naccount which that's\nwhat we're going to use.\n\n396\n00:21:05.633 --> 00:21:08.900\nWe're going to use a machine account, but\nI can also tie this to a specific user,\n\n397\n00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.000\nin this case by default, it's whatever\nuser's logged into this machine.\n\n398\n00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.430\nI'm gonna just say machine account.\n\n399\n00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.760\nNow you do have some options, right.\n\n400\n00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.204\nIf you're trying to\noptimize your bandwidth and\n\n401\n00:21:20.204 --> 00:21:24.556\nyou don't want a lot of this communication\nreally hindering your network bandwidth,\n\n402\n00:21:24.556 --> 00:21:26.610\nwe can say minimize bandwidth, right.\n\n403\n00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:27.490\nI'm not going to do that, for\n\n404\n00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.910\nthe purposes of this show I'm\ngonna say minimize latency.\n\n405\n00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.840\nJust understand what you might\nbe doing here, all right.\n\n406\n00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.650\nI also want you to pay attention to\nthe port number too, just in case they\n\n407\n00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.760\nask you on the exam, says wait a second,\nwe're getting an event subscription,\n\n408\n00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.040\nwe're going through a firewall,\nwhat do you need to do?\n\n409\n00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:49.240\nWell, you might need to\nenable TCP port 5985.\n\n410\n00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.736\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nchoose OK to that.\n\n411\n00:21:51.736 --> 00:21:52.986\nAnd then OK.\n\n412\n00:21:52.986 --> 00:21:55.780\nAnd notice that we have\nthis subscription now.\n\n413\n00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.260\nAll right, now, in the right-hand\nside here, just above my head,\n\n414\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.570\nyou'll see that we've got the subscription\nand we've got some of these options here,\n\n415\n00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.720\nDelete, Runtime, Property, Disable, Retry.\n\n416\n00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.410\nIf I right-click,\nthose are those same options.\n\n417\n00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.720\nRemember I told you the action pane does\nthe same thing as your right-click, but\n\n418\n00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.300\nI can look at the runtime status.\n\n419\n00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.450\nRight, and\nif I look at the runtime status,\n\n420\n00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.000\nit tells me yeah, you're active, right.\n\n421\n00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.950\nI know that I've got an active, and\nI can disable it if I wanted to.\n\n422\n00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.050\nMaybe I decide that hey, I've got enough\ninformation, I'll keep this here for\n\n423\n00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.050\nthe future, I'll just disable it, right.\n\n424\n00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.580\nNow I don't have to worry about that\ncommunication, I can turn it around and\n\n425\n00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.870\nif I wanted just like I did,\nenable it that easy.\n\n426\n00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:37.010\nNow the next thing that we can do, is we\ncan go over here to our Forward Events,\n\n427\n00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.230\nright, and\nthese are brand new events, right?\n\n428\n00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.130\nThese weren't here before.\n\n429\n00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.380\nIf you remember, when I opened that,\nall we had was a string of errors, well,\n\n430\n00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.240\nnotice that we got information\nevents here too, right?\n\n431\n00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.590\nAnd I could do the same thing,\nif I wanted, I could go down and\n\n432\n00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.360\nI can get some details.\n\n433\n00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.230\nBut more importantly,\n\n434\n00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:56.180\nwhat I want you to see here is the fact\nthat look at the source, right?\n\n435\n00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.712\nSo notice the source here.\n\n436\n00:22:57.712 --> 00:23:00.650\nThe source is no longer my local computer.\n\n437\n00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.840\nAgain, these are Forward Events.\n\n438\n00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.310\nClient02 is sending these\nback to Client01 and\n\n439\n00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.340\nthey're stored in\nthe Forward Event location.\n\n440\n00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.893\nSo that is Subscriptions, right?\n\n441\n00:23:12.893 --> 00:23:15.600\nSo a lot a bit about event viewer,\nknow how to run it,\n\n442\n00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.240\nknow how to set up these subscriptions,\nmake sure that your WinRM is going,\n\n443\n00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:25.090\nmake sure that you got the QC option run\n\n444\n00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:30.560\non the event collector, all right.\n\n445\n00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:35.141\nLast thing I might say is that if\nyou wanted to launch your event\n\n446\n00:23:35.141 --> 00:23:39.811\nviewer from the command line,\nwhether it's command prompt or\n\n447\n00:23:39.811 --> 00:23:44.833\nwhether it's PowerShell,\njust throw this one out here eventvrw,\n\n448\n00:23:44.833 --> 00:23:49.177\noops, excuse me,\nvwr.msc launches your event viewer.\n\n449\n00:23:49.177 --> 00:23:52.521\nSo the run line command just in\ncase it comes up on the exam.\n\n450\n00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:58.860\nAll right, so that is basically, in a\nnutshell, that is using your event viewer.\n\n451\n00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.050\nNow the next one that we've had,\nwe've had around for a very long time, and\n\n452\n00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:07.260\nit's gone through a series of face lifts\nover the last couple of operating systems.\n\n453\n00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.840\nCouple of different ways\nthat you can get to this.\n\n454\n00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.170\nCuz I'm a left hand, I'm South pole,\n\n455\n00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:16.170\nI like this keyboard combination cuz it's\nall in the left hand side of the keyboard.\n\n456\n00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:17.625\nThat's Ctrl+Shift+Esc.\n\n457\n00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:21.530\nCtrl+Shift+Esc brings\nup your Task Manager.\n\n458\n00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.762\nThat's one of the ways that\nyou can get to Task Manager.\n\n459\n00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:28.900\nThe easiest way, right click the task bar,\nShow Task Manager.\n\n460\n00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.870\nNow when you first launch\nyour Task Manager,\n\n461\n00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.160\nyou don't get a lot of information.\n\n462\n00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.575\nIn fact, in this case, you can see well,\n\n463\n00:24:33.575 --> 00:24:37.000\n[LAUGH] I really don't have any\ninformation, and even if I was to,\n\n464\n00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.050\nlet's say, run an application,\nand it shouldn't connect.\n\n465\n00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:46.090\nBut I can see I've got Internet Explorer,\nand if I wanted, I could end the task,\n\n466\n00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.470\nand you see it closes down.\n\n467\n00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.421\nBut that's not as easy as they're\ngonna give it to you on the exam,\n\n468\n00:24:51.421 --> 00:24:52.521\nI can almost guarantee that.\n\n469\n00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:54.640\nYou're gonna show more details, right?\n\n470\n00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.540\nAnd here are the different\ntabs that we have, and\n\n471\n00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.040\nI wanna talk about these tabs, all right?\n\n472\n00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.750\nThe first one is called Processes tab.\n\n473\n00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:08.975\nNow the Processes tab, keep in mind,\napplications run processes, if you will.\n\n474\n00:25:08.975 --> 00:25:11.690\nAnd then there's a lot of\nbackground processes too.\n\n475\n00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:14.530\nIt shows you what the utilization\nis with the four horsemen,\n\n476\n00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:15.986\nas I like to call them, right?\n\n477\n00:25:15.986 --> 00:25:20.654\nThe four components within a machine,\na system unit that can either make or\n\n478\n00:25:20.654 --> 00:25:26.770\nbreak performance, right, CPU, memory,\nhard drive, and network adapter, right?\n\n479\n00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.400\nAnd it shows you what they're\ncurrently utilizing, and\n\n480\n00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.130\nif you wanna cycle through these, all you\nhave to do is click the top of the list,\n\n481\n00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:37.360\nand it'll show you which of these is\nconsuming, in this case, the most memory.\n\n482\n00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:42.790\nI can see that's it's Miss Cortana here\nis kinda consuming a lot of the memory.\n\n483\n00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:47.210\nCPU, same thing, I just go ahead and\nclick it, and it cycles back through and\n\n484\n00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:52.285\nshows me what process is\nrunning the most CPU here.\n\n485\n00:25:52.285 --> 00:25:54.285\nI can right click on it, I can end a task.\n\n486\n00:25:54.285 --> 00:25:56.733\nI will tell you be very\ncareful in ending a task.\n\n487\n00:25:56.733 --> 00:26:01.260\nUnderstand that [LAUGH] make sure that if\nit's a background processes that's going\n\n488\n00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.770\non, and you end the task, know what\nyou're ending cuz you could break or\n\n489\n00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.590\ncripple your operating system, all right?\n\n490\n00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.520\nNow I tell you what I'm gonna do, Ronnie.\n\n491\n00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.831\nI'm gonna kind of jump\noff the beaten path,\n\n492\n00:26:11.831 --> 00:26:16.760\njust jumping down to details because these\ntwo are really, really similar, right?\n\n493\n00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.950\nNotice that I have Task Manager,\nand if I expand it out,\n\n494\n00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:21.760\nI've got another Task Manager.\n\n495\n00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.650\nWell, detail shows you a lot\nof the same information,\n\n496\n00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.360\nbut you no longer get\nthis collapsed hierarchy.\n\n497\n00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.420\nRight, it breaks them down,\nit shows you every single process and\n\n498\n00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.790\napplication that's running, but it shows\nyou things like your processor ID,\n\n499\n00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.630\nit shows you your status,\nwhether it's running the username,\n\n500\n00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.050\nthe context that it's running in,\nwhether it's a system account,\n\n501\n00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:47.080\nwhether it's the network, CPU, memory, and\nI can even add columns here if I want.\n\n502\n00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.890\nAll right, so\nthat's one of the differences.\n\n503\n00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.420\nDetails is exactly, if you remember it for\n\n504\n00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.080\nthe exam,\ndetailed information about your processes.\n\n505\n00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.750\nWe don't get that nice pretty icon, and\nagain, like I said, this hierarchical tree\n\n506\n00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:02.880\nthat you can collapse and say, well,\nthat's Internet Explorer running, right?\n\n507\n00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.002\nWell, if you have multiple instances of\nInternet Explorer running, guess what?\n\n508\n00:27:07.002 --> 00:27:07.790\nYou're gonna sit there,\n\n509\n00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:11.940\nand you'll see however many instances\nyou have running here not collapsed.\n\n510\n00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.005\nI could also do the same thing.\n\n511\n00:27:14.005 --> 00:27:16.535\nI could do something,\nwhich kind of interesting here,\n\n512\n00:27:16.535 --> 00:27:18.555\nis setting priority on a process, right?\n\n513\n00:27:18.555 --> 00:27:21.925\nI could say, okay, well,\nthis is gonna be high priority.\n\n514\n00:27:21.925 --> 00:27:24.325\nI could set affinities if I wanted,\ntoo, right?\n\n515\n00:27:24.325 --> 00:27:26.500\nI could say, all right,\nlet's set the affinity and\n\n516\n00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.710\nwe're gonna tell it which processor,\nif I got a multi-core processor in here,\n\n517\n00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.920\nmaybe I wanna tell it which\ncore I want it to use.\n\n518\n00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.700\nSo again, I can set the affinities, too.\n\n519\n00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.070\nSo like I said,\nI just wanted to kinda compare.\n\n520\n00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.320\nI know I'm jumping a little bit there.\n\n521\n00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.080\nBut those are very, very similar.\n\n522\n00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.980\nYou can see one doesn't give\nyou the pretty icons and\n\n523\n00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.330\nthe collapsed hierarchical tree.\n\n524\n00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.879\nIt breaks it down for you and\ngives you every application and process.\n\n525\n00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:54.840\nHere's one that has changed tremendously\nfrom the earlier days of Windows.\n\n526\n00:27:54.840 --> 00:28:00.660\nI really like this one now, and\nthis one is the Performance tab.\n\n527\n00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.936\nNotice that the Performance tab,\nall right,\n\n528\n00:28:02.936 --> 00:28:07.110\nnotice that it shows you, those four\nhorsemen that I was telling you about,\n\n529\n00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.820\nin this case, there's another one,\nBluetooth, although it's not configured.\n\n530\n00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.000\nIt's not running right now, so\nit's not gonna show you any information.\n\n531\n00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.740\nBut here, you get the components, right?\n\n532\n00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.650\nAnd I can actually, if I wanted to,\nI could right click on this, and I could\n\n533\n00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:24.280\nchoose Show Graphs, and notice it gives me\nthis heads up on all of the components.\n\n534\n00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.000\nIf I do summar, don't wanna do\nthe summary review, let's take that off.\n\n535\n00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.230\nHigh graph,\nit just gives me the icons, and\n\n536\n00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:33.770\nI can't really tell how much\nis being used individually.\n\n537\n00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:38.940\nBut in this view,\nI don't have to switch over and look here,\n\n538\n00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.270\nI can see it in real time and kind of\nget like a little heads up view as well.\n\n539\n00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:47.090\nNow I really like this interface because\nof the fact that they've given it kind\n\n540\n00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:48.120\nof a flashy interface.\n\n541\n00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.870\nIt's got a good look to it.\n\n542\n00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:54.347\nThe only thing I will tell you that I\nkinda miss from the earlier Task Manager\n\n543\n00:28:54.347 --> 00:28:59.198\nand the Performance tab is the fact that\nyou could see the individual cores here.\n\n544\n00:28:59.198 --> 00:29:01.830\nAnd you could see what your core\nutilization is individually.\n\n545\n00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:05.780\nNow you have a totality of utilization,\ndoesn't matter if you have four or\n\n546\n00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.730\nfive cores, what you see is,\nwell, right here.\n\n547\n00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.930\nWe're gonna get back to it where\nyou can see the individual cores.\n\n548\n00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.150\nThat's in a component called\nResource Monitor that we'll take care of\n\n549\n00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:15.420\na little bit later.\n\n550\n00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.060\nAll right, so how about modern UI apps?\n\n551\n00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.033\nI know they used to be called the metro\nUI, the Window Store apps, right?\n\n552\n00:29:23.033 --> 00:29:26.550\nI wanna see how they're\naffecting my machine, right?\n\n553\n00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:30.110\nMaybe you're on a mobile device or\nmaybe on a laptop like we are here, and\n\n554\n00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.960\nyou've got maybe a data cap\nyou wanna kind of find out,\n\n555\n00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.100\nwell, is it using a lot of my information?\n\n556\n00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.045\nIs it chewing up a lot of my CPU string?\n\n557\n00:29:38.045 --> 00:29:40.855\nWell I can go to app history, right, and\n\n558\n00:29:40.855 --> 00:29:45.445\nyou notice that I'm not really using\ntoo many of these apps, so apparently,\n\n559\n00:29:45.445 --> 00:29:49.185\nI don't use the apps at all here cuz\nit doesn't give me any information.\n\n560\n00:29:49.185 --> 00:29:52.935\nSo you can see CPU time, you can see\nnetwork, you can see metered network and\n\n561\n00:29:52.935 --> 00:29:53.825\nthe tile updates.\n\n562\n00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:56.705\nNow I just wanna take a second to tell\nyou what that metered network is.\n\n563\n00:29:56.705 --> 00:29:59.920\nMost of these should be\npretty obvious what they are,\n\n564\n00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.750\nhow much of the CPU am I using?\n\n565\n00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.170\nHow much of my network\ncommunications am I using?\n\n566\n00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.160\nTile updates, when they refresh,\nif I go down to the Start screen here, or\n\n567\n00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.272\nthe Start menu,\nnotice that they're refreshing.\n\n568\n00:30:09.272 --> 00:30:13.870\nI wanna know how much of that's util, and\nlet me just kind of draw the comparison.\n\n569\n00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:16.520\nThis is what we're talking about,\nthese apps.\n\n570\n00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.770\nNow what's Metered Network?\n\n571\n00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:21.390\nWell Metered Network, if I flag\na connection as a metered network,\n\n572\n00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:23.760\nit means certain things are gonna\nchange in the background.\n\n573\n00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.910\nWe're not gonna do tile updates, we're not\ngonna reach out to the Windows Store and\n\n574\n00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.870\ndo updates, so you'd see\na performance hinderance there, but\n\n575\n00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.350\nthat's what that column is about.\n\n576\n00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.950\nSo this is all about\n\n577\n00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:38.010\nthose applications that are basically\nthe Windows Store type API.\n\n578\n00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.340\nAnd I could also delete\nthe usage history if I want.\n\n579\n00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:45.010\nNow, for me, that would be pretty easy, I\nguess I'd just be deleting 1.14 seconds or\n\n580\n00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:49.190\nCPU time here from old Miss Cortana,\nbut you can do it if you need to.\n\n581\n00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:54.060\nAll right, we also got the Startup tab,\nand I'm gonna go ahead, and\n\n582\n00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.330\nI know that we've said\nthis in other episodes,\n\n583\n00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.550\nRonnie, but I just wanna go ahead and\nmake sure that everybody's aware of it.\n\n584\n00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:04.092\nBecause this one did change kind of\nconsiderably, and we're not in a Windows\n\n585\n00:31:04.092 --> 00:31:07.810\n8.1 exam, so if you haven't taken that\nexam, you might not be aware of that.\n\n586\n00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:12.819\nIn Windows 8 and 8.1, they took what\nwe used to configure here from system\n\n587\n00:31:12.819 --> 00:31:18.293\nconfiguration or MSconfig, the Startup\ntab, and we would configure applications\n\n588\n00:31:18.293 --> 00:31:22.941\nthat would put their startup files\nas part of the boot process, right?\n\n589\n00:31:22.941 --> 00:31:25.060\nAnd I want you to notice\nwhat it says here.\n\n590\n00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.810\nTo manage the Startup items,\nuse the Startup section of Task Manager.\n\n591\n00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:30.820\nAnd that's what we're talking about here.\n\n592\n00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.730\nAnd I just mentioned that because\nMicrosoft likes to know are you aware of\n\n593\n00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.190\nnewer features that maybe weren't in\nsome of the previous operating systems.\n\n594\n00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:40.443\nEven though this one is,\nyou'll still be prepared.\n\n595\n00:31:40.443 --> 00:31:42.934\nAnd for this,\nI can right click on any of these,\n\n596\n00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:46.129\nI could say open the file location\nif I wanna know where it is.\n\n597\n00:31:46.129 --> 00:31:49.209\nSearch online if you're not aware\nof what it is, maybe it's a virus.\n\n598\n00:31:49.209 --> 00:31:53.386\nWell I don't think one drive by any means\nis a virus, but if something showed up in\n\n599\n00:31:53.386 --> 00:31:56.581\nthis list and I couldn't identify\nit I could search online and\n\n600\n00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:59.090\nI could find out maybe I\ndo need to disable that.\n\n601\n00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.020\nI could also look at the properties and\n\n602\n00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.950\nthe properties shows me no different\nthan a properties dialog box.\n\n603\n00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.935\nIf I was to look down at a program file,\nselect the application,\n\n604\n00:32:06.935 --> 00:32:10.900\nright-click on it and\nbring up its properties, and\n\n605\n00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.880\nthen we have the ability,\nif I wanted, to disable it.\n\n606\n00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.860\nSo, for instance, Microsoft OneDrive\nmaybe I'm not using OneDrive.\n\n607\n00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.750\nIt's part of the Office suite,\nbut I'm not using it.\n\n608\n00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.310\nWell, I could choose disable, all right?\n\n609\n00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.910\nNow I don't have to worry about,\nyou can see the status is disabled, and\n\n610\n00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:25.670\nI don't have to worry\nabout the startup impact.\n\n611\n00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:30.240\nUsers basically shows you the users\nthat are logged into the machine, right?\n\n612\n00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.725\nI can't disconnect myself.\n\n613\n00:32:31.725 --> 00:32:36.420\n[LAUGH] But if you've ever been\nto a domain computer that four or\n\n614\n00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:40.200\nfive people have left themselves logged\nin and they do the fast user switching,\n\n615\n00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.540\nevery one of those user accounts\nis using your computer resources.\n\n616\n00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.000\nSo I could come in here if I wanted and\nI could disconnect them manually.\n\n617\n00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.780\nKeep in mind that that is going to discard\nany information they haven't saved so\n\n618\n00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:54.070\ndo that carefully,\nuse caution I should say.\n\n619\n00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:56.760\nServices guys,\nthis is pretty much a stripped\n\n620\n00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.600\ndown version of the services\nconsole that we see,\n\n621\n00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.670\nthe services management console, and\nwe have the ability to stop and restart.\n\n622\n00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:08.538\nWe can open the Services Console and\nyou could see that very thing right there,\n\n623\n00:33:08.538 --> 00:33:09.291\nall right?\n\n624\n00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:14.700\nSo basically those, in a nutshell,\nare your Event Viewer and Task Manager.\n\n625\n00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.355\nNow we've got a lot more to go, but\n\n626\n00:33:16.355 --> 00:33:20.870\nRonnie is telling me, I think we might end\nup having to do a part two on this one.\n\n627\n00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:26.240\n>> All right Wes, well thank you for\nhelping us take a look at those tools.\n\n628\n00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.600\nWe've actually taken a look, or\n\n629\n00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.700\nWes has guided us through at least\ntaking a look at the event viewer and\n\n630\n00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.490\nsetting up things like subscription,\nas well as actually trying to show us\n\n631\n00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:39.190\nsome of the things that have been modified\nin the task manager inside of Windows 10.\n\n632\n00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:41.910\nSo take a look at those options and\n\n633\n00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:46.760\nmake sure you understand especially\nhow to setup that event subscription.\n\n634\n00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.950\nMake sure you understand those different\noptions that you have available there.\n\n635\n00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.330\nWhether it's gonna be source generator or\n\n636\n00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:54.400\nwhether it's gonna be the collector\ninitiated type of thing.\n\n637\n00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.797\nYou have to actually be able to\ndifferentiate that if you're gonna be\n\n638\n00:33:57.797 --> 00:34:01.090\ngetting ready for this exam that\nyou're facing for Windows 10.\n\n639\n00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:05.390\nAll of this, of course, helps actually go\ninto the other things that you also need.\n\n640\n00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.110\nBut there's plenty of more things\nthat we can actually take a look at,\n\n641\n00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.070\nespecially when we talk about monitoring.\n\n642\n00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.990\nAnd so we're actually going to be able\nto see that, but we do need to wait for\n\n643\n00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:15.150\npart two.\n\n644\n00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:18.810\nSo that means it's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n645\n00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:21.900\nSigning off for\nITProTV I've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n646\n00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.980\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n647\n00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.736\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows 10 episodes.\n\n648\n00:34:26.736 --> 00:34:35.239\n[MUSIC].\n\n",

They also demonstrate the real time resource usage and realtime performance monitoring Windows 10 can do.  They also show the ability to create data collector sets, this allows for collecting data over time for comparison basis.  The guys also show how to install, monitor and manage printers and print jobs, respectively.   All these tools are not additional tools but built in tools to demonstrate the completeness of Windows 10 to help the technician support this operation system.",

00:00:19.550\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today,\nwe're continuing on with some Windows 10,\n\n4\n00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.680\ntalking about configuring and\nof course, installing Windows.\n\n5\n00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.800\nWhat we're taking a look at,\nof course, is a part two,\n\n6\n00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.590\nand we talk about\nmonitoring Windows as well.\n\n7\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.703\nThere's a lot of tools available for\nus, and who better to help us than Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:30.703 --> 00:00:31.265\nWes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:32.125\nWes, welcome back.\n\n10\n00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:35.675\n>> Thank you, sir, as always, good to be\nhere with ITProTV crew, and that's right,\n\n11\n00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:37.183\nwe're coming back with a part two.\n\n12\n00:00:37.183 --> 00:00:39.275\nWell, cuz I talked a lot in the first one,\nand\n\n13\n00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:43.035\nwe didn't really get through everything\nthat we needed to talk about.\n\n14\n00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:46.135\nIn the first episode, part of this\nepisode I guess you could say,\n\n15\n00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:48.805\nis we talked about Event Viewer.\n\n16\n00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:49.925\nWalk you through Event Viewer, and\n\n17\n00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:54.140\nsetting up what are known as event\nsubscriptions as well as Task Manager.\n\n18\n00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.150\nIf any of that seems foreign to you,\njump back and watch that episode, and\n\n19\n00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.330\nwe'll see you back here after you do.\n\n20\n00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.380\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna move on to a couple of\n\n21\n00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.240\nadditional technologies that we\nneed to be aware of for the exam.\n\n22\n00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.970\nThose technologies, what are they?\n\n23\n00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.020\nWell, one is known as Resource Monitor,\nand\n\n24\n00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.185\nthe second one is known\nas Performance Monitor.\n\n25\n00:01:13.185 --> 00:01:14.572\nLet's go ahead and get started, and\n\n26\n00:01:14.572 --> 00:01:17.679\nwe're gonna jump right in, we're gonna\nstart with the Resource Monitor first.\n\n27\n00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.599\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and jump down\nto my little search field here, and\n\n28\n00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.998\nI'm gonna type resmon, right, resmon.exe.\n\n29\n00:01:25.998 --> 00:01:29.880\nYou say well, Wes, wait a second, you said\nyou were gonna show us Resource Monitor.\n\n30\n00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.870\nWell, resmon is the way that you\ncan launch up the Resource Monitor.\n\n31\n00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.582\nNow this, one of the reasons that I\nlike the Resource Monitor is it's what\n\n32\n00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:42.410\nactually shows me all of\nthe cores within my CPU.\n\n33\n00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.755\nWell, I have to jump back and correct\nsomething that I said in the last episode.\n\n34\n00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:49.930\nCuz I told you, that by default,\nyou cannot see.\n\n35\n00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.140\nIn fact, I didn't say that by default,\n\n36\n00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.520\nI said that you can't see the cores\ninside of the new performance menu,\n\n37\n00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.870\nor I guess you'd say performance tab,\ninside of Task Manager.\n\n38\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.448\nNow, that's not technically correct.\n\n39\n00:02:02.448 --> 00:02:07.027\nIf I right-click on this, I can change\nthe graph to, notice how it says,\n\n40\n00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:10.790\nlet me right-click on that, make that\na little easier to see, zoom in there.\n\n41\n00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.830\nNotice how it says Change graph to,\nand right now by default,\n\n42\n00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.030\nit's Overall utilization.\n\n43\n00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.400\nIf I change it to Logical Processors,\nyou can change it back.\n\n44\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.970\nSo I wanna make sure that I corrected that\nbecause typically, I don't use this view.\n\n45\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.400\nBut that certainly doesn't mean\nthat it doesn't exist there, and\n\n46\n00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.680\nthat you cannot configure it that way, so\ndefinitely kind of have to correct that.\n\n47\n00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.850\nNow, that being said,\nnow we've got Resource Monitor, all right?\n\n48\n00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.260\nWhen we look at Resource Monitor,\n\n49\n00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.220\none of the things that I like about\nthis is it gives you an overview.\n\n50\n00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.677\nIt gives you an overview, and it shows\nyou the process and applications that\n\n51\n00:02:42.677 --> 00:02:46.469\nare running and what they are consuming\nwhen it comes to the four horsemen, right?\n\n52\n00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.590\nCPU, memory, disk, and network, right?\n\n53\n00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.270\nWe've got the CPU here.\n\n54\n00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.890\nEverybody knows what the CPU is,\nI can look at its total utilization,\n\n55\n00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.750\nI can find out what applications\nare using the majority of my CPU,\n\n56\n00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.960\nsame thing with the memory,\nsame thing with disk IO and your network.\n\n57\n00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.200\nBut here's something that I really\nlike about the Resource Monitor.\n\n58\n00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.630\nIf I wanna know across the board,\nhow much resources an application or\n\n59\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.975\nprocess is using, it's okay, all I\ngotta do, in fact, we'll use this one.\n\n60\n00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:21.815\nI'm almost certain,\nnot completely certain, but\n\n61\n00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:25.645\nI think that is the Windows Defenders\nengine right there that's running.\n\n62\n00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:28.405\nAnd if I select that,\nI want you to notice something.\n\n63\n00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:33.265\nIf I expand out these categories\non the overview disk,\n\n64\n00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:38.825\nin this case, network and memory,\nwhat is it that we're looking at here?\n\n65\n00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:41.860\nWell, we're actually looking\nat a filtered version, right?\n\n66\n00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.221\nI could see that when I select\nsomething here in this list,\n\n67\n00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:48.983\nit automatically filters that out.\n\n68\n00:03:48.983 --> 00:03:52.645\nIt takes everything out of the list and\nshows me how much CPU, how much memory,\n\n69\n00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:56.440\nhow much disk, and\nhow much network utilization is happening.\n\n70\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.020\nAnd if I keep it selected and I switch\nover to CPU, it puts it right at the top.\n\n71\n00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.540\nAll right, and\nif I expand this out, sure enough,\n\n72\n00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.880\nthat's the Windows Defender service,\nI thought what that was.\n\n73\n00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.130\nGotta love the names on the background,\n\n74\n00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.390\nthey certainly don't match up\nwith the software that's running.\n\n75\n00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.000\nNotice it's not really doing anything\nwith associated modules or handles or\n\n76\n00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.480\nanything, and again,\nI can see what is currently going on.\n\n77\n00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.925\nNow I will tell you the other thing\nI want you to be aware of too,\n\n78\n00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:27.330\nis I can stop the real-time\nmonitoring if I want.\n\n79\n00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.430\nI can select Processors here.\n\n80\n00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.145\nBut I also want you to know\nthe Resource Monitor configuration files.\n\n81\n00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:36.720\nI'm gonna go ahead and save setting as.\n\n82\n00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.400\nAnd I'm gonna save it to the desktop, and\n\n83\n00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.870\nI'm just gonna do test here because\nthis might come up on the exam, and\n\n84\n00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.760\nthis is one that sometimes we\ndon't really see that much.\n\n85\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.570\nSo I'm gonna right-click on this file that\nit just created, and I'm gonna zoom in,\n\n86\n00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.350\nand I want you to know that file\nextension for the exam, .ResmonCFG, okay.\n\n87\n00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.390\nPlease know that that's\na configuration file for\n\n88\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.290\nyour Resource Monitor,\njust in case it comes up on the exam.\n\n89\n00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.420\nIt's pretty straightforward when it\ncomes to Resource Monitor, I like it,\n\n90\n00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.090\ngives you good heads up, real-time view.\n\n91\n00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.580\nAnd the overview option, keep in mind,\nyou can filter these down what you want.\n\n92\n00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.390\nNotice that when I deselect that or\nclear that check mark, goes back, and\n\n93\n00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.800\nit shows me what everything is doing\nin these four categories here.\n\n94\n00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.480\nAgain, Desktop Windows Manager, if I\nwanna see what that's doing, I select it,\n\n95\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.050\nand again,\nnotice how it filters everything down.\n\n96\n00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.970\nSo I do like it because of the fact\nthat unlike the performance tab\n\n97\n00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.010\ninside of Task Manager, this can give\nyou a filter, that filters it across\n\n98\n00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.940\nall of the components that\nwe wanna monitor, all right?\n\n99\n00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.660\nSo that's Resource Monitor.\n\n100\n00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.415\nThe next one we have is\nPerformance Monitor.\n\n101\n00:05:44.415 --> 00:05:51.730\nThough, you can launch this up with\na perfmon, all right, and .exe.\n\n102\n00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.733\nThis isn't an MSC,\nit isn't a Microsoft management consult,\n\n103\n00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:59.970\neven though you can add it,\nby default, perfmon is an executable.\n\n104\n00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.630\nThat's one way you can get to it.\n\n105\n00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.520\nThe other way you can get to it is by\nright-clicking on your Start icon,\n\n106\n00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.000\nchoosing Control Panel > System and\nSecurity,\n\n107\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.510\nscrolling down to Administrative Tools.\n\n108\n00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.990\nThen you also have\nthe Performance Monitor right here.\n\n109\n00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.580\nSo just a couple different ways,\nyou never know text-based answer.\n\n110\n00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.670\nThey might not give you the shortcut.\n\n111\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.560\nYou might have to take\nthe scenic approach, so\n\n112\n00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.720\nI would know the scenic\napproach just in case.\n\n113\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.610\nMany different ways to get to them, know\nif you know different ways, all right.\n\n114\n00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.710\nNow, let's go ahead, and\nwe'll go through our Performance Monitor.\n\n115\n00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.490\nNow the first thing we wanna talk about,\na little bit, is our interface, okay.\n\n116\n00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.360\nIf we go to the Performance Monitor,\nhere's our interface.\n\n117\n00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.220\nAnd by default,\n\n118\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.390\nthe first thing that we see here is\nthat we got a line graph, all right.\n\n119\n00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:52.250\nNow this line graph here has only\na single counter added to it.\n\n120\n00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.230\nWe'll get to the counters\nhere in just a second.\n\n121\n00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.710\nBut what we see here is a real-time\nanalysis of the performance\n\n122\n00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.420\nof what's known as the processor\npercentage, right.\n\n123\n00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.550\nHow much time is the processor\nbeing utilized, right?\n\n124\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.420\nAnd I can see it's spiking here\na little bit but not much.\n\n125\n00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.490\nNow if we focus in on\nthese buttons up here,\n\n126\n00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.630\nwe look at the very first one,\nthat's gonna be View Current Activity.\n\n127\n00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.600\nThat's the default view here.\n\n128\n00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.735\nThe second one is View Data Log,\nand if I was to click this,\n\n129\n00:07:20.735 --> 00:07:25.020\nit'll actually take me to the properties,\nPerformance Monitor properties and\n\n130\n00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.368\nthe source, notice current activity.\n\n131\n00:07:26.368 --> 00:07:29.220\nI don't wanna get too much into that\none cuz we'll come back to it in\n\n132\n00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.360\na second here.\n\n133\n00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.355\nHere's another thing too,\nI have the default, I like the line graph.\n\n134\n00:07:33.355 --> 00:07:36.948\nLine graph, to me,\njust makes a little bit more sense,\n\n135\n00:07:36.948 --> 00:07:40.167\nhowever we can change\nthe default view if we want.\n\n136\n00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:43.707\nYou can see that default view here is\nline, we got the histogram bar, and\n\n137\n00:07:43.707 --> 00:07:44.761\nwe've got reports.\n\n138\n00:07:44.761 --> 00:07:47.694\nLike for instance,\nif you wanna change the way this looks,\n\n139\n00:07:47.694 --> 00:07:51.330\nwe can change it to the histogram, and\nthen what it's gonna give me is just\n\n140\n00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.634\nthis bar and up and down on\nthe percentage, versus the line graph.\n\n141\n00:07:54.634 --> 00:07:59.220\nThe report is gonna be all about text.\n\n142\n00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.040\nAll right?\n\n143\n00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.500\nAnd that's all it really gives you,\nit gives you the text there.\n\n144\n00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.019\nFor me, like I said, I like the line\nbold myself, the line graph.\n\n145\n00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.270\nNow the next one that we have is that\nwe have the ability if we wanted\n\n146\n00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.420\nto add a counter and again we're going\nto look at that because we also gotta do\n\n147\n00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.670\nsomething known as creating something\ncalled a data collector set.\n\n148\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.260\nI'll tell you what.\nWe'll jump in here real quick.\n\n149\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.630\nWe'll add one so\nyou'll see what we're talking about.\n\n150\n00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.490\nWe've already got one for\nthe percent the processor.\n\n151\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.880\nMaybe, for instance,\nwe wanna check out Paging File, right?\n\n152\n00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.760\nWe wanna see pages per second,\nsee if we have enough memory.\n\n153\n00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.680\nMaybe we gotta add some more memory,\nmaybe we need to adjust the Paging File.\n\n154\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.790\nWe'll go ahead, we'll add that from the\ncategory selection on the left-hand side.\n\n155\n00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.840\nChoosing Add adds it to the right-hand\ncolumn, which is the counters.\n\n156\n00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.870\nWe choose OK, and here in a second,\nit should refresh.\n\n157\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.640\nNow we might not be paging, so you might\nnot really see any information here.\n\n158\n00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:57.770\nBut if I decide that I wanna scroll down,\nI can see that.\n\n159\n00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.370\nNo, you can't really see it there.\n\n160\n00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.010\nLet me go ahead and down, there we go.\n\n161\n00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.710\nNow it's a little hard to see here, but\n\n162\n00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.880\nyou can see pages per second is\nnow an added counter in the list.\n\n163\n00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.210\nAnd it really isn't showing\nme which one is which.\n\n164\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.950\nI don't know which one is which.\n\n165\n00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.900\nSo I can make this a little\nbit easier if I want to.\n\n166\n00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:21.050\nWhat I can end up doing is I\ncan delete if I want a counter,\n\n167\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.360\njust by selecting it down here.\n\n168\n00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.590\nIf I choose Delete it's going\nto take processor time out.\n\n169\n00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.850\nBut notice how these lines are running\nreally, really close together, and\n\n170\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.280\nI don't know which one's which.\n\n171\n00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.800\nThat's where the highlighter comes in.\n\n172\n00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.810\nI select the counter that I want to look,\nand I choose Highlighter, and\n\n173\n00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:35.910\nit brings that one out.\n\n174\n00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.830\nAnd it says that's the counter\nthat you're looking at.\n\n175\n00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.730\nNotice the processor will be the one\nthat's in the background this time.\n\n176\n00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.060\nWell, this is the processor time.\n\n177\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.660\nThe one in the background is\nthe paging per second, so\n\n178\n00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.390\nlooks like we've got\nplenty of memory in this.\n\n179\n00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.040\nWe're not doing a lot of paging, and\n\n180\n00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.960\nthat's again one of the benefits\nof using the performance monitor.\n\n181\n00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.050\nAll right, now if I had this set up,\nI could turn around.\n\n182\n00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.310\nI could copy the properties of this,\nand I could save it.\n\n183\n00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:03.850\nIf I wanna save this counter on this view,\nI could do that, right?\n\n184\n00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.620\nWe could turn around, and if we wanted,\nwe could paste the counter list.\n\n185\n00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.080\nAll right, I can turn around and\npaste the counter list if I wanted to, and\n\n186\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.920\nit does just that it pastes it right back\nin there, so that's kinda interesting.\n\n187\n00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.420\nThe other one that we have,\ntoo, this is the properties.\n\n188\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.980\nNow, and again, like I said,\n\n189\n00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.760\ndepending on where you launch these up,\nit could launch up this dialogue box,\n\n190\n00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.550\nlike for instance, you'll see this is\non data If I go back to the, I hover\n\n191\n00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:31.150\nover the view log data it also opens up\nbut it opens up from a different tab.\n\n192\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.180\nSo, it's still the same properties.\n\n193\n00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.190\nYou've got the general option here and we\ncan change some of the display elements.\n\n194\n00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:41.790\nWe could change the size of\nthe histogram bar if we wanted.\n\n195\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.870\nAgain, current activity.\n\n196\n00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.550\nI can actually add or remove counters from\nthis location if I wanted to rather than\n\n197\n00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.300\nhitting the plus button, so\na few different ways that you can do this.\n\n198\n00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.050\nIf you've decided that these two\ncolors are too close together and\n\n199\n00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:57.340\nI can't tell them apart, that's okay,\njust change them and choose Apply.\n\n200\n00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.280\nAnd then as it starts to refresh\nitself I can take the highlighter off.\n\n201\n00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.080\nYou can see that that's now a blinding\nneon green so maybe not the best choice.\n\n202\n00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.340\nSo again and\nthe last thing is the graph, right.\n\n203\n00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.160\nWe can change the style as well\nas the appearance and the color.\n\n204\n00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.060\nSo you do have the ability to modify\nthe performance monitor real time view.\n\n205\n00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.100\nI can also pause this too and\nit would do exactly that.\n\n206\n00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.680\nIt would pause what it's monitoring.\n\n207\n00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.610\nSo we can do that likewise.\n\n208\n00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.860\nBut that's all real-time information.\n\n209\n00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:33.200\nNow we get to something known as Data\nCollector Sets here on the left hand side.\n\n210\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.810\nNow you might hear these in documentation,\nyou might hear the term DCSs.\n\n211\n00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.140\nSame thing, data collector set.\n\n212\n00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.130\nWhat is this?\n\n213\n00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.780\nWell, it's a series of counters or\ntrace events that you want to monitor that\n\n214\n00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.000\nyou've collectively put together,\nand we run them.\n\n215\n00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.780\nNotice that I have my processor time and\n\n216\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.260\nwe added the paging file,\nas far as paging per second.\n\n217\n00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.690\nLet me go ahead and close that down.\n\n218\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.950\nAnd we'll go ahead and do the same thing\nwe'll go ahead and launch Perfmon back up.\n\n219\n00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.282\nAnd I'll go back to that same tab.\n\n220\n00:12:05.282 --> 00:12:10.080\nWell unfortunately the paging file\nthat we were looking at's gone.\n\n221\n00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.330\nWell that's the benefit\nof a data collector set.\n\n222\n00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.000\nWith a data collector set, I can come\nover here and group these together.\n\n223\n00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.440\nNow you have a few different\ntypes of data collector sets.\n\n224\n00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.980\nYou have what are known as user defined.\n\n225\n00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.520\nAnd it's exactly what it sounds like.\n\n226\n00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.450\nYou define what you wanna put in the DCS.\n\n227\n00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.370\nWe also have some system defined ones.\n\n228\n00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:33.270\nThe systems are for diagnostics and\nperformance reports and you can see all of\n\n229\n00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:38.950\nthe trace events that they're\ngonna be looking at, all right?\n\n230\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.520\nYou also have event trace sessions here,\nthese are for components, if you will,\n\n231\n00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.760\ninside of the operating system that\nyou wanna get information for.\n\n232\n00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.910\nFrom if you will the providers or\n\n233\n00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.030\nthe components within the operating system\nthat provide the tracing information.\n\n234\n00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.570\nWe're not gonna worry\nabout that too much and\n\n235\n00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.590\nwe're not gonna worry about\nstart up trace sessions.\n\n236\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.400\nCuz it wants you to know how to create and\nmanage a DCS so\n\n237\n00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.850\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n238\n00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.750\nWe're gonna go back up to user defined and\n\n239\n00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.740\nI've already got a DCS that's\nbeen defined here prior to this.\n\n240\n00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.060\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're going to delete that one,\n\n241\n00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.660\ncuz if we already have that one in here,\nwell then the show's over.\n\n242\n00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.160\nWe certainly don't want that.\n\n243\n00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.400\nI can right click on User Define, and\nI can choose New, Data Collector Set.\n\n244\n00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.120\nI do want you to know that if you're\nselecting a performance monitor and\n\n245\n00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.030\nyou right click and choose New,\nyou can also do the same thing.\n\n246\n00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.150\nSo two different locations\ngets to the exact same place.\n\n247\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.100\nWe'll go ahead and cancel that.\n\n248\n00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.850\nAnd we're gonna go back to User Define.\n\n249\n00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.530\nWe'll choose nNew.\n\n250\n00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:35.540\nAll right.\n\n251\n00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:42.833\nNow, this data collector set,\nwe're gonna call this the ITProTV lab.\n\n252\n00:13:42.833 --> 00:13:46.330\nAll right?\n\n253\n00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.910\nAnd, we've got a couple of options.\n\n254\n00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.530\nWe can create it from a template.\n\n255\n00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.570\nThey say recommended, or\n\n256\n00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.780\neven create it manually I don't\nwant to do what's recommended.\n\n257\n00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.420\nWe're going to sand against the grain\nhere and we're going to go ahead and\n\n258\n00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.590\ncreate one manually so\nwe can show you the individual steps here.\n\n259\n00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.330\nWe're going to choose next.\n\n260\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.070\nNow it asks us what do we want to do?\n\n261\n00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:08.510\nSee Performance Monitor doesn't only\ngather information it can also alert you\n\n262\n00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.900\nto when a certain performance\ncounter's threshold is met.\n\n263\n00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.330\nRight.\nNow I need to be made aware of it.\n\n264\n00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.320\nMaybe it's a production server\nthat I'm running this on and\n\n265\n00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.550\nsomething's going on and\nI need an alert when it happens.\n\n266\n00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.810\nAnd when the CPU utilization hits 100%\nbecause now my database is Discretion, or\n\n267\n00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.730\nwhatever might be the reason, right?\n\n268\n00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:24.850\nI can do that.\n\n269\n00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:25.950\nIn this case, what we're gonna do,\n\n270\n00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.120\nwe're gonna use our traditional\nperformance counters.\n\n271\n00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.450\nWe're gonna say performance counter,\nand we're gonna choose Next.\n\n272\n00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.340\nNotice that the sample interval down\nhere at the bottom, I can change that.\n\n273\n00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.000\nBy default it's in seconds, but it\ncertainly doesn't have to remain that way.\n\n274\n00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.910\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead just for\nthe sake of our show, and\n\n275\n00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:42.219\nI'm gonna change that sample\ninterval down to one second.\n\n276\n00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:47.420\nAll right, then we get the ability\nto add the performance counters.\n\n277\n00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.840\nWe'll add some of the common ones that you\nmight see here guys, again depending on\n\n278\n00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.730\nwhat you're monitoring, your DCS is\ngoing to be unique to your environment.\n\n279\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.650\nIt's also going to be\nunique to exam itself.\n\n280\n00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.720\nI'm going to go ahead, and\nwhat I'm going to do is scroll up here.\n\n281\n00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.140\nVery first one that we're\ngoing to look at is memory.\n\n282\n00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.400\nThey're alphabetic.\n\n283\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.360\nAll right, and you can scroll if you want.\n\n284\n00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.530\nNow, I want you to pay attention to\nwhat happens when I span these out.\n\n285\n00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.640\nYou notice by default\neverything is selected?\n\n286\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.580\nDon't worry about that, guys.\n\n287\n00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.130\nThat's just what the default is.\n\n288\n00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.560\nYou find out what the counter is, and\n\n289\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.380\nin this case it's the one\nwe already used earlier.\n\n290\n00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.910\nPages per second, and then, I choose Add.\n\n291\n00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.900\nNow, notice, that it adds it,\nand its category.\n\n292\n00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.060\nIt's right there, all right?\n\n293\n00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.490\nIf I ended up adding the whole entire\nthing, all of the counters under\n\n294\n00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.140\nthe memory category,\nyou wouldn't have an individual counter.\n\n295\n00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.510\nYou'd just have a little asterisk symbol.\n\n296\n00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.990\nAnd that says, hey, everything\nin this category has been added.\n\n297\n00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.950\nBe careful in doing that,\nbecause you'll get a lot more information.\n\n298\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.180\nAnd that information\nmight not be discernable.\n\n299\n00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.120\nYou’ll say when you have\na lot of counters in here.\n\n300\n00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.721\nYou use a line graph; it’s going to look\nlike a road map to downtown New York.\n\n301\n00:15:49.721 --> 00:15:53.650\nAnd it might not be something\nthat you can really decipher and\n\n302\n00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:57.359\nget any kind of legitimate\nperformance base line out of.\n\n303\n00:15:57.359 --> 00:15:59.710\nAll right, so that's our pages per second.\n\n304\n00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.720\nWe'll go ahead and scroll down them.\n\n305\n00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.552\nI'm gonna use, the next one's\ngonna be Network Adapter, and\n\n306\n00:16:03.552 --> 00:16:05.030\nwe'll do Packets Sent.\n\n307\n00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.790\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nadd this one, all right?\n\n308\n00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.420\nI'm gonna go ahead and add this one.\n\n309\n00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.521\nNotice that it's not adding.\n\n310\n00:16:11.521 --> 00:16:15.312\nLet me show you a little bug that's\nbeen here in Performance Monitor for\n\n311\n00:16:15.312 --> 00:16:17.535\na while and they still haven't fixed it.\n\n312\n00:16:17.535 --> 00:16:21.625\nNotice that the instances of\nthe selected object is grayed out.\n\n313\n00:16:22.715 --> 00:16:24.515\nRight.\nWe have multiple network adaptors in here.\n\n314\n00:16:24.515 --> 00:16:27.459\nWe've got a Bluetooth network adapter,\nwe've got an Ethernet adapter, and\n\n315\n00:16:27.459 --> 00:16:29.100\na wireless adapter, right?\n\n316\n00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.110\nThe reason it's not showing\nis because of the bug.\n\n317\n00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.674\nIf I select Packets Sent,\nnow notice all of the instances populate.\n\n318\n00:16:35.674 --> 00:16:39.550\nAnd I go back to packets per second,\nnow all my network adapters are there.\n\n319\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.730\nIn this case,\nI'm gonna choose All Instances.\n\n320\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.190\nIf you happen to be monitoring a specific\nnetwork adapter for maybe a multi-home\n\n321\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.645\nmachine, you can select the appropriate\nnetwork adapter and add it to the list.\n\n322\n00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.840\nAll right, so that's the next one here,\nand we'll scroll down.\n\n323\n00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.870\nWhat else do we have?\n\n324\n00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.340\nProcessor, all right.\n\n325\n00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.992\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna add,\nactually, I'll tell you what.\n\n326\n00:16:57.992 --> 00:16:59.540\nWe'll go to physical disk first.\n\n327\n00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.430\nWe'll open that up, all right,\nand I'm gonna look for\n\n328\n00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.600\nthe average disk queue length.\n\n329\n00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.142\nNotice here again,\naverage disk queue length?\n\n330\n00:17:07.142 --> 00:17:09.000\nWe're gonna go ahead and add it.\n\n331\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.220\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and add it.\n\n332\n00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.644\nThat bug I told you,\nnotice I don't have any instances here.\n\n333\n00:17:14.644 --> 00:17:18.190\nI'll select above it, and I'm gonna select\nthe same one again, and they populate.\n\n334\n00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.110\nI'm not exactly sure why that happens.\n\n335\n00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:21.720\nI don't expect that to be on the exam.\n\n336\n00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.720\nBut it is a bug that's been\nin Performance Monitor, and\n\n337\n00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.030\nI've seen it going all\nthe way back to Windows 7.\n\n338\n00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.640\nAll right, so we'll add that one.\n\n339\n00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.810\nScrolling down in the list,\nwe get us another one here.\n\n340\n00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:34.040\nLet's see, we'll enter that same\nprocess or time percentage,\n\n341\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.230\nprocessor time if you will.\n\n342\n00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.740\nWe'll select that one, we'll choose Add.\n\n343\n00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.070\nWe'll add one more here.\n\n344\n00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.280\nShould be just above TCP/IP.\n\n345\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.390\nShould be System, I believe.\n\n346\n00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.752\nYep, right, just above TCP/IP.\n\n347\n00:17:47.752 --> 00:17:49.640\nWe'll open that up.\n\n348\n00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.140\nAnd I will tell you that some\nof them don't have an instance.\n\n349\n00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.270\nWhy?\n\n350\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.040\nWell, I only got a single CPU.\n\n351\n00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.785\nSo there's not really\nanything else to select here.\n\n352\n00:17:57.785 --> 00:18:01.350\nSo processor queue length, notice that\nit doesn't have an instance selected.\n\n353\n00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.510\nChoose Add.\n\n354\n00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.058\nThe reason I tell you about the bug is,\nthat one added just fine, and\n\n355\n00:18:05.058 --> 00:18:07.182\nyou might say, well,\nwhat happened to the other ones?\n\n356\n00:18:07.182 --> 00:18:12.840\nThis one didn't have any instances of\nan object, and it added itself just fine.\n\n357\n00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.640\nJust pay attention.\n\n358\n00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.136\nIf it doesn't add,\nselect the one above it and\n\n359\n00:18:16.136 --> 00:18:19.215\nthen re-select whatever\ncounter you're looking for.\n\n360\n00:18:19.215 --> 00:18:22.030\nAll right, and\nwe'll go ahead and choose OK.\n\n361\n00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.868\nNow, at this point,\nwe could finish it, and\n\n362\n00:18:24.868 --> 00:18:28.322\nthat's okay, but\nI want to show you where the logs go.\n\n363\n00:18:28.322 --> 00:18:30.730\nLet me go ahead and choose,\nactually, kinda funny.\n\n364\n00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:33.270\nThe logs go right there in\nthe interface under Reports,\n\n365\n00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.112\nbut I'm gonna show you\nwhere they're stored.\n\n366\n00:18:35.112 --> 00:18:35.960\nWe'll choose Next.\n\n367\n00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.100\nAnd notice the root directory,\nthe system drive, perf logs, admin,\n\n368\n00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.970\nin this case it's under the name\nof the DCS that you named it.\n\n369\n00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.160\nAnd we'll choose Next, and\nthen it gives me the option to run as.\n\n370\n00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.310\nWe're gonna run it as the default,\n\n371\n00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.180\nyou could change the context\nto which this runs.\n\n372\n00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.290\nI could start this data\ncollector set right now,\n\n373\n00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.420\nand it's gonna start\ncollecting that information.\n\n374\n00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.320\nOf course, we're not gonna do that.\n\n375\n00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.674\nWe're gonna choose Finish so\n\n376\n00:18:57.674 --> 00:19:01.060\nwe can show you what it looks\nlike when it's in the list.\n\n377\n00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:06.234\nAll right, now I have the ITProTV lab DCS.\n\n378\n00:19:06.234 --> 00:19:09.390\nNow all I have to do is right-click\non it and I can choose Start.\n\n379\n00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.271\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nchoose Start.\n\n380\n00:19:12.271 --> 00:19:15.350\nAnd I'm gonna just fire up\na couple of applications.\n\n381\n00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.555\nI don't really have too\nmany applications on this.\n\n382\n00:19:18.555 --> 00:19:22.719\nJust want to see if I can generate\na little bit of information here.\n\n383\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.269\nAll right.\n\n384\n00:19:34.269 --> 00:19:36.235\nWe should probably left that persistent.\n\n385\n00:19:40.424 --> 00:19:42.244\nAll right, so we'll let that go ahead and\n\n386\n00:19:42.244 --> 00:19:45.500\nwe'll just generate a little\nbit of information there.\n\n387\n00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.060\nAnd then what I'm gonna do here\nis I'm gonna come back and\n\n388\n00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.153\nI am going to right-click and\nchoose Stop, okay.\n\n389\n00:19:54.153 --> 00:19:59.122\nNow, once the data collector set has been\nstopped, it grabs that information, right,\n\n390\n00:19:59.122 --> 00:20:03.295\nit stores it down in that root directory\nthat we were telling you about, but\n\n391\n00:20:03.295 --> 00:20:08.410\nas far as the graphical user interface,\nit's now under Reports and User Defined.\n\n392\n00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.490\nAnd I can expand out User Defined.\n\n393\n00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.810\nUnder User Defined, you might have\nmultiple data collector sets.\n\n394\n00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.790\nIn this case, I've got this one right\nhere, and by default, there it is,\n\n395\n00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:19.370\nClient01.\n\n396\n00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:26.500\nNow, notice that we only put, what,\none, two, three, four, five counters,\n\n397\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.910\nall right, five counters in this list, and\nwe generated a little bit of activity.\n\n398\n00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.060\nNot much, but enough so\nyou could see what's going on.\n\n399\n00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:38.730\nIf you have tons of these, and I don't\nknow what the threshold is here, but\n\n400\n00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.020\nif you have a bunch of these, you might\nnot be able to read this information.\n\n401\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.170\nRemember your highlighter.\n\n402\n00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:47.937\nNow I can show you that if I select, for\ninstance, average disk queue length.\n\n403\n00:20:47.937 --> 00:20:51.877\nWell, I don't know, is that a light blue,\nan even lighter blue, is it a dark blue,\n\n404\n00:20:51.877 --> 00:20:53.070\nis it a purple?\n\n405\n00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.140\nMaybe I'm color blind.\n\n406\n00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.060\nI don't know what that information is.\n\n407\n00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.670\nI go up here and choose highlighter and\nit highlights and\n\n408\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.310\nbrings it to the forefront,\nthe one that you're looking at.\n\n409\n00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.070\nWhat's really good too\nis if you run this and\n\n410\n00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:08.740\nsomebody has left this for a line graph\nand you want to change it, go ahead.\n\n411\n00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.340\nIt doesn't have to be\nrunning in real time, right.\n\n412\n00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.710\nWe can do Area and\nyou get a few extra options.\n\n413\n00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.170\nYou can see here, we get stacked area, and\n\n414\n00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:24.230\nwe also if we want general report\ninformation, we can have that as well.\n\n415\n00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.850\nAll right.\nSo\n\n416\n00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:31.500\nthat is a little bit about\nyour performance monitor.\n\n417\n00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.760\nNow, there's a couple of other things\nthat they call out on the exam.\n\n418\n00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.730\nOne of the next things that they talk\nabout is managing printers, all right?\n\n419\n00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.170\nWhen it comes to managing printers,\n\n420\n00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.670\nthere are a few different\nways that we can do this.\n\n421\n00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.130\nWe can do this in the Control Panel,\nand you can do this locally or\n\n422\n00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.470\nyou can also do this with\nthe print management option.\n\n423\n00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:52.970\nWe're gonna go ahead and show you through\nprint management inside of Windows.\n\n424\n00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.190\nSo what I'm gonna go ahead and do is we'll\ngo ahead and install a printer right?\n\n425\n00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.650\nThey say configure, install and\nconfigure, and then manage the printer.\n\n426\n00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.470\nSo we're gonna go ahead and right-click.\n\n427\n00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:01.680\nWe're gonna choose Control Panel.\n\n428\n00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.698\nWe're gonna choose Hardware and Sound.\n\n429\n00:22:04.698 --> 00:22:09.010\nAnd we're gonna do Devices and Printers.\n\n430\n00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.940\nAll right.\n\n431\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.368\nNow, by default, I can manage\nthe printers right from here, right.\n\n432\n00:22:13.368 --> 00:22:17.340\nAll I gotta do is right-click on it,\nI can choose Printer Properties if I want.\n\n433\n00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.470\nAnd I can manage various\naspects right here.\n\n434\n00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.560\nKnow that for the exam, all right?\n\n435\n00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.130\nI can also add a printer\nby clicking this button.\n\n436\n00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:30.880\nNow, if this is a printer that supports\nthings like WiFi Direct, it can call out.\n\n437\n00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:36.024\nMaybe it's got its own connection,\nyou could see in this list, all right?\n\n438\n00:22:36.024 --> 00:22:38.988\nIf you don't and\nyou're not gonna see anything here,\n\n439\n00:22:38.988 --> 00:22:42.476\nwe can choose the printer that\nI want isn't listed, all right?\n\n440\n00:22:42.476 --> 00:22:44.640\nAnd then I can click this.\n\n441\n00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.911\nThis is a newer option in Windows 10.\n\n442\n00:22:46.911 --> 00:22:49.379\nNotice this, my printer's a little older,\nhelp me find it.\n\n443\n00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:51.650\nDoes exactly that.\n\n444\n00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.311\nIf I run that, it's just gonna go back and\ntry to discover it on its own.\n\n445\n00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:56.920\nIt's gonna do what we just launched.\n\n446\n00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.930\nIf it's find the printer in the directory,\nright, based on location or feature,\n\n447\n00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.612\nif you got network\nlocation aware printing,\n\n448\n00:23:02.612 --> 00:23:06.850\nlocation aware printing and it's in Active\nDirectory, you'd be able to find that.\n\n449\n00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.934\nWe can select the shared printer by name.\n\n450\n00:23:08.934 --> 00:23:11.096\nAnd in this case, it's going to be,\nif I choose that,\n\n451\n00:23:11.096 --> 00:23:13.449\nit's gonna be your universal\nnaming convention, right.\n\n452\n00:23:13.449 --> 00:23:16.736\nWe're gonna say whatever\nthe computer name is, right.\n\n453\n00:23:16.736 --> 00:23:17.860\nAnd you can see that.\n\n454\n00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:22.170\nAnd whatever the shared printer name is.\n\n455\n00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:27.866\nWe can use a, if we want as well, if we\nchoose this option, the use printer or\n\n456\n00:23:27.866 --> 00:23:32.951\nadd printer using TCP/IP address or\nhostname, I can choose that.\n\n457\n00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:36.872\nAnd I can either choose Autodetect and\nlet it do it for me or\n\n458\n00:23:36.872 --> 00:23:41.872\nI can say TCP/IP device or web services\nand I could put in the IP address.\n\n459\n00:23:41.872 --> 00:23:42.844\nAll right.\n\n460\n00:23:42.844 --> 00:23:44.790\nSo that's one of the options\nthat we can use.\n\n461\n00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.203\nLet me get back to that list here.\n\n462\n00:23:46.203 --> 00:23:49.016\nIf it's a wireless printer,\nor again, network discovered,\n\n463\n00:23:49.016 --> 00:23:50.671\nwe should've found it in that list.\n\n464\n00:23:50.671 --> 00:23:52.255\nIf I choose this option and choose Next,\n\n465\n00:23:52.255 --> 00:23:55.330\nit's gonna go back to [LAUGH] that\nlist again, so as a heads up.\n\n466\n00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.750\nHere's what we're gonna do, we're gonna\nadd this printer locally, all right?\n\n467\n00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.180\nAdd the local printer with manual\nsettings and we're doing this for\n\n468\n00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.950\nthe purposes of the lab,\nplease keep that in mind.\n\n469\n00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:07.830\nA lot of these printers are very easy\nto discover on your networks today.\n\n470\n00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:11.970\nBut we're gonna go ahead, and we need to\nshow you a little bit of print management.\n\n471\n00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:14.630\nFirst thing that we're gonna do is we\nhave to designate what the port is.\n\n472\n00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.170\nIn this case, since we are just\ndoing this all in software,\n\n473\n00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.320\nwe're gonna use a null local port here,\nand again, like I said, that just for\n\n474\n00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.550\nthe purposes of this lab environment.\n\n475\n00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.470\nWe're gonna choose Next.\n\n476\n00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.490\nNow it says to install the print driver.\n\n477\n00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:30.200\nI will tell you guys,\nmajority of the times, if a print device\n\n478\n00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.910\nis a network based printer, a lot of\ntimes it's got a small application or\n\n479\n00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.230\nprint server on it that\nwill hold its own driver.\n\n480\n00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.346\nWhen you connect to it,\nit'll pull it to the machine,\n\n481\n00:24:39.346 --> 00:24:42.640\nprovided that you have the administrative\nprivileges to do that.\n\n482\n00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.520\nIn this case, we're gonna go ahead and\njust tell it the manufacturer.\n\n483\n00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.270\nI'm gonna say Microsoft, and\nwe use the Open XPS class driver.\n\n484\n00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.820\nI could also search Windows Update as you\ncan see right here, and I'll choose Next.\n\n485\n00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.542\nAll right,\n\n486\n00:24:54.542 --> 00:24:59.850\nnow notice that it says use the driver\nthat's currently installed (recommended).\n\n487\n00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:00.670\nIf you've already,\n\n488\n00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:04.110\nmaybe you've removed this device before,\nit doesn't necessarily remove the driver.\n\n489\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.370\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nreplace the current driver.\n\n490\n00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:08.790\nIt's gonna use the same exact\ndriver that I've used before,\n\n491\n00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.030\nso that's really up to you.\n\n492\n00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.230\nNow let's make it a little\neasier to find this printer.\n\n493\n00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.210\nI'm gonna call this,\nlet's say this is our Dev printer.\n\n494\n00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:17.410\nAll right, we'll chose Next.\n\n495\n00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:19.980\nAnd now it also gives me the option.\n\n496\n00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.480\nDo I want to share this printer so\n\n497\n00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.800\nother people can find it\non the network and use it?\n\n498\n00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.290\nThat's what we're gonna do.\n\n499\n00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.380\nWe're gonna choose yes.\n\n500\n00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.820\nAnd now I can print a test\npage if I wanted to or\n\n501\n00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.790\nI could set it as the default printer.\n\n502\n00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:34.780\nI'm not gonna print a test page, but what\nI am gonna do is finish the wizard up.\n\n503\n00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.082\nWonderful Wizard of Oz.\n\n504\n00:25:38.552 --> 00:25:42.639\nAnd if we scroll down I now have,\namongst all these other printers,\n\n505\n00:25:42.639 --> 00:25:45.090\nI've got a dev printer in here, right?\n\n506\n00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:51.720\nAll right, now let's go ahead and let's\nset up the printer on the other machine.\n\n507\n00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.960\nSo I'm gonna go ahead,\nswitch over to client 02, and\n\n508\n00:25:55.170 --> 00:26:00.830\nwe're gonna show you installing that\nprinter from this side, once it's shared.\n\n509\n00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:06.132\nOkay, so we're right-clicking on\nthe Start icon > control panel\n\n510\n00:26:06.132 --> 00:26:11.620\n> Hardware and Sound > Devices and\nPrinters > Add Printer.\n\n511\n00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.338\nBut it's gonna be a little bit\ndifferent this time when we do it.\n\n512\n00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:18.811\nWe're gonna say the printer that I want\nisn't listed, but I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n513\n00:26:18.811 --> 00:26:23.030\nselect the printer by its name,\nI'm going to use the UNC path.\n\n514\n00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:27.743\nI'm gonna type in // and you could see\nit's cash there, but we'll go ahead and\n\n515\n00:26:27.743 --> 00:26:31.558\ntype in 10.10.10.10/ and\nwe'll say Dev printer and\n\n516\n00:26:31.558 --> 00:26:34.710\nit finds it right away cuz it's shared,\nright?\n\n517\n00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:40.110\nThe UNC path, when you type it in,\nsays, yeah, I already see that printer.\n\n518\n00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.430\nLet me go ahead and put it in the list for\nyou and I'll choose Next and\n\n519\n00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.720\nnotice that it's\nconnecting to the printer.\n\n520\n00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.250\nAll right,\nyou've successfully added the printer and\n\n521\n00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.230\nit tells me where it's located.\n\n522\n00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:51.562\nAnd I could choose Next.\n\n523\n00:26:51.562 --> 00:26:55.020\nAll right,\nnow I could print a test page, but\n\n524\n00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.663\nhere's one of the things\nthat I wanna show you.\n\n525\n00:26:58.663 --> 00:27:02.413\nNow we're gonna just leave this\nwizard right where it is and\n\n526\n00:27:02.413 --> 00:27:07.010\nI wanna show you that you can manage\nthe printer inside of Windows.\n\n527\n00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:12.010\nOn the exam, don't let them think,\nwalk you into a situation where they\n\n528\n00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:16.840\nsay the least amount of administrative\nefforts, the answer and you install RSAT,\n\n529\n00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.090\nthe remote server administration\ntoolkit just to do print management.\n\n530\n00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:24.120\nThe Windows client natively does print\nmanagement, let me show you what I mean.\n\n531\n00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.430\nWe switch over to our other machine here,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n532\n00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.090\nthere's a couple different\nways that we can do this.\n\n533\n00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:32.800\nOne of them is just by typing\nthe Microsoft Management console,\n\n534\n00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:41.920\nI can do PrintManagement.MSC, and that'll\nlaunch the print management console.\n\n535\n00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.000\nI don't know where it went.\n\n536\n00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:45.348\nTry that again.\n\n537\n00:27:45.348 --> 00:27:50.459\nMaybe I clicked it too fast or\nmaybe I wasn't holding my mouse right.\n\n538\n00:27:50.459 --> 00:27:53.230\n.MSC.\n\n539\n00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.050\nFor some reason it's\ngiving me a hard time.\n\n540\n00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.740\nDoesn't wanna launch so we'll go ahead,\n\n541\n00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.040\nthank goodness we've got\nanother way to launch this.\n\n542\n00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.305\nI do want you to know that\nMicrosoft management console,\n\n543\n00:28:01.305 --> 00:28:06.920\nI have to find out why that's not actually\nworking the way we want, lovely Windows.\n\n544\n00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.700\nWe'll go to System and\nSecurity > Administrative Tools, and\n\n545\n00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.480\nthen somewhere in this list we\nshould see Print Management.\n\n546\n00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.270\nWe'll go ahead and run that.\n\n547\n00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.930\nAnd that's what it should've done\nthe first time, [LAUGH] honestly,\n\n548\n00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:22.320\nI'm not exactly sure why it\nwasn't launching the second time.\n\n549\n00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.000\nBut anyways, we are there now, all right?\n\n550\n00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.590\nJust took a longer trip,\nlonger time to get to our destination.\n\n551\n00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:36.330\nAll right, so if I select over here on the\nleft-hand side, if I select all printers,\n\n552\n00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.648\nnotice I have that dev printer,\nshows up right away, all right?\n\n553\n00:28:39.648 --> 00:28:43.320\nIf I right-click on that dev printer,\n\n554\n00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.220\nI've got a series of options that\nallows me to manage this printer.\n\n555\n00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.380\nNotice I can open the printer queue,\nright?\n\n556\n00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.350\nWe'll get back to that print\nqueue here in a second.\n\n557\n00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:54.150\nBecause what I wanna do, is,\nI wanna right-click and pause the printer.\n\n558\n00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.790\nNotice that it says that\nthe queue status is paused.\n\n559\n00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:57.790\nAll right?\n\n560\n00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.110\nLet's show you that we\nare managing this printer.\n\n561\n00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.370\nLet's switch back over and\nlet's print our test page.\n\n562\n00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:04.780\nNow when I do this,\n\n563\n00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:09.590\nit's gonna slide out just beneath my\nhead here on the right-hand side.\n\n564\n00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:14.620\nWhen I say print test page, look what\nhappens here on the lower right-hand side.\n\n565\n00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.520\nPrinter's paused All right?\n\n566\n00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:20.110\nWhen I say print test page, look what\nhappens here on the lower right-hand side.\n\n567\n00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:22.939\nWhen I say print test page,\n\n568\n00:29:22.939 --> 00:29:28.600\nlook what happens here on\nthe lower right-hand side.\n\n569\n00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.590\nAnd what does this give\nme the ability to do?\n\n570\n00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:35.370\nWhen I say print test page, look what\nhappens here on the lower right-hand side.\n\n571\n00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:40.640\nI can right-click on this and if I wanted\nto, I could right-click, choose Pause.\n\n572\n00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.150\nIt's already paused, ll so\nI don't have to worry about that.\n\n573\n00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.910\nI could choose Restart,\nI could choose cancel, or\n\n574\n00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:47.930\nI could even choose properties, right?\n\n575\n00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:51.210\nIf I choose Properties, it'll show me.\n\n576\n00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:53.510\nNow this isn't the properties\nof the printer.\n\n577\n00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:56.280\nPlease understand,\nthat's a little bit different, all right?\n\n578\n00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.150\nThis is the properties of the print job.\n\n579\n00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:03.500\nAnd I can see what the data type is,\nwho the owner was, when it was submitted.\n\n580\n00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.200\nAnd I can set it to a priority if I want,\nright?\n\n581\n00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:11.180\nI'm not gonna change anything there,\nbut notice the print queue.\n\n582\n00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:15.230\nLet's see if we can go back and\nwe can unpause that, right,\n\n583\n00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.160\nwe'll resume printing.\n\n584\n00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.790\nAnd we'll go back to the print queue and\nlook at there, it's gone, right?\n\n585\n00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.930\nI also have the ability\nif I wanted to as I could\n\n586\n00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:28.140\nchoose the properties from right\nhere if I wanted to, right?\n\n587\n00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.790\nSo there's a couple different things\nwith this interface that you can do when\n\n588\n00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:31.370\nyou right-click.\n\n589\n00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:34.110\nNotice the properties there and\nif I decide that I wanna right-click and\n\n590\n00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:38.450\nI wanna manage sharing, [LAUGH] notice\nit brings you to the same location.\n\n591\n00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:39.370\nJust a different tab.\n\n592\n00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.520\nSo you get the option here that you\ncan modify things like your printer\n\n593\n00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.060\npreferences.\n\n594\n00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.850\nPrinting test pages.\n\n595\n00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.940\nRemember the port that we\nset was the null local port?\n\n596\n00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.300\nWell, I can see that right here and if,\nwell, Wes, you set the printer up and\n\n597\n00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:56.550\nyou set it up wrong, it needs a COM port,\nit needs one of your communication ports\n\n598\n00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.485\nor for whatever reason it needs\none of the old LTP ports.\n\n599\n00:30:59.485 --> 00:31:02.670\nWell, you have the ability that you\ncan change that after the fact.\n\n600\n00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.020\nNow, this is the other thing\nthat's kind of cool too.\n\n601\n00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.670\nI can do time restrictive printing.\n\n602\n00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:11.410\nI could say, well, this printer is only\ngonna be available from this time,\n\n603\n00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:12.930\nall right, and\nI could set a priority on it.\n\n604\n00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:17.840\nAgain, you could add things\nlike your separator pages here,\n\n605\n00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.820\nyou can do full print management\non any one of the printers.\n\n606\n00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.590\nI can do that on any one of\nthe printers in this list.\n\n607\n00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:29.028\nSo you get the ability to do full\nprint management from the print\n\n608\n00:31:29.028 --> 00:31:32.221\nmanagement console inside of Windows 10.\n\n609\n00:31:32.221 --> 00:31:34.080\n>> All right, Wes, well, thank you for\n\n610\n00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.687\nhelping us out again on taking a look\na little bit more about monitoring but\n\n611\n00:31:37.687 --> 00:31:39.977\nI believe were gonna have\nto go to a part three.\n\n612\n00:31:39.977 --> 00:31:44.100\nBecause we still have plenty of\ndifferent tools out there to help us.\n\n613\n00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.590\nBut remember what you\nalso saw in this episode.\n\n614\n00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:50.600\nWe took a look at using the resource\nmonitor as well as the performance monitor\n\n615\n00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.930\nand also using data collector sets.\n\n616\n00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:54.380\nResource monitor, performance monitor,\n\n617\n00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.040\ngreat real time event type of things\nthat we have to keep track of.\n\n618\n00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.880\nBut overall, though, if you need\nto actually compare that against\n\n619\n00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.660\nsomething else using those data collector\nsets are gonna be also the key here too.\n\n620\n00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.450\nSo make sure you go back and understand\nthese things before you get into the exam.\n\n621\n00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:14.140\nAlso, of course, printers are usually\na big part of any Windows exam, and so\n\n622\n00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.590\nyou wanna make sure that you do\nhave those concepts down and\n\n623\n00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:20.090\nmake sure that they do\nnot confuse you at all.\n\n624\n00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:24.056\nMake sure you know the difference between\nmanaging that print job versus managing\n\n625\n00:32:24.056 --> 00:32:26.944\nthe printer itself in terms of\nthe printer properties too.\n\n626\n00:32:26.944 --> 00:32:30.406\nSo those are all key elements when\nyou're actually getting ready for\n\n627\n00:32:30.406 --> 00:32:33.757\nthat 70-698 exam,\ncuz it's really gonna help you out too.\n\n628\n00:32:33.757 --> 00:32:36.990\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n629\n00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:40.160\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n630\n00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.150\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n631\n00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.923\n>> Stay tuned right here for\nmore Windows 10 episodes.\n\n632\n00:32:44.923 -->

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.120\nI'm you host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.670\nAnd in today's episode we continue\nwith our Windows 10 series.\n\n6\n00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.900\nMore of that coming at you.\n\n7\n00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.920\nJoining us in the studio again today\nto lend his expertise on that topic,\n\n8\n00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.150\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.050\nWes, welcome back, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.070\nSo glad to have you.\n\n11\n00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.270\nWhat are we gonna learn today?\n\n12\n00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.030\n>> That's right.\n\n13\n00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.210\nI have talked a bunch.\n\n14\n00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.110\nWe're working on a small miniseries here,\nand\n\n15\n00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.540\nwe're coming back with\nmore monitoring Windows.\n\n16\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.650\nThat's right,\npart three in monitoring Windows.\n\n17\n00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.550\nIn a couple of the other parts\nhere that we have, if you will,\n\n18\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.380\nwe've talked about things like the\nperformance monitor, the resource monitor.\n\n19\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.090\nWe've looked at Task Manager.\n\n20\n00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.550\nWe've got a few more that we need to\nlook at so that we can pretty much\n\n21\n00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.000\nwrap up monitoring Windows, if you will,\nand so you'll be prepared for the exam.\n\n22\n00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.180\nThe next one that we're gonna jump\ninto is what's known as indexing.\n\n23\n00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.450\nIt's one of the things they\ncall out in the exam objectives\n\n24\n00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.730\nin 7698 is configuring indexing options.\n\n25\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.220\nLet me go ahead, let's dive right in here.\n\n26\n00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.480\nAnd I've got a file on the desktop.\n\n27\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.410\nIt's just BgInfo from Sysinternals.\n\n28\n00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.170\nWe use it all the time.\n\n29\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.640\nYou've probably seen it before.\n\n30\n00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.930\nAnd I'm just gonna use it to demonstrate,\nwell, indexing.\n\n31\n00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.170\nWell, what is indexing?\n\n32\n00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.558\nWell, indexing is actually\nan attribute of the file system, and\n\n33\n00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:27.480\nit isn't turned on on\nall files by default.\n\n34\n00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.280\nBut if you ever maybe launch up\nthe Windows Search and it goes through and\n\n35\n00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.210\nit searches and it searches and then it\nsearches and you get up, you go away,\n\n36\n00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.260\nyou grab some coffee, you come back,\nand you still haven't found that file.\n\n37\n00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.420\nWell, that's because chances\nare the indexing option isn't turned on,\n\n38\n00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.050\non that file.\n\n39\n00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.870\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n40\n00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.830\nIf I right click on this file here,\njust choose properties.\n\n41\n00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.770\nAnd down here at the bottom, we go to\nour attributes, we choose advanced,\n\n42\n00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.930\nyou'll see that there's an option.\n\n43\n00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.470\nThese are some of the extra attributes.\n\n44\n00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.530\nWe talked about the basic\nones in other shows?\n\n45\n00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.580\nRead only, archive, system and hidden.\n\n46\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.890\nWell, there's some extended attributes,\nif you will, here.\n\n47\n00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.460\nIn Windows you have the compression\nattribute and encryption but\n\n48\n00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.550\nyou also have one called indexing.\n\n49\n00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.320\nAnd notice that it says allow\nthis file to have the contents\n\n50\n00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.730\nindexed in addition to\nthe file properties.\n\n51\n00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.070\nWell, that indexing option, what that\ndoes is that it allows me the ability to\n\n52\n00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.350\nfind these files a little bit quicker.\n\n53\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.498\nSo, it improves performance.\n\n54\n00:02:23.498 --> 00:02:28.520\nBut I wanna show you something interesting\nbecause in the context of attributes,\n\n55\n00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.210\ntypically when we assign an attribute,\nthat means that we're applying that\n\n56\n00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.244\nattribute to that file, and for instance,\nwhen we talk about the archive bit.\n\n57\n00:02:37.244 --> 00:02:42.310\nLet me go ahead and I'll move on over\nhere to the desktop real quick so\n\n58\n00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.340\nwe can look at that attrib command that\nwe've looked at in other episodes.\n\n59\n00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.500\nAnd we'll get to the desktop here.\n\n60\n00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.700\nIf we do a DIR,\nthere you'll see that Bginfo file.\n\n61\n00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.620\nWell if I do an a-t-t-r-i-b,\nyou'll notice the archive attributes.\n\n62\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.250\nIn this case we've got a desktop INI file\nthat's hidden by default in file explorer,\n\n63\n00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.560\nif you will, or\nWindows Explorer as it used to be called.\n\n64\n00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.640\nBecause, well, they don't want you\nmessing with it so it's hidden and\n\n65\n00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.870\nit's a system file.\n\n66\n00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.390\nBut remember that the archive\nfile is also here.\n\n67\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.700\nAnd the archive file tells the Windows\nbackup subsystem what to do with the file.\n\n68\n00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.480\nIf the archive bit is present,\nit means if you run this backup,\n\n69\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.180\nyou'd better include this file\ncuz you don't have a copy of it.\n\n70\n00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.800\nBut notice, more importantly,\n\n71\n00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.250\nas we compare it to indexing that\nthe attribute is placed on the file.\n\n72\n00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.880\nIt tells the Windows subsystem what to do.\n\n73\n00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.870\nAnd if I look.\n\n74\n00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.170\nWell, if I do an a-t-t-r-i-b here,\nor the attrib command,\n\n75\n00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.130\nand I put a /?, you could see sets\nan attribute with a plus symbol, and\n\n76\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.340\nI can set read only and I can set archive.\n\n77\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.210\nNotice I can also set I.\n\n78\n00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.170\nIt says indexed file attribute.\n\n79\n00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.780\nBut the index attribute isn't on there.\n\n80\n00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.610\nWell, I want you to remember this for the\nexam cuz this is a little tricky when you\n\n81\n00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.090\nlook at attributes and what indexing is\ndoing for us and then you come to find out\n\n82\n00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.550\nthat when you apply the indexing\nattribute, what does it do?\n\n83\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.650\nWell, let's show you.\n\n84\n00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.370\nLet's go ahead and,\nI'll clear the screen a little bit,\n\n85\n00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.720\nmake this a little bit easier to see.\n\n86\n00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.540\nAnd what we'll do is we'll\ndo an a-t-t-r-i-b and\n\n87\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.080\nwe will go ahead and do a +i and\nthen we're gonna go ahead and\n\n88\n00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.830\nwe're gonna call out that file Bginfo and\nwe're gonna set it.\n\n89\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.250\nNow it really doesn't\nlook like it did much.\n\n90\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.280\nBut if I turned around and I run the\nattrib command one more time, now you can\n\n91\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.560\nsee that the indexing attribute is there.\n\n92\n00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.120\nSo if you're thinking on the exam,\nwhich would be logical deduction,\n\n93\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.290\nlogically deducing what the answer is,\nI can say, well,\n\n94\n00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.490\nif I've got an archive attribute, and\nyou're telling me that that allows me, or\n\n95\n00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.860\nthe backup subsystem to know, hey,\nwe need to keep a copy of this,\n\n96\n00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.590\nthen well certainly the indexing option\nshould help Windows search find it better.\n\n97\n00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.540\nFortunately, it's completely opposite.\n\n98\n00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.630\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n99\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.860\nNotice that we did put, on that file,\nwe put the index attribute.\n\n100\n00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.130\nLet me go ahead and go back to our GUI\nhere, for a second and choose advanced.\n\n101\n00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.719\nAnd I want you to see what happens\nwhen I apply the indexing attribute.\n\n102\n00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.560\nIt's the complete opposite\nof what you might think.\n\n103\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.790\nAnd that's one of the reasons I\njust talk about the command prompt\n\n104\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.810\nin relationship to that\nindexing attribute.\n\n105\n00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.200\nBecause if they give you on the exam, for\ninstance, they give you a little command\n\n106\n00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.300\nprompt and it says you wanna make\nsure that this file is indexed, and\n\n107\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.210\nif we go back to our powershell,\nif that happens to be what is opened,\n\n108\n00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.939\nI might say, well, you know what?\n\n109\n00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:43.301\nThere's the indexing attribute.\n\n110\n00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:46.970\nThat means that it must be ready,\nlike the archive bit, it must be ready for\n\n111\n00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.460\nthe Windows search.\n\n112\n00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.860\nBut I want you to pay attention,\n\n113\n00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.302\none more time,\nto what that says in the switches here.\n\n114\n00:05:54.302 --> 00:05:57.940\nNot content indexed.\n\n115\n00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.900\nExcuse me, if I could speak right.\n\n116\n00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.200\nWhat this is doing is\nsaying don't index it.\n\n117\n00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.680\nSo it's out of all of these\nattributes that we have when we apply\n\n118\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.880\nthe attribute the R that\nmakes it read-only.\n\n119\n00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.210\nWhen we apply the archive bit,\nthat says back it up.\n\n120\n00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.730\nWhen we apply the system file,\nit means Windows file protection,\n\n121\n00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.910\nprotect this,\nthis is part of your integrity.\n\n122\n00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.400\nSo, this is one that does\nexactly the opposite.\n\n123\n00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.110\nYou apply the bit, and\n\n124\n00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.980\nwhen you apply the bit it actually clears\nit and doesn't allow it to be indexed.\n\n125\n00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.090\n>> Well, that's intuitive, Wes.\n\n126\n00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.047\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n127\n00:06:33.047 --> 00:06:37.350\nSo you know, on is off and off is on, so\n\n128\n00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.770\nI just kind of preface indexing with\nthat just because you never know.\n\n129\n00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.400\nIt might be something that\ncomes up on the exam.\n\n130\n00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.160\nNow, there's other ways\nthat we can do indexing.\n\n131\n00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.535\nWe don't have to do the opposite\nof what you might think here.\n\n132\n00:06:48.535 --> 00:06:49.780\n[LAUGH]\n>> With that in mind,\n\n133\n00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.570\nI'm fully convinced at this point\nthat Microsoft is building their\n\n134\n00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.010\noperating systems with\ntest questions in mind.\n\n135\n00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.250\nI see what you're doing Microsoft.\n\n136\n00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.940\nI'm on to you.\n[LAUGH]\n\n137\n00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.140\n>> And that's why we're here.\n\n138\n00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.380\n>> That's right,\nsetting the record straight.\n\n139\n00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.980\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n140\n00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.604\nVery good,\nto set the record straight here.\n\n141\n00:07:02.604 --> 00:07:04.030\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n142\n00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.196\nshow you a little bit about more\nefficiently working with indexing options.\n\n143\n00:07:08.196 --> 00:07:12.050\nSo I'm gonna just right click on our\nlittle start icon there and we'll go\n\n144\n00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.540\nto our quick links menu and we're gonna\nbasically launch up the control panel.\n\n145\n00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.489\nAll right.\nNow this is one that's buried and\n\n146\n00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:21.915\nyou can go clicking in front of a door,\nin front of a door, in front of a door,\n\n147\n00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:22.950\nto open another door.\n\n148\n00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.790\nOr you can just make it easy and you can\nswitch back to more like what used to be\n\n149\n00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.340\ncalled a classic view and\njust go to large icons.\n\n150\n00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.830\nLarge icons for\npeople like me who have four eyes.\n\n151\n00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.065\nAnd you'll see that there's this\nIndexing Options option here.\n\n152\n00:07:35.065 --> 00:07:36.720\n[LAUGH] That's redundant.\n\n153\n00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.790\nAnd we'll go ahead and launch this up.\n\n154\n00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.070\nNow notice that it tells you right away,\n\n155\n00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:46.310\nit says well there's a little over\n2,800 items that are indexed.\n\n156\n00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.060\nAnd what we can do.\n\n157\n00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.588\nKeep in mind, let's step back for a second\nand say why would we even be doing this?\n\n158\n00:07:51.588 --> 00:07:55.611\nWell, it helps the Windows search\nengine find that file quicker.\n\n159\n00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:57.184\nBut there is a drawback to it.\n\n160\n00:07:57.184 --> 00:08:01.891\nAlright, if I decide that I want to\nindex every file in the file system,\n\n161\n00:08:01.891 --> 00:08:05.510\nis that going to help\nme optimize my search?\n\n162\n00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.560\nNo, right?\n\n163\n00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.090\nSo you have to be careful with this.\n\n164\n00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.540\nIf you're optimizing it by indexing,\ndon't index everything, right?\n\n165\n00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.450\nYou don't need to search system file,\nwell, maybe you do.\n\n166\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.910\nMaybe you're an IT admin.\n\n167\n00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.730\nThere's no right or wrong way here,\nbut if you index everything,\n\n168\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.990\nyou're still searching the entire\ndirectory for that one file.\n\n169\n00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.130\n>> So you really need to use\nthis as your quick links.\n\n170\n00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.660\nThis is stuff I use the most.\n\n171\n00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.490\nTherefore, I want it to show up very\nquickly when I search for it, and\n\n172\n00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.500\nthat's why I'm going to index it.\n\n173\n00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.330\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n174\n00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.720\nGiving you an example where this\nmight optimize your search,\n\n175\n00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.550\nlike Dan's asking here, maybe I do this on\nthe user profile and I leave it at that.\n\n176\n00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.280\nJust index the user profile,\nso when I fire up or\n\n177\n00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.940\nsomebody logs into this machine,\nand they log into their profile\n\n178\n00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.770\nit's gonna search and it's gonna find\ntheir documents a little bit quicker.\n\n179\n00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:47.630\nSo, you can do that.\n\n180\n00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.200\nYou can also, again, modify the locations.\n\n181\n00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.140\nNotice that by default there's\na lot of stuff that's indexed, but\n\n182\n00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.110\nnot everything's indexed.\n\n183\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.990\nNotice there isn't a check mark\nhere next to local disc C,\n\n184\n00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.590\nbecause if I index local disc C,\nwe're indexing everything, and\n\n185\n00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:07.313\nat the point that you index everything,\nyou're not really speeding anything up.\n\n186\n00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:10.350\n[LAUGH] Yeah, as soon as you've\nchose not to make a choice,\n\n187\n00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.390\nyou still have made a choice.\n\n188\n00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.390\nI hear music song in my head here now.\n\n189\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.805\n>> Geddy Lee is gonna come and get us.\n\n190\n00:09:14.805 --> 00:09:16.410\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n191\n00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:21.570\nSo let me go ahead back up here real quick\nand bring up those indexing options.\n\n192\n00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.680\nNow you do have the another\nset of parameters that you\n\n193\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.360\ncan configure with here in\nthe advanced section and\n\n194\n00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.450\nkeep in mind that the advanced section\nobviously with these little UHC shield you\n\n195\n00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.780\ngotta be an administrator to\nperform this functionality.\n\n196\n00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.540\nAnd so what can I do?\n\n197\n00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.590\nAll right.\nWell, I can also index encrypted files.\n\n198\n00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.060\nWe can also change the location.\n\n199\n00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:48.436\nWe can do troubleshooting, delete and\nrebuild the index if you happen to make\n\n200\n00:09:48.436 --> 00:09:53.170\ntoo many choices here and you realize that\nhey man, that didn't do me any justice.\n\n201\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.900\nIt certainly didn't optimize anything.\n\n202\n00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.040\nThat's okay.\nJust rebuild it, and\n\n203\n00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.890\ntake it back to the defaults.\n\n204\n00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.370\nYou can also include different file types.\n\n205\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.920\nAnd you can see, it indexes everything.\n\n206\n00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.080\nYou can do the properties,\nyou can do the file contents.\n\n207\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.640\nIf new extensions come out here,\nI can also add them here.\n\n208\n00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.270\nSo, again, you get the ability\nto optimize your search engine.\n\n209\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.210\nAnd I say search engine, let me be careful\nbecause I'm not talking about Google,\n\n210\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.110\ndefinitely not talking about Bing or\nanything like that.\n\n211\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.020\nI'm talking about the search\nfunctionality inside of Windows.\n\n212\n00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.880\nNow the other things we have\nto look at is some security.\n\n213\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.780\nOne of the things that they want you to\ndo on the test is they want you to be\n\n214\n00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.380\nable to monitor and do a little\nconfiguration inside of Windows Defender.\n\n215\n00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.540\nNow, Windows Defender has two interfaces.\n\n216\n00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.450\nIt's got a newer interface that we're\ngonna look at first because Microsoft\n\n217\n00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.990\nloves the new features in an exam\nenvironment, so you need to be aware of\n\n218\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.390\nthose, then we're gonna look at\na little bit of the old interface.\n\n219\n00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.570\nBut maybe you've seen it before,\n\n220\n00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:53.370\ngoing all the way back to Windows 7\nwith the Microsoft Security Essentials\n\n221\n00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.920\ncuz essentially today,\nthat's what Defender is.\n\n222\n00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:02.120\nMicrosoft said, okay, no more separate\ninstallation of MSE, or Microsoft Security\n\n223\n00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.140\nessentials, let's go ahead and bundle\nthat into Windows Defender and now you've\n\n224\n00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.300\ngot both of them in a single interface and\nthey don't look any different.\n\n225\n00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.420\nThere's no separation there.\n\n226\n00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.720\nNow, we go back to my computer here and\n\n227\n00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.580\nif, I know my head's kinda covering\nit up here, but all the way\n\n228\n00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.880\ndown in the lower right hand corner is\nthis new action center notification icon.\n\n229\n00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.180\nIf I click that, action center as a pane\nwill slide out from the right and\n\n230\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.820\nI can choose all settings.\n\n231\n00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.700\nNow, this is your new interface.\n\n232\n00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.460\nIt's different than the traditional\ncontrol panel that we're\n\n233\n00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.260\nprobably used to and have been going all\nthe way back to really Windows Vista,\n\n234\n00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.440\nwhen it comes down to it,\nand even farther.\n\n235\n00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.570\nBut we have to be aware of this.\n\n236\n00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.440\nSo I'm going to go ahead.\n\n237\n00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.090\nI'm going to go over to security option.\n\n238\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:43.760\n>> It really is.\n\n239\n00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.460\nIt's simplistic.\n\n240\n00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.550\n>> I don't like it.\n\n241\n00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.250\nYou don't like simplicity, right?\n\n242\n00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.930\nWe gotta make it overly complicated,\nDan says.\n\n243\n00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.110\nWell, they sometimes-\n>> No, it is real nice.\n\n244\n00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.610\nI enjoy the new interface\nthat they put on Windows 10.\n\n245\n00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.060\nIt is a whole lot easier to peruse,\nmuch more intuitive.\n\n246\n00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.070\nI know they do a lot of things that\naren't intuitive like what we were\n\n247\n00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.010\njust talking about.\n\n248\n00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:01.990\nThis is not one of them.\n\n249\n00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.650\nThe interface is very, very nice.\n\n250\n00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:04.680\n>> It really is.\n\n251\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.690\nNow you can find things.\n\n252\n00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.220\nAnd like Dan said, the intuitive nature\nof it was kind of hard to find stuff in\n\n253\n00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.900\nWindows 8.1 when you first jumped into it,\nand Windows 8 even before that.\n\n254\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.700\nAll right, so do keep that in mind.\n\n255\n00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.780\nNow Windows Updates, or not update, but\nwe're gonna go to the security option.\n\n256\n00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.830\nIt's update and security.\n\n257\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.250\nAnd over here on the left hand side,\nyou see we have Windows Update and\n\n258\n00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.590\nWindows Defender.\n\n259\n00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.070\nOkay, now with Windows Defender we've\ngot a few things that we can do.\n\n260\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.773\nAll right, Real-time Protection is\nexactly what it sounds like, guys.\n\n261\n00:12:32.773 --> 00:12:33.900\nI wanna keep this on.\n\n262\n00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.930\nNow, you might wanna keep this on\nif you got a third-party vendor\n\n263\n00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:37.780\nthat you're using.\n\n264\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.410\nThat's okay,\nyou can certainly turn it off but\n\n265\n00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:44.510\nI would always have something that\nprovides you with real-time protection.\n\n266\n00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:49.160\nIn fact, I believe you'll see the action\ncenter notify you, if I turn this off and\n\n267\n00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.900\nit's not really notifying, and there it\nis, and it kind of slides in from the side\n\n268\n00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.318\nthere, and it says well wait a second,\nyour virus protection isn't on.\n\n269\n00:12:55.318 --> 00:13:03.060\nNow, it will, the Windows security will\nknow that if you've got a third party,\n\n270\n00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.930\nit won't trigger that warning if\nyou got a third party application.\n\n271\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.240\nBut that's a little bit about\nthe real-time protection.\n\n272\n00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.770\nNow we also got cloud-based protection,\nand\n\n273\n00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.870\nthis is something that's becoming more and\nmore popular.\n\n274\n00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.540\nNot just in the Microsoft land,\nbut in a lot of the vendor right?\n\n275\n00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:21.300\nCan you imagine all, if I'm a vendor,\nif I'm a security vendor, and\n\n276\n00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.260\nwe have hundreds of thousands\n\n277\n00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.110\nof our products across the world\nthat are sitting there grabbing and\n\n278\n00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:31.360\nscraping these different viruses and\ndocumenting them and cataloguing them.\n\n279\n00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.750\nWell, they're local to the machines,\nright, and if they're not,\n\n280\n00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.090\nwhat are they doing?\n\n281\n00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:39.170\nWell they're taking and they're submitting\nthat up to the cloud and you have this\n\n282\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:45.030\ncollective database of all of these\ndifferent types of definitions.\n\n283\n00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.720\nAnd because of that, you can become\naware of things like zero-day\n\n284\n00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.590\nexploits a lot quicker because somebody\nwill probably have it before you do.\n\n285\n00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.440\nHopefully, if not there's really\nnothing you can do about that.\n\n286\n00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.390\nBut at least you get the benefit\nof sending those samples to\n\n287\n00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.445\nMicrosoft up in the cloud and\nthis generates a larger pool of knowledge,\n\n288\n00:14:04.445 --> 00:14:07.145\nand we can identify those viruses quicker.\n\n289\n00:14:07.145 --> 00:14:09.595\nNow we also have exclusions.\n\n290\n00:14:09.595 --> 00:14:14.145\nWhen you add an exclusion,\nyou're saying don't include this file.\n\n291\n00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.955\nAnd I just went ahead and\nclicked that little link there.\n\n292\n00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:19.625\nLet me do that a little slower there,\na little add an inclusion, or\n\n293\n00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:21.460\nexclusion, excuse me.\n\n294\n00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.730\nAnd I can say, excludes files,\nfolders, file types, or even process.\n\n295\n00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.830\nI can say, now this executable,\nI don't want you to flag it as bad.\n\n296\n00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.560\nJust go ahead and turn a blind eye to it.\n\n297\n00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.930\nWhere might this come in handy?\n\n298\n00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.870\nAll right, here at ITProTV,\n\n299\n00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:40.730\nwe've got some subject matter experts that\ndeal with a lot of software that sometimes\n\n300\n00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:45.310\nis recognized by your malware\nsoftware as being malware.\n\n301\n00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.810\nAnd what does it do?\n\n302\n00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.480\nIt flags it, it quarantines and\nif you got a default action and\n\n303\n00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.610\nit's a high level alert,\nwhat does it do, it discards it.\n\n304\n00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.330\nWell if you need those files and\nyou know those files aren't bad and\n\n305\n00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.880\nyou trust them,\nyou might put a folder exclusion, or\n\n306\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.550\nyou might do an individual file or even\na process or even file types themselves.\n\n307\n00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:06.480\nSo that's a great thing, to be able to\nconfigure that, and it makes sure that\n\n308\n00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.600\ncertain locations If you trust the files,\ntrust the folders, trust the processor,\n\n309\n00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.330\nthe executable, you can mark them\nas benign or, if you will, they're\n\n310\n00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.590\nnot harmful to your computer and again\nWindows Defender will turn a blind eye.\n\n311\n00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.670\nNow, this is another thing that I\nreally like about the new interface.\n\n312\n00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.290\nDan mentioned how intuitive it is.\n\n313\n00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.750\nWell, he's absolutely correct.\n\n314\n00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:32.010\nIf you look here,\nI know exactly what the version is.\n\n315\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:33.290\nI know what the client is.\n\n316\n00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.040\nThe engine.\n\n317\n00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.230\nI know the definition\ndatabase that I have, right?\n\n318\n00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:39.700\nI know the NIS system,\n\n319\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.660\nthe Networking Inspection System,\nI know what the version is of that.\n\n320\n00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.800\nI know the engine,\nI know all this information, so\n\n321\n00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.570\nif I do get a virus, well, I can find out.\n\n322\n00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.630\nI can go up to Microsoft knowledge base,\nand say, compare them to these numbers.\n\n323\n00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.960\nAnd say, hey,\nhas this machine been updated in a while?\n\n324\n00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.410\nMaybe it hasn't been connected to\nthe network for a little bit, right?\n\n325\n00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.588\nMaybe it's not connected to\nthe network now when I login.\n\n326\n00:15:58.588 --> 00:16:02.253\nWell, I can check that versioning number\nand I can compare it to the database\n\n327\n00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:05.016\ndefinitions that they have\nup on Microsoft's website.\n\n328\n00:16:05.016 --> 00:16:07.868\nAnd I can find out if I need to update.\n\n329\n00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:12.910\nNow, one of the things I like is so far we\nhave been using Windows Defender, right?\n\n330\n00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.610\nBut notice this little icon down here.\n\n331\n00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:20.520\nAll right, Microsoft is really good at\nkeeping two technologies alive, right?\n\n332\n00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.430\nIt's one of the reasons we have\nPowerShell and we have command prompt.\n\n333\n00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.240\nNow we don't have two\ncommand line interpreters.\n\n334\n00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.790\nNow they gotta manage and\nmaintain two of them.\n\n335\n00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.550\nWell, this kind of gives you\nsome of the old interface.\n\n336\n00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.110\nAnd this is what the Microsoft\nsecurity essentials, well,\n\n337\n00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.870\nlet's see here, maybe it, you know what?\n\n338\n00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.670\nLet me show you guys, I forgot about that.\n\n339\n00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:44.110\nThat is a bug in one of the older builds,\nso you guys can see this here.\n\n340\n00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.580\nYou can still get to Windows Defender,\nand I'm gonna show you this, but\n\n341\n00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.040\nnotice it says Windows Defender.\n\n342\n00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.140\nYou go to launch it and it says.\n\n343\n00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.930\nCannot find the specified path or file.\n\n344\n00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.030\nYou may not have\nthe appropriate permissions.\n\n345\n00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.370\nThat is a bug in the interface, okay?\n\n346\n00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.290\nI still want you to know about it,\nbut it is there nonetheless.\n\n347\n00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.500\nSo how do we get to Windows Defender?\n\n348\n00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.470\nLet's go the old scenic approach.\n\n349\n00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:07.480\nWe're gonna go right-click on our start\nicon, we're gonna choose Control Panel.\n\n350\n00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.682\nDown here at the bottom you got\ngood ol trusty Windows Defender.\n\n351\n00:17:12.682 --> 00:17:16.700\nAll right,\nnow if you have Windows version 10 1511.\n\n352\n00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.940\nYou won't really have to worry about this.\n\n353\n00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.350\n>> This is just a bad link\nin the user interface then.\n\n354\n00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.480\n>> That's all it is.\n\n355\n00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.390\n>> Some code that slipped by.\n\n356\n00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.120\n>> Yeah that's really all it is.\n\n357\n00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.990\nAnd I'm sure as the updates go and\nprogress they're gonna fix that.\n\n358\n00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.850\nBut you can still get here\nto the older interface.\n\n359\n00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.830\nNow this is what Microsoft Security\nEssentials used to look like, right?\n\n360\n00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.030\nIt's what Windows Defender\nlooks like today and\n\n361\n00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.080\nagain it's basically all\nintegrated into one.\n\n362\n00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:48.060\n>> Now there really isn't too much that we\ncan do here like we used to be able to.\n\n363\n00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.150\nRight?\nIn Settings I can go to Settings and\n\n364\n00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.068\nwell it takes me right back\nto the original place I was,\n\n365\n00:17:53.068 --> 00:17:57.250\nwhich is kinda interesting that that link\ntakes me back to the new interface, but\n\n366\n00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:01.190\nthe new interface doesn't take me\nto the old so figure that one out.\n\n367\n00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.930\nNow, I can customize our scans, right?\n\n368\n00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:06.799\nI can do a quick scan and it scans,\nI was gonna say very quickly,\n\n369\n00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:09.120\nbut that would be obvious, right?\n\n370\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.954\nIt scans common locations where files,\nwhere malware is known to reside.\n\n371\n00:18:13.954 --> 00:18:18.430\nAll right, full scan guys, you know what\na full scan does, it scans everything.\n\n372\n00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.990\nNow the custom scan is essentially\nnothing more than a quick scan\n\n373\n00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.730\nplus whatever you tell it to include.\n\n374\n00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.490\nSo no too big a problem there.\n\n375\n00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.830\nUpdate again, that same information,\nI can see virus definition.\n\n376\n00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.190\nDatabases here.\n\n377\n00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:40.620\nI can do an update if I want to and\nthen history, all right?\n\n378\n00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.708\nNow, this is another exam alert\nI want you to be aware of.\n\n379\n00:18:45.708 --> 00:18:48.960\nNotice that we have quarantine items,\nallow items, and all detected items.\n\n380\n00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.090\nWell, all detected items.\n\n381\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.700\nSo it's not really showing me anything.\n\n382\n00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.980\nYou have to be an administrator.\n\n383\n00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.370\nNotice the View details\nhas a little shield on it.\n\n384\n00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:58.340\nThat's because,\n\n385\n00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.660\nand according to Microsoft,\none of the reasons they explained that\n\n386\n00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.935\nthey require administrative level\nprivileges is because the information\n\n387\n00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:08.320\nthat's shown here about other users\ncould be sensitive information, right?\n\n388\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.410\nThey may not want you to know that.\n\n389\n00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:12.230\nSo they figure if you\nare the administrator,\n\n390\n00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.910\ndoesn't matter if it's sensitive or\nnot, you should have access to it.\n\n391\n00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.580\nSo we don't have anything\ndetected here but\n\n392\n00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.870\nif I did have something here\nI could certainly remove it.\n\n393\n00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.850\nI could apply a default\naction to it as well.\n\n394\n00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.820\nWes, really quickly, are you able to\nright-click on a folder or file and\n\n395\n00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:32.540\nsay scan with Windows Defender,\nunlike many other types of anti-virus?\n\n396\n00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.790\n>> Not really.\n\n397\n00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:38.260\nI've seen some registry modifications\nthat you could do to put\n\n398\n00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.240\npretty much any application\nin your right-click.\n\n399\n00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.050\nI've done it before.\n\n400\n00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.770\nI've actually right-clicked the desktop\nand I've got PowerShell in there and\n\n401\n00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.420\nI can just launch PowerShell.\n\n402\n00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:51.055\nBut not by default,\nyou have to unbreak it, if you will.\n\n403\n00:19:51.055 --> 00:19:54.724\n[LAUGH] So\nthat's a little bit about your indexing,\n\n404\n00:19:54.724 --> 00:19:58.640\nnot your indexing options,\nbut Windows Defender.\n\n405\n00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.375\nThe next one I want to go to is what's\nknown as the Reliability Monitor.\n\n406\n00:20:02.375 --> 00:20:06.325\nNow the Reliability Monitor is another one\nyou've got to kind of go walkabout for.\n\n407\n00:20:06.325 --> 00:20:10.315\nAnd I'm going to go back to category view,\njust so\n\n408\n00:20:10.315 --> 00:20:12.505\nyou guys can see what I mean\nby a door in front of a door.\n\n409\n00:20:12.505 --> 00:20:13.755\nSo here's our utilities.\n\n410\n00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:14.415\nRight?\n\n411\n00:20:14.415 --> 00:20:16.725\nSo I click, I open this door.\n\n412\n00:20:16.725 --> 00:20:18.150\nAnd I go to this door.\n\n413\n00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.198\nAnd then I open another door.\n\n414\n00:20:20.198 --> 00:20:21.738\nAnd then I open another door.\n\n415\n00:20:21.738 --> 00:20:26.240\nAnd then I finally can click\nthis reliability history.\n\n416\n00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.900\nWhen it comes to reliability history,\nguys, this is actually a really,\n\n417\n00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:29.690\nreally cool chart.\n\n418\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.330\nIt's been around for awhile.\n\n419\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.120\nBack in the days of Vista,\nit used to be called the performance and\n\n420\n00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.350\nreliability monitor, and they used\nto all be in computer management.\n\n421\n00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.610\nWhen Windows 7 came out,\nthey decided, you know what?\n\n422\n00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.299\nWe're going to separate these and\n\n423\n00:20:41.299 --> 00:20:44.921\nwe're going to put them in the\nReliability Monitor in the Action Center.\n\n424\n00:20:44.921 --> 00:20:47.790\nWe'll keep Performance Monitor\nwhere it's always been.\n\n425\n00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.640\nNow, why do I make mention of those paths?\n\n426\n00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.490\nWell, Microsoft loves text based answers\nthat have those paths in them, so\n\n427\n00:20:55.490 --> 00:21:00.450\nyou can prove to them or on the exam,\nthat your way around the operating system.\n\n428\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.950\nSo let me just say really quick here,\nwith Control Panel,\n\n429\n00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:05.270\nI wanna show you this one more time.\n\n430\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.050\nI'll open up a separate Control Panel.\n\n431\n00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.720\nNotice we have System and Security.\n\n432\n00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.280\nThat didn't change.\n\n433\n00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:15.880\nBut what does change is it no longer says\nthe Action Center like it has in the past,\n\n434\n00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.850\ngoing up to Windows 8.1.\n\n435\n00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.850\nNow, the Action Center is\nwhat we see right here.\n\n436\n00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.620\nSo it's no longer called\nthe Action Center.\n\n437\n00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.390\nIt's called Security and Maintenance.\n\n438\n00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.130\nSo please remember that on the exam.\n\n439\n00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.340\nIt's just a little tidbit\nthat I want you to know so\n\n440\n00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.720\nthat they don't try to slip\nthat in on you and confuse you.\n\n441\n00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.760\nSo back to the Reliability Monitor.\n\n442\n00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.250\nWe've got quite a few different\nthings that we could look at, right?\n\n443\n00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.960\nIf we look over here\non the right-hand side\n\n444\n00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.810\nwe've got things like\nApplication Failures, right?\n\n445\n00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:48.870\nAnd I've got this information,\n\n446\n00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.290\nwe'll talk about this information\ncoming up here in a second.\n\n447\n00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.890\nBy the way, you can also see this\ninformation inside of Event Viewer, but\n\n448\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.230\nthis gives you a really\ngood quick way to look at\n\n449\n00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:02.170\na specific amount of time\nthe reliability of your machine.\n\n450\n00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:06.450\nWe've got Windows failures, Miscellaneous\nfailures, Warning, and Information.\n\n451\n00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:11.040\nNow, notice that down here\nthis is a context pane, right?\n\n452\n00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.920\nIt isn't populated yet\ncuz I haven't selected anything.\n\n453\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.120\nWe will do that in just a second,\n\n454\n00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.242\nthe other thing I want you to see is\nwhen this graph, this is a bar graph,\n\n455\n00:22:19.242 --> 00:22:24.710\nall right I'm sorry, a line graph [LAUGH]\nand what it does is shows the reliability.\n\n456\n00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:29.540\nThe longer you go on with just these\ninformation level events going.\n\n457\n00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.560\nThat graph will stay all\nthe way up to the top.\n\n458\n00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.350\nThe moment you have errors, warning,\ncritical events it starts to lower.\n\n459\n00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.900\nRight?\nIt's called a stability index and\n\n460\n00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:42.745\nit lowers the stability index, any time\nyou have some kind of instability, right?\n\n461\n00:22:42.745 --> 00:22:46.225\nNow pay attention to the context pane\nwhen I select one of these issues.\n\n462\n00:22:46.225 --> 00:22:52.950\nNotice that the moment I select it,\nI now have information down here, right?\n\n463\n00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.300\nI have critical events.\n\n464\n00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.980\nI have information events.\n\n465\n00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.910\nI can see that this was Microsoft Edge\nthat stopped responding and was closed.\n\n466\n00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.630\nAnd this also gives me the ability\nto check for a solution.\n\n467\n00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:07.580\nThis is called the Problem Reports and\nSolution Center that when I click that,\n\n468\n00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.820\nit'll send the information\nout to Microsoft and\n\n469\n00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.740\nsee if they've come across this issue.\n\n470\n00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.130\nAnd if they resolved it.\n\n471\n00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.520\nNow I can tell you,\na lot of times when I send it it says, no.\n\n472\n00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.910\nThere's not a resolution yet,\nyou need to try it again later.\n\n473\n00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.560\nAll right?\nWell, how do we try it again later?\n\n474\n00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.460\nWell, down here at the bottom,\nyou have a few options here.\n\n475\n00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.770\nSave reliability history,\nview all problem reports, and check for\n\n476\n00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:28.990\nsolutions to all problems.\n\n477\n00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.400\nSo I can view,\n\n478\n00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.450\nif I want to get out of the Reliability\nMonitor, we'll just view all problems.\n\n479\n00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.720\nNow it drops me down, and it tells me,\nhave these things been reported?\n\n480\n00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.270\nAnd has there been a solution to them?\n\n481\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.400\nNotice [LAUGH] they all say report sent,\nbut\n\n482\n00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.110\nI certainly don't see\na solution to any of these.\n\n483\n00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:52.128\nSo we could that again and you can see,\nit's the Problem Reports up there.\n\n484\n00:23:52.128 --> 00:23:54.035\nAll right.\n\n485\n00:23:54.035 --> 00:23:58.540\nNow, tell you what Dan, I don't see\nanything in Windows failures, right?\n\n486\n00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.600\nNotice that the Windows failure is blank.\n\n487\n00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.680\nLet's see here on screen.\n\n488\n00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.890\nWe're gonna create a blue screen.\n\n489\n00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:05.777\nLet's go ahead and do that.\n\n490\n00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:08.446\nWe're gonna use a little cis internals and\nlet's go ahead and\n\n491\n00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:09.841\nsee if we can crash the machine.\n\n492\n00:24:09.841 --> 00:24:10.849\nWe'll give it a second.\n\n493\n00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:12.699\nWe'll let it run its memory dump and\n\n494\n00:24:12.699 --> 00:24:15.114\nhopefully it's not doing\na full memory dump.\n\n495\n00:24:15.114 --> 00:24:17.320\nThat's going to take a little bit.\n\n496\n00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.760\nWe might end up having to use\nthe magic of TV time out.\n\n497\n00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.360\nRight?\nSo we've created a blue screen and\n\n498\n00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:28.050\nhopefully what we'll see is when we\nlaunch back up the reliability monitor,\n\n499\n00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.940\nwe now have another critical event, and it\nshould be right there in Windows failures,\n\n500\n00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.310\nat least that's what we're hoping.\n\n501\n00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.790\nIt might log in application failure,\n\n502\n00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.790\ncuz it was technically\nan application that caused it.\n\n503\n00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.460\nBut we'll see if we can\nfind one here in real time.\n\n504\n00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.110\nSo let me go ahead and get logged back\nin with our super secret password here.\n\n505\n00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:48.670\nAnd when we get to log back in,\n\n506\n00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:51.850\nagain remember we're going to\nbasically right-click the Start icon.\n\n507\n00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.350\nWe're gonna go to Control Panel,\nthen from System and Security, System and\n\n508\n00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.750\nMaintenance, and then we're\ngonna expand out Maintenance and\n\n509\n00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:02.100\nclick that View Reliability link.\n\n510\n00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:07.450\nThere we go, Control Panel,\nSystem and Security, Security and\n\n511\n00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:12.880\nMaintenance, and as we wait for\nit to think about it.\n\n512\n00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.100\nWe'll expand that out and\ngo back to the review reliability history.\n\n513\n00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:16.810\nThere we go.\n\n514\n00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:18.800\nActually we've got a couple of failures.\n\n515\n00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.490\nSometimes it's hard to get that,\n\n516\n00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:24.740\nI almost said millennial,\nmiscellaneous failure to happen.\n\n517\n00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:29.120\nWell I've scored today I can break\nWindows with the best of them apparently.\n\n518\n00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.220\nSo notice here that we've\ngot a Windows failure and\n\n519\n00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.200\nwe've got a miscellaneous failure\nthat wasn't there before.\n\n520\n00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.890\nWell that's what I was\nhoping to generate here and\n\n521\n00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:42.340\nif I look, I can see technical details.\n\n522\n00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.050\nRight?\nIt says\n\n523\n00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:44.920\nWindows was not shut down properly.\n\n524\n00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.470\nI would almost venture to say that\nthis is what's known as a critical\n\n525\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:53.340\nkernel power failure,\nregardless of what the error is.\n\n526\n00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.129\nLet's go ahead and see.\n\n527\n00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.710\nShut down, yep.\n\n528\n00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.140\nWasn't properly shut down and\nagain, unexpected.\n\n529\n00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.240\nSo it's a critical kernel power failure.\n\n530\n00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.520\nAll right, now the other one here,\nwe've got Windows stopped working.\n\n531\n00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.830\nThere we go, rebooted from a bug check.\n\n532\n00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.380\nThat's what I wanted to see.\n\n533\n00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:13.060\nAnd we can look and we can see\nthat the crash memory data there.\n\n534\n00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.120\nNow what's interesting is this is the\ncrash memory data that was on that blue\n\n535\n00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.370\nscreen that I'm sure you had\ntime to write down, right?\n\n536\n00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:23.760\nWith all these zeros in here,\nas well as the memory dump right?\n\n537\n00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.850\nAnd we can see where\nthe memory dump was saved.\n\n538\n00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.820\nAnd if we got something like\nthe diagnostic and recovery tool kit,\n\n539\n00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.060\nwe can throw that in\nto the crash analyzer.\n\n540\n00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.470\nAnd kinda find out what the problem is.\n\n541\n00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:36.230\nKnow what the problem is, it's\nan application called, it's not my fault.\n\n542\n00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.730\nSo, Dan, when it comes down to it\nthat's pretty much what we have.\n\n543\n00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.590\nWe've looked at the indexing options.\n\n544\n00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:45.530\nWe've looked at the managing your clients\nsecurity through Windows Defender and\n\n545\n00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.620\nwe also took a second to look\nat the reliability monitor.\n\n546\n00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.510\nRemember these on the exam\nbecause they might come up.\n\n547\n00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:52.470\n>> Pretty cool stuff, though Wes.\n\n548\n00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.330\nThey've got a lot of nice new features\nin our Windows operating systems.\n\n549\n00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:59.420\nAnd they continually refine them to\nmake them better and better products.\n\n550\n00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:04.050\nMaking it more useful for us as\nworkstation support, desktop support,\n\n551\n00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:04.860\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n552\n00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.910\nWhatever you get into as\nyou enter into your career.\n\n553\n00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:11.320\nWes, that being said, it looks like\nwe've come to yet another great episode.\n\n554\n00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.160\nThe end is here.\n\n555\n00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.050\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n556\n00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.310\nWes, thank you for stopping by.\n\n557\n00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:18.960\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n558\n00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.600\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n559\n00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.310\n>> And we'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:17.850\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.470\nAnd in today's episode, I hope you're\nready for it, cuz it's more Windows 10.\n\n5\n00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.680\nJoining us back in the studio again today,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.530\nWes, welcome back, sir.\n\n7\n00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.255\nSo glad to have you.\n\n8\n00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:28.261\n>> Thank you, man, I appreciate it.\n\n9\n00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.360\n>> How's it going today?\n>> Man, it's going great.\n\n10\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.020\nIt's great to be here, as always.\n\n11\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.060\nThat's right, we're gonna get into\nanother topic that they call out.\n\n12\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.920\nBy the exam objectives,\nthey call them advanced tools.\n\n13\n00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.277\nWe're hoping that by the end of this\nepisode, they won't be so advanced.\n\n14\n00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:42.490\nAnd you're gonna know a little bit more\nabout them should you come up with,\n\n15\n00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.995\nyou know, come across any of\nthose questions on the exam.\n\n16\n00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:48.382\nOne of the first things that we're gonna\nbe looking at is something known as\n\n17\n00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:49.546\nconfiguring services.\n\n18\n00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:53.875\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead for a second here,\nand I'm gonna try and attempt to\n\n19\n00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:58.426\nlaunch the graphical user interface, cuz\nI do want to look a little bit at that.\n\n20\n00:00:58.426 --> 00:01:01.676\nBut as we know, or maybe you don't,\nyou'll be prepared,\n\n21\n00:01:01.676 --> 00:01:06.226\na lot of times they don't ask you all the\neasy graphical user interface questions,\n\n22\n00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:08.375\nthey do ask you about the command line.\n\n23\n00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.224\nSo we're gonna get into those as well.\n\n24\n00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:13.314\nSo services, services.msc.\n\n25\n00:01:13.314 --> 00:01:15.075\nIt's also in Computer Management,\nby the way.\n\n26\n00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.679\nAnd again, just kind of throwing these\nout there just in case they say, okay,\n\n27\n00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.350\nwhich of these allows you\nto configure services?\n\n28\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.763\nChoose three.\n\n29\n00:01:21.763 --> 00:01:23.045\nThey like to do stuff like that.\n\n30\n00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:26.575\nMaybe they say choose four, and\nyou'd say, Command Prompt, PowerShell,\n\n31\n00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:29.250\nServices console, and Computer Management.\n\n32\n00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.431\nWell, we want you to be able\nto be ready for the exam.\n\n33\n00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:34.401\nHowever I will tell you that if\nI was in Computer Management,\n\n34\n00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:36.098\nnotice that they're identical.\n\n35\n00:01:36.098 --> 00:01:37.990\nSo we're not gonna spend\ntoo much time there.\n\n36\n00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.760\nNo real need to.\n\n37\n00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.590\nNow, what can I do with these services?\n\n38\n00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.470\nWell, services, let's define\nwhat a service is first, right.\n\n39\n00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.940\nServices are typically background\nprocesses that happen, and\n\n40\n00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.000\na lot of times we don't\ninteract with them.\n\n41\n00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.510\nLike a lot of these services here,\nyou can see, their status is Running.\n\n42\n00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.700\nNow, I didn't turn any of\nthese services on, right?\n\n43\n00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.190\nI started the computer up, and\n\n44\n00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.110\nwhen I start the computer up,\nthey're running in the background.\n\n45\n00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.630\nIn other systems, you'll see,\nthey're called by different things.\n\n46\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.600\nLike in Novell, I think they called\nthem NLMs, Novell Loadable Modules.\n\n47\n00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.100\nIn the *nix based systems,\nI believe they call them daemons, right?\n\n48\n00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.050\nThey're just the processes that\ntypically run in the background and\n\n49\n00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.830\nwe don't have any interaction with them.\n\n50\n00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.460\nExcept sometimes you do\nhave to configure them.\n\n51\n00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.600\nSometimes you have services\nthat are supposed to run, but\n\n52\n00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.940\nby default they are disabled.\n\n53\n00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.960\nI'll give you the classic example of one.\n\n54\n00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.960\nUp here at the top, there is\nan Application Identity Service, right?\n\n55\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.690\nI love to use this one, because if\nyou're ever configuring AppLocker, this\n\n56\n00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.510\nis one of the services that you need to\nturn on in order to make AppLocker work.\n\n57\n00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.720\nYou can configure all of your AppLocker\nrules, do everything that you need to do,\n\n58\n00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.860\nand if you don't turn this service on,\nAppLocker does absolutely nothing for you.\n\n59\n00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.230\nSo it is good to know a little bit about\nthe graphical user interface here.\n\n60\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.969\nAll right, so what do we have?\n\n61\n00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.770\nWhen we talk about services, these\nprocesses have different startup types.\n\n62\n00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.590\nThey have three that have been around\nWindows for a long time, right?\n\n63\n00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.538\nThis is the Automatic,\nManual, and Disabled.\n\n64\n00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:01.434\nAutomatic (Delayed Start),\n\n65\n00:03:01.434 --> 00:03:06.217\nI believe this started [LAUGH] a little\nredundancy there, started in Windows 7.\n\n66\n00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:10.716\nSome of you guys might remember how much\nof a resource hog Windows Vista was, so\n\n67\n00:03:10.716 --> 00:03:14.124\nin Windows 7, they tried to\noptimize it a little bit more,\n\n68\n00:03:14.124 --> 00:03:16.460\nmake it a little easier on your machine.\n\n69\n00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.890\nSo let's talk about the three oldies but\ngoodies.\n\n70\n00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.080\nAutomatic, automatic means\nexactly what it says.\n\n71\n00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.490\nThe moment I push the start button or\npower button, I should say,\n\n72\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.540\non the computer,\nit's going to start this service.\n\n73\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.050\nAnd that's where we get this,\nif you can see in the background here,\n\n74\n00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.850\nwhere the status is running, right?\n\n75\n00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.970\nNow, the other one that we have here is,\n\n76\n00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.150\nlet me get back to it,\nis Manual, all right?\n\n77\n00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.580\nWell, what does Manual process mean?\n\n78\n00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.930\nDoes that mean it isn't gonna start?\n\n79\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.000\nNo, that's not what it means.\n\n80\n00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.390\nIt means this service stays shut\ndown until an application or\n\n81\n00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.444\nanother dependency, which we'll look\nat in a second, calls on it, and\n\n82\n00:03:51.444 --> 00:03:54.717\nsays, okay, let's go ahead and\nstart the service then.\n\n83\n00:03:54.717 --> 00:03:58.373\nThat's why you can see, and let me go\nahead and close this down one more time,\n\n84\n00:03:58.373 --> 00:04:01.185\nin the background, this one,\nif I expand this column out,\n\n85\n00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:03.290\nsays Manual (Triggered Start), right?\n\n86\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.280\nNow, the last one that we have,\nif you can see,\n\n87\n00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.490\nis probably pretty obvious on this one.\n\n88\n00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.840\nAnd this is where you might need\nto configure these services.\n\n89\n00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.939\nNotice it says Disabled.\n\n90\n00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.566\nAll right, Disabled means I\ndon't care if an application or\n\n91\n00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:16.017\na component in Windows needs it.\n\n92\n00:04:16.017 --> 00:04:20.448\nLet's say AppLocker, in that case, it uses\nthe Application Identity Service here to\n\n93\n00:04:20.448 --> 00:04:24.029\nlook at the application, compare it\nback to the AppLocker rules, and\n\n94\n00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:28.300\neither restrict it or allow it to run,\nbased on what rules you've got configured.\n\n95\n00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.320\nHowever, if I have it disabled,\nit doesn't matter that AppLocker needs it.\n\n96\n00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.989\nIt says, well, you told me it's disabled,\n\n97\n00:04:33.989 --> 00:04:38.350\nI'm not gonna run regardless of what\ncomponent in the operating system or\n\n98\n00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.090\nmaybe whatever other service\nmight need this, right?\n\n99\n00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.102\nNow, I can also, the other important tab\nI wanna show you is the Dependencies tab.\n\n100\n00:04:47.102 --> 00:04:50.390\nAll right, you can see, at the first one,\nthe first dialog box here,\n\n101\n00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.690\nis the dependencies that\nthis service needs, right.\n\n102\n00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.386\nSo this service will require these\nother services to be running.\n\n103\n00:05:00.386 --> 00:05:02.840\nAnd you can see sometimes\nwhen you expand these out,\n\n104\n00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.340\nthere are a lot of additional services\nthat need to be available and running for\n\n105\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.460\nthe Application Identity Service\nto be running.\n\n106\n00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.360\nFor instance, Remote Procedure Call.\n\n107\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.100\nWhen you look at Remote Procedure Call,\n\n108\n00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.840\njust about everything in your Windows\noperating system relies on that.\n\n109\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.471\nSo you can't disable it.\n\n110\n00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:22.718\nIf you could disable it,\nit'd end up being a bad day at the office.\n\n111\n00:05:22.718 --> 00:05:26.370\nIt'd pretty much crash your\nentire computer, all right.\n\n112\n00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.050\nNow, the other thing that we can do is,\nwe can start, and I'll go ahead and\n\n113\n00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.620\nstart this.\n\n114\n00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.570\nAnd as it starts up,\nyou can see that it says Start, right.\n\n115\n00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.090\nNow it say that it's running.\n\n116\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.710\nAnd if I come back here to\nthe Services console, right, I can see\n\n117\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.770\nnow that it says it's a running process or\na running background service, if you will.\n\n118\n00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.920\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna stop this one.\n\n119\n00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.630\nAnd again,\nI want you to know that for the exam.\n\n120\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.420\nServices console, Computer Management.\n\n121\n00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.650\nBut we also wanna focus a little bit\non Command Prompt or PowerShell.\n\n122\n00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.560\nNow, the next options\nthat we're gonna run,\n\n123\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.220\nlet me go ahead and clear the screen here.\n\n124\n00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.270\nWe're gonna run another oldie\nthat's been around for a bit.\n\n125\n00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.550\nAnd you know what, let me go ahead.\n\n126\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.150\nI kind of forgot something here,\nand I don't want to do that.\n\n127\n00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.160\nCuz I didn't explain the other\noption that we have, and\n\n128\n00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.980\nthat was the automatic delayed start.\n\n129\n00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.901\nI kind of skipped over that one.\n\n130\n00:06:16.901 --> 00:06:20.173\nThe automatic delayed start,\nthis is kind of optimized,\n\n131\n00:06:20.173 --> 00:06:24.970\nan optimized start-up type that says,\nkeep it out of my boot process.\n\n132\n00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.110\nYou need the service, that's fine.\n\n133\n00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.540\nBut it's not a critical\nboot start service.\n\n134\n00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.550\nI don't need it.\n\n135\n00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.890\nSo wait till that's done,\nand then start the service.\n\n136\n00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.340\nNow that we've looked at that,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n137\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.960\nwe're gonna drop down to\nour command-line interface.\n\n138\n00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.870\nAnd what we're gonna do here is,\nlet me get in to my PowerShell here,\n\n139\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.260\nand I'll clear the screen up here for you.\n\n140\n00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.610\nNow, there are times when you need\nto configure your services, right?\n\n141\n00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.710\nWe've got a couple of options.\n\n142\n00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.397\nSo we've got some that have been\ntraditionally in the Command Prompt.\n\n143\n00:06:53.397 --> 00:06:55.429\nWe've got some that\nwill run in PowerShell,\n\n144\n00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:58.380\neven though they've traditionally\nbeen in the Command Prompt.\n\n145\n00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.030\nLet's talk about that first one here.\n\n146\n00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.630\nAnd that's the net option.\n\n147\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.650\nNow, net is a program you can\nuse if you want to start,\n\n148\n00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.690\nstop, pause, and resume your services.\n\n149\n00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.612\nFor instance, we have the print spooler\nthat runs within Windows, right,\n\n150\n00:07:12.612 --> 00:07:16.260\nit's the service that controls the print\nprocess from the moment that use you use\n\n151\n00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.370\nyour little Ctrl+P shortcut\nto bring up the print screen,\n\n152\n00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.190\nto the moment you see the printed\noutput on the print device itself.\n\n153\n00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.870\nIf I want, I can do a net, and\n\n154\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:31.100\nI can do stop, and\nthen I can name the service.\n\n155\n00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.330\nSo in this case,\nwe'll do a net stop spooler.\n\n156\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.010\nNotice that it tells me the principle or\nservice is stopping.\n\n157\n00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.740\nAll right, and if I want to,\nI can start it up again.\n\n158\n00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.230\nJust replace stop with start,\nnet start, space, spooler.\n\n159\n00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.170\nAll you gotta do is be able to spell,\nand we'll choose start.\n\n160\n00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.160\nAnd notice that the service is starting.\n\n161\n00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.310\nNow, notice that I'm in PowerShell.\n\n162\n00:07:54.310 --> 00:08:00.510\nIf I was in Command Prompt,\nI could do the same thing, all right,\n\n163\n00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:06.520\nand I could do a net stop spooler.\n\n164\n00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.080\nNotice how it's stopping\nhere in Command Prompt.\n\n165\n00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.510\nAnd then if I decide to, I could always\nchange this around a little bit, and\n\n166\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.210\nI could do net start.\n\n167\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.540\nAll right, so what do we do?\n\n168\n00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.220\nWe just basically stopped and\nrestarted a service.\n\n169\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.660\nIn this case,\nthere's times when people say, you know,\n\n170\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.190\nI've been trying to print and\nprint's not happening.\n\n171\n00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.140\nRight?\nWell, you can connect to their computer,\n\n172\n00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.190\nyou can fire up a Command Prompt, and\nyou can end up running the net option.\n\n173\n00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.330\nRemember, net start, net stop.\n\n174\n00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.660\nNow, there are other options that\nare available with net stop or\n\n175\n00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.420\nnet in general if you will,\nand that's pause.\n\n176\n00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:44.030\nNow, not every service is gonna\nallow the pause functionality, and\n\n177\n00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.190\nlet me show you that.\n\n178\n00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.378\nSpooler is one that doesn't.\n\n179\n00:08:46.378 --> 00:08:47.769\nSo you have to do your research and\n\n180\n00:08:47.769 --> 00:08:51.010\nfigure out if the service itself will\nallow you to pause the service, right?\n\n181\n00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.129\nSo if I do a net pause and spooler,\n\n182\n00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.860\nnotice that it says, pause, continue,\nor stop is not valid for this service.\n\n183\n00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.170\nNow, technically,\nstop is valid for this service.\n\n184\n00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.270\nI've just shown you.\n\n185\n00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.665\nAll right, so this is a generic output.\n\n186\n00:09:08.665 --> 00:09:11.555\nI make mention of that cuz you guys\njust see, well, what did I do?\n\n187\n00:09:11.555 --> 00:09:13.435\nI ran the net stop, and what did it do?\n\n188\n00:09:13.435 --> 00:09:16.975\nIt said the service is stopping, but down\nhere, it tells you, stop is not valid for\n\n189\n00:09:16.975 --> 00:09:17.995\nthe spooler service.\n\n190\n00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:20.060\nWhat do you mean?\n\n191\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.610\nWell, this is a generic warning,\n\n192\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.990\nit goes out for all of the services\nthat don't support pause or continue.\n\n193\n00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.428\nYou also get the stop option\nin there as well, but\n\n194\n00:09:28.428 --> 00:09:32.610\nit technically isn't true in this case,\nall right, so we can't pause a service.\n\n195\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.360\nThere might be a situation in\nwhich you need to do that, and\n\n196\n00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.190\nthen you can turn around and\nyou would run net resume.\n\n197\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.540\nWell, of course not.\n\n198\n00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.460\nYou actually run continue, all right.\n\n199\n00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.670\nSo net pause and\nthen the service name pauses the service,\n\n200\n00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.770\njust kind of freezes it.\n\n201\n00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:51.245\nAnd net continue and\nthe service name will basically resume it.\n\n202\n00:09:51.245 --> 00:09:53.783\nThe next command that we're gonna look\nat is the Service Control Manager.\n\n203\n00:09:53.783 --> 00:09:58.235\nAnd for the most part, I haven't really\nhad too many problems running traditional\n\n204\n00:09:58.235 --> 00:10:01.225\nCommand Prompt commands\ninside of PowerShell.\n\n205\n00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:04.198\nThere was one time,\nnetsh with a certificate thumbprint,\n\n206\n00:10:04.198 --> 00:10:07.780\nit didn't like PowerShell and\nI had to drop down to the Command Prompt.\n\n207\n00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.965\nLet me show you that this is one that it\ndoesn't really work too well inside of\n\n208\n00:10:11.965 --> 00:10:12.730\nPowerShell.\n\n209\n00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:17.180\nSo if I do an sc and\nI do a query, it looks and\n\n210\n00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:21.410\nit says, well, wait a second, I'm\nlooking for some additional information.\n\n211\n00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.930\nSo let me go ahead and I'll Ctrl+C that.\n\n212\n00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.770\nSo, we'll get out of that there and\nwe'll clear the screen.\n\n213\n00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.025\nAnd what I'm gonna do is drop\ndown to my Command Prompt.\n\n214\n00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:33.927\nAnd if I run the same exact command and I\ndo sc for the service control manager and\n\n215\n00:10:33.927 --> 00:10:35.570\nI do query.\n\n216\n00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.830\nI run that, and then what do we see here?\n\n217\n00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.790\nWell, you see all of\nthe services that are running.\n\n218\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.640\nNow, that doesn't stop me right there.\n\n219\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.630\nI can look at more information if I want.\n\n220\n00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:52.030\nFor instance, if I wanted to see maybe all\nthe drivers that are currently being used,\n\n221\n00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.490\nthat are running, well,\nwe could do something like this.\n\n222\n00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:59.720\nWe can do an sc,\nwe can do a space and a query.\n\n223\n00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.790\nAnd what I can do is state equals.\n\n224\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.730\nNow, let me show you an error here.\n\n225\n00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:09.230\nA lot of times, when you do like\nan equals, you'll have where the, whatever\n\n226\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:14.360\nthe variable is after that, or the option\nwill be butted up next to the equal sign.\n\n227\n00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.690\nIf I did that right here and I ran it,\nit would give me this error.\n\n228\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.980\nSo what it's actually looking for\nis a space right there.\n\n229\n00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.780\nAnd I said start.\n\n230\n00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.974\nI'm gonna type that right there.\n\n231\n00:11:25.974 --> 00:11:28.676\nAnd we're gonna do state= all.\n\n232\n00:11:28.676 --> 00:11:31.210\nAnd when I run this,\nyou'll notice that the information,\n\n233\n00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.689\nthere was a lot more information.\n\n234\n00:11:32.689 --> 00:11:35.187\nNow, I know it scrolled by really,\nreally fast,\n\n235\n00:11:35.187 --> 00:11:38.457\nbut what's happening now is it's\nnot saying just the services,\n\n236\n00:11:38.457 --> 00:11:42.660\nit says give me all the drivers that\nare loaded up and are currently in use.\n\n237\n00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.040\nWell, maybe that's not what you want.\n\n238\n00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.970\nMaybe you wanna just stay\nwith the services itself.\n\n239\n00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.301\nLet me clear our screen out\nhere with our cls command.\n\n240\n00:11:50.301 --> 00:11:51.985\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll try it like this.\n\n241\n00:11:51.985 --> 00:11:57.161\nWe'll do an sc, again, Service Control\nManager there, sc, space, query.\n\n242\n00:11:57.161 --> 00:12:01.256\nAnd the next thing we'll do is type\nequals with a space after it as well, and\n\n243\n00:12:01.256 --> 00:12:04.051\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do service.\n\n244\n00:12:04.051 --> 00:12:07.274\nNow, when we run this, again,\nremember, we're getting the services,\n\n245\n00:12:07.274 --> 00:12:08.790\nwe're not getting the drivers.\n\n246\n00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.510\nSo remember the sc command, again,\n\n247\n00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.678\non the exam as a way to be\nable to find the services.\n\n248\n00:12:15.678 --> 00:12:18.449\nAgain, we're not worried too\nmuch about the drivers here,\n\n249\n00:12:18.449 --> 00:12:21.453\ncuz we're really talking about\nconfiguring just the services.\n\n250\n00:12:21.453 --> 00:12:22.920\nAnd we've seen it in Command Prompt.\n\n251\n00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.910\nLet's go ahead and see if we can do\nthe same thing inside of our PowerShell.\n\n252\n00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.830\nNow, we've got the PowerShell going here.\n\n253\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.590\nAnd if you wanna find out what\nservices are on the machine,\n\n254\n00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.710\nincluding what their current state is,\nyou can always do a Get-Service.\n\n255\n00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:41.510\nAnd if I do a Get-Service here,\nit will give me all of\n\n256\n00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:46.660\nthe services on the machine, whether\nthey are stopped or they are running.\n\n257\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.160\nNow, this is important,\nbecause the names mean a lot here.\n\n258\n00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.170\nAnd you have a display name, which you\ncan use, or you can use its regular name.\n\n259\n00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.467\nWe're gonna go ahead and, I'll tell you\nwhat, we'll start and stop a service.\n\n260\n00:12:58.467 --> 00:13:03.930\nOne that I know is typically\ndisabled by default here.\n\n261\n00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.568\nWe'll do a Start-Service.\n\n262\n00:13:06.568 --> 00:13:10.116\nWe're gonna do a name, all right,\nand I'll tell you what,\n\n263\n00:13:10.116 --> 00:13:12.700\nlet me just kind of\nformat that a little bit.\n\n264\n00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.054\nThere you go,\nnow you can see it a little bit better.\n\n265\n00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:16.438\nLet's go ahead and do Start-Service.\n\n266\n00:13:16.438 --> 00:13:21.279\nWe'll do name, and then for\nm, e it's gonna be WinRM.\n\n267\n00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:25.010\nAnd, well, what did that really do?\n\n268\n00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.330\nThat really didn't do much,\nso now what do I have to do?\n\n269\n00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.574\nDo I have to do a Get-Service and\nscroll through that entire list?\n\n270\n00:13:30.574 --> 00:13:31.320\nWell, no.\n\n271\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.014\nI can do a Get-Service and\n\n272\n00:13:33.014 --> 00:13:37.946\nI can actually filter it as long as I\nknow a little bit about its name, right.\n\n273\n00:13:37.946 --> 00:13:41.750\nSo I can do, for instance,\nI can do a Get-Service.\n\n274\n00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.958\n>> Yeah, Wes,\nthe good thing about PowerShell, though,\n\n275\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.994\nis that as long as you don't have a bunch\nof red text on the screen, typically,\n\n276\n00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:48.387\nyou're pretty safe at that point.\n\n277\n00:13:48.387 --> 00:13:50.540\nBut it never hurts to verify, right?\n\n278\n00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.220\n>> That's exactly it, and\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n279\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.840\nBecause it really didn't show me anything.\n\n280\n00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.190\nI know that I didn't get a red line here,\nright?\n\n281\n00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.498\nIf I would have done something\nwhere it came up like that, well,\n\n282\n00:13:59.498 --> 00:14:00.860\nI know that's not right.\n\n283\n00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.390\nSo how do we do that, right?\n\n284\n00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.130\nAnd also, let's go a little bit farther,\n\n285\n00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:10.440\nhow do we find the service without\nscrolling through everything in the list?\n\n286\n00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.900\nWell, I can go ahead and\nI can do a wildcard here.\n\n287\n00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.150\nI could say name, and\nin this case, I can do a win for\n\n288\n00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.850\nthe first three letters, then an asterisk\nsymbol, right, for a wildcard.\n\n289\n00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.830\nAnd it tells me now\nthe Windows Remote Management has started.\n\n290\n00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:25.590\nAll right.\n\n291\n00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.090\nNow, there's some other things\nthat we can do as well.\n\n292\n00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.070\nNotice that it outputted\nall of the services.\n\n293\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.770\nWell, maybe I just wanna find out\nwhat services are running currently.\n\n294\n00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:35.850\nWell, you can do that too.\n\n295\n00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.180\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll clear our screen here.\n\n296\n00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.680\nAnd we're gonna run a Get-Service.\n\n297\n00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:48.960\nAnd then what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna pipe this out to Where-Object.\n\n298\n00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.500\nAnd we'll put a variable in there.\n\n299\n00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.618\nAll right, we'll do our underscore,\nour dot, we'll do status.\n\n300\n00:14:56.618 --> 00:15:01.123\nAnd then eq, that's equals,\n\n301\n00:15:01.123 --> 00:15:05.975\nand we'll put some quotes here,\n\n302\n00:15:05.975 --> 00:15:09.454\nand we'll do running.\n\n303\n00:15:09.454 --> 00:15:13.450\nWe'll close that off with the quotes,\nand then close everything off here.\n\n304\n00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:15.790\nAnd we'll run this.\n\n305\n00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:21.510\nNow, what this did is it didn't\nshow me every single service,\n\n306\n00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.360\nonly the services that\nare currently running.\n\n307\n00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.870\nSo you do have a way that you can\nfilter through it if you need to.\n\n308\n00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.463\nThe other thing that we can do is\nwe can sort this a little bit too.\n\n309\n00:15:29.463 --> 00:15:34.140\nSo for instance,\nif I do a Get-Service, all right, and\n\n310\n00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:39.219\nthen I pipe this out to a Sort-Object,\nand then I say status.\n\n311\n00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:44.540\nNow the output is gonna make them\na little bit easier to find, right.\n\n312\n00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.260\nI can see that nice, easy dividing line\nbetween what's stopped and started.\n\n313\n00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.790\nSo you also have that\nability to do that as well.\n\n314\n00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:57.758\nSo, when we look at this, Dan, we can\ncontrol all aspects of the services.\n\n315\n00:15:57.758 --> 00:16:01.446\nWe've shown you, in this episode so far,\nwe've shown you how to do this through\n\n316\n00:16:01.446 --> 00:16:04.919\nthe graphical user interface as well\nas defining some of the startup types,\n\n317\n00:16:04.919 --> 00:16:06.980\nshowing you start and stopping it.\n\n318\n00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.610\nBut also showing you that net option\ninside of the traditional Command Prompt.\n\n319\n00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.503\nYou can also run it inside of PowerShell.\n\n320\n00:16:12.503 --> 00:16:17.095\nRemember that the sc command that we ran,\nthe Service Control Manager, that command\n\n321\n00:16:17.095 --> 00:16:21.451\nlikes to run inside of Command Prompt,\nit doesn't do too well with PowerShell.\n\n322\n00:16:21.451 --> 00:16:26.080\nAnd then the last one, we showed you some\nof the ways that PowerShell has native\n\n323\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.602\ncmdlets in them that you can\nuse to start and stop services.\n\n324\n00:16:29.602 --> 00:16:32.796\nAgain, know some of those cmdlets,\nbe aware of them, and be\n\n325\n00:16:32.796 --> 00:16:36.945\naware of some of the things that you can\ndo as far as configuring your services.\n\n326\n00:16:36.945 --> 00:16:40.670\nNow, Dan, I got a lot more to go, but\nI can see Dan over here is telling me we\n\n327\n00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.543\nmight have to go into a part two on this\none, because you let me talk too much.\n\n328\n00:16:44.543 --> 00:16:45.271\n>> That's right.\n\n329\n00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:47.645\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just, enough, already, all right?\n\n330\n00:16:47.645 --> 00:16:48.855\nThe man loves to run his yammer.\n\n331\n00:16:48.855 --> 00:16:50.255\nBut it's for a good reason, right?\n\n332\n00:16:50.255 --> 00:16:51.445\nWe have to learn these things so\n\n333\n00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:56.180\nthat we can effectively administrate our\nWindows environments and pass an exam so\n\n334\n00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.420\nthat we can become administrators\nof Windows environments.\n\n335\n00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.700\nThat being said, Wes,\nwe look forward to seeing you in part two.\n\n336\n00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.320\nWe do thank you stopping by today.\n\n337\n00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.696\nWe thank you guys for\nstopping by, as well.\n\n338\n00:17:04.696 --> 00:17:05.872\nHopefully, you've enjoyed this episode.\n\n339\n00:17:05.872 --> 00:17:09.975\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n340\n00:17:09.975 --> 00:17:10.646\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n341\n00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:11.443\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n342\n00:17:11.443 --> 00:17:20.348\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.184\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:21.160\nwe continue our Windows 10 series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.150\nJoining us back in\nthe studio today again for\n\n6\n00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.000\na part two on advance configuration\nis our good friend Mr. West Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.100\nWest, welcome back, Sir,\nso glad to have you.\n\n8\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.220\n>> Man, it's great to be here with\nITProTV staff, and you're right.\n\n9\n00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.560\nI talk way too much of.\n\n10\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.570\nWe're coming back with a part\ntwo in advance management tools.\n\n11\n00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.480\nWe did have a few other things that\nwe kind of wanted to wrap up, so\n\n12\n00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.200\nthat you'll be prepared for the exam.\n\n13\n00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.310\nOne of the things that we're\ngoing to look at is an oldie, but\n\n14\n00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.850\ngoodie, it's been around for a while.\n\n15\n00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.360\nAnd that is something\nknown as device manager.\n\n16\n00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.430\nSo, tell you what?\n\n17\n00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.070\nBut rather than get into a whole bunch\nof lecture, let's dive right in.\n\n18\n00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.440\nI'm going to log into my\nWindows machine here.\n\n19\n00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.610\nNow, device manager.\n\n20\n00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.927\nI'm just going to go ahead and\nright-click on our start icon,\n\n21\n00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:00.940\nlaunch up device manager.\n\n22\n00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.455\nSo what is it that the device\nmanager does for us?\n\n23\n00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:07.145\nWell, as you might know, and if not,\nwe'll go ahead and tell you,\n\n24\n00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:11.125\noperating systems are typically written in\nhigh level programming languages, right?\n\n25\n00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:15.015\nOur hardware, it doesn't understand\nthat lingo if you will, right?\n\n26\n00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:20.980\nIt only understands the low-level\nmachine code, as far as interacting.\n\n27\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.350\nSo imagine that maybe I'm talking\nto somebody that speaks Spanish.\n\n28\n00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.000\nI would love to be able to\nspeak Spanish fluently.\n\n29\n00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.550\nBut I don't.\n\n30\n00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.050\nSo if we're going to have\na conversation between two people,\n\n31\n00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.280\nmyself speaking English, and\nsomebody speaking Spanish,\n\n32\n00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.980\nI'm going to have to have\na translator in the middle.\n\n33\n00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.670\nAnd then that allows us\nto have a conversation.\n\n34\n00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.060\nWell, that's much the way a driver\nworks inside of your operating system.\n\n35\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.430\nThe high level programming languages\nthat operating systems are written in,\n\n36\n00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.560\nthe driver sits in the middle, and\n\n37\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.390\nit translates calls that come down\nfrom it, basically from the user, and\n\n38\n00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.580\ntranslates it into the machine lingo\nthat our hardware can react to.\n\n39\n00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.440\nWell, that's what\nDevice Manager allows us to do.\n\n40\n00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.230\nAnd the fact that it allows us to\nview the state of our hardware and\n\n41\n00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.350\nwhether our operating system recognizes,\nanalyzes it,\n\n42\n00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.120\nand can communicate\nwith it via the driver.\n\n43\n00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.400\nSo let me show you what I mean here.\n\n44\n00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.720\nIf I expand out, for instance,\n\n45\n00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.660\nthe keyboard, you can see that it says\nthe classic Standard PS/2 Keyboard.\n\n46\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.340\nWell, how does it know that it's\na classic Standard PS/2 Keyboard?\n\n47\n00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.310\nWell, that's because of\nthe driver that's installed.\n\n48\n00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.530\nSo one of the things that I can do\nis I can right click on it, and\n\n49\n00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.500\nyou can see a couple of options.\n\n50\n00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.010\nOptions that you have here, and\nwe're going to look at these, but notice\n\n51\n00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.360\nthe update driver software, install,\nscan for hardware changes, and properties.\n\n52\n00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.210\nAll right, if I go ahead and take a look\nat the properties dialog box, and\n\n53\n00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.470\nI would know this on the exam,\n\n54\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.220\nthis is what this device status lets me\nknow is the driver doing its job, right?\n\n55\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.680\nWe know that the operating system's\nworking because I'm in it, right?\n\n56\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.740\nI know that I have a keyboard here\nbecause I'm typing on it, but\n\n57\n00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.740\nI need to know is it functioning properly?\n\n58\n00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.150\nWell, and we can see that it is.\n\n59\n00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.350\nIt says that it's working properly here.\n\n60\n00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.760\nThe other thing,\nbeing able to manage your drivers.\n\n61\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.090\nWe've got quite a few\ndifferent buttons here.\n\n62\n00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.790\nWe'll talk about each one\nof these individually.\n\n63\n00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.770\nDriver details is a good place to go,\nespecially for\n\n64\n00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.990\nthe exam because what is shows\nyou is where the drivers located.\n\n65\n00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.010\nAnd I really want you guys\nto know this for the exam.\n\n66\n00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.561\nIf they ask where the drivers are located,\nC:/Windows/32 32\\DRIVERS.\n\n67\n00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:13.640\nKnow that for the exam, because that's\nwhere your driver repository is.\n\n68\n00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.290\n>> Least it's short, right?\n\n69\n00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.772\n>> It is.\nIt rolls right off the tongue for sure.\n\n70\n00:03:17.772 --> 00:03:20.050\nNotice that I can also\nsee who the provider is.\n\n71\n00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.090\nIn this case, it's built in.\n\n72\n00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.640\nIt's a built in driver, it's Microsoft.\n\n73\n00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.460\nI can see the file version, which let's\nme know the version of the driver.\n\n74\n00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.310\nSo video drivers, if any of you guys have\nsome nice video cards out there, you know\n\n75\n00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.430\nthat video card drivers are always being\nupdated because the manufacturers realize\n\n76\n00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.160\nthat hey, we can add functionality,\nwe can add improvements to it.\n\n77\n00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.480\nSo as drivers update,\nthey'll put versioning numbers on here.\n\n78\n00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.170\nAnd if you want to find out, well,\ndo you have the current driver?\n\n79\n00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.590\nWell, look at this information and\ngo to the manufacturer's website, and\n\n80\n00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.570\ncompare the two and if they match, well,\nyou know you have the latest and greatest.\n\n81\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.520\nIf not, you get the ability,\nyou can download and install the driver.\n\n82\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.710\nWe'll show you where that's\nat here in a second.\n\n83\n00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.750\nNext thing is updating the driver.\n\n84\n00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.300\nNow if I choose, update driver,\nit takes me to this screen.\n\n85\n00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.160\nLet me show you another way.\n\n86\n00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.490\nThere's always six one half dozen or\nthe other.\n\n87\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.760\nIn Windows here, if I right-click,\nI can choose, update drive, and\n\n88\n00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.270\nnotice it takes me pretty\nmuch to the same location.\n\n89\n00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.600\nWe'll come back to that here in a second.\n\n90\n00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.200\nAll right,\ngetting back to that property screen.\n\n91\n00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.890\nAll right, notice I have some details.\n\n92\n00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.480\nAll right, now you say well,\nthe details, they don't,\n\n93\n00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.820\nthis big old long laundry list of stuff,\nand I don't really care about that.\n\n94\n00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.950\nLet me give you a little hint,\na little tip that's kind of cool.\n\n95\n00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.110\nWhen you want to control the class of\ndriver devices that can be deployed,\n\n96\n00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.910\nlet's say inside a group\npolicy in active directory.\n\n97\n00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.290\nYou need what's known as a class ID.\n\n98\n00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.770\nAnd we'll check it out here.\n\n99\n00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.510\nYou've got hardware IDs, or class GUIT's,\nthe globally unique identifier.\n\n100\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.540\nWell, if I don't know what the GUIT is,\ncheck it out.\n\n101\n00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.180\nI can find it right here, all right?\n\n102\n00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.030\nAnd that is actually\nsaves you a little bit.\n\n103\n00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.550\nThe other thing you can do is to dig\ndown in and find the INF file and\n\n104\n00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.610\ndo a Ctrl f and find the GUIT that way.\n\n105\n00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.040\nThat's it's a little bit easier here.\n\n106\n00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.760\nYou can get some information\nrelated to the hardware.\n\n107\n00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.620\nThe other thing we have are events\nsurrounding the keyboard here.\n\n108\n00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.920\nYou can see some INF files.\n\n109\n00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.290\nAgain, these are drivers, if you will.\n\n110\n00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.040\nI can see that class goo it, and\nI can also see the driver date here.\n\n111\n00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.010\nWe can see the device ID, and you can\nsee it's a P and P, it's a plug and\n\n112\n00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.230\nplay driver.\n\n113\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.220\nAll right, and\nwe can view additional events here.\n\n114\n00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.370\nWe don't have to worry\ntoo much about that, and\n\n115\n00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.840\nI'm going to mention a very bad word here.\n\n116\n00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.550\nThank goodness we don't have to\ndeal with these anymore, but\n\n117\n00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.630\nI can also see things like IRQs, right?\n\n118\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.840\nAnd IO input output ranges.\n\n119\n00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.460\nThank goodness we got plug and play today,\nand we don't have to mess with these.\n\n120\n00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.000\nDan, did you ever have\nto mess with those IRQs?\n\n121\n00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.030\n>> Yeah, Westat's going to give me.\n\n122\n00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.751\nI'm going to have to start talking to\na qualified, like, for psychiatrist or\n\n123\n00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:38.698\nsomething at this point.\n\n124\n00:05:38.698 --> 00:05:41.910\n>> [LAUGH] So Dan, that's absolutely\ncorrect because it was the bane of\n\n125\n00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.780\nexistence having the manually configured\narmor resources you have in the system.\n\n126\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.480\nSo we'll go ahead and\n\n127\n00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.130\nget out of there before we had to get\nsome psychiatric help there for Dan here.\n\n128\n00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.810\nNow, what about, let's go ahead and\n\n129\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.860\nlet's talk a little bit about\nthe driver software itself.\n\n130\n00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.635\nAnd we'll come back to\nsome of those buttons,\n\n131\n00:05:57.635 --> 00:06:01.430\nbecause I do want to talk a little bit\nabout the driver tab within properties\n\n132\n00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.360\nthat you might have to know for the exam.\n\n133\n00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.270\nSo when we talk about driver software, we\nget the ability to update driver software.\n\n134\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.960\nIf you'll see,\nit says search automatically.\n\n135\n00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.670\nAnd I know you guys can read this, but let\nme kind of tell you what's going on here.\n\n136\n00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.280\nNotice it says Windows will search\nyour computer and the Internet.\n\n137\n00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.260\nLet's stop right there, right?\n\n138\n00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.000\nSo what's it doing when\nit searches Windows?\n\n139\n00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.680\nRemember the driver store\nthat I told you about?\n\n140\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.470\nI said I want you guys\nto know where it is?\n\n141\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.650\nWe've seen it from the Properties tab,\nright?\n\n142\n00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.270\nWe looked at Drivers and\nDrivers Details and down in System 32,\n\n143\n00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.000\nwell, it's going to look there first,\nright?\n\n144\n00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.320\nYou have a file repository\nthat's all the plug and\n\n145\n00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.370\nplay drivers that Windows has built in so\nthat if you plug a device in, right?\n\n146\n00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.270\nYou plug the device in, it's going to\nbe recognized by the operating system.\n\n147\n00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.200\nit takes that class GUI and\nthe device ID, it tries to match them.\n\n148\n00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.240\nIt finds it, it says,\nthat's the driver you're looking for.\n\n149\n00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.350\nLet's go ahead and we'll load it\nup here into this driver location.\n\n150\n00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.590\nAnd you'll be able to use your device.\n\n151\n00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.510\nIf it doesn't find a match,\nthen it goes out to Windows update, and\n\n152\n00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.380\nit says okay, Windows update,\nsame thing, same process.\n\n153\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.390\nHere's the class ID or\nthe hardware ID, actually,\n\n154\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.170\nbecause it doesn't have a class ID yet.\n\n155\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.550\nThat's part of the driver side.\n\n156\n00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.500\nSo here's the device ID, do you have\na driver in there that matches?\n\n157\n00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.700\nAnd it looks through, it's repository,\nand if it finds one, it pulls it down.\n\n158\n00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.840\nNow, with video cards and stuff like that,\n\n159\n00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.350\nand your hardware,\na lot of times the driver's going to\n\n160\n00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.090\nupdate faster than they get into\nthat repository on Windows Update.\n\n161\n00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.170\nWell, why is that?\n\n162\n00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.810\nWell, that's because to get a driver\ninto the Windows update, it has to be\n\n163\n00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.570\ntested pretty rigorously through\nthe hardware quality labs with Microsoft.\n\n164\n00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.720\nOnce they know that it's not going to\naffect the kernel if it's operating down\n\n165\n00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.030\nthe lower portions of the kernel\nin the kernel mode, right?\n\n166\n00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.130\nThat's a shared memory space.\n\n167\n00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.760\nDrivers operate down there just like they\noperating system does if a driver decides\n\n168\n00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.790\nit's not going to play nice.\n\n169\n00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:42.770\nWell, guess what?\n\n170\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.885\nIt's going to crash everything\nelse that's in the kernel mode.\n\n171\n00:07:44.885 --> 00:07:48.749\nSo if they decide that hey,\nit works fine, that's okay, if not,\n\n172\n00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:53.592\nit has to be rewritten to work for the\nuser, user mode, driver framework, right?\n\n173\n00:07:53.592 --> 00:07:56.772\nKeeps it in user space,\nrather than in the kernel space.\n\n174\n00:07:56.772 --> 00:08:00.478\nAll right, now I'm not gonna\ngo that route here, right,\n\n175\n00:08:00.478 --> 00:08:02.760\ncuz we wanna show you the other way.\n\n176\n00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.360\nImagine that you do want the latest and\ngreatest functionality and\n\n177\n00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.340\nyou've determined that the driver that\nyou have here in the operating system\n\n178\n00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.080\nisn't the driver that is the latest and\ngreatest and\n\n179\n00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.520\ncurrent that you see up on the\nmanufacturers website but what can you do.\n\n180\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.660\nWell, you can take that version number,\ncompare it and once you've compared and\n\n181\n00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.520\nyou know that yours is outdated,\nyou download the driver and\n\n182\n00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.050\nthat what you say is Browse my computer.\n\n183\n00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.580\nAll right, and you can point it to\nthe location where the driver might be and\n\n184\n00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.760\nthen load it into the system.\n\n185\n00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.200\nNow the other thing that you can do,\nand we're gonna show you this because\n\n186\n00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.830\nI don't really have a driver\nhere per se to show you.\n\n187\n00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.230\nBut I can show you with a lot of\nthe bundled in driver software.\n\n188\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.480\nCuz one of the things they want you\nto know, is being able to analyze and\n\n189\n00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.110\ninterpret some of this information\nhere in device manager.\n\n190\n00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.200\nSo let me go ahead and show you.\n\n191\n00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.470\nSo, just let me pick from a list, right?\n\n192\n00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.590\nWell, here is the standard PS/2 keyboard,\n\n193\n00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.220\nit is already selected so If I was to say\ninstall this, it would already be ready.\n\n194\n00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.910\nYou know your device has\nthe appropriate driver.\n\n195\n00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.910\nBut I'm actually gonna uncheck this.\n\n196\n00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.360\nAll right, now this isn't recommended.\n\n197\n00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.460\nUnderstand this because it\ncan break your machine and\n\n198\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.910\nit can give you a very hard\ntime getting back into it.\n\n199\n00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.430\nBut I wanna show you what happens\nwhen a device doesn't play nice.\n\n200\n00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.270\nAll right?\n\n201\n00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.800\nSometimes they play nice,\nsometimes they don't.\n\n202\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.850\nThis first one that I'm gonna select,\n\n203\n00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.130\nwe're gonna go way back to the 80s,\nall right?\n\n204\n00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.960\nXT, we're talking about\nthe successor to the IBM PC.\n\n205\n00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.440\nThat's how far back we're going, right?\n\n206\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.570\nAnd we're gonna select that,\nwe're gonna choose Next, and\n\n207\n00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.370\nthe update driver warning,\nit's gonna tell you.\n\n208\n00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.350\nYou can see right here guys, right?\n\n209\n00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.950\nIt says installing Installing this driver\nis not recommended cuz Windows can't\n\n210\n00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.150\nverify whether it's compatible\nwith the device that you have.\n\n211\n00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.920\nWell, I know it's compatible,\nI just kinda know that.\n\n212\n00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.610\nI don't need to worry about Windows\non this one, so we're gonna close it.\n\n213\n00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:47.520\nIt's gonna say well,\n\n214\n00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.480\nyou've updated the driver now you have\nto restart your machine, all right?\n\n215\n00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.190\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll let this machine restart.\n\n216\n00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:59.500\nAnd then when the machine boots back up or\nwe can log in, we'll go back to the device\n\n217\n00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.260\nmanager and we'll see if we notice any\nwarnings or any thing is different.\n\n218\n00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.530\nLike I said, sometimes you can install a\ndriver that gives you the functionality of\n\n219\n00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.180\nthe device but it doesn't give you\nfull functionality of the device.\n\n220\n00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.260\nThere might be a warning sometimes.\n\n221\n00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.150\nSometimes you might not\nhave a warning at all.\n\n222\n00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.600\nWe're gonna see which is the case here by\nanalyzing, interpreting a little bit of\n\n223\n00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.060\nthat information that we get\ninside of device manager.\n\n224\n00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.210\nAnd if it seems to work just fine for\nus, then what we're gonna do,\n\n225\n00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.900\nis we're gonna see if Wes here on camera,\ncan break Windows.\n\n226\n00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.090\nSo we're gonna try that.\n\n227\n00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.480\nIt does look like it is booting up here.\n\n228\n00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.380\nSometimes, when it's installing\nthe driver It can take a little\n\n229\n00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.270\nbit to restart the machine as\nit does its reconfiguration.\n\n230\n00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.760\nIt's gotta make sure the driver's loaded\nup, it has the appropriate resources.\n\n231\n00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.590\nSo here we go.\n\n232\n00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.950\nIt looks like it is launched back up.\n\n233\n00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.390\nAnd the first thing I could see,\nI can use the mouse.\n\n234\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.200\nCan I use the keyboard?\n\n235\n00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.590\nI could still use the keyboard, right?\n\n236\n00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.600\nSo, this is a driver that even though\nWindows couldn't verify whether it was\n\n237\n00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.740\ncompatible with your system.\n\n238\n00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.810\nIt is compatible with the system here.\n\n239\n00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.890\nSo we'll let it get logged in,\nwe'll get back to device manager.\n\n240\n00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.730\nAll right, and\nwe'll get back to the keyboard and\n\n241\n00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.010\nnotice I have zero warnings, right?\n\n242\n00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.190\nNothing at all.\n\n243\n00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.900\nAnd if I look, it tells me that\nthis device is working properly.\n\n244\n00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.690\nSo just because Windows doesn't say that\nit can verify or can't verify whether it's\n\n245\n00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.490\ncompatible doesn't necessarily mean\nit's incompatible with your system.\n\n246\n00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.720\nLet's show you one where\nthey get it right.\n\n247\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.470\nSo we're gonna go and I'm just\ngonna go back to, I tell you what.\n\n248\n00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.410\nWe'll go Properties,\nwe'll go back to the Driver tab, and\n\n249\n00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:32.490\nwe'll show you that way, right.\n\n250\n00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.570\nSeven, eight, nine, ten,\n1,000 different ways to get to places.\n\n251\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.070\nAnd we'll say Browse my computer,\nlet me pick from a list.\n\n252\n00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.820\nI'm gonna uncheck this.\n\n253\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.660\nAnd now this time, I'm gonna go\ndown to the Acer keyboards, and\n\n254\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:48.650\nI'm just gonna pick, it looks like API\nergonomics, a USB keyboard, all right?\n\n255\n00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:49.920\nAnd we'll choose Next.\n\n256\n00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.570\nAnd now it says the same exact warnings,\nit says we can't verify.\n\n257\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:54.210\nAll right?\n\n258\n00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.580\nSo we're gonna go ahead and say Yes.\n\n259\n00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.279\nWe're gonna close it.\n\n260\n00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.970\nAnd close.\n\n261\n00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.780\nAnd I'm going to restart my computer.\n\n262\n00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.420\nAll right, so\nthe same thing is going to go on, right?\n\n263\n00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.652\nIt's going to restart the computer.\n\n264\n00:12:03.652 --> 00:12:07.810\nIt's gonna load that driver into the boot\nprocess, it's one of the boot start\n\n265\n00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.820\ndrivers, cuz you've got to be able to use\nyour keyboard to do anything, to log in,\n\n266\n00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.730\nto press F8 to boot into advanced options.\n\n267\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.610\nSo, it's one of those critical\ndrivers that does start right there at\n\n268\n00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.650\nthe boot process.\n\n269\n00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.620\nAnd when it gets rebooted,\nwhat we're gonna do is we'll go ahead and\n\n270\n00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.600\nlogin, we're gonna go back\nto device manager again and\n\n271\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.370\nwere gonna see if there's a difference,\nif there's warnings, if can’t see\n\n272\n00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:34.218\nanything different than what we've seen\ninitially when we installed the driver,\n\n273\n00:12:34.218 --> 00:12:38.260\nWindows said well, we just can’t\nverify whether it's compatible or not.\n\n274\n00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.970\nWell, it gave me the same warning for this\none and that's what we wanna find out.\n\n275\n00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.650\nWe wanna find out if we\ngo into device manager,\n\n276\n00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.810\ndo we see anything that's different\nthan what we've seen before?\n\n277\n00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.400\nSo it is booting up here real quick,\nwe'll just give it a second.\n\n278\n00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.970\nLike I said, it takes, it takes a little\nbit sometimes when you're installing these\n\n279\n00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:55.190\ndrivers to get the machines back online.\n\n280\n00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.270\nIt shouldn't take too long here.\n\n281\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.670\nAnd there we go, so we're logged back\nin and I'm going to go ahead here and\n\n282\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.762\nI'm going to type.\n\n283\n00:13:01.762 --> 00:13:06.080\nAll right, now you have to,\nyou can't really see this so I'm gonna let\n\n284\n00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.080\nDan confirm for you that I am typing on\nthe keyboard and nothing is happening.\n\n285\n00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.351\nNothing is happening at all\n>> Wes, you didn't type on the keyboard.\n\n286\n00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:16.619\nI mean yeah, you type great,\nit was awesome.\n\n287\n00:13:16.619 --> 00:13:18.310\n>> So, now I have a problem.\n\n288\n00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.990\nMy keyboard's not responding.\n\n289\n00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.870\nThank goodness my mouse is still\nresponding, but the keyboard's not.\n\n290\n00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.330\nSo I'm gonna use a little trick here.\n\n291\n00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.680\nI'm gonna go down to\nthe Ease of Access Center.\n\n292\n00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.935\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick the on-screen keyboard.\n\n293\n00:13:28.935 --> 00:13:32.050\nNow, I also want you to know about\nthis too for your own benefit.\n\n294\n00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.760\nBecause of the fact that when this happens\nI love the fact that they've got the Ease\n\n295\n00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.500\nof Access Center.\n\n296\n00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.170\nI've had it before where\nthe keyboard failed and\n\n297\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.060\nI couldn't get logged into\nthe machine to do anything to it.\n\n298\n00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.670\nBut now, with the Ease of Access Center,\n\n299\n00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:48.330\nthat's a software-based keyboard that is\nbuilt into Windows that doesn't interact\n\n300\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.180\nwith any of this driver software\nthat's now causing a problem.\n\n301\n00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.990\nSo we'll go ahead,\nmake sure that I select the right field.\n\n302\n00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.890\nWe'll try to type\nthe super secret password.\n\n303\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.260\nThat everybody can see now.\n\n304\n00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.110\nWe'll hit Enter and it's gonna log us in.\n\n305\n00:14:06.552 --> 00:14:10.760\nNow, when it logs us in,\nwe're gonna go to the same place.\n\n306\n00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.270\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nlaunch Device Manager.\n\n307\n00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.560\nWhen we launch it up, we're gonna\nnotice something that is a little\n\n308\n00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.680\nbit different than what we see before.\n\n309\n00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.520\nNotice that I've got this little\nexclamation point that's telling me\n\n310\n00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.550\nthere's a problem with the device,\nall right?\n\n311\n00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.814\nYou can also see down here the pointing\ndevice has a little problem too.\n\n312\n00:14:29.814 --> 00:14:32.105\nWell, it If I go, and I right click, and\n\n313\n00:14:32.105 --> 00:14:36.135\nI choose Properties, notice that\nI've got a different warning now.\n\n314\n00:14:36.135 --> 00:14:39.925\nThe request is not a valid operation for\nthe target device.\n\n315\n00:14:39.925 --> 00:14:41.455\nWhat requested operation?\n\n316\n00:14:41.455 --> 00:14:43.685\nRemember when I told you about\nthe high level programming language?\n\n317\n00:14:43.685 --> 00:14:45.330\nIt's trying to speak to the hardware, but\n\n318\n00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.610\nnow the translator that's in it is no\nlonger speaking English to Spanish.\n\n319\n00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.100\nNow it's speaking German to Japanese,\nright?\n\n320\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.750\nSo there is no translation going on here,\nright?\n\n321\n00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.320\nSo that's a problem.\n\n322\n00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:02.770\nLet's go ahead, and let's show you one\nmore thing when it comes to drivers.\n\n323\n00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.400\nSince something went\nwrong with the drivers,\n\n324\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.530\nif I right click on Device Manager.\n\n325\n00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.850\nAnd I choose the Driver tab again here.\n\n326\n00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.220\nNotice I have this\nRoll Back Driver option.\n\n327\n00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.440\nLet me tell you a little bit about this.\n\n328\n00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.975\nRolling back driver allows you to install,\nor actually uninstall this driver and\n\n329\n00:15:18.975 --> 00:15:22.380\nreinstall a roll back\nto the previous driver.\n\n330\n00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.810\nYou don't get multiple roll backs, right?\n\n331\n00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.170\nIf I have gone through four or\nfive drivers in this process,\n\n332\n00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.150\nI can't roll back and\nthen roll back and then roll back.\n\n333\n00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.310\nI can only roll back to\nthe previous driver before.\n\n334\n00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.560\nLet's see if that fixes the problem.\n\n335\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.160\nAll right?\nSo\n\n336\n00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.620\nit's gonna ask me, driver package roll\nback, are you sure you wanna do this?\n\n337\n00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.692\nWe're gonna go ahead and say Yes,\nwe'll choose Close all right.\n\n338\n00:15:43.692 --> 00:15:46.350\nAnd you'll notice that it's not\ngiving me a hard time and all.\n\n339\n00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.508\nBut I do still have a problem\nwith the pointing device so\n\n340\n00:15:49.508 --> 00:15:51.785\nit looks like These are tied together.\n\n341\n00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.640\nSo, let's go ahead, and\nwe're gonna restart one more time.\n\n342\n00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.580\nNow, that pointing device should\nfix itself on the restart.\n\n343\n00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.070\nLet me keep my fingers crossed and\nhope that that's the case here,\n\n344\n00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.400\nthat we don;t throw you\nan air ball here on camera.\n\n345\n00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.190\nSo, what has happened, right?\n\n346\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.012\nIt said, okay,\nwe see the last driver that you had,\n\n347\n00:16:09.012 --> 00:16:13.340\nall right, when you know that we know\ncurrently that this driver isn't working.\n\n348\n00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.760\nSo what we’re gonna do is we’re gonna\ninstall the very last driver that you had\n\n349\n00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.510\ninstalled, and it’s gonna boot back up.\n\n350\n00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:26.480\nNow, [LAUGH] first driver, or the driver\nthat you rolled back to has problems,\n\n351\n00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.340\nnow you’re gonna have to\nuninstall the device.\n\n352\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.410\nNow when you uninstall the device you\ncan turn around and reinstall it and\n\n353\n00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.970\npoint it back to an appropriate driver.\n\n354\n00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.470\nSo, we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n355\n00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.640\nWe'll let the driver roll back, and again\nit's just another one of those things.\n\n356\n00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.170\nIt actually,\nwhen it rolls back you could see it\n\n357\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.590\ndidn't take quite as long as\nit did installing the driver.\n\n358\n00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:43.850\nSo we'll go ahead and get logged in.\n\n359\n00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.960\nAnd it does look like my\nkeyboard's working again.\n\n360\n00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.810\nAnd then I'd like to show you\nwhat device manager looks like.\n\n361\n00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.290\nAnd really honestly guys you've already\nseen what it looks like when it's\n\n362\n00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.220\nnot a problem.\n\n363\n00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.030\nAll right?\n\n364\n00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.340\nThere's no warnings.\n\n365\n00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:01.380\nThe other thing that might\nbe here is a question mark.\n\n366\n00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.755\nQuestion marks are when Microsoft or\nWindows can't.\n\n367\n00:17:04.755 --> 00:17:06.915\nIt doesn't have the driver\nin the repository.\n\n368\n00:17:06.915 --> 00:17:09.545\nIt says,\nI don't know what this device is, right?\n\n369\n00:17:09.545 --> 00:17:10.255\nI have no clue.\n\n370\n00:17:10.255 --> 00:17:13.345\nOr it can identify the hardware\nidentifier and says ethernet controller.\n\n371\n00:17:13.345 --> 00:17:17.105\nIt says, I know what kind of device it is\nbut I don't have a driver to control it.\n\n372\n00:17:17.105 --> 00:17:19.180\nNotice here, all good.\n\n373\n00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.370\nEverything's good here.\n\n374\n00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:21.490\nWe're back in business.\n\n375\n00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:27.860\nThe driver is just fine, and if I want\nI've got the previous driver before.\n\n376\n00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.775\nAnd I could, even if I wanted to now,\ngo ahead and\n\n377\n00:17:29.775 --> 00:17:33.780\nre-install the standard keyboard,\nPS2 keyboard that we had initially.\n\n378\n00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:39.510\nSo Device Manager, keep in mind\nthat you can also disable devices.\n\n379\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:43.670\nOr when you uninstall a device,\nyou could disable it, turns it off.\n\n380\n00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.780\nThat's a red x.\n\n381\n00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.970\nIf you uninstall the driver, you lose\nthe ability to communicate with it.\n\n382\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.560\nIf it's a plug and play device and\n\n383\n00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.010\nyou uninstall the driver,\nnext time you reboot, the plug and\n\n384\n00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.880\nplay subsystem is gonna say,\nI've got a hardware identifier there, and\n\n385\n00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.025\nI know that driver's right here in this\ndriver store, and it matches it back up.\n\n386\n00:18:01.025 --> 00:18:04.830\nSo, yeah,\nyou really have to remove a plug and\n\n387\n00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:09.230\nplay driver from the driver store\nif you truly wanna uninstall it.\n\n388\n00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.950\nBut I wouldn't recommend uninstalling.\n\n389\n00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.500\nThe reason they say it's advanced\nis because you lose the ability to\n\n390\n00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.990\ncommunicate with it.\n\n391\n00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.290\nAll right?\n\n392\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:21.410\nNow, we've looked at this next\ntopic quite a bit in other\n\n393\n00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:25.040\nendeavors here during the series, but\nI do wanna take the time to show you guys.\n\n394\n00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.890\nAnd this is the Microsoft Management\nConsole, and the launch one,\n\n395\n00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.400\nyou just type mmc.exe, and here we go.\n\n396\n00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.890\nYou guys have seen this one before.\n\n397\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:34.030\nWe've used it.\n\n398\n00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.420\nMicrosoft Management Consoles,\n\n399\n00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.700\nthere's a lot of them that are built\ninto the operating system.\n\n400\n00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.000\nComputer Management is a built in MMC.\n\n401\n00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.700\nBut there are some times that you have\ncertain snap-ins that aren't available and\n\n402\n00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.550\nbuilt into the operating system.\n\n403\n00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:51.160\nSo you can add, if you want,\nadd or remove snap-ins.\n\n404\n00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.630\nI like actually just using Control M\ncuz it gets me there quicker.\n\n405\n00:18:54.630 --> 00:19:03.490\nI'll give you an example of ones that\nare not built into any pre-existing MMC's.\n\n406\n00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:08.570\nThat is the IPsec monitor and\nthe IP security policies.\n\n407\n00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:10.110\nWe don't have an MMC built in.\n\n408\n00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:15.620\nYou have to add the snap-in to be able to\nsee IPsec configuration on your machine.\n\n409\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.780\nWe can't just launch one of these\nup from computer management.\n\n410\n00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.710\nNow you get the ability that, if you want,\nyou can turn around and you can save this.\n\n411\n00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.035\nAnd I'll go ahead and save it to\nthe desktop so Wes can actually find it.\n\n412\n00:19:26.035 --> 00:19:29.705\n>> So, Wes, a lot of the tools that we use\ninside of the Windows operation system,\n\n413\n00:19:29.705 --> 00:19:33.775\nespecially when we see a window\nlike what we're looking at now\n\n414\n00:19:33.775 --> 00:19:35.205\nis just prebuilt MMCs?\n\n415\n00:19:35.205 --> 00:19:38.010\n>> That's right, and\nthey got the snap-ins.\n\n416\n00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.020\nFollowing that line of reasoning,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n417\n00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.890\nlet's open up Computer Management and\nlet's kinda show them side by side, right?\n\n418\n00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.040\nNow, notice that these are all snap-ins.\n\n419\n00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.210\nI can't modify this, but certainly if\nI wanted to I could come in here and\n\n420\n00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.600\nI could say okay, I'm gonna add, right?\n\n421\n00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.320\nSo we've got Task Scheduler.\n\n422\n00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.210\nWell, I could come in here,\nand I could scroll down, and\n\n423\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.750\nI could add Task Scheduler, and\nI can do the local computer.\n\n424\n00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:04.190\nRight?\nI could add Event Viewer, and\n\n425\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.240\nI'll say the local computer.\n\n426\n00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.920\nI could add Device Manager\nto the local computer.\n\n427\n00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.630\nAnd we'll just go ahead and stop it there.\n\n428\n00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.660\nAnd now if you look, I'm kind of building\nmy own little computer management, but\n\n429\n00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.980\nit's tailor made to something that I want.\n\n430\n00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.160\nWhat's even better about this\nis I could take this MMC,\n\n431\n00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.210\nthis Microsoft Management Console, and\nI could export it to a USB drive and\n\n432\n00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.310\nplug it into any of\nthe machines I'm working at.\n\n433\n00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:30.220\nAnd I now have a customized\nMicrosoft Management Console that has just\n\n434\n00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.830\nthe snap-ins that I utilize\non a day to day basis.\n\n435\n00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.000\nSo, let's go ahead.\n\n436\n00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.300\nWe'll save that Console.\n\n437\n00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.120\nKnow a little bit about the MMC.\n\n438\n00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.440\nKnow what's going on there.\n\n439\n00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.720\nNow, I mentioned something\ncalled Task Scheduler.\n\n440\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.330\nSince we created an MMC, and\n\n441\n00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.570\nI put Task Scheduler in there,\nlet me go ahead and open up my MMC.\n\n442\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.250\nNotice that it has saved my settings.\n\n443\n00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.790\nI'm gonna go ahead real quick, and\n\n444\n00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:56.130\nI'm gonna remove some snap-ins, kinda\nshow you how you can do that as well.\n\n445\n00:20:56.130 --> 00:21:01.910\nWe'll remove IPsec, Event Viewer, and\nDevice Manager and we'll say OK..\n\n446\n00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.360\nNow, we're just dealing\nwith Task Scheduler.\n\n447\n00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.537\nNow, have you ever had maybe a process\nthat you had to go and you had to click.\n\n448\n00:21:08.537 --> 00:21:09.774\nYou had to click click.\n\n449\n00:21:09.774 --> 00:21:11.710\nYou had to click day in and day out.\n\n450\n00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:16.570\nAnd you're like, I'd really just like to\nbe able to set this and forget it, right?\n\n451\n00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.730\nWell, that's what\nTask Scheduler is good for.\n\n452\n00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.320\nIt's good for automating day to day tasks\nthat you don't wanna have to sit and\n\n453\n00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.000\ndo every time.\n\n454\n00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.370\nNow let me show you a couple of them.\n\n455\n00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:28.940\nIf you expand Task Scheduler,\nyou got the Task Scheduler library.\n\n456\n00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.660\nUnder Microsoft you have Windows, and\n\n457\n00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.420\nunder Windows you have a whole\nbunch of different components.\n\n458\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.030\nLets look at a couple of them here.\n\n459\n00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:36.930\nDisk clean up, right?\n\n460\n00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.050\nWe have to do disk clean up, and, Dan,\nI know you've worked in help desk.\n\n461\n00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.550\nI know you supported end users.\n\n462\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.750\nHave you ever had to run a check disk for\nsomebody?\n\n463\n00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.340\n>> Every now and then.\n\n464\n00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.830\nIt does come up, and\nyou have to run that guy.\n\n465\n00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.100\n>> That's right.\nOr a disk clean up in this case.\n\n466\n00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.060\nWell, imagine the ability to set a task,\nright?\n\n467\n00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.718\nSilent clean up and run once a day.\n\n468\n00:21:54.718 --> 00:21:56.030\nWell, I could do that, right?\n\n469\n00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:59.200\nI could come in here, and\nI could set the properties of this, right?\n\n470\n00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.990\nAnd triggers.\n\n471\n00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.750\nI could say, you know what?\n\n472\n00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.150\nI wanna add a new trigger to this.\n\n473\n00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.410\nWhat's the new trigger going to be?\n\n474\n00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.620\nWell, it's going to be run daily.\n\n475\n00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.620\nRun every one day.\n\n476\n00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.380\nRight?\nAnd I could say okay.\n\n477\n00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.940\nWhen I do that I choose okay.\n\n478\n00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.270\nNow I've got a task that's\ngoing to be automated for\n\n479\n00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.590\nme, and it's going to keep running.\n\n480\n00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.560\nAnd I don't have to be there to run it.\n\n481\n00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:21.340\nA couple of the other ones that are really\ncool that I like, is right underneath it.\n\n482\n00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.770\nDisk diagnostics.\n\n483\n00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.220\nSome of them are built in.\n\n484\n00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:28.140\nIn Vista they decided to take your disk\ndefragmenter cuz people wouldn't do it.\n\n485\n00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.980\nand it's in the automated Task Scheduler.\n\n486\n00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.310\nIt's automated with Task Scheduler now, so\nit happens in the background at idle time.\n\n487\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:39.040\n>> My favorite use for the Task Scheduler\nis actually getting around the UAC.\n\n488\n00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.160\nYou can create a task with\nthe system of the privileges, and\n\n489\n00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.250\nthen put that task on your desktop,\n\n490\n00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.620\nchange the icon to whatever it is you\nwant to run, and then double click it.\n\n491\n00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.250\nAnd it'll run without giving you\na UAC prompt because it already\n\n492\n00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.997\nhas the permissions built in.\n\n493\n00:22:54.997 --> 00:22:55.950\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's interesting.\n\n494\n00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.845\nI'll tell you I've got one, too,\nsince we're going down memory name here.\n\n495\n00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:01.000\nHere's one that I did.\n\n496\n00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.530\nI had a media center, right?\n\n497\n00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.150\nI love media center in Windows.\n\n498\n00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.830\nI wish it wouldn't taken it out because\nI really did its functionality, right?\n\n499\n00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.780\nSo what I would do is I'd have program\nthat my wife wanted to watch, but\n\n500\n00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.470\nI wasn't there.\n\n501\n00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.340\nI was teaching.\n\n502\n00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.910\nI was doing instructions at that time.\n\n503\n00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:17.605\nSo what I did is I set up\na Task Scheduler to boot my computer.\n\n504\n00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:18.890\nWell,actually it was\na little bit more than that.\n\n505\n00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.830\nWhat happened is that one computer would\nsend a wake on land package to the big\n\n506\n00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.540\ncomputer that was my media center, and\n\n507\n00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:29.630\nit would wake it up, I think it was at\n10:55 because it would come on at 11.\n\n508\n00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.450\nAnd then at 12:05,\nafter the movie was over,\n\n509\n00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:36.370\nthat machine that just got woken up would\nrun it's own test that would shut it down.\n\n510\n00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:39.994\nSo one would wake it up, it would record\nthe movie, and it would shut itself down.\n\n511\n00:23:39.994 --> 00:23:43.493\nAnd I didn't have to do it, and\nI certainly wouldn't have to remember cuz\n\n512\n00:23:43.493 --> 00:23:46.215\nout of all the things I've lost,\nI miss my mind the most.\n\n513\n00:23:46.215 --> 00:23:50.146\n[LAUGH] So\nyou could do that with Task Scheduler.\n\n514\n00:23:50.146 --> 00:23:52.066\nIt's a really, really good thing to have.\n\n515\n00:23:52.066 --> 00:23:55.030\nNow the other thing, speaking of\nscheduling and automating stuff.\n\n516\n00:23:55.030 --> 00:24:00.520\nThe other thing that we get the ability\nto do is automate tasks with PowerShell.\n\n517\n00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.530\nAll right, now this does require\nyou having PowerShell scripts.\n\n518\n00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:08.330\nOn the exam, guys, you don't have to\nknow PowerShell scripting language.\n\n519\n00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:09.240\nPlease don't think that.\n\n520\n00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.070\nI don't want you guys deer in headlights,\nmy gosh.\n\n521\n00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.190\nI really gotta learn\nPowerShell scripting language?\n\n522\n00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.198\nNo, you do not, all right.\n\n523\n00:24:15.198 --> 00:24:17.840\n>> Not yet.\n>> Not yet, not yet, that's right, but\n\n524\n00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.560\nwhat they do want you to know\nis the concepts behind it.\n\n525\n00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.120\nSo, let me go ahead.\n\n526\n00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.550\nI'm gonna drop down to\nan administrative PowerShell here.\n\n527\n00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:32.280\nWe'll kinda expand that out and\nwe will look at it a little bit, okay?\n\n528\n00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.990\nSo, one of the things that we\nhave to do is, I tell you what,\n\n529\n00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.680\nlet me go ahead and open this\nwithout administrative privileges.\n\n530\n00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.980\nWe'll just open the basic ones here and\nsee if it will work, all right?\n\n531\n00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:49.020\nNow, one of the things that I wanna\ndo is I wanna run a script, right?\n\n532\n00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.840\nI wanna automate a task.\n\n533\n00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.070\nSo let me go ahead, give us\na little bit more real estate here.\n\n534\n00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:58.600\nAll right, so I've got a PowerShell script\nand it is on the desktop, all right?\n\n535\n00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.630\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna call on this script and\n\n536\n00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:04.870\nwe're gonna see if we can automate\ndeleting old files, right?\n\n537\n00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.590\nScour through the hard drive, and\nfind these files that we're not using\n\n538\n00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.600\nafter a certain date, they hadn't been\nmodified and we're gonna clean them up.\n\n539\n00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.440\nSo, what we're gonna do,\nremember that the,\n\n540\n00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.270\nand I have to navigate up\nto my desktop here, guys.\n\n541\n00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.767\nLet me do that real quick.\n\n542\n00:25:19.767 --> 00:25:26.013\nIt does help to be in\nthe location of that script.\n\n543\n00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.840\nAll right, yeah, there it is, okay,\nhad to make sure I was there.\n\n544\n00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.298\nAll right, now to call this script,\nyou just have to be,\n\n545\n00:25:34.298 --> 00:25:37.540\nyou can use a relative path or you can\ncall on it by the fully qualified path.\n\n546\n00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.354\nThat's fine, in this case,\nI'm doing the relative path, right?\n\n547\n00:25:40.354 --> 00:25:42.851\nAnd then I'm gonna say, folder path.\n\n548\n00:25:47.634 --> 00:25:49.175\n>> Starts with a p.\n\n549\n00:25:49.175 --> 00:25:50.040\n[LAUGH]\n>> Thank you.\n\n550\n00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.912\nI'm so\nglad Dan's here to help me with that.\n\n551\n00:25:51.912 --> 00:25:57.255\nAll right, now I'm gonna say, you know\nwhat, I wanna clean up the old scripts or\n\n552\n00:25:57.255 --> 00:26:00.915\nthe old files, if you will,\nthat are in the user profile.\n\n553\n00:26:00.915 --> 00:26:05.775\nWe'll say file age, all right, 30 and\n\n554\n00:26:07.245 --> 00:26:12.465\nI'll leave the log file off and\nI'll run that, okay?\n\n555\n00:26:12.465 --> 00:26:15.885\nAnd like you've seen Dan, in fact Dan\nmentioned this in one of the other\n\n556\n00:26:15.885 --> 00:26:18.120\nepisodes, when I get red,\nsomething's wrong.\n\n557\n00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.200\nSomething didn't go right.\n\n558\n00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.360\n>> I think your c colon user\nshould be c colon users.\n\n559\n00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.067\n>> Users.\nOkay, so let's try that, let's try that.\n\n560\n00:26:27.067 --> 00:26:28.390\nSpelling counts.\n\n561\n00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:29.290\n>> It does.\n\n562\n00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:29.790\n>> And we still get red.\n\n563\n00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:30.580\n>> That didn't help.\n\n564\n00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.910\n>> All right, so what's going on?\n\n565\n00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:36.680\nThis is the, this is the part that they\nreally want you to know on the exam.\n\n566\n00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.290\nAll right, by default,\nlet's get some of that red off the screen,\n\n567\n00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:45.410\nby default,\nscripts can not be executed on Windows.\n\n568\n00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:49.870\nAll right, and to see that you can do\na get-ExecutionPolicy and you run it.\n\n569\n00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.020\nNotice that I have this restricted here.\n\n570\n00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.250\nI can't run this, right?\n\n571\n00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.270\nBecause it is restricted.\n\n572\n00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.590\n>> You know,\nthe fact that it's restricted,\n\n573\n00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.520\nwill probably stop you\nfrom running that script.\n\n574\n00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.621\n>> Yeah, that's absolutely right.\n\n575\n00:27:00.621 --> 00:27:03.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So how do we change that fact?\n\n576\n00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:06.940\nWell, we've got to set the execution\npolicy to something else, right?\n\n577\n00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:07.720\nSo that's what we're going to do.\n\n578\n00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.725\nWe're going to run set-ExecutionPolicy.\n\n579\n00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.792\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna do a,\n\n580\n00:27:14.792 --> 00:27:16.572\nthere's a few different ones, right?\n\n581\n00:27:16.572 --> 00:27:19.730\nThere's restricted, there's all signed,\nremote signed, and unrestricted.\n\n582\n00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.300\nRestricted does exactly what you've\njust seen, it blocks everything.\n\n583\n00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.399\nUnrestricted, in a test environment,\nit's fine.\n\n584\n00:27:25.399 --> 00:27:27.210\nDon't do it on a production machine,\nright?\n\n585\n00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:32.109\nRemote signed means if I make a PS\nremoting session across the network,\n\n586\n00:27:32.109 --> 00:27:37.009\nI have to make sure that that script\nis on my machine that I'm gonna run on\n\n587\n00:27:37.009 --> 00:27:41.122\nthe remote machine,\nhas to have a digital signature on it.\n\n588\n00:27:41.122 --> 00:27:44.170\nAll signed means I don't care\nif you're running it locally or\n\n589\n00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:48.580\nremote, I don't care what it is, it has\nto have a code signing certificate on it.\n\n590\n00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:52.050\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nchange this set-ExecutionPolicy, and\n\n591\n00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.120\nwe're gonna do remotesigned, right?\n\n592\n00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.350\nBecause I'm running it on the local\nmachine, I'm right here at the machine.\n\n593\n00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.670\nI'm the one running it, right?\n\n594\n00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.520\nAnd it's gonna ask me,\ndo you want to set this?\n\n595\n00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.430\nAnd I love when PowerShell\nworks correctly.\n\n596\n00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:06.240\nIt doesn't really show you much, right?\n\n597\n00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.120\nBut boy, I tell you what,\nwhen it gets wrong, when you got it wrong,\n\n598\n00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.640\nit shows you everything under the sun.\n\n599\n00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.300\n>> It takes out a full page ad in\nthe New York Times, doesn't it?\n\n600\n00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.671\n>> That's right, it gives you a doctoral\ndissertation or thesis, if you will,\n\n601\n00:28:16.671 --> 00:28:17.650\non why you're wrong.\n\n602\n00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.250\nSo now we've set that.\n\n603\n00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.060\nLet's see if we can call\non that script again.\n\n604\n00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.410\nAll right, now it's telling me,\n\n605\n00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:29.000\nwell wait a second here,\nyou've got something you've missed.\n\n606\n00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.230\nWell, it knows that it's\nmissing a parameter.\n\n607\n00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:35.084\nIt didn't give me this option\nwhen it was restricted, right?\n\n608\n00:28:35.084 --> 00:28:38.869\nSo what I have to do is\nI have to do logfile,\n\n609\n00:28:38.869 --> 00:28:44.067\nthat's what it's looking for,\nand then I'm gonna tell\n\n610\n00:28:44.067 --> 00:28:49.080\nit logfile and\nwe'll just do psscript.log, right?\n\n611\n00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.510\nThe other thing I want you to pay\nattention that I didn't mention then and\n\n612\n00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.450\nI do need to mention is\nthis file extension .ps1.\n\n613\n00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.548\nSorry, you PlayStation fanatics out there.\n\n614\n00:28:56.548 --> 00:28:58.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That is not the first PlayStation.\n\n615\n00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.170\nThat's the format of a PowerShell script.\n\n616\n00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.503\nAll right, and let me spell log right.\n\n617\n00:29:05.664 --> 00:29:06.780\nAnd we'll run it.\n\n618\n00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.310\nAnd notice that it's automating\nthe process, it's saying\n\n619\n00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:12.520\nI'm retrieving a list of folders,\nright, and it's going to go through.\n\n620\n00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.370\nIt's going to find the folders in\nthis case that are thirty days old,\n\n621\n00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.020\nright, and it says old files.\n\n622\n00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.440\nIt's found a whole bunch, all right.\n\n623\n00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.869\nI can tell you on this script you really\nshouldn't be running it on the users\n\n624\n00:29:24.869 --> 00:29:29.808\nprofiles unless you've confirmed with\nthem that those files aren't important.\n\n625\n00:29:29.808 --> 00:29:31.971\nBecause what this thing does,\nyou can see right here,\n\n626\n00:29:31.971 --> 00:29:33.582\nit's starting to remove the old files.\n\n627\n00:29:33.582 --> 00:29:35.950\nNow what's going on, right?\n\n628\n00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.630\nI don't have to do anything.\n\n629\n00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.150\nI don't have to open, right?\n\n630\n00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.690\nDan calls me up says, hey Wes,\nI need you to look for\n\n631\n00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:45.720\n3634 files and I need them deleted.\n\n632\n00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.600\nAnd you don't get paid hourly, so you're\ngonna be here tonight, all night long.\n\n633\n00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.190\nWell, no, I can say sure, no problem.\n\n634\n00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.790\nDelete.ps1, this script in case,\nrun it, say Dan,\n\n635\n00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.440\nI'll be on the golf course by noon, right?\n\n636\n00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.720\nSo, the automated task is a lot better.\n\n637\n00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.000\nAnd that's essentially some of\nthe things that you can do.\n\n638\n00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.720\nRemember you can automate\ntasks with Task Scheduler, but\n\n639\n00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.960\nyou can also dig down deep and\nyou can grab a ps1 file.\n\n640\n00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.610\nIf you know the scripting language,\nyou can build them yourself.\n\n641\n00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:16.080\nIf not, jump on over to Scripting Guy and\n\n642\n00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.740\nthere's tons of them that people\nthat do create these scripts.\n\n643\n00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:24.650\nMake sure you set your execution policy\nto remote signed, if you wanna make\n\n644\n00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:28.210\nsure that it's locally, all signed,\nif you wanna go the securest route.\n\n645\n00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.660\nUnrestricted, again,\nI would be careful with it.\n\n646\n00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.870\nIn a test environment, might be okay, but\n\n647\n00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.082\nother than that it will cause\na pretty good security vulnerability.\n\n648\n00:30:36.082 --> 00:30:39.290\nSo, Dan, that's a little bit\nabout our advanced tools.\n\n649\n00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.210\n>> Really, really cool stuff today, Wes.\n\n650\n00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.050\nI enjoyed this episode quite a bit.\n\n651\n00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.640\nHopefully you guys did as well.\n\n652\n00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.510\nBut unfortunately the arts clock\nhas ticked away, time has ended.\n\n653\n00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:49.770\nBut we do appreciate you guys showing up.\n\n654\n00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:53.000\nAnd Wes, we appreciate you for\nshowing us these things, so\n\n655\n00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.090\nthat we can increase\nour Windows knowledge.\n\n656\n00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:56.100\nPass that exam.\n\n657\n00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.450\nThat being said,\nit is time to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n658\n00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.440\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n659\n00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.205\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n660\n00:31:01.205 --> 00:31:03.493\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n661\n00:31:03.493 --> 00:31:12.130\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.837\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today,\nyou're actually watching the Windows 10\n\n4\n00:00:18.837 --> 00:00:21.909\nshow, taking a look at installing and\nconfiguring Windows 10.\n\n5\n00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:25.852\nSpecifically talking about the 70-698\nexam, and who better to help us out on\n\n6\n00:00:25.852 --> 00:00:29.025\nsome of the different topics there,\nthan Mr. Wes Bryan himself.\n\n7\n00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:30.229\nWes, welcome back to our studios.\n\n8\n00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.136\n>> Thanks Ronnie for having me here.\n\n9\n00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:32.589\nAs always, great to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:36.177\nThat's right,\nwe're moving through our 7698 exam.\n\n11\n00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:40.664\nOne of the things that we're gonna look\nat today is configuring system recovery,\n\n12\n00:00:40.664 --> 00:00:42.560\nif you will, backup and restore.\n\n13\n00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.117\nWe're going to look at a couple\nof technologies that we want you\n\n14\n00:00:45.117 --> 00:00:46.380\nto be prepared for on the exam.\n\n15\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.645\nNow there are a handful of technologies\nthat can help you backup and\n\n16\n00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:50.644\nrecover your data.\n\n17\n00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:54.795\nIn the 7697 exam, they took care\nof things like your PC refresh,\n\n18\n00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:59.684\nyour PC reset, the Windows recovery\nenvironment and creating a recovery disk.\n\n19\n00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:01.484\nSo we definitely encourage\nyou to jump back over.\n\n20\n00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:03.080\nIf any of those seem foreign to you,\n\n21\n00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.393\nyou're gonna want to watch them\nregardless of what exam you're taking.\n\n22\n00:01:06.393 --> 00:01:09.537\nHere today what we're going to be looking\nat is a little bit on the command line and\n\n23\n00:01:09.537 --> 00:01:10.383\nan oldie but goodie.\n\n24\n00:01:10.383 --> 00:01:14.231\nOne that was taken out in Windows 8 Or\n8.1 completely, and\n\n25\n00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:19.192\nthere must have been enough uproar that\nthey brought it back into Windows 10.\n\n26\n00:01:19.192 --> 00:01:22.497\nSo let's talk about one that's been\nin Windows for a very long time, and\n\n27\n00:01:22.497 --> 00:01:24.241\nthat's something known as Wbadmin.\n\n28\n00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:27.510\nThat's the Windows Backup\nAdministration Utility, and\n\n29\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.511\nI wanna talk about a few of the switches,\nand also make\n\n30\n00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:34.932\nyou aware of some of the changes just in\ncase they might catch you up on the exam.\n\n31\n00:01:34.932 --> 00:01:36.300\nI went ahead and\nmade a little diagram here.\n\n32\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.292\nLet's talk a little bit about WBADMIN,\nall right.\n\n33\n00:01:39.292 --> 00:01:44.144\nWhen we start a backup inside\nof the command prompt,\n\n34\n00:01:44.144 --> 00:01:48.345\nwe typically run WBADMIN_start_backup.\n\n35\n00:01:48.345 --> 00:01:51.324\nNow there are a couple of switches that\nI want you to be aware of for the exam.\n\n36\n00:01:51.324 --> 00:01:54.522\nAnd then there are again a couple of\nthings that we'll mention that I don't\n\n37\n00:01:54.522 --> 00:01:55.602\nwant them to trip you up.\n\n38\n00:01:55.602 --> 00:01:57.179\nThe first one is the backup target.\n\n39\n00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.962\nNow when we look at backup target,\n\n40\n00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:02.961\nI want you to understand that you're\ntelling the program, you're saying,\n\n41\n00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:06.737\nthis is where I want you to send that\ninformation that we're backing up.\n\n42\n00:02:06.737 --> 00:02:12.283\nNow, I went ahead and put this\nlittle warning here, not -addTarget,\n\n43\n00:02:12.283 --> 00:02:17.468\nbecause when you are scheduling\na backup the switch is addTarget.\n\n44\n00:02:17.468 --> 00:02:20.821\nAnd it says okay if I've got\nmultiple drives in the system and\n\n45\n00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:25.030\nI don't wanna just include C: which\nis typically your Windows directory,\n\n46\n00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.890\nadd the D drive, add the E drive.\n\n47\n00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.408\nSo you're adding a target, if you will.\n\n48\n00:02:29.408 --> 00:02:32.721\nNotice that when you're running start\nbackup it's a little bit different.\n\n49\n00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:36.687\nYou choose backupTarget and that just\nsays, okay Windows back up administration\n\n50\n00:02:36.687 --> 00:02:40.740\nutility, I want you to put all of\nour backup data in this location.\n\n51\n00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.948\nNow, include, you can exclude items,\nyou can include items.\n\n52\n00:02:43.948 --> 00:02:46.820\nFor us, we're gonna use this,\nwe're gonna use include.\n\n53\n00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.326\nWe're gonna say C: here so that we\ncan include the drive C, if you will.\n\n54\n00:02:52.326 --> 00:02:55.824\nNow here's another one for the exam\nthat I want you to pay attention to.\n\n55\n00:02:55.824 --> 00:03:00.308\nAnd this has changed a little bit\nfrom what it was in previous versions\n\n56\n00:03:00.308 --> 00:03:01.780\nof the WB admin.\n\n57\n00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.370\nWhen you wanted to capture\nyour system state, well,\n\n58\n00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.810\nif you don't know what system state data\nis, let's kind of talk about that right?\n\n59\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.162\nSystem state data is things like your\n.com, registration objects, your registry.\n\n60\n00:03:13.162 --> 00:03:17.134\nAnd it's the crucial set of system files\nthat your operation system needs in\n\n61\n00:03:17.134 --> 00:03:17.889\norder to run.\n\n62\n00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.454\nWell, if you want to back up that system\nstate data, should you get a virus or\n\n63\n00:03:21.454 --> 00:03:25.194\nsomething that starts to corrupt your\ncritical files, those operating system\n\n64\n00:03:25.194 --> 00:03:28.290\nfiles, you need to make sure that\nyou have a system state backup.\n\n65\n00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.999\nIn earlier versions, you used to\nrun systemstatebackup as a switch.\n\n66\n00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:38.638\nToday we run -allCritical.\n\n67\n00:03:38.638 --> 00:03:40.360\nSo please keep that in mind.\n\n68\n00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.229\nBut if you want to not only backup user\ndata, but you want to backup those crucial\n\n69\n00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.862\nfiles that the operating system\nneeds to stay functional,\n\n70\n00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:53.164\nyou're gonna go ahead and\nyou’re gonna use the allCritical switch.\n\n71\n00:03:53.164 --> 00:03:57.062\nNow, there are a couple other options\nthat I want you to look at as well here.\n\n72\n00:03:57.062 --> 00:04:00.267\nAnd this is the get option with WBADMIN.\n\n73\n00:04:00.267 --> 00:04:04.120\nAnd what this allows you to do is,\nit allows you to find some information,\n\n74\n00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.190\nhence the term get.\n\n75\n00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.407\nAll right, if I have multiple\nversions of a backup, right.\n\n76\n00:04:10.407 --> 00:04:13.959\nLet's say I take a backup and\nlet's say at 12 noon.\n\n77\n00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.178\nAnd then I run a backup at 8 o'clock.\n\n78\n00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:18.626\nMaybe you're running\na backup every other day.\n\n79\n00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:21.593\nAnd I decide that I wanna go\nto the recovery operation.\n\n80\n00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:22.803\nI wanna recover.\n\n81\n00:04:22.803 --> 00:04:27.251\nWell, I need to know what the backup\nversion is in order to recover it.\n\n82\n00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:31.905\nSo you can get the version numbers from\nthe various backups that you have.\n\n83\n00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:37.722\nAgain, keep in mind I don't\nbelieve we need this one here.\n\n84\n00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:40.057\nYeah, you don't need the backup target,\nwhich is great.\n\n85\n00:04:40.057 --> 00:04:42.155\nYou don't need to point it to it.\n\n86\n00:04:42.155 --> 00:04:47.397\nStatus, if I run a backup job or I have\na backup job that's currently running.\n\n87\n00:04:47.397 --> 00:04:51.912\nMaybe it's being scripted and I wanna find\nout Where is it in the back up operation?\n\n88\n00:04:51.912 --> 00:04:56.467\nWell I can run a WBADMIN get dash status,\nand\n\n89\n00:04:56.467 --> 00:05:02.758\nit'll show me the running status\nof incurring backup jobs.\n\n90\n00:05:02.758 --> 00:05:08.192\nNow another one that's in here,\nthat's not supported in Windows 10,\n\n91\n00:05:08.192 --> 00:05:11.609\nand we're gonna demonstrate\nthis coming up,\n\n92\n00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:16.355\nis the fact that when I do a get-disks,\nit doesn't support it.\n\n93\n00:05:16.355 --> 00:05:19.347\nAnd it will tell you,\nnot supported in this version so\n\n94\n00:05:19.347 --> 00:05:21.217\nplease keep that in mind as well.\n\n95\n00:05:21.217 --> 00:05:23.370\nI can also look for the volumes.\n\n96\n00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.135\nWhat can I backup or what can I\nrecover inside of a Windows backup?\n\n97\n00:05:27.135 --> 00:05:31.595\nWell, I can do get items and\nI can find out is it just a drive letter?\n\n98\n00:05:31.595 --> 00:05:36.659\nIs it a folder that we can backup or\nwe can recover or is it an entire volume?\n\n99\n00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.213\nAnd that's with the get-items.\n\n100\n00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:42.570\nAnd you also have to use\nthe version number, as well.\n\n101\n00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.557\nFinally, and again, like I said,\nwe're going to demonstrate some of these.\n\n102\n00:05:45.557 --> 00:05:47.925\nWe also have the enable backup.\n\n103\n00:05:47.925 --> 00:05:51.105\nWBADMIN allows you the ability\nto schedule a backup,\n\n104\n00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:54.438\njust like you can do from\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n105\n00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:57.471\nNow understand that we use and\n\n106\n00:05:57.471 --> 00:06:02.329\nrun WBADMIN enable backup and\nthen -include.\n\n107\n00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:05.277\nAgain, what do we wanna include\nwhen we're gonna schedule this?\n\n108\n00:06:05.277 --> 00:06:09.658\n-addTarget if you have additional\ndrives that you wanna include, and then\n\n109\n00:06:09.658 --> 00:06:15.310\nthe -schedule, and the schedule, when you\nadd the time, it's hour and minute format.\n\n110\n00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.030\nSo, those are a few of the options that\nI want you to be aware of for this exam.\n\n111\n00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.805\nNow, that's enough talking about it.\n\n112\n00:06:21.805 --> 00:06:24.228\nLet's go ahead switch\nover to our machine and\n\n113\n00:06:24.228 --> 00:06:28.130\nlet's show you how you would back up\nall the critical files on a machine.\n\n114\n00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.005\nNow, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll run one here, and\n\n115\n00:06:31.005 --> 00:06:34.374\nthen we'll see what it looks\nlike after it's completed.\n\n116\n00:06:34.374 --> 00:06:35.773\nSo I'm gonna drop down to my Powershell.\n\n117\n00:06:35.773 --> 00:06:38.008\nKeep in mind guys,\nyou can do this in Powershell,\n\n118\n00:06:38.008 --> 00:06:41.510\nyou can do it in command prompt,\nWBadmin is it's own utility.\n\n119\n00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.310\nSo it's not tied to any\none of the command lines.\n\n120\n00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.353\nAll right now.\n\n121\n00:06:47.353 --> 00:06:50.861\nTo do this, what we're going to\ndo is we're going to run WBADMIN.\n\n122\n00:06:54.446 --> 00:06:59.113\nAll right and\nwe're going to say start, backup.\n\n123\n00:06:59.113 --> 00:06:59.615\nAll right.\n\n124\n00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:03.759\nAnd now keep in mind that when running\nthe backup, we do backup target.\n\n125\n00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:06.535\nNot add target,\nthat's in the scheduling of it.\n\n126\n00:07:06.535 --> 00:07:11.440\nSo we're gonna do backup Target and\n\n127\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.008\nyou're going to include one of\ntwo things here, all right?\n\n128\n00:07:17.008 --> 00:07:20.851\nIf you've got a file server on your\nnetwork, you can include the UNC path to\n\n129\n00:07:20.851 --> 00:07:24.952\nthe file, or the share, that you've\nshared out, that you've got access to.\n\n130\n00:07:24.952 --> 00:07:26.764\nOr you can type in a local drive.\n\n131\n00:07:26.764 --> 00:07:29.310\nFor us, here,\nwe're going to type a local drive.\n\n132\n00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.196\nAnd I've got a couple\nof drives on this PC.\n\n133\n00:07:31.196 --> 00:07:34.884\nNow, one of the things to keep in\nmind it doesn't like is when you try\n\n134\n00:07:34.884 --> 00:07:37.695\nto include a backup on\nthe drive you are backing up.\n\n135\n00:07:37.695 --> 00:07:40.034\nSo please keep that in mind.\n\n136\n00:07:40.034 --> 00:07:43.810\nSo I've got this E drive here, and\nwe'll go ahead, we'll run that.\n\n137\n00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.117\nWe'll run our backup and we'll tell\nthe Windows Backup Administration Utility\n\n138\n00:07:47.117 --> 00:07:48.875\nyeah, go ahead and put it on the E: drive.\n\n139\n00:07:48.875 --> 00:07:51.065\nSo I'll say backup target.\n\n140\n00:07:51.065 --> 00:07:57.260\nAnd then :e : all right, next thing we're\ngonna do is we're gonna say include.\n\n141\n00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:03.100\nAnd we're going to say, c : all right.\n\n142\n00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.790\nNow remember that if I want the system\nstate to be backed up, I don't do,\n\n143\n00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.390\nlike we used to do,\nwhen we'd say system state backup.\n\n144\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:14.920\nKeep in mind we're gonna\ndo a dash all Critical, and\n\n145\n00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.400\nsince this is not a Linux system we might\nwant to take that double dash out of there\n\n146\n00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.510\nor it won't work.\n\n147\n00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.770\nIf you get any errors,\nit could pause your backup state.\n\n148\n00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.770\nOne of the things that you can\ndo is you can run it quietly, so\n\n149\n00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.630\nit just runs the back-up.\n\n150\n00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.100\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll just put quiet.\n\n151\n00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.130\nAnd we'll go ahead and run this.\n\n152\n00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.700\nNow, and we zoom in here,\nwe'll see a little bit of this.\n\n153\n00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.090\nIt could take some time here and\n\n154\n00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.120\nI won't torture you guys by\nmaking you watch the whole thing.\n\n155\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.050\nBut I do want you to see at\nleast the initial start of it.\n\n156\n00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:45.940\nAll right.\nWhat it does is it's going to backup\n\n157\n00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.310\nthings like your system volume, right.\n\n158\n00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.500\nThat protective volume that Windows\nuses to store its bootfiles, right.\n\n159\n00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.380\nYou might have seen it before,\nlittle 500 megabyte partition?\n\n160\n00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.910\nThat's one of the first\nthings it's gonna do.\n\n161\n00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.820\nOnce it, and you could see it here,\nwe'll back up the system reserved.\n\n162\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.140\nIt'll start there.\n\n163\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.700\nAnd then it's gonna go through the system,\nand\n\n164\n00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.710\nit's gonna start to back up data,\nthat has the archive bit present.\n\n165\n00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.740\nNow in earlier episodes, when we talked\nabout some of the characteristics\n\n166\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.215\nof your file system, one of the things\nthat we mentioned was an archive bit.\n\n167\n00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:18.250\nRight, well the archive bit is whats gonna\nbe used by the system in order to tell,\n\n168\n00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.690\nhey, do I have a copy of\nthis currently in my system?\n\n169\n00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.042\nIn any previous backup systems?\n\n170\n00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:25.890\nAll right, and here it goes,\n\n171\n00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.760\nyou can see that it's starting to\ncreate a backup of the volume.\n\n172\n00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.950\nNow, depending on what kind of backup\nyou're running's whether that archive\n\n173\n00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.470\nbit is cleared or not.\n\n174\n00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.990\nIn our case we're doing a full back up so\nit's gonna back everything up,\n\n175\n00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:43.110\nit's gonna mark it as backed up but\nthere again with full back ups,\n\n176\n00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.807\nthey don't really care\nabout that archive bit.\n\n177\n00:09:44.807 --> 00:09:48.498\nSo let's go ahead,\nlet's take some of the time out of this,\n\n178\n00:09:48.498 --> 00:09:51.360\nI've actually completed this\nin another machine here and\n\n179\n00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.270\nyou can see the results of\nthe back up once it's finished.\n\n180\n00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:59.290\nAll right, notice that it created that 500\nmegabyte backup of the system reserved.\n\n181\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.960\nYou can see it went through, and\nit backs up all the files, and\n\n182\n00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.980\nthen it lets you know.\n\n183\n00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.900\nBackup of the volume\ncompleted successfully, and\n\n184\n00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.920\nit shows you a summary of\nthe backup operation that happened.\n\n185\n00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.160\nReally, if you don't have a lot\nof information, you probably,\n\n186\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.450\nif we come back over here, you'll see\nthat this really doesn't take too long.\n\n187\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.520\nSo, this gives you the ability\nto back up your system.\n\n188\n00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.180\nIt is very, very important to keep\nthis in mind that you can do this.\n\n189\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.730\nNow, is this the only place\nwhere we can perform this?\n\n190\n00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.750\nAnd actually, Ronnie, you can see\nit really didn't take too long.\n\n191\n00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.510\nSometimes, depending on your data,\n\n192\n00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.110\nI know that Ronnie just\ngot a two terrabyte drive.\n\n193\n00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.680\nI can only imagine if we had\nthat hooked to this system and\n\n194\n00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.120\nit was full of data,\nit might be here a while.\n\n195\n00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.160\nThis might be a four or\nfive, 16-hour show.\n\n196\n00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.862\nSo, keep in mind, what we've done here\nis we've just done very small backups,\n\n197\n00:10:46.862 --> 00:10:48.400\nit could take a lot more time.\n\n198\n00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.350\nNow, I wanna take a second,\nwe're gonna show this in action but\n\n199\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.280\nbefore I clear the screen and move away\nfrom here, I want you to see that it dsys,\n\n200\n00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.530\nnotice that it says, Windows logs, Windows\nbackup, and it's got this number here.\n\n201\n00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:05.105\nThat's gonna be important that if you have\nmultiple backups stored in a location that\n\n202\n00:11:05.105 --> 00:11:09.107\nyou pay attention to those numbers\nbecause that's gonna be the number that\n\n203\n00:11:09.107 --> 00:11:12.620\nyou're gonna use when you call on\na specific version of a backup.\n\n204\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.002\nLike I said,\nwe'll show that here in a second.\n\n205\n00:11:16.002 --> 00:11:18.770\nAll right, now I'll go ahead and\nI'm gonna minimize this,\n\n206\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.590\nthat is how we back up\nthrough the command line.\n\n207\n00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.640\nNow we've also got another oldie but\ngoodie.\n\n208\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.890\nThis is the known as the Windows 7 backup.\n\n209\n00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.830\nAnd you might say well, Wes, I'm sure\nRonnie's over here saying wait wait wait\n\n210\n00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.080\nwait wait Wes, this is a Windows 10 show,\nwhy are we talking about Windows 7 backup?\n\n211\n00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.360\nWell, this was kept in\nthe operating system.\n\n212\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.510\nIf I drill down in here to\nthe control panel, system insecurity,\n\n213\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.160\nabout halfway down the page.\n\n214\n00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.730\nYou are gonna see right here,\nbackup and restore Windows 7.\n\n215\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.400\nSo what is a Windows 7 product\ndoing in a Windows 10 machine?\n\n216\n00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.310\nWell in Windows 8.1 this was kept in.\n\n217\n00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:57.238\nIt was for the purposes of backing\nup your Windows 7 machines.\n\n218\n00:11:57.238 --> 00:12:00.250\nIn Windows 8.1 they completely removed it.\n\n219\n00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.030\nThey didn't even allow you to have access,\nit was gone.\n\n220\n00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.526\nBut there was such an outcry that\nsaid this was a very easy system,\n\n221\n00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:10.786\nnice graphical user interface to backup\nyour systems that they decided to bring\n\n222\n00:12:10.786 --> 00:12:11.309\nit back.\n\n223\n00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.920\nNow that being said,\nhere's our backup system.\n\n224\n00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.730\nNotice that I've already got a schedule.\n\n225\n00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.800\nI've already got some backup data and\nwe can do some management options.\n\n226\n00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.350\nIt doesn't start out that way.\n\n227\n00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.260\nYou have to set a backup first.\n\n228\n00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.500\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n229\n00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.900\nLet's go over to a machine,\n\n230\n00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.630\nanother machine, where we haven't had this\nset up so you can see what it looks like.\n\n231\n00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:35.870\nAnd this is another one of those\nbackup types that could take a while.\n\n232\n00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.520\nCould take longer than\nwe have in this episode.\n\n233\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.300\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n234\n00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.480\nshow you how to set it up and then we'll\nshow you how to manage it as well.\n\n235\n00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.320\nNow the first thing you have to do is\nright over here you have the Set Backup.\n\n236\n00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.910\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna run that.\n\n237\n00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:54.320\nAnd it does a little querying of the\noperating system, getting things in place.\n\n238\n00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.110\nAnd then it looks and\n\n239\n00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.960\nit says what are the locations that\nyou have available, all right?\n\n240\n00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.850\nI want you to notice what's not here.\n\n241\n00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.680\nNotice that the C drive isn't here.\n\n242\n00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.510\nIf you can you can see the optical disk.\n\n243\n00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.670\nRight.\nYou can see\n\n244\n00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.250\ntwo internal drives that I have.\n\n245\n00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.490\nWell why is C not here?\n\n246\n00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.540\nC is not a viable backup location\nbecause you are taking backup of it.\n\n247\n00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.490\nNow the other thing I could do here,\nis I could say, save to the network.\n\n248\n00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.680\nAnd again, if I've got a file\nserver out of my network where I\n\n249\n00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.590\nwanna put this backup location,\nI can use the UNC path, right.\n\n250\n00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.330\nBackslash, backslash,\ncomputer name, or server name,\n\n251\n00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.720\nprobably in this case, backslash,\nwhatever the shared name is, okay.\n\n252\n00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.610\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust save it locally, and I'll use,\n\n253\n00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:41.290\nI've kind of set this drive up b and\ng there, for this drive here.\n\n254\n00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.330\nOr for this episode here.\n\n255\n00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.140\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll continue next to the wizard.\n\n256\n00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:51.210\nNow, this is another one of those\nreasons they really, I would believe,\n\n257\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.080\nthat they brought it back.\n\n258\n00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.870\nBecause it makes it very easy for\nthe average end user.\n\n259\n00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:55.760\nNow you yourself, and\n\n260\n00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.400\nthe viewers out there,\nprobably are not the average end user.\n\n261\n00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.500\nYou could be.\n\n262\n00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.500\nBut how about of something more advanced?\n\n263\n00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.310\nMaybe you don't want Windows to choose\nbecause, if you let Windows choose,\n\n264\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.040\nit's gonn look at the locations\nthat it thinks is most critical and\n\n265\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.680\ncrucial and it's gonna back those up.\n\n266\n00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.730\nIt's also going to create\nwhat's known as a system image.\n\n267\n00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.040\nNow, interestingly enough,\n\n268\n00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.310\nthis is another one of the good points\nof the Windows 7 Backup and Restore.\n\n269\n00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.780\nAnd that I believe was called\nthe Backup and Restore Center anyways.\n\n270\n00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.700\nVerbiage is not gonna be a problem here.\n\n271\n00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.280\nThen you can also choose.\n\n272\n00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.130\nSo you let me choose.\n\n273\n00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.170\nAnd that's the way we're gonna do it so\n\n274\n00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.800\nwe can show you these options that\nwe could just take for granted.\n\n275\n00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.500\nAll right and we'll choose next.\n\n276\n00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.860\nNow I want you to notice something here.\n\n277\n00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.280\nSo these are the locations that\nit gives you to backup, and\n\n278\n00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.390\nit also gives you the ability to\nget a little bit more granular.\n\n279\n00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.990\nNotice that if I don't want certain users,\n\n280\n00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.820\nI don't want to backup their data, that's\nokay I don't have to if I don't want to.\n\n281\n00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:55.390\nNotice that local disk C if I choose,\nit doesn't select it by default.\n\n282\n00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.910\nNow I can expand these out and\n\n283\n00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:01.450\nI could, let's say back up all the user\nprofiles if that's what I wanna back up.\n\n284\n00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.200\nNow if I scroll down here a little bit,\nhere's the other thing I want you to see.\n\n285\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.690\nAll right,\ninclude a system image of the drives.\n\n286\n00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.430\nSo, what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna create a vhdx file,\n\n287\n00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.690\nthat you're gonna use to turn around and\nrestore your computer.\n\n288\n00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:20.890\nIt's a file-by-file snapshot of\nthe entire drive of this machine.\n\n289\n00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.440\nAll right?\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n290\n00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.310\nI'm gonna uncheck that.\n\n291\n00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.300\nAnd I'm gonna leave the defaults.\n\n292\n00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.730\nAnd, for this purpose, I'm gonna go\nahead and uncheck the system image.\n\n293\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.980\nWe'll come back and\ntalk about it a little bit more here.\n\n294\n00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.750\nAnd I'm going to choose Next.\n\n295\n00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.250\nAll right.\n\n296\n00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:36.680\nSo, there we go.\n\n297\n00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.410\nWe've got our backup set.\n\n298\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.161\nAnd we saved the settings,\nand we run the backup.\n\n299\n00:15:41.161 --> 00:15:42.745\nAnd now, what we get the ability,\n\n300\n00:15:42.745 --> 00:15:46.471\nyou'll see that it's gonna start its\nprogress through backing up the machine.\n\n301\n00:15:46.471 --> 00:15:51.159\nAll right, now, Once that's done, I get\nthe ability that I could come in here, and\n\n302\n00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:54.660\nI could manage and\nchange some things if I needed to.\n\n303\n00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.760\nBut we'll go ahead, we'll let that\none run, and what I'm gonna do is,\n\n304\n00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.735\nI'm gonna bump on over to the one\nthat's already completed.\n\n305\n00:16:02.075 --> 00:16:06.125\nNow what this does, once we've configured\nthe back-up and restore, we've set\n\n306\n00:16:06.125 --> 00:16:10.095\nthe schedule, now we get the ability\nthat we can manage the space if we want.\n\n307\n00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:15.760\nSo notice that it tells me right here,\nI've got just under 40 gigs free of 50.\n\n308\n00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.312\nAnd if I wanted to click, it even tells\nme what the current back-up size is.\n\n309\n00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:25.690\nI could choose manage space, and\nI can see some summary information.\n\n310\n00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.740\nIf I happen to have a backup\njob currently running and\n\n311\n00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.250\nI wanted to update this information,\nyou guys know what the refresh option is.\n\n312\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.833\nThat's what it would do,\nit would refresh the statistics here.\n\n313\n00:16:35.833 --> 00:16:41.845\nNow, if I want to delete data file\nback-ups I could choose view back-ups.\n\n314\n00:16:41.845 --> 00:16:45.758\nYou can see I already have a backup that\nwas run earlier, maybe I get to a point\n\n315\n00:16:45.758 --> 00:16:49.879\nwhere I've got a current back up and\nmaybe I don't want the old backup anymore.\n\n316\n00:16:49.879 --> 00:16:53.499\nWell I can come in here and if I wanted to\nI can delete it, so it really gives you\n\n317\n00:16:53.499 --> 00:16:57.025\nthe ability to manage the space that\nyou're using for the backup itself.\n\n318\n00:16:57.025 --> 00:17:01.639\nSystem image, when you create\na system image keep in mind it is\n\n319\n00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:06.540\na file by file snapshot of the entire\ncontents of your hard drive.\n\n320\n00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.400\nIt can start adding up quick,\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n321\n00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:16.855\nWe'll drop down to File Eplorer and\nwe'll go look at those backups.\n\n322\n00:17:16.855 --> 00:17:21.107\nAnd here's another thing for the exam,\nwhen it looks for the backup folder.\n\n323\n00:17:21.107 --> 00:17:24.571\nI want you to remember this all\ntogether with the name here,\n\n324\n00:17:24.571 --> 00:17:27.907\nWindowsimagebackup just in\ncase it comes up on the exam.\n\n325\n00:17:27.907 --> 00:17:31.240\nAnd if we drilled down in here,\nyou'll see that I have two backups.\n\n326\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:37.490\nI have a backup prior to this computer\nhaving its computer name changed.\n\n327\n00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.220\nWhen that happens,\nit's gonna create a separate folder.\n\n328\n00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.854\nEven though it's the same computer,\n\n329\n00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:47.063\nit will not run in the same\nbackup destination, if you will.\n\n330\n00:17:47.063 --> 00:17:50.284\nSo let's go here, we'll go into client 3,\ngot to be an administrator.\n\n331\n00:17:50.284 --> 00:17:53.605\nYou're gonna see the UAC\ncome up a couple times here.\n\n332\n00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:54.740\nNow, I'm gonna get into the backup.\n\n333\n00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.350\nRemember that version\nnumber I was telling you?\n\n334\n00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:01.798\nHere you can see it in the graphical\nuser interface versus the command line.\n\n335\n00:18:01.798 --> 00:18:04.517\nWe'll get in here again, and\nthere's the UAC warning me hey,\n\n336\n00:18:04.517 --> 00:18:06.700\nyou don't have the permissions to be here.\n\n337\n00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.540\nNow notice right here, this big old,\nlong string of numbers.\n\n338\n00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.140\nThat's the GUID for the the hard drive,\nor the backup set that it created, and\n\n339\n00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.210\nI want you to notice what\nkind of file it made.\n\n340\n00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.840\nNotice that it's a vhdx file,\n\n341\n00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.720\nthese are the same files that we\nuse inside out hyper V servers.\n\n342\n00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.026\nSo its created this image\nof the entire drive and\n\n343\n00:18:28.026 --> 00:18:32.087\nthis is what would pile when\nwe do the system restoration.\n\n344\n00:18:32.087 --> 00:18:35.938\nSo that gives you just a look\nat where those files are and\n\n345\n00:18:35.938 --> 00:18:38.040\nwhat they really mean for us.\n\n346\n00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:44.530\nNow the next thing that we might wannado\nis, we might wanna schedule a backup.\n\n347\n00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:48.768\nSo if we're gonna schedule a backup,\nhow do we do that?\n\n348\n00:18:48.768 --> 00:18:52.236\nWell it's in the graphical\ninterface it's pretty easy.\n\n349\n00:18:52.236 --> 00:18:56.060\nAnd I got to say guys it's fairly easy\nin WB admin once you know a couple of\n\n350\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.160\nthe switches that you have to go through.\n\n351\n00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.350\nSo let me show you here.\n\n352\n00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:05.402\nNotice that is says Schedule, down here\nand for me it says Sunday at 7 PM.\n\n353\n00:19:05.402 --> 00:19:08.621\nWell maybe that's not where\nI want the schedule to be.\n\n354\n00:19:08.621 --> 00:19:11.146\nWell I can choose change settings and\n\n355\n00:19:11.146 --> 00:19:16.616\nwhen I choose change settings notice\nthat we've already seen this interface.\n\n356\n00:19:16.616 --> 00:19:18.550\nWe've seen this when we started it up.\n\n357\n00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.150\nNot only do I get the ability\nto change schedules, but\n\n358\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.910\nI could change the backup location.\n\n359\n00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:27.366\nIf this time I decided hey,\nI don't want a local copy anymore.\n\n360\n00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:32.720\nI wanna put this up on the file server,\nwell I could say save to network.\n\n361\n00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.380\nAnd I could save it with a UNC path and\nappropriate username, and\n\n362\n00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.940\ncredentials that allow you to log in and\nsee that shares.\n\n363\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.380\nSo if this doesn't work, check your\nshare permissions on the file server.\n\n364\n00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.240\nAnd again, this is not really about\npermissions on file servers, but as it\n\n365\n00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.330\nrelates to your backup not completing\nsuccessfully, it's very important.\n\n366\n00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.715\nCuz remember,\nsomebody told me a awhile ago,\n\n367\n00:19:53.715 --> 00:19:56.297\nyou never wanna wait until\nyou need your backups.\n\n368\n00:19:56.297 --> 00:20:01.556\nTo confirm that those back\nups are were should be and\n\n369\n00:20:01.556 --> 00:20:04.623\nthat they are valid backups.\n\n370\n00:20:04.623 --> 00:20:07.180\nSo we'll go ahead and\ncancel out of that and I'll choose next.\n\n371\n00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.372\nAll of this was to change the schedule and\nas you can see, we're just\n\n372\n00:20:10.372 --> 00:20:14.068\ngoing through the same process again,\nand I'll go ahead and go through this.\n\n373\n00:20:14.068 --> 00:20:16.740\nWe'll leave this in,\nwe're not changing anything here.\n\n374\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.366\nBut notice something right here,\nnotice this, every Sunday at 7 PM,\n\n375\n00:20:21.366 --> 00:20:24.152\nwe get the ability to change the schedule.\n\n376\n00:20:24.152 --> 00:20:29.120\nAnd if we backup, run the backup on\na schedule, and it says recommended.\n\n377\n00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.805\nI could change this,\nif I decide that I wanna run at 11 PM.\n\n378\n00:20:33.805 --> 00:20:37.390\n7 PM, I might still be working with\nmy files and who knows, I might\n\n379\n00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:41.460\nneed the performance of my computer so\nagain, you modify it to suit your needs.\n\n380\n00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.090\nNow we'll go ahead, and\n\n381\n00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.690\nwe'll just cancel out of that and\nwe'll cancel out of this as well.\n\n382\n00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:52.030\nAnd let's go ahead and what we're gonna do\nis we're drop down to the command line and\n\n383\n00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.790\nwe're gonna see how would\nwe schedule a backup\n\n384\n00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.600\nif we drop down to the command line.\n\n385\n00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.560\nWell let's go ahead and\nlet's look at that.\n\n386\n00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.680\nSo back at the command line,\nin this case PowerShell.\n\n387\n00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.820\nLet me go ahead and\nclear all this mess off of here.\n\n388\n00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:14.376\nNow here's what we do, if you\nremember that I said that the enable\n\n389\n00:21:14.376 --> 00:21:18.881\nbackup is also an option,\ndon't think a start backup.\n\n390\n00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:21.846\nThat runs a current backup operation.\n\n391\n00:21:21.846 --> 00:21:26.788\nAn enable backup is the option that\nyou're gonna use in order to create or\n\n392\n00:21:26.788 --> 00:21:28.339\nmodify the schedule.\n\n393\n00:21:28.339 --> 00:21:33.203\nSo we're gonna do wbadmin,\nwe'll do a space,\n\n394\n00:21:33.203 --> 00:21:38.203\nwe'll do enable backup and\nwe're gonna include\n\n395\n00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.255\nC: and we're gonna add target.\n\n396\n00:21:47.255 --> 00:21:52.440\nHere's what that add target comes in, I\nwas telling opposite of the backup target.\n\n397\n00:21:54.390 --> 00:22:01.197\nWe'll do add target And\n\n398\n00:22:01.197 --> 00:22:07.562\nwe'll say, e:, and now we're\ngoing to add the schedule option.\n\n399\n00:22:07.562 --> 00:22:11.095\nWhen we add schedule,\nunderstand that it's hour,\n\n400\n00:22:11.095 --> 00:22:14.240\nhour: minute, minute format, if you will.\n\n401\n00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.433\nSo the HH:MM format for\n\n402\n00:22:17.433 --> 00:22:21.907\nthose of you guys, look at that.\n\n403\n00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:27.334\nLet's say, we might want to do this at 3\nAM or maybe even 3:30 AM, and I run this.\n\n404\n00:22:27.334 --> 00:22:28.970\nNow, notice what it tells me.\n\n405\n00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.500\nIt's really good in the fact that\nit gives you a lot of output,\n\n406\n00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.760\nlets you know exactly what's\ngoing to go on in this backup.\n\n407\n00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.110\nIt tells you that we're not doing\na bare metal recovery backup.\n\n408\n00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:42.147\nThat's where the all critical\nis gonna be included.\n\n409\n00:22:42.147 --> 00:22:48.190\nSystem state backup, again all critical\nbackup and then you can do files excluded.\n\n410\n00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.340\nYou can also do volume shadow copy.\n\n411\n00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:55.100\nKeep in mind your VSS,\nit keeps versions of your files there, so\n\n412\n00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.810\nthat you can recover them to\nan earlier state if you need to.\n\n413\n00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.590\nIf you do that, that's up to you.\n\n414\n00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:03.188\nIf you wanna include that,\n\n415\n00:23:03.188 --> 00:23:07.731\nyou just do a vss copy, excuse me.\n\n416\n00:23:07.731 --> 00:23:09.740\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nsay yes, to this.\n\n417\n00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.110\nAnd it takes just a second and\n\n418\n00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.300\nwhat it does,\na little bit when it completes right.\n\n419\n00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.586\nWhen it completes right you really\ndon't see much information and\n\n420\n00:23:19.586 --> 00:23:23.470\nit's only when it doesn't complete right\nthat you get all these errors here.\n\n421\n00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.012\nSo now, I've got it scheduled.\n\n422\n00:23:25.012 --> 00:23:26.250\nWhat if I made a mistake?\n\n423\n00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:30.500\nWhat if I said, well 3 AM,\nno, I wanna change this.\n\n424\n00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.700\nWell it's easy.\n\n425\n00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:37.729\nAll you have to do to remove any existing\nscheduled back ups is just to a wbadmin\n\n426\n00:23:40.771 --> 00:23:48.192\nAnd then it is going to be disable Backup.\n\n427\n00:23:48.192 --> 00:23:51.442\nNow it's gonna tell you right there,\nwell wait a second here.\n\n428\n00:23:51.442 --> 00:23:54.762\nAre you sure you wanna stop\nrunning schedule backups?\n\n429\n00:23:54.762 --> 00:23:55.960\nAnd we'll say yes.\n\n430\n00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.360\nAnd they have been disabled, all right?\n\n431\n00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.830\nKeep in mind that it lets you know,\nonce you disabled them,\n\n432\n00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:06.940\nthat you're gonna have to run these\ncommands again in order to, the ones I\n\n433\n00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.009\njust showed you with the schedule option,\nin order to set another backup.\n\n434\n00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.460\nNow what if we need to form a restoration.\n\n435\n00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.000\nWe've talked about backup but\n\n436\n00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.310\nyou also sometimes need to\nrecover information as well.\n\n437\n00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:23.350\nWell, let's go ahead and let's show\nyou what a recovery would look like.\n\n438\n00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.680\nI'm going to go ahead,\nI've got a little backup test file.\n\n439\n00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.710\nI'm going to delete that and\nwe'll get rid of that.\n\n440\n00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:32.910\nI got another file down here in the user\nprofile in the documents section.\n\n441\n00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:35.730\nSecond test file here.\n\n442\n00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:37.860\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe're gonna delete that.\n\n443\n00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.480\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nget rid of it from the Recycle Bin.\n\n444\n00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.370\nAll right, so right?\n\n445\n00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.400\nWe've been doing this with\na graphical user interface and\n\n446\n00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.810\nwe've been doing this with a command line.\n\n447\n00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.450\nSo I should be able, right?\n\n448\n00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:57.000\nIn theory, to jump down to the command\nline, and be able to run a recovery.\n\n449\n00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.142\nNow remember I told you that\nin order to run the recovery,\n\n450\n00:25:00.142 --> 00:25:03.036\nyou have to know what version\nof the backup you have.\n\n451\n00:25:03.036 --> 00:25:07.152\nWell you say, well Wes, how would I even\nknow if I had more than one version.\n\n452\n00:25:07.152 --> 00:25:13.920\nWell, that's where we get wbadmin get and\nversions.\n\n453\n00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.300\nNow lot of information here, right?\n\n454\n00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.330\nWhole bunch of, I've got quite a few\ndifferent backups that I've done here and\n\n455\n00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:24.990\nwhat I really care about are these\nversion identifiers, right?\n\n456\n00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.200\nYou can see them right here.\n\n457\n00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.880\nYou could see it right here.\n\n458\n00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.260\nMakes it really easy now,\nthat you can copy, cut and\n\n459\n00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.660\npaste from the command line, today.\n\n460\n00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.700\nYou would have to write these down, but\n\n461\n00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:42.560\nwe can select a backup and I'm just\ngonna select that identifier, right?\n\n462\n00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.090\nAnd copy it.\n\n463\n00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:45.560\nRight click and\nit copies it to the clipboard.\n\n464\n00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:50.840\nNow, to do a recovery,\nwe're going to do wb Admin space\n\n465\n00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.850\nstart recovery and\nwe're gonna do a version\n\n466\n00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.690\nand I'm just gonna right click,\nput that version number there.\n\n467\n00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.580\nAll right, once that's there,\n\n468\n00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.330\nthe next thing I have to enter is\nsomething known as an item type.\n\n469\n00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:10.620\nAll right so\nwe're gonna do dash Item type, and\n\n470\n00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.560\nin this case for me, it's a volume.\n\n471\n00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:18.080\nAnd before I run this, let me show you\nanother thing that's really important\n\n472\n00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.210\nwhen you do these get versions.\n\n473\n00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.570\nNotice it tells you what it can recover.\n\n474\n00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:29.600\nI've got volumes, files, applications,\na bare metal recovery, and system state.\n\n475\n00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.520\nAll right, well,\nwe talked about what the Systems State is.\n\n476\n00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.890\nAnd I'm pretty sure you guys know\nwhat applications of the files are.\n\n477\n00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.410\nWhat do they mean about\nthat bare metal recovery?\n\n478\n00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.450\nRemember that VDX file we created,\nthe image.\n\n479\n00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.350\nI don't have to have an operating\nsystem on this machine.\n\n480\n00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:46.360\nExcuse me, I don't have to have\nall of the information prior.\n\n481\n00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.220\nIt will literally do exactly that.\n\n482\n00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.719\nThe bare metal recovery.\n\n483\n00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:51.960\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n484\n00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.710\nWe got item type volume.\n\n485\n00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.140\nThe next thing that we're\ngonna do here is items.\n\n486\n00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:01.170\nWhat are the items that we're gonna\nview or that we're gonna restore.\n\n487\n00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.280\nWe're gonna do items and c.\n\n488\n00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.440\nAll right, now we're gonna run this.\n\n489\n00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.300\nOr maybe not.\n\n490\n00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.180\nI want you to notice what has happened.\n\n491\n00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:17.050\nAlright, now we've talked about different\ntechnologies inside of windows as we\n\n492\n00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:23.630\ngo through the different editions or\nversions really, being deprecate, rIght?\n\n493\n00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:25.480\nThis is one of those.\n\n494\n00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.260\nWB admin doesn't allow you in Windows 10\nto do a recovery from the command line.\n\n495\n00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.100\nYou have to use the backup and restore.\n\n496\n00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.860\nRemember, they've got reset your PC,\nthey've got refresh your PC.\n\n497\n00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.640\nThey've got all these technologies and\n\n498\n00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:40.060\nfile history all these technologies\nin order to recover information.\n\n499\n00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.210\nIt's not supported I want you\nto remember that for the exam.\n\n500\n00:27:44.232 --> 00:27:48.110\nAll right, so how would we do this,\nwell this is where we get the ability.\n\n501\n00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.850\nTo go back to the graphical\nuser interface.\n\n502\n00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:55.190\nNotice it says Manage Space.\n\n503\n00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:56.440\nWe are going to go ahead and click that.\n\n504\n00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.860\nGive me one second,\nI don't know why I said Manage Space.\n\n505\n00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:08.060\nThis big button down here that\nsays restore my files, all right?\n\n506\n00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.710\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose that, restore my files.\n\n507\n00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:16.360\nAll right, and it's gonna give\nyou the ability to search for\n\n508\n00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.340\nthe files that you wanna restore.\n\n509\n00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.550\nAll right, now let me go ahead and\nbrowse for folders.\n\n510\n00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.380\nAnd here's my backup of C.\n\n511\n00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.300\nNotice it says backup of sequel and\nthen it's on the drive that we use\n\n512\n00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:32.000\nthis as a backup and\nrecovery to put those files on.\n\n513\n00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.160\nSo we're gonna select that,\nwe're gonna add that photo,\n\n514\n00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.830\nwe're gonna choose next and it's gonna\nask you, do you wanna restore it to\n\n515\n00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:41.690\nthe original location or do you have\na new location that you can do this to?\n\n516\n00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:47.140\nAnd if you're like change the hierarchy,\nif you will, of your naming convention.\n\n517\n00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.880\nIt's not c colon, it's d colon,\nyou can change it.\n\n518\n00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.410\nIf you use original location,\nit does exactly what it says,\n\n519\n00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.393\nWindows knows exactly where to put these,\nall right?\n\n520\n00:28:54.393 --> 00:28:55.100\nAnd we'll choose restore.\n\n521\n00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.920\nAll right, and notice it's asking, hey,\n\n522\n00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.010\nthere's a couple of things that you\nwant to copy and replace, all right?\n\n523\n00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:03.550\nI'm just going to copy and replace.\n\n524\n00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.910\nAnd you know what it is?\n\n525\n00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.300\nIt's the boot files.\n\n526\n00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.850\nIt doesn't like the boot files.\n\n527\n00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.180\nAll right,\nwe'll try to skip all these files.\n\n528\n00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.650\nThere's a couple of log\nfiles you'll notice.\n\n529\n00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:18.100\nNow I want you to notice in the\nbackground, this was an online recovery.\n\n530\n00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.800\nNotice that my file is back there.\n\n531\n00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.800\nRemember what happened, so\nwhen it looks at certain files,\n\n532\n00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.240\nit's not gonna be able\nto recover it online.\n\n533\n00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.030\nAgain, that's why I was\ngetting that error there.\n\n534\n00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.850\nAll right now, let's go ahead one last\nthing and let's check to see if that\n\n535\n00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:38.590\nother file is down there in\nthe documents here where I deleted it.\n\n536\n00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:41.290\nAnd sure enough,\nyou can see the second file is back.\n\n537\n00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.220\nSo we've been able to\nrestore user's files.\n\n538\n00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.710\nNow this goes a little bit\nmore than just file history,\n\n539\n00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:50.770\ncuz in the context of the way I used this,\nhonestly you could use file history and\n\n540\n00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:51.960\nyou can save yourself some time.\n\n541\n00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.250\nBut when you need to do things\nlike additional drives,\n\n542\n00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:58.580\nremember file history only works on\nthe libraries, the user profiles.\n\n543\n00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.780\nIt doesn't work on SQL and\nadditional drives like we've seen here.\n\n544\n00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.200\nSo you can add those and that's one of\nthe benefits of the backup and restore.\n\n545\n00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.730\nOperation here.\n\n546\n00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:09.960\nSo, Ronny,\nit's a fairly straightforward process.\n\n547\n00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.370\nIt's not too difficult once you\nknow the switches for the WB admin,\n\n548\n00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:14.620\nyou can schedule this.\n\n549\n00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:17.960\nAnd that's one of the benefits\nof not to schedule them.\n\n550\n00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.160\nYou can schedule them in both of them.\n\n551\n00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.540\nBut with WB admin,\nyou get the ability to script too.\n\n552\n00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.160\nBecause it is in the command line.\n\n553\n00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.550\nThe graphical user interface.\n\n554\n00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:29.180\nKeep in mind that they brought it back\ninto Windows 10 here, because it was\n\n555\n00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:33.890\na great way to basically recover your\nmachine should anything go wrong.\n\n556\n00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:36.380\nI know we're probably a little pressed for\ntime, Ronnie.\n\n557\n00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.980\nI do wanna mention one\nmore thing here because\n\n558\n00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.550\nwe wouldn't be doing you guys any justice.\n\n559\n00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:43.510\nGoing back to the Backup and\nRestore I did mention that\n\n560\n00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:47.890\nthey're one of the biggest benefits,\nI don't know if it's the biggest benefit.\n\n561\n00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:51.980\nBut another great benefit of this is\nbeing able to create a system image.\n\n562\n00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.880\nI don't have to pick and\nchoose if I create a system image.\n\n563\n00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.790\nIt backs up everything.\n\n564\n00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:00.530\nAnd then the repair disk.\n\n565\n00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:06.080\nNow we talked about creating\na recovery disk In other episodes here.\n\n566\n00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.320\nKeep in mind what the system\nrepair disk does,\n\n567\n00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:13.500\nit takes the Windows recovery environment\nand slaps it on an optical drive.\n\n568\n00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.090\nAnd then what you can do is you\ncan boot to the recovery disk, or\n\n569\n00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:20.230\nthe system repair disk,\nthat allows you on the USB thumb drive or\n\n570\n00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.360\nthe USB drive to plug\nit in the machine and\n\n571\n00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:27.790\npoint the repair disk to the appropriate\ninformation in order to do your backup.\n\n572\n00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.370\nSo did want to make mention of that.\n\n573\n00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.510\nKeep in mind that was another one that\nI'm sure got a lot of complains when it\n\n574\n00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.410\nwas gone.\n\n575\n00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:36.180\nIt's probably one of the reasons\nthey brought it back in.\n\n576\n00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.750\n>> And with Windows 10 there are so\n\n577\n00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:41.580\nmany options out there but the idea of\nbackup and restore is still important.\n\n578\n00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.860\nEven though file history is kinda\none of the more recommended methods\n\n579\n00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.110\nthat's great if you need\nto backup certain files.\n\n580\n00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:50.820\nBut what Wes has just showed us,\nwhether we're using Wbadmin or\n\n581\n00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:55.790\nwe're using the Windows 7 backup and\nrecovery, well, both of those give\n\n582\n00:31:55.790 --> 00:32:00.680\nus options that go beyond the idea, here,\nof just restoring a few files, right?\n\n583\n00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.360\nSo with WB Admin, and what we also\nsaw inside of the control panel,\n\n584\n00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.940\nwe can actually back up the entire\nfile system if we need to.\n\n585\n00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.290\nWe can actually make a complete\nsystem image backup if we need to.\n\n586\n00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.840\nWe can actually go in there and\nbe very selective, if we want to, as well.\n\n587\n00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.560\nBut this is a bit more\npowerful of a tool and\n\n588\n00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.030\nrequires a little bit more knowledge and\nsetup.\n\n589\n00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:24.230\nMost end users are probably not going to\ncare too much about these things, and\n\n590\n00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:28.010\nin an enterprise environment the idea of\nactually backing up individual desktops\n\n591\n00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:30.140\nmay not be a high priority for us.\n\n592\n00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:34.310\nBut if that machine needs to go ahead and\nactually be imaged again, you don't have\n\n593\n00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:38.100\na great solution you may want to check\nthis solution out to help you out here.\n\n594\n00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:42.230\nAs far as the exam goes, you wanna\nmake sure that you do pay attention of\n\n595\n00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.480\nwhat they are requiring of\nyou when you run a backup.\n\n596\n00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.400\nAnd it's just a few simple fouls.\n\n597\n00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.970\nYou may go to foul history and\n\n598\n00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:51.470\nthey ask about making sure you\nrecovered the system state data.\n\n599\n00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.800\nWell you may not be able to just\ndo that when you're told, so\n\n600\n00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.600\nthis is where you have the options\nthat Wes showed as well and\n\n601\n00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.700\nthat's what you want to make\nsure that you understand.\n\n602\n00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.990\nTake a look at these options again,\nespecially the command line options.\n\n603\n00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:08.050\nThey are very heavily asked on the exam,\nI should say.\n\n604\n00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:10.820\nSo you make sure you go ahead and\nfocus in on that as well.\n\n605\n00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.390\nSo great episode for you to rewatch again.\n\n606\n00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.440\nThat's a great place for\nus to sign off then.\n\n607\n00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.760\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie

00:00:19.240\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today we're\ndoing installing and configuring Windows.\n\n4\n00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.430\nAnd specifically in this episode.\n\n5\n00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.970\nwe're gonna be looking at\nsupporting device security.\n\n6\n00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.160\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.070\nHow you doing, Wes?\n\n8\n00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.860\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.970\nThat's right, we're gonna come at\nyou with a alphabet soup today.\n\n10\n00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.840\nIt's acronym city.\n\n11\n00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.020\nSo, I hope you're hungry out there, but\n\n12\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.840\nwe'll try to help you as we\nfeed you this alphabet soup.\n\n13\n00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.386\nWe'll try to let you know what\nsome of these acronyms about.\n\n14\n00:00:41.386 --> 00:00:44.760\nSo in Windows 10 there are a lot\nof advancement on how you can\n\n15\n00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.570\nmaintain the security of your devices and\nthe applications.\n\n16\n00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.070\nThere's a lot of different technologies\nthat allow us to do this, but\n\n17\n00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.470\nthere are some that we want you\nto be aware of for the exam.\n\n18\n00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.200\nOne of the first ones that we're gonna\ntalk about is a technology know as\n\n19\n00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.270\nDevice Guard.\n\n20\n00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.760\nAnd Device Guard has some interesting\ncapabilities in what it can do as far as\n\n21\n00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.680\nsecuring our devices.\n\n22\n00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.190\nSo I've gone ahead and\nmade a little diagram here,\n\n23\n00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.840\nso we'll take a look at that.\n\n24\n00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.060\nThe traditional methods that\nwe talk about when it comes to\n\n25\n00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.590\ncontrolling our applications, right?\n\n26\n00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.190\nThe code that runs on our machines.\n\n27\n00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.440\nNot just applications drivers as\nyou will as well is that, well,\n\n28\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.100\nwe've got one thing that's been around for\na bit.\n\n29\n00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.770\nRight, that's called the user mode frame,\nuser mode driver framework, right?\n\n30\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.010\nThe other thing you could look at is\nkernel mode in kernel mode code integrity.\n\n31\n00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.250\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n32\n00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.250\nThat's a fancy acronym that\nreally just stands for\n\n33\n00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.540\nnothing more than if you are gonna install\ndrivers that interact with a kernel,\n\n34\n00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.220\nthey've gotta be digitally signed.\n\n35\n00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.380\nThat's been in Windows for awhile.\n\n36\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.030\nSo that's not really\nanything new to Windows.\n\n37\n00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.570\nAnd when it comes to applications running,\nwhat applications,\n\n38\n00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.843\na lot of times we take\na white-listing approach, right?\n\n39\n00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:58.223\nWe block communications with firewalls,\nwe have the user account control,\n\n40\n00:01:58.223 --> 00:02:00.096\nthat's been around since Vista, right?\n\n41\n00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:04.076\nIt requires administrative level\ncredentials if it's going to write\n\n42\n00:02:04.076 --> 00:02:05.768\nto portions of the registry.\n\n43\n00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:09.820\nSo we have some of these technologies that\nhave really been around for a bit, right?\n\n44\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.130\nYou've got your user mode and\n\n45\n00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.995\nthat's protected from\nthe kernel memory if you will.\n\n46\n00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:18.680\nCause it, think about it if you got\na piece of code that interferes with\n\n47\n00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.180\nthe kernel, it interferes with\nall of the drivers, right?\n\n48\n00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.580\nThat's a unified memory access, right?\n\n49\n00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.230\nThe kernel sharing that memory\nspace with other drivers and\n\n50\n00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.730\nif one little piece of code causes\na problem, it causes a problem for\n\n51\n00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.110\nthe entire system typically where we're\ngetting things like blue screens as well.\n\n52\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.670\nRight?\n\n53\n00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.600\nWe can control what applications run as\nwell like through things like app locker,\n\n54\n00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.830\nthat's been in Windows for\na while as well.\n\n55\n00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.510\nBut there is something\nnew that comes in and\n\n56\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.870\nthat's the virtualization\ntechnology that we have too.\n\n57\n00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.399\nWe're gonna implement something known,\nwell implement something known as\n\n58\n00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.800\nVirtualization based security.\n\n59\n00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.000\nWe still have some of those,\nall those old technology,\n\n60\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.850\nnot old technology but\ntechnologies that we had prior,\n\n61\n00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.090\nfirewalls, again,\nblocking communications that we want.\n\n62\n00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.180\nThe USC, that user mode code, or\nnot the user mode code integrity,\n\n63\n00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.310\nthe kernel mode code integrity, right?\n\n64\n00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.230\nSign drivers.\n\n65\n00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.440\nWell now it adds in something else and\n\n66\n00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.350\nthat's something known as\nthe user mode code integrity.\n\n67\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.370\nNow what does this mean?\n\n68\n00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.860\nWell, now not only do you have\nto worry about things like your\n\n69\n00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.000\nkernel mode drivers\nbeing digitally signed.\n\n70\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.690\nAny piece of software that's gonna run on\nthe machine has to be digitally signed.\n\n71\n00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.480\nAnd that is a little bit different,\nbecause we're not even going to install\n\n72\n00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.590\nthe software unless it's first, again,\nsigned by our company and we trust it.\n\n73\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.990\nThis is one of the things that\nreally benefits us with DeviceGuard,\n\n74\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.000\nis that you couple in things like HyperV\nand the virtualization technologies.\n\n75\n00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.740\nAnd now you have this isolated\narea where it's running\n\n76\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.930\nin a virtualization-based portion\nof your operating system.\n\n77\n00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.590\nAnd it's really protected from\nthe other components, right?\n\n78\n00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.260\nSo we have now this middle man\nin-between the operating system and\n\n79\n00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.010\nsome of the software that is running.\n\n80\n00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.500\nNow, how do we control this?\n\n81\n00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.780\nWell, we control this through what\nare known as code integrity policies.\n\n82\n00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.200\nAgain this user mode code integrity again\nis digitally signing these applications\n\n83\n00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.300\nallowing them to run on the machines\nbefore they ever get installed,\n\n84\n00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.760\nand how do we control that?\n\n85\n00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.210\nAnd again,\nthat's their code integrity policies.\n\n86\n00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.270\nNow, if you're gonna deploy something\nlike device guard the first you have to\n\n87\n00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.030\ndo is you have to create\na code integrity policy.\n\n88\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.430\nNow the code integrity policy contains\nwhat are known as policy rules.\n\n89\n00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.480\nAnd the policy rules tell you, for\ninstance, if that user code integrity,\n\n90\n00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.860\nagain, user code mode integrity,\nis enabled or not.\n\n91\n00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.750\nAgain, if that policy enables it,\nit means that's software that is not\n\n92\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.790\npresent and accepted,\nwill not be able to even be installed.\n\n93\n00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.304\nThe next thing that you can do and is\nsign the code integrity policies as well.\n\n94\n00:04:59.304 --> 00:05:01.150\nThey've gotta have a digital\nsignature on them,\n\n95\n00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.210\nletting them know that we're not\nonly do we trust the software.\n\n96\n00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.700\nBut we trust the policy\nthat is going to configure,\n\n97\n00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.670\ntell us whether that code is\nrequired to have its integrity, too.\n\n98\n00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.890\nNow a couple different\nways that you can do this.\n\n99\n00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.650\nWhen you deploy these policies,\nyou can deploy them through group policy.\n\n100\n00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.010\nIn fact, I've got a machine here.\n\n101\n00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.750\nLet's jump on over to it real quick and\n\n102\n00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.150\nlet me show you a group policy\nwhere you can control device guard.\n\n103\n00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.180\nAgain, with the virtualization\ntechnologies it is really, really great.\n\n104\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.720\nIt takes advantage of\nthings like your intel,\n\n105\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.900\nwhat is it the Intel VT virtualization\ntechnology, AMD has their AMDV,\n\n106\n00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.300\nit also runs on second\nlevel address translation.\n\n107\n00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.440\nSo you have kind of like this middle\nman if you will between your running\n\n108\n00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.980\noperating system and the hardware and\nessentially isolating that communication.\n\n109\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.030\nNow, let's go ahead and\nlet's look at where that policy is.\n\n110\n00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.070\nThere's a couple of things that\nmight come up on the exam.\n\n111\n00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.710\nThey might ask you how you deploy it.\n\n112\n00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.710\nAnd, again, remember that's with\nthose code integrity policies.\n\n113\n00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.150\nBut they also might ask you,\nwell, how do I do that?\n\n114\n00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.830\nHow do I deploy those policies?\n\n115\n00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.330\nAnd like any other policy, this gonna be\nsomething that's controlled through GPOs.\n\n116\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.100\nWe get down in here to\nadministrative templates and\n\n117\n00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.960\nsystem, you will see that right here\nthere is something called device guard.\n\n118\n00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.560\nAll right?\nAnd\n\n119\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.970\nin device guard this is where,\nnow I'm on a local machine guys so\n\n120\n00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.040\nlet's just be like I said I've got\nmister active directory over here.\n\n121\n00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.980\nSo, I'd better be specific on this one.\n\n122\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.350\nThis is the local policy that's\non the windows machine, so\n\n123\n00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.010\nit'll effect this windows machine,\nit won't effect anybody else.\n\n124\n00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.600\nSo, if you're deploying this\nto the enterprize level,\n\n125\n00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.980\nyou want to make sure that you're\ndoing this on the domain controller or\n\n126\n00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.920\nit's not gonna have an effect.\n\n127\n00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.290\nAlright, so lets go ahead,\nwe'll look at that.\n\n128\n00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:50.600\nLet me see if I can zoom in here a little\nbit, make this a little bit easier to see.\n\n129\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.932\nThere we go.\n\n130\n00:06:52.932 --> 00:06:57.570\nAll right, so deploy code integrity\npolicy, we double click on that GPO\n\n131\n00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.170\nsetting, there's a couple of things\nthat's going to allow us to do.\n\n132\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.940\nWe're gonna talk about another\none coming up in a second\n\n133\n00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.550\nthat's called credential guard.\n\n134\n00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.450\nAnd one of the things I love telling\npeople that are studying for these exams.\n\n135\n00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.870\nIf you can remember, two different\ntechnologies and one place you deploy them\n\n136\n00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.410\nboth, you've saved your stuff a little\nbit of memorization so keep that in mind.\n\n137\n00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.600\nYou can deploy not only device\nguard here but credential guard.\n\n138\n00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.300\nWe're going to talk about\nthat coming up in a second.\n\n139\n00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.680\nAll right, so\nit's just as simple as enabling it.\n\n140\n00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.940\nAnd once you have your policy,\nyou just, where's the policy stored?\n\n141\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.480\nOnce you have it stored in a location,\n\n142\n00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.190\nit can be stored on the local machine\ntypically in an enterprise environment.\n\n143\n00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.400\nThere'll probably be some\nintermediate file share.\n\n144\n00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.280\nAnd then you can attach it to the GPO and\nthen you can deploy it out.\n\n145\n00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.482\nAll right.\n\n146\n00:07:40.482 --> 00:07:45.136\nSome of the things that I also\nlike to just kind of recap,\n\n147\n00:07:45.136 --> 00:07:50.188\nmaking sure that you understand\nthat it does require your CPU\n\n148\n00:07:50.188 --> 00:07:55.459\nhardware level virtualization,\nagain, with your intel VT.\n\n149\n00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:57.967\nAgain, Or AMD, if you're in the AMD world,\n\n150\n00:07:57.967 --> 00:08:00.806\nAMD Virtualization,\nsecond level translation.\n\n151\n00:08:00.806 --> 00:08:04.410\nKeep in mind that the kernel\nmode integrity's been there.\n\n152\n00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:08.350\nWe cannot install unsigned\ndrivers at the kernel mode.\n\n153\n00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.090\nAnd today, now it's getting\nto where we can also enforce\n\n154\n00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.030\nthat integrity at the user level as well.\n\n155\n00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.050\nWhich is something that'll\nkeep your system stable and\n\n156\n00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.350\nhopefully a little bit more secure.\n\n157\n00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.980\nAll right there's one other thing Mike\nthat I think I forgot yes they like\n\n158\n00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:30.294\nto bring up on tests where in the registry\nyou make these modifications.\n\n159\n00:08:30.294 --> 00:08:35.430\nAnd as we've talked about before\nin many of our episodes and\n\n160\n00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.570\nreally in many of the different series\nthat we have in Windows, I want you to\n\n161\n00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.720\nkeep in mind if you're modifying\nthe registry know what you're doing.\n\n162\n00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.880\nI stay out of the registry\nbecause there's very,\n\n163\n00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.320\nvery easy to make a change and well\nthe whole thing that you're trying to do\n\n164\n00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.860\nhere is maintain the integrity\nof your operating system and\n\n165\n00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.110\nyou modify the registry wrong well you\ncould cash the whole operating system.\n\n166\n00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.900\nSo in trying to make it more secure,\n\n167\n00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.750\nyou can end up locking yourself\nout of your own machines.\n\n168\n00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.950\nNot that I've ever done that.\n\n169\n00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.542\n>> No, never.\n\n170\n00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.240\nVery easy to back up the registry\nthough before we try to make any\n\n171\n00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.070\nchanges to it is always a good safe guard.\n\n172\n00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.680\n>> Definitely, so let's go ahead and\nshow you where that is.\n\n173\n00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.300\nWe're still on that same,\nthat same Windows machine,\n\n174\n00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.010\nall I'm gonna do is go down here.\n\n175\n00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.440\nI guess I could have\nlaunched it from PowerShell.\n\n176\n00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.030\nAnd we're gonna our good old reg edit.\n\n177\n00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:24.220\nAll right, now give you a couple, I'll\nshow a couple different options for this.\n\n178\n00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.100\nAnd so, let's go ahead and\nlet's look at the long drawn out path.\n\n179\n00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.560\nWe'll take the scenic route.\n\n180\n00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.150\nI've already been in here so\nyou can remember that the registry editor\n\n181\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.830\ntypically keeps things expanded\nif you've been in here before.\n\n182\n00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.760\nWe're gonna be under HKey local machine.\n\n183\n00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.650\nThen we're gonna be under System and\n\n184\n00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.340\nthis is the Current Control Set and\nthen Control.\n\n185\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.170\nAll right.\n\n186\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.050\nNow in here,\nif we scroll down a little bit,\n\n187\n00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.325\nyou're gonna see, yep,\nthere it is, Device Guard.\n\n188\n00:09:49.325 --> 00:09:51.180\nDeice Guard is in the registry, and\n\n189\n00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.300\nwhat we wanna look at is just\na couple of these options here.\n\n190\n00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.610\nNotice it says\nEnable Virtualization-Based Security.\n\n191\n00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.730\nNow if you're going to turn this\non remember that the d word\n\n192\n00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.020\nis set to one, right?\n\n193\n00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.000\nThat configures it as On.\n\n194\n00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.170\nHowever, notice that there's\na required platform security features,\n\n195\n00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:16.030\nthere's a couple of different\nthings that you can do here.\n\n196\n00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.710\nIf you change the d word to one,\n\n197\n00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.000\nthen what you're doing is you're\nsaying I want to enable secure boot.\n\n198\n00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.300\nWe're gonna talk about secure boot\na little bit more coming up because it's\n\n199\n00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.610\nalso one of the ways that you can manage\nthe integrity of your operating system and\n\n200\n00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.720\nreally your whole boot environment.\n\n201\n00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.780\nHowever, one of the other things that\nif your hardware supports it and\n\n202\n00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.100\nIntel does support this I know and\nI'm pretty sure AMD does as well\n\n203\n00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.880\nis not only secure boot but\nalso something known as DMA protection.\n\n204\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.270\nRight?\nWhat is DMA protection like,\n\n205\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.405\nI said, guys we're not short of\nacronyms here in this episode.\n\n206\n00:10:50.405 --> 00:10:52.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Remember direct memory access, right?\n\n207\n00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.570\nThat is when a hardware device\ndoes exactly that, right?\n\n208\n00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.600\nIt has direct memory access.\n\n209\n00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.430\nWell, the problem is, you can use\ntechniques to, basically hijack,\n\n210\n00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.900\nor get your code with any product\nthat has direct memory access.\n\n211\n00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.660\nTo give you an example FireWire.\n\n212\n00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.600\nNot a lot of people,\nsome people don't realize\n\n213\n00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.940\nthat a FireWire plug plugged into\na machine has direct memory access.\n\n214\n00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.040\nAnd people can exploit those, that direct\nmemory access, they can inject their code.\n\n215\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.440\nSo, what you're doing here when you\nchange the DWORD to 2, you're saying,\n\n216\n00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.790\nnot only are we gonna\nimplement secure boot, right?\n\n217\n00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.400\nYou can see mine is already turned on,\nit's 1, DWORD is 1.\n\n218\n00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.280\nSo that means that this system has a TPM\nand it is implementing secure boot.\n\n219\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.810\nChange it to 2 and now you're saying\na little bit more protection.\n\n220\n00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:40.100\nYou're saying not only secure\nboot the boot environment,\n\n221\n00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.700\nyou're also saying secure the memory.\n\n222\n00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.240\nAnd again, that's that DMA protection.\n\n223\n00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.810\nIt's handled through a technical term,\nagain you're gonna love this one,\n\n224\n00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.100\nIOMMU, wow I couldn't remember\nthat to save my life.\n\n225\n00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.790\nThat is\nInput Output Memory Management Unit, okay.\n\n226\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.480\nAnd what does that essentially mean?\n\n227\n00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.130\nHave you ever seen a technology like that?\n\n228\n00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:03.370\nWell I want you to step back and\nremember the Virtual Memory Manager,\n\n229\n00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.150\nit's been Windows for a long time.\n\n230\n00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:09.850\nYour operating system except for\ncomponents that have DMA technology,\n\n231\n00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.500\ndirect memory access, right?\n\n232\n00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.580\nThey don't have access to\nthe physical memory addresses,\n\n233\n00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.770\nthe physical locations within\nthe computer or within the hardware.\n\n234\n00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.020\nWhat does the Virtual Memory Manager do?\n\n235\n00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.674\nWell it takes virtual addresses and\nit acts as the go-between between\n\n236\n00:12:24.674 --> 00:12:29.420\nthese software-based addresses and\nmapping that into physical memory.\n\n237\n00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.160\nRight?\nThat is an example of a memory\n\n238\n00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.680\nmanagement unit, right?\n\n239\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.130\nWell, this is Input Output Memory\nManagement Unit and that's the hardware,\n\n240\n00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.750\nessentially the hardware specification\nthat needs to be supported,\n\n241\n00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:45.150\nneeds to be there are a requirement for\nimplementing DMA protection.\n\n242\n00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.009\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n243\n00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:48.810\nAll right.\nSo\n\n244\n00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.230\nthat's one of the places that\nyou can do this as well.\n\n245\n00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.072\nBut there's another place that you\ncan do this, and this involves,\n\n246\n00:12:55.072 --> 00:12:58.159\nwhen it comes to the Device Guard,\nit involves something known that we've\n\n247\n00:12:58.159 --> 00:13:00.023\nalready taken care of\nin a previous episode.\n\n248\n00:13:00.023 --> 00:13:03.620\nBut as it relates to Device Guard,\nthat is the Windows Store for Business.\n\n249\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.880\nSo what we have to do here\n\n250\n00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.010\nis we have to get logged into\nthe Windows Store for Business.\n\n251\n00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.850\nSo let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n252\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.230\nSo here we see the Windows Store for\nBusiness.\n\n253\n00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.210\nAnd what we're gonna go ahead and\n\n254\n00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.460\ndo is we'll show you a little bit more\nthan you can do with Device Guard\n\n255\n00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.220\ninside of the Windows Store for Business\nbecause we've talked about deploying this.\n\n256\n00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.440\nOne of the things I said that you\ncan do is that you can deploy these\n\n257\n00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.730\ncode integrity policies through GPOs.\n\n258\n00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.130\nWell you can also do it\nthrough Windows Intune.\n\n259\n00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.450\nAnd you could also set it up here\nin the Windows Store for Business.\n\n260\n00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.750\nNow, if you're maybe just tuning in for\nthe first time and\n\n261\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.270\nyou're like what is this Windows Store for\nBusiness?\n\n262\n00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.140\nWe did an episode on the Windows Store for\nBusiness.\n\n263\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.080\nSo, go back and\ncheck that out if you will.\n\n264\n00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.050\nJust keep in mind that this more\nrelates to the Device Guard itself.\n\n265\n00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.580\nSo, once you get logged in, you're gonna\ngo to Settings on the drop down list.\n\n266\n00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.800\nKeep in mind that the interfaces\nalways change a little bit, so\n\n267\n00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.030\nit might change this a little bit.\n\n268\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.790\nThen we've got this Device Guard signing.\n\n269\n00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.870\nRemember, we talked about having\nto have these signed policies?\n\n270\n00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.650\nWell, we can do that here.\n\n271\n00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:04.126\nBut before we do that, we might have to\ndo a little bit of role-based delegation,\n\n272\n00:14:04.126 --> 00:14:07.540\nrole-based access control,\nI guess you would say.\n\n273\n00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.720\nAnd that's through the permissions.\n\n274\n00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.350\nSo I can set up a Device Guard signer,\nall right.\n\n275\n00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.790\nAnd we'll go ahead, we'll hit Permissions.\n\n276\n00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.930\nAnd I've already got\nsomebody here on the list.\n\n277\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.620\nBut if we wanted to add somebody,\nall right.\n\n278\n00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.040\nWe have this Device Guard Signer and\n\n279\n00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.290\nthe Admin as well inside of\nthe Windows Store for Business.\n\n280\n00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.140\nNotice it says it can sign policies and\ncatalogs.\n\n281\n00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.770\nAnd that's also our Device Guard Signer,\nso keep in mind a couple of the roles.\n\n282\n00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.760\nI'm not sure if it'll come up on the test\nbut if it does and they say well,\n\n283\n00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.650\nwhat are the required permissions inside\nof the Windows Store for Business for\n\n284\n00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.160\ndoing Device Guard Signing, two roles.\n\n285\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.550\nI want you to remember the Admin,\nwell that's because it's the admin, and\n\n286\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.840\nthen also remember that the Device\nGuard Signer can do this as well.\n\n287\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.420\nNow once you have your permissions set up,\nI don't have to set anything up here,\n\n288\n00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.040\nour user here is the admin.\n\n289\n00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.520\nI can go into Device Guard Signing, and\n\n290\n00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.250\nit gives me the ability\nto do a couple things.\n\n291\n00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.470\nI can upload and sign the catalog and\n\n292\n00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.210\npolicy files for\nuse with Device Guard right here.\n\n293\n00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:11.120\nI can also download a default\ncode integrity policy for\n\n294\n00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.390\nuse inside of Device Guard here.\n\n295\n00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:18.380\nAnd right, it says right away that this\npolicy file is already pre-populated with\n\n296\n00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.630\nthe information customized\nto your organization.\n\n297\n00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.620\nWhat are we talking about here?\n\n298\n00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.530\nBut we're talking about this information\ncoming from the Windows Store for\n\n299\n00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:26.910\nBusiness.\n\n300\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.530\nLast but not least, remember all\ndevice signing, what does it require?\n\n301\n00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.240\nSome form of PKI, right?\n\n302\n00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.000\nSo you can use an external CA if you want\nthat requires a subscription, right?\n\n303\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.452\nOr purchase if you will and\n\n304\n00:15:40.452 --> 00:15:44.154\nit's typically trusted by the devices\nif it's a trusted root CA.\n\n305\n00:15:44.154 --> 00:15:47.926\nBut you can also use an internal PKI\nif you have that infrastructure set up.\n\n306\n00:15:47.926 --> 00:15:52.348\nThen you've got a certificate root\nthere or CA or root CA if you will.\n\n307\n00:15:52.348 --> 00:15:58.944\nAnd then what we can do is we can download\nthe root certificate, I can't say that.\n\n308\n00:15:58.944 --> 00:16:00.859\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I always wanna say certification.\n\n309\n00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:02.318\nCertificate file here too.\n\n310\n00:16:02.318 --> 00:16:08.058\nSo again, a couple of different locations\nthat you can manage your device guard.\n\n311\n00:16:08.058 --> 00:16:12.552\nSo one of the things I mentioned earlier\nis the fact that we get the ability\n\n312\n00:16:12.552 --> 00:16:15.130\nto not only manage Device Guard here, but\n\n313\n00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:19.496\nwe also get the ability to manage\nsomething called Credential Guard.\n\n314\n00:16:19.496 --> 00:16:26.683\nLet's go and let me bring back up my,\nI don't know where they went here.\n\n315\n00:16:26.683 --> 00:16:27.435\nThere we go.\n\n316\n00:16:27.435 --> 00:16:31.818\nLet's go ahead and let's move into\nsomething known as CredentialGuard.\n\n317\n00:16:31.818 --> 00:16:35.580\nNow with CredentialGuard, in the past,\n\n318\n00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:40.990\nwhen we've talked about\ntradition logons with Microsoft,\n\n319\n00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:46.570\nor any Windows based machine, what handles\nthese secrets that are on our computers?\n\n320\n00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:47.078\nWhat are the secrets?\n\n321\n00:16:47.078 --> 00:16:49.290\nAnd I know my heads kind\nof covering it up there.\n\n322\n00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:53.919\nWell it's the local security authority,\nthat's what handles the login process.\n\n323\n00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:58.792\nAnd then traditionally it stored\nthe secrets like your NTLM hashes,\n\n324\n00:16:58.792 --> 00:17:00.562\nyour Kerberos tickets.\n\n325\n00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:04.076\nAnd even single sign on, it's one of the\nthings that I didn't mention in here as\n\n326\n00:17:04.076 --> 00:17:06.540\nwell, your single sign on credentials.\n\n327\n00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:12.180\nWell one of the things that credential\nguard does, is it protects these secrets.\n\n328\n00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.111\nAll a hacker or attacker if you will,\nwould have to do,\n\n329\n00:17:16.111 --> 00:17:21.850\nis you could exploit the operating system,\nmaybe do the NTLM hash collisions.\n\n330\n00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:26.620\nSo we can get access to the database or\nmaybe even access to the Kerberos TGTs.\n\n331\n00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.500\nNow I know that's a little bit more\ndifficult, because of time stamping and\n\n332\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.300\neverything.\n\n333\n00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.370\nBut it does expose that information\nto the ability to be attacked.\n\n334\n00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.360\nWell if you have virtualization software,\n\n335\n00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.450\nnow we can isolate this information and\nCredentialGuard does something new.\n\n336\n00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:45.121\nWhat it does is now\nthe Local Security Authority\n\n337\n00:17:45.121 --> 00:17:49.572\ntalks to something known\nas an isolated LSA.\n\n338\n00:17:49.572 --> 00:17:54.281\nSo the Local Security Authority can\ncommunicate, and it's the only thing\n\n339\n00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:58.855\nthat can communicate with what's known\nas the LSA ISO, as they call it.\n\n340\n00:17:58.855 --> 00:18:04.131\nAnd again, now talking about ISO is in\na installation media here it's just short\n\n341\n00:18:04.131 --> 00:18:09.030\nof isolated, so it's using more of\nthat virtualization based security.\n\n342\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:13.777\nIt contains a small driver that\nallows a remote procedure call and\n\n343\n00:18:13.777 --> 00:18:18.612\nit's only the local security\nauthority that can communicate With\n\n344\n00:18:18.612 --> 00:18:21.930\nthis isolated LSA, if you will.\n\n345\n00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:26.300\nIt's the one housing the secrets\nwhether it's your NTLM,\n\n346\n00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.560\nwhether it's your Kerberos,\nwhether your single sign off.\n\n347\n00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:34.230\nAnd one of the great things\nabout the isolated LSA is that\n\n348\n00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:39.420\neven the running operating system cannot\ncommunicate with that protected location.\n\n349\n00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.130\nThere's only one thing that can\ncommunicate with it through a single\n\n350\n00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.700\ndriver and that's the LSA talking\nto that protected location.\n\n351\n00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.450\nNow there's a couple of things I\nwant you to know for the exam, guys.\n\n352\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:55.670\nI know these are statistics but tell you,\nthey like to test you on requirements.\n\n353\n00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.764\nThis is another thing,\nit uses the UEFI version,\n\n354\n00:18:58.764 --> 00:19:02.458\nyour firmware,\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface.\n\n355\n00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:07.984\nIt uses version 2.3.1 with Secure Boot.\n\n356\n00:19:07.984 --> 00:19:11.085\nIt also uses the Intel VT and the AMD-V.\n\n357\n00:19:11.085 --> 00:19:14.480\nIt uses second level address translation.\n\n358\n00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.733\nNow, here's where they\nmight get you on specifics,\n\n359\n00:19:18.733 --> 00:19:23.741\nif you are using Windows 10 version 1507,\nthe only TPM,\n\n360\n00:19:23.741 --> 00:19:28.768\ntrusted platform module,\nthat you can use is version 2.0.\n\n361\n00:19:28.768 --> 00:19:34.022\nIf you're using version 1511 and prior,\nyou also get the ability not only to use\n\n362\n00:19:34.022 --> 00:19:39.425\nthe newer 2.0 TPM but also the 1.2, which\nis an older one that we've been using.\n\n363\n00:19:39.425 --> 00:19:43.211\nGosh, I wanna say back to the days,\nmaybe even Vista, could be Windows 7.\n\n364\n00:19:43.211 --> 00:19:46.450\nNow, where do we see this turned on?\n\n365\n00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.780\nWell that's that same\nlocation we were looking at.\n\n366\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.150\nSo if I decide to, and\n\n367\n00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:55.250\nI can pick up any one of these\nenabled virtualization based security.\n\n368\n00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.200\nThat's that VBS, I had to be careful with\nthe acronym here because don't think\n\n369\n00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.930\nof it using VBS as being\nvisual basic scripts,\n\n370\n00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.180\nwe're not talking about that type\nof VBS different acronym there.\n\n371\n00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.155\nAnd if I bring up the and you know what?\n\n372\n00:20:10.155 --> 00:20:12.573\nI'm in the registry here,\nyou can control it here, but\n\n373\n00:20:12.573 --> 00:20:15.740\nwhat I wanted to show you guys\nis that device guard policy.\n\n374\n00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.480\nSo let's go ahead and\nget into our GP edit here,\n\n375\n00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.670\nagain we'll get down to\nthe administrative templates.\n\n376\n00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.500\nAnd I mention these paths guys,\nbecause they like to hit you with,\n\n377\n00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.910\non the exam with text based answers,\nand they just wanna know.\n\n378\n00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:32.210\nHave you ever been there before in\nthe group policy in order to deploy or\n\n379\n00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.260\nconfigure this?\n\n380\n00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.390\nSo that's one of the reasons we kind\nof show you the long way around here.\n\n381\n00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.299\nIt's gonna be in System, so\nthat's computer configuration.\n\n382\n00:20:39.299 --> 00:20:43.469\nIt's gonna be in System, and then under\nSystem you should see Device Guard.\n\n383\n00:20:45.892 --> 00:20:54.430\nAnd then if we hit the Explain tab,\nProperties, on you know what?\n\n384\n00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:58.863\nI'm sitting here thinking of\nGroup Policy here, Active directory.\n\n385\n00:20:58.863 --> 00:21:03.724\nSo if I look in here, it gives me\nthe option let's me know what I\n\n386\n00:21:03.724 --> 00:21:08.120\nwanna turn on if I just wanna\nturn on virtualization base\n\n387\n00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:13.120\nprotection with code integrity,\nI've turn on Device Guard.\n\n388\n00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.351\nIf I wanna turn on Credential Guard\nyou see it right there.\n\n389\n00:21:15.351 --> 00:21:17.113\nI can enable it right here in this policy.\n\n390\n00:21:17.113 --> 00:21:21.940\nSo keep in mind this is the way that you\ncan turn on credential guide by default it\n\n391\n00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.048\nisn't enabled.\n\n392\n00:21:23.048 --> 00:21:24.947\nSo this is a way basically,\n\n393\n00:21:24.947 --> 00:21:29.745\nthat you can protect the credentials\nthat are on your local machine.\n\n394\n00:21:29.745 --> 00:21:33.837\nThey're not out there on the open anymore\nwhere just anybody can get access to them.\n\n395\n00:21:33.837 --> 00:21:37.582\nThey're stored in an isolated, virtualized\nenvironment that's kept separate if you\n\n396\n00:21:37.582 --> 00:21:39.845\nwill from the the running\noperating system.\n\n397\n00:21:39.845 --> 00:21:43.488\nAnd like I said the LSA is the only\nthing that can talk to it.\n\n398\n00:21:43.488 --> 00:21:44.829\nNow, that being said,\n\n399\n00:21:44.829 --> 00:21:48.921\nthat brings us to one of the last topics\nthat we really gotta discuss, and\n\n400\n00:21:48.921 --> 00:21:54.135\nthat's something known as device health\nattestation, if I can say that right.\n\n401\n00:21:54.135 --> 00:21:55.595\nAnd what does that mean for us?\n\n402\n00:21:55.595 --> 00:21:59.630\nWell, there's a couple of\nways we can do this, and\n\n403\n00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:03.570\nI wanna kind of explain\nboth processes here.\n\n404\n00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:07.240\nWe've talked a little bit about Secure\nBoot, when we talk about Secure Boot,\n\n405\n00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.270\nwhat is it doing for us?\n\n406\n00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.787\nWhat is it verifying?\n\n407\n00:22:09.787 --> 00:22:11.583\nWell health attestation.\n\n408\n00:22:11.583 --> 00:22:15.524\nIn earlier implementations of server,\nwe can do this through\n\n409\n00:22:15.524 --> 00:22:20.013\nthings like network access protection,\nsays does your firewall on?\n\n410\n00:22:20.013 --> 00:22:21.174\nDo you have your updates?\n\n411\n00:22:21.174 --> 00:22:24.956\nIf you have this then you're in\ncompliance with the network policy,\n\n412\n00:22:24.956 --> 00:22:26.335\nwe can grant you access.\n\n413\n00:22:26.335 --> 00:22:31.240\nWell, that's also after\nthe operating system is launched,\n\n414\n00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.308\nhow about antivirus and\nanti-malware software?\n\n415\n00:22:35.308 --> 00:22:36.620\nTypically what do we have to do?\n\n416\n00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.900\nWe have to wait till this\nsoftware comes online for\n\n417\n00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.720\nit to start protecting our machines.\n\n418\n00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.640\nWell, we've go a whole boot\nprocess that does need to\n\n419\n00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.640\nbe protected against things like rootkits.\n\n420\n00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.510\nThey're getting very crafty at\nslipping these rootkits in, and\n\n421\n00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.350\nthey come online before your any\nmalware software is ever even awake.\n\n422\n00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.680\nSo what Secure Boot does is\nthe first thing it goes through,\n\n423\n00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:02.700\nis it looks at the TPM and a few\nprocesses here, looks at your firmware.\n\n424\n00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.130\nAnd it says, is the firmware valid?\n\n425\n00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.810\nHas it been modified or\nhasn't it been modified?\n\n426\n00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.920\nIf it's been modified,\nthen a boot process is gonna fail.\n\n427\n00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.978\nIf it hasn't been modified then\nit goes through the next step.\n\n428\n00:23:12.978 --> 00:23:16.010\nIt looks at for instance,\nfor a signed boot loader.\n\n429\n00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:19.624\nA digital signature for the boot\nloader that's stored within that TPM.\n\n430\n00:23:19.624 --> 00:23:23.026\nIf it finds it and the boot loader\nthat's currently launching,\n\n431\n00:23:23.026 --> 00:23:25.925\ntrying to bootstrap\nthe operating system as trusted.\n\n432\n00:23:25.925 --> 00:23:30.050\nIt'll go through the next process, then\nit looks for a digitally signed kernel.\n\n433\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.330\nDo we trust the kernel?\n\n434\n00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:32.664\nHas it maintained its integrity?\n\n435\n00:23:32.664 --> 00:23:34.787\nAre we looking at that and\nverifying that it's good?\n\n436\n00:23:34.787 --> 00:23:39.690\nAnd once that happens,\nthat's where the next process comes in.\n\n437\n00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.406\nSo as part of this,\nthis is what is known as ELAM and\n\n438\n00:23:42.406 --> 00:23:45.272\nthat's the Early Launch Anti-malware\nsoftware.\n\n439\n00:23:45.272 --> 00:23:49.943\nNow this is all in the boot process\nto verify that your system has\n\n440\n00:23:49.943 --> 00:23:51.804\nmaintained its health.\n\n441\n00:23:51.804 --> 00:23:53.064\nAll right, so what happens?\n\n442\n00:23:53.064 --> 00:23:57.818\nWell when ELAM comes on on the scene what\nit does is it loads something known as\n\n443\n00:23:57.818 --> 00:24:02.356\nan initialization policy and\ninitialization policy essentially tells\n\n444\n00:24:02.356 --> 00:24:07.200\nelam here's how you start the boot\ndrivers, the early boot start drivers.\n\n445\n00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.150\nThis is the order that we\nwant them to be booted in.\n\n446\n00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.550\nAlright?\nSo what does it do?\n\n447\n00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:17.180\nIt only loads drivers that are in\nthat initialization policy.\n\n448\n00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.790\nRight?\nIt only loads the known, good drivers.\n\n449\n00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.370\nHow do we know that the drivers are good,\nright?\n\n450\n00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:22.930\nRemember?\n\n451\n00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.780\nRemember that kernel mode integrity code.\n\n452\n00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.690\nThey have to be digitally signed.\n\n453\n00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:31.280\nAlright, The other thing it doesn't do,\nit doesn't load unknown drivers.\n\n454\n00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.740\nIf the drivers are digitally signed\n\n455\n00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.000\nthey're not going to run at boot start,\nright?\n\n456\n00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.260\nThe other thing it does is if it finds\ncorrupted drivers, and this is where\n\n457\n00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.600\nanother place that ELAM maintains the\nintegrity of the boot process because if\n\n458\n00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:47.150\nthe drivers themselves are corrupted\nit isn't going to load a bad driver.\n\n459\n00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.800\nAll right.\nSo this is the first part of if you will,\n\n460\n00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.460\ndevice health attestation.\n\n461\n00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:55.460\nMore so\nthan that is something called measureboot.\n\n462\n00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.490\nNow measureboot and secureboot a lot\nof times are considered to be close to\n\n463\n00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.730\nthe same thing, but\nit is slightly different, right?\n\n464\n00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:06.310\nIn a measured boot we're going\nthrough a lot of the same process.\n\n465\n00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:10.920\nBut what we're doing here is we're\nactually now using a third party,\n\n466\n00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.230\nall that process we talked about,\nsecure boot, checking the TPM, and ELAM.\n\n467\n00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.420\nThis is gonna say, okay,\nthis is what we expect to happen.\n\n468\n00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:25.730\nAnd we're gonna send what we find in\nthe operating system out to a third party.\n\n469\n00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:26.948\nAnd see if they agree with it.\n\n470\n00:25:26.948 --> 00:25:29.170\nThat's why they call it measured boot.\n\n471\n00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:33.090\nI need to know if the boot files\n\n472\n00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.420\nhave maintained their integrity\naccording to my company's policy.\n\n473\n00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:41.610\nSecure boot is a UAFI based\nimplementation right,\n\n474\n00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:46.800\nand it's maintained by the UAFI council,\nI would guess.\n\n475\n00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.720\nSo what this says is,\nI know what Secure Boot says.\n\n476\n00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.590\nSecure boot is going to be\npart of this process but\n\n477\n00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:56.380\nI am going to send this whole\nboot process out to this server.\n\n478\n00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.420\nWhat is this server doing?\n\n479\n00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.010\nWhat is it actually sending?\n\n480\n00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.380\nIt is really only looking at\nhash values of the firmware,\n\n481\n00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.870\nthe kernel, secure boot, e lamb,\nand the boot start drivers.\n\n482\n00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:11.420\nWhat it does is it says okay, here's what\nI found, it's sends that information\n\n483\n00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:15.080\nover to the server and the server\nstores what the expected values are.\n\n484\n00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.510\nThis is what we expect to find and again,\n\n485\n00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.970\nbecause we're measuring\nthe whole entire process.\n\n486\n00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.600\nAnd if it finds that it has, it is\n\n487\n00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.610\nin compliance with the database and\nit proceeds to boot the process.\n\n488\n00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.640\nAnd it proceeds with the boot\nprocess if you will.\n\n489\n00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:35.420\nSo very close to the same thing, the\ndifference is the whole entire process is\n\n490\n00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:40.050\nall measured from beginning to end and\nthere's a certain expected values and\n\n491\n00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:43.720\nit does require a third party\nin order to implement it.\n\n492\n00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.890\nAlright so.\n\n493\n00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:48.110\nthose are a couple of things that\nyou can keep in mind for the exam.\n\n494\n00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.870\nRemember secureboot,\n\n495\n00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:54.280\ndo remember the fact that measureboot\nis a little bit different.\n\n496\n00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.910\nOne of the differences is that it\ndoesn't stop the boot process,\n\n497\n00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:02.500\nunlike secureboot if secureboot\nfinds processes that don't match.\n\n498\n00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:07.120\nThis doesn't really stop the process, it's\njust a way to measure the boot environment\n\n499\n00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.690\nagainst a third-party to see if\nyou're in compliance with it.\n\n500\n00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:14.910\nSo this is another one of those things\nthat also requires a UFEI platform.\n\n501\n00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.250\nAnd the TPM in order to be in the system,\nso\n\n502\n00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:21.350\ndefinitely keep in mind those extra\ncomponents, but that essentially is some\n\n503\n00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:25.260\nof the things you can support when it\ncomes to authentication and authorization.\n\n504\n00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.200\n>> Fantastic Wes, great explanation there,\nlooking at some of these\n\n505\n00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.600\nnew technologies that Microsoft and\nWindows 10 is bringing to play.\n\n506\n00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:38.000\nBig push into the virtualization security\ntaking advantage of virtualization\n\n507\n00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.300\nleveraging that isolation that we can get\nfrom virtualization to make a more secure\n\n508\n00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.220\ncomputing environment with things like\ndevice guard, credential guard and\n\n509\n00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.150\nthen that last one that\ndevice health attestation.\n\n510\n00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:54.130\nSo fantastic, hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching Signing off for\n\n511\n00:27:54.130

00:00:22.540\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.890\nIn this episode we'll be taking a look at,\nwell, joining a user to a domain.\n\n10\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.370\nBut this is going to be special because\nwe're gonna be looking at it from\n\n11\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.940\na perspective of configuring and\nutilizing Azure in this process.\n\n12\n00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.530\nAzure with Active Directory.\n\n13\n00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.600\nAnd with us today we have Mr.\nMike Roderick.\n\n14\n00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.370\nHow's it going, Mike?\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Cherokee.\n\n15\n00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.230\nThanks for having me back.\n\n16\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.630\nAnd yeah,\nwe've got to do a little Azure AD\n\n17\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.370\njoin, right?\n\n18\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.380\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n19\n00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.410\nCuz they specifically call\nthis out on the objective.\n\n20\n00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.730\nI wanna make sure you're familiar\nwith concepts, the topics and\n\n21\n00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.580\nwhat they are talking about.\n\n22\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.252\nAnd a lot of these at this point is some\nof you might be studying preparing for\n\n23\n00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:56.300\nthis exam or might be in the field\nworking with these devices.\n\n24\n00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.901\nAnd you probably at this point at\nleast familiar with traditional\n\n25\n00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:01.060\nActive Directory.\n\n26\n00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.780\nWhat we would call\non-premises Active Directory,\n\n27\n00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.930\nwhere we run our domain\ncontroller locally.\n\n28\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.190\nWhen we have our corporate-owned devices,\nwe join them to the domain.\n\n29\n00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.030\nSo we go through that process of creating\nthat trust relationship with the domain\n\n30\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.100\ncontroller.\n\n31\n00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.730\nAnd then you can log onto that machine\nwith a domain name account, and\n\n32\n00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.600\nwe can manage that demand through\ngroup policy and other things.\n\n33\n00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.320\nSo it's considered part of our domain.\n\n34\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.260\nBut when we think about why you're\njoining the computer to the domain in\n\n35\n00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.000\nthe first place.\n\n36\n00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.400\nAnd there's a couple of reasons, right?\n\n37\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.790\nWe wanna be able to.\n\n38\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.820\nManage the device.\n\n39\n00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.452\nThat's one of the primary\nreasons we join the domain is so\n\n40\n00:01:36.452 --> 00:01:40.099\nthat we can manage it through\ngroup policy and auditing.\n\n41\n00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.532\nBeing able to track what machine\nyou're at when you logged on and\n\n42\n00:01:43.532 --> 00:01:47.040\nwhen you accessed a certain resource,\nthings like that.\n\n43\n00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.200\nAs we shift out to the cloud we can host\nwhat we call Azure Active Directory, and\n\n44\n00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.040\nit's very similar to our\non-premise Active Directory,\n\n45\n00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.630\nwith a few differences, group policy\nbeing a big one we don't have.\n\n46\n00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.850\nBut computer accounts are another\nbig difference between\n\n47\n00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.790\nAzure Active Directory and what we think\nof as traditional Active Directory.\n\n48\n00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.940\nAnd the fact that we really don't\nhave computer accounts in Azure AD.\n\n49\n00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.860\nWhen we go in and look,\nwe don't create new computer accounts.\n\n50\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.690\nBut we still wanna be able to\njoin those devices to Azure AD so\n\n51\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.900\nthat they can use, or users can use\nthose devices to access resources.\n\n52\n00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.670\nBut when we look at the devices, it's\nnot like traditional Active Directory,\n\n53\n00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.550\nwhere they were desktops or laptops or\ntablets that were company issued, they're\n\n54\n00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.860\nconnected to the corporate network,\nwe manage them through group policy.\n\n55\n00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.950\nWe're talking about Azure and\nmoving things out of the cloud, it shifts.\n\n56\n00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.760\nNow all of a sudden, we're dealing\nwith some company issued devices, but\n\n57\n00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.920\na lot of BYOD type stuff.\n\n58\n00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.180\nLaptops that you own that\nyou want to use at home and\n\n59\n00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.970\nyou want to be able to access\nwork resources or your tablets or\n\n60\n00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.580\nyour phones and your other devices.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so Mike we're looking at I guess\n\n61\n00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.970\nthe traditional domain join\nutilizing that corporate network we\n\n62\n00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.390\nwere seeing our administrators being the\nones to perform these duties and tasks.\n\n63\n00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.340\nAnd with a lot of the advent of our Azure\nCloud services, we're seeing a lot of\n\n64\n00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.935\nthose responsibilities even something\nas password reset being handed off and\n\n65\n00:03:17.935 --> 00:03:19.405\ndelegated to the client.\n\n66\n00:03:19.405 --> 00:03:23.365\nWhat are we talking about here when\nwe're using the domain join with Azure?\n\n67\n00:03:23.365 --> 00:03:27.105\nAre we still going to to be utilizing that\nfrom an administrative perspective, or\n\n68\n00:03:27.105 --> 00:03:29.485\ndo end users get that\nopportunity now as well?\n\n69\n00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:30.525\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, and\n\n70\n00:03:30.525 --> 00:03:33.075\nthe answers we're going to be\nshifting it off to the end user.\n\n71\n00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:36.635\nWe're going to let them do it, because\nthey're going to be, again, their laptops,\n\n72\n00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:39.410\ntheir tablets, their phones,\ntheir home computers.\n\n73\n00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.460\nWhatever they're using to connect to our\nresources because we're seeing the shift\n\n74\n00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.560\nin the way we do things.\n\n75\n00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.990\nWe want to be able to do\nour job from any device.\n\n76\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.950\nNot just my corporate owned desktop\nthat's part of my work domain.\n\n77\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.040\nBut I still want to be able to\ncontrol what devices are connecting,\n\n78\n00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.600\nwhat they're allowed to connect.\n\n79\n00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.870\nMaybe doing health checks on them,\nthings like that.\n\n80\n00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.970\nBut we are gonna as your question or\n\n81\n00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.020\nto your question there,\nwe are gonna let the end-users do this.\n\n82\n00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.050\nCuz I'm not going out to their house and\nlogging in and\n\n83\n00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.200\njoining their machine to the domain,\nor their phone, or\n\n84\n00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.010\nthey don't have to bring them into\nwork before they can start using them.\n\n85\n00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.750\nWe can let them do it.\n\n86\n00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.360\nSo let me show you that part first.\n\n87\n00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.335\nI'm gonna log into my Azure here.\n\n88\n00:04:18.335 --> 00:04:24.640\nportal.azure.com and to allow my users\nto join their devices to Azure AD.\n\n89\n00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.071\nI'm gonna click on Azure Active Directory\nin my navigation tree over here on\n\n90\n00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:29.704\nthe left.\n\n91\n00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:34.580\nAnd once that loads up I'm gonna click\non devices in that Azure Blade or\n\n92\n00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.140\nIT Pro Blade.\n\n93\n00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.570\nAnd then I'm going to\ngo to Device Settings.\n\n94\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.250\nAnd this is where I can\ncontrol their behavior.\n\n95\n00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.750\nAs soon as my options load up,\nthere we go.\n\n96\n00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.865\nWe should see right here, the first one\nusers may join devices to Azure AD.\n\n97\n00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:52.215\nSo this is what's going\nto control whether or\n\n98\n00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:56.545\nnot they're allowed to take that iPhone,\nor that laptop at home, and\n\n99\n00:04:56.545 --> 00:04:57.975\nconnect it to Azure AD.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n100\n00:04:57.975 --> 00:05:02.105\nyou're still maintaining that control,\nthat administrative duty per say, but\n\n101\n00:05:02.105 --> 00:05:04.445\nfrom this console.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n102\n00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:06.885\nAnd so our choices here, all selected, or\n\n103\n00:05:06.885 --> 00:05:10.590\nnone, All means anybody\ncould join their device.\n\n104\n00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.960\nThey would still have to have an account.\n\n105\n00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.838\nIt's not like Joe Stranger can\nget [CROSSTALK] can connect and\n\n106\n00:05:16.838 --> 00:05:18.469\njoin their device.\n\n107\n00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:19.850\nThey're gonna have to have an account.\n\n108\n00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.290\nThey're gonna have to know the password,\nthat kind of thing,\n\n109\n00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.270\nif you do multi factor authentication.\n\n110\n00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.590\nSo it's secured in that respect.\n\n111\n00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.610\nBut when I say all, so we should clarify.\n\n112\n00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.140\nWhen I say all,\nanybody that's part of my Azure AD,\n\n113\n00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.170\ncan join a device to our\nAzure active directory.\n\n114\n00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.595\nNone would mean, nobody can.\n\n115\n00:05:36.595 --> 00:05:41.130\nI'd have to do with manually or\nnot at all, and then selected and\n\n116\n00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.290\nthis option here lights up.\n\n117\n00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.350\nMaybe I only wanna allow a certain\ngroup of users, like my sales people,\n\n118\n00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.970\nthat travel.\n\n119\n00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.370\nThey have a need to join\ntheir devices to AzureAD.\n\n120\n00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.590\nBut my host side only, them doing it,\n\n121\n00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.280\nthey're not doing any\nwork from home anyway.\n\n122\n00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.720\nRight or whatever the case may be.\n\n123\n00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.780\nSo if you wanna pick and choose,\nwho was allowed to join those devices.\n\n124\n00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.760\nOr maybe you do set it up.\n\n125\n00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.340\nSo that only IT can do it.\n\n126\n00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.140\nAnd they have to bring their\ndevices in get approved or\n\n127\n00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.750\nsomething like that before they're joined.\n\n128\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:15.110\nSo this is where you control who is\nallowed to join a device to Azure AD.\n\n129\n00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.530\nI'm gonna leave it on all for now.\n\n130\n00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.330\nRight below that additional local\nadministrator on Azure AD join devices.\n\n131\n00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.730\nDefault is None.\n\n132\n00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.990\nThis would allow me to add\nan administrative account.\n\n133\n00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.400\nIf I want to let's say for example my end\nusers, they're using their home laptops or\n\n134\n00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.120\ntheir home desktops to work from home or\nwhile they travel.\n\n135\n00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.430\nNow they've joined their\ndevice to Azure AD.\n\n136\n00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.140\nThey're out there on the road.\n\n137\n00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.640\nThey hit a stumbling block.\n\n138\n00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.710\nThey call up IT and they need help.\n\n139\n00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.910\nWell, now the problem is that's not\na corporate device where my helpdesk is\n\n140\n00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.880\nthe admin on those machines.\n\n141\n00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.810\nSo how do I help them.\n\n142\n00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.200\nI don't have any administrative access.\n\n143\n00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.140\nI going to have to try to trouble shoot by\nwalking them through it over the phone or\n\n144\n00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.310\nsomething like that.\n\n145\n00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.300\nHere I could add.\n\n146\n00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.790\nI could say Selected.\n\n147\n00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.780\nAnd I could go and find one of my groups.\n\n148\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.600\nI don't know if I have a group\nthat I called helpdesk.\n\n149\n00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.000\nBut anyway, I don't know what, I can't\nremember what groups I've created, but\n\n150\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.590\nI would add them here.\n\n151\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.700\nAnd this would, kind of like we do with\nrestrictive groups and group policy,\n\n152\n00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.610\nthis would allow me to add a local\nadministrator to those BYOD type devices.\n\n153\n00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.550\nUsers may register\nthe devices with Azure AD.\n\n154\n00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:35.330\nThis one is if we are going to enroll for\nMDM, or Mobile Device Management.\n\n155\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.740\nRequire multi factor\nauthentication to join devices.\n\n156\n00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.490\nI would say this is not\nturned on by default.\n\n157\n00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.791\nMicrosoft highly recommends it-\n&gt;&gt; Good idea.\n\n158\n00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:45.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely a good idea.\n\n159\n00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.100\nMaximum number of devices.\n\n160\n00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:52.110\nI might want to set a limit on how many\ndevices each user is allowed to enroll.\n\n161\n00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.360\nUsers may sync settings and\napp data across devices.\n\n162\n00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.070\nSo we can choose to allow them to sync,\nlike Internet Explorer favorites or\n\n163\n00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.140\nI should say Edge favorites,\nthings like that across their devices.\n\n164\n00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:09.700\nSo this is where we would configure\nthat Azure AD join in the Azure portal.\n\n165\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.080\nAnd I'm not going to\nsave any changes to that.\n\n166\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.520\nI do want to make sure that I left\nthat on all for the rest of our demo.\n\n167\n00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.370\nLet's double check that, all good to go.\n\n168\n00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.010\nAll right, so\nonce you've got that set up in Azure,\n\n169\n00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.260\nnow your users should be able to join.\n\n170\n00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.480\nAnd how do they do that?\n\n171\n00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.450\nWell, with Windows 10, and what I've\ngot here is just a Windows 10 install.\n\n172\n00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.570\nIt's an enterprise edition but\nit is not part of the domain.\n\n173\n00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:41.750\nAnd your user, I think I'm logged on\nas Albert, so what Albert's gonna do\n\n174\n00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:46.050\nis he's gonna say, you know, he's got his\nnew laptop, he's got Windows 10 installed.\n\n175\n00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.200\nNow he wants to use that to\nconnect to work resources.\n\n176\n00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.250\nSo he knows that or he's been told\nthat he has to do an Azure AD join,\n\n177\n00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.460\nand how does he go about doing that?\n\n178\n00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.370\nWe're going to go into his settings.\n\n179\n00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.690\nAnd then we're going to go to Accounts.\n\n180\n00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.820\nAnd then the option right here,\nAccess work or school.\n\n181\n00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.003\nWe'll click on that and\nthis is where I can configure or\n\n182\n00:09:09.003 --> 00:09:10.655\nI can make that connection.\n\n183\n00:09:10.655 --> 00:09:15.487\nSo I'm gonna click connect and\nthis is where the authentication process\n\n184\n00:09:15.487 --> 00:09:19.221\ncomes in to keep strangers\nfrom joining your as your AD.\n\n185\n00:09:19.221 --> 00:09:24.058\nSo I'll say albert@ I\nforget what my domain\n\n186\n00:09:24.058 --> 00:09:28.113\nitprotvlab.onmicrosoft.com and\n\n187\n00:09:28.113 --> 00:09:33.090\nmy password, if I remember it, hopefully.\n\n188\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.020\nIt's always a good thing.\n\n189\n00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.422\nAnd it says, hold on while we register\nthis device with your company and\n\n190\n00:09:42.422 --> 00:09:43.350\napply policy.\n\n191\n00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.270\nThis may take a moment, and there we go.\n\n192\n00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.010\nOnce I've verified my\npassword I can click Done.\n\n193\n00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.040\nAnd we will give it just a minute.\n\n194\n00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.825\nAnd now we can see work or school account.\n\n195\n00:09:55.825 --> 00:10:00.404\nalbert@itprotvlab.onmicrosoft.com so\n\n196\n00:10:00.404 --> 00:10:04.140\nthis is now a Azure AD joined device.\n\n197\n00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.640\nSo from here the user\ncan pull up information.\n\n198\n00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.140\nThey can click info and\nthey can see the last time it synced,\n\n199\n00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.221\npolicy are being applied.\n\n200\n00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:16.200\nI got some connection information here,\n\n201\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.063\ndo some diagnostics, we can also\nif I go back, I could disconnect.\n\n202\n00:10:21.063 --> 00:10:27.250\nIf I didn't want this to be part of that\nAzure domain anymore, I just disconnect.\n\n203\n00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.860\nAlso click Manage your account,\nwhich is actually going to go out and\n\n204\n00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.890\ntake me to the portal.office.\n\n205\n00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.107\nOr no, I'm sorry,\nactivedirectory.windowsazure.\n\n206\n00:10:38.351 --> 00:10:42.037\nYou can use this to reset your password,\nand yes, this is the first I've\n\n207\n00:10:42.037 --> 00:10:46.990\nconnected from this browsers, so it's\ngiving me all these crazy options here.\n\n208\n00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:51.500\nWe don't wanna verify it right now but\nwe'll verify it one more time.\n\n209\n00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.520\nOkay, Microsoft better safe than sorry,\nright?\n\n210\n00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.817\nSo we say.\n\n211\n00:11:00.256 --> 00:11:01.124\nThere we go.\n\n212\n00:11:04.115 --> 00:11:08.255\nAnd I'm not gonna set up all of my, I\nmean you really should in the real world,\n\n213\n00:11:08.255 --> 00:11:10.930\nin case I lose my password or something.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.087\n&gt;&gt; These are VMs that I am\n\n215\n00:11:12.087 --> 00:11:13.186\ngoing to blow away.\n\n216\n00:11:13.186 --> 00:11:16.734\nSo there we go I can now see that\nthere it is Albert's laptop is now\n\n217\n00:11:16.734 --> 00:11:18.330\nWindows Workplace joined.\n\n218\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:23.860\nI can't do as much as an end user\nas far as the devices go from here.\n\n219\n00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.500\nBut at this point it is\nnow a managed device and\n\n220\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.370\nI can start accessing work resources or\nwhatever my\n\n221\n00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.580\nIT department has allowed me to do.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n222\n00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.320\nthat really wasn't difficult at all.\n\n223\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.290\nI mean we're walking through these steps.\n\n224\n00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.300\nIt didn't take long.\n\n225\n00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.960\nThe end user can go ahead and\ncomplete this process.\n\n226\n00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.460\nIt's quite a shift from\nprovisioning it on site,\n\n227\n00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.380\nmailing it to the employee or\nyour customer.\n\n228\n00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.230\nAnd now we see this is just so\n\n229\n00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.681\nmuch easier.\n&gt;&gt; IT really is,\n\n230\n00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:51.610\nnow there are ways we're not\ngoing to cover them in here.\n\n231\n00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.830\nIt's not called out\nspecifically on the objectives.\n\n232\n00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.030\nThere are ways to do\nthis ahead of the OOBE.\n\n233\n00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.990\nThe out of box experience.\n\n234\n00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.370\nThis is a Windows laptop that\nthe user was already using,\n\n235\n00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.260\nwhich is typically what you're gonna see.\n\n236\n00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.220\nYou've got your user that says, hey,\n\n237\n00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.620\ncan I use my laptop to connect\nto this while I'm at home?\n\n238\n00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.330\nSure.\n\n239\n00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.060\nIf you were, as Cherokee was saying,\nyou're gonna roll out brand new devices.\n\n240\n00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.710\nYou can Azure AD join them before\nyou pass it off to the user.\n\n241\n00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.680\nThis is so darn easy.\n\n242\n00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.150\nOne thing, last thing I will check,\nlet's go back over here to all devices and\n\n243\n00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.620\njust see if it showed up.\n\n244\n00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.420\nAnd sure enough, there it is,\nAlbert's laptop.\n\n245\n00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:31.070\nThe one we just joined in, here's all\nthe information about that device.\n\n246\n00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.210\nAnd I can manage it.\n\n247\n00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.520\nI can come over here,\nI can see this device.\n\n248\n00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.042\nI'm just kind of clicking\non a little fast but\n\n249\n00:12:40.042 --> 00:12:43.320\nI wanted to wipe company data if\nI wanted to do a factory reset.\n\n250\n00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.930\nIf I wanted to do a Defender scan or\n\n251\n00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.730\nupdate Windows Defender settings,\nsync settings, restart the machine.\n\n252\n00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:57.180\nAll of that can now be done because\nthey chose to Azure AD join that device.\n\n253\n00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.850\nBut unlike standard or what we think of,\nI don't even know what to call it anymore,\n\n254\n00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:04.020\ntraditional Active Directory,\nwe've got users and groups.\n\n255\n00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.990\nI've got Devices, which takes me\nright back to that same screen.\n\n256\n00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.260\nIt's not like on-premises traditional\nActive Directory where I have\n\n257\n00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.666\ncomputer accounts.\n\n258\n00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:17.570\nHalf of these devices,\nsome of these are like iPad,there is\n\n259\n00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:22.690\nanother home machine,\nthis is actually a domain join machine.\n\n260\n00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:28.420\nTraditional domain join machine which is\nautomatically Azure AD registered as well.\n\n261\n00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.290\nBut a lot of these devices\nare not part of the domain.\n\n262\n00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.660\nBut I'm still able to manage them.\n\n263\n00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.520\nThat's really what,\nas your AD domain joint is all about.\n\n264\n00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.450\nGetting that device\nconnected as your tenant.\n\n265\n00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.522\nBeing able to remotely manage\nthose devices and allow those\n\n266\n00:13:41.522 --> 00:13:44.080\ndevices to access company resources.\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n267\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.270\nThank you for\ntaking the time to share with us today.\n\n268\n00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:49.488\nAnd it's probably a good idea,\nnot just for the exam, but\n\n269\n00:13:49.488 --> 00:13:51.670\nfamiliarized with this process.\n\n270\n00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.080\nSo that if you are helping\nan end user via the phone or\n\n271\n00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.920\nsome other type of communication, you can\njust walk through these steps easily.\n\n272\n00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.520\nAnd make it a seamless process,\nso that your\n\n273\n00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.978\nend user doesn't have any frustrations.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We always try to avoid that,\n\n274\n00:14:04.978 --> 00:14:05.947\nright?\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n275\n00:14:05.947 --> 00:14:06.631\nThat's right.\n\n276\n00:14:06.631 --> 00:14:08.740\n[LAUGH] Well, thank you so\nmuch for joining us today.\n\n277\n00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.040\nBut that's it for this show.\n\n278\n00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.730\nWe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n279\n00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.080\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm mike Rodrick.\n\n280\n00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.009\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n281\n00:14:17.009 -->

Doing great Cherokee,\n\n10\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.831\nthanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:32.719\nI'm excited as always to\nbe here with you guys and\n\n12\n00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.880\ngals talking about good old Windows 10.\n\n13\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.460\nAnd yeah we got our dynamic lock\nthat we wanna configure today.\n\n14\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.310\nThis is one of those, they've\nupdated the objectives recently and\n\n15\n00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.840\nthis is a new feature in\nWindows 10 that they've added.\n\n16\n00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.138\nSo we're gonna go back, do a little video,\nand show you how to set it up so\n\n17\n00:00:47.138 --> 00:00:48.611\nyou'll be ready for that exam.\n\n18\n00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:51.620\nOr just be ready to use the feature-\n&gt;&gt; And that's pretty cool, yeah.\n\n19\n00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.263\n&gt;&gt; I have to say so [CROSSTALK]\n\n20\n00:00:52.263 --> 00:00:52.933\n&gt;&gt; So I like it.\n\n21\n00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.072\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's one of those things that\n\n22\n00:00:54.072 --> 00:00:54.780\nI've thought about.\n\n23\n00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.100\nWow, maybe I should use this.\n\n24\n00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.940\nAnd I should, but I'll tell you in all.\n\n25\n00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.390\nWe'll talk about some of\nthe caveats of it here.\n\n26\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.140\nIn just a minute.\n\n27\n00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.530\nLet me show you what it's all about,\n\n28\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.990\nexplain it, show you how to get it set up,\nshow you how to get it to work.\n\n29\n00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.550\nAnd we'll talk a little bit about it.\n\n30\n00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.830\nSo, what it is, dynamic lock,\nbasically all you gonna do is you're gonna\n\n31\n00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.535\npair a Bluetooth with the device\nwith your Windows 10 device.\n\n32\n00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:18.125\nAnd then,\n\n33\n00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:23.095\nWindows 10 is going to recognize when\nthat Bluetooth device is out of range.\n\n34\n00:01:23.095 --> 00:01:26.445\nWhen there's so much separation\nbetween that paired device and\n\n35\n00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:27.925\nthe Windows 10 device.\n\n36\n00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:29.585\nAnd once that separation occurs,\n\n37\n00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:32.925\nwhen you get to that distance,\nit's going to lock your computer.\n\n38\n00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:35.595\nIt's going to throw up your lock screen,\nand\n\n39\n00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:39.450\nnow you're going to have to put in your\npassword to get back into that machine.\n\n40\n00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.540\nSo it's a great idea.\n\n41\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.950\nYou're sitting there, and\nlet's say you pair your phone.\n\n42\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.580\nNow, it should be a common one to do.\n\n43\n00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.905\nBut anything Bluetooth that you can\npair with it you wear your headphones or\n\n44\n00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:51.170\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, most everybody has some kind of\n\n45\n00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.565\ndevice on them all short of some kind\nof implant or chip nowadays right?\n\n46\n00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:56.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Pretty close.\n\n47\n00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.560\nI mean, I'm in line for\nthe implant as soon as they get one.\n\n48\n00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.920\nBut yeah, it could be your iPhone or\nyour iWatch.\n\n49\n00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.000\nIs that what they call it iWatches?\n&gt;&gt; Apple watch.\n\n50\n00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.870\n&gt;&gt; Apple watches.\n\n51\n00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.410\nSorry.\nI got to get that lingo straight or\n\n52\n00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.500\nany other brand of Bluetooth device.\n\n53\n00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.620\nIt doesn't have to be an iPhone or\nanything like that.\n\n54\n00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.890\nAnything Bluetooth, my Bose headphones for\nexample that I wear around my neck.\n\n55\n00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.800\nI can pair those with my laptop and\nif I gt up from my desk at work and\n\n56\n00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.960\nI walk down to the watering hole and\n\n57\n00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.250\nI forgot to lock my computer before\nI walked away it's gonna lock.\n\n58\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.630\nAs soon as that Bluetooth\ndevice is out of range.\n\n59\n00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.600\nFor about a minute.\n\n60\n00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.510\nIt doesn't happen immediately sometimes.\n\n61\n00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.130\nThey say it's about a minute\nof being out of range.\n\n62\n00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.360\nThat way if there's any momentary\nglitches, and things like that,\n\n63\n00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.870\nit's not locking your\ncomputer all the time on you.\n\n64\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.510\nAnd the range is going to vary.\n\n65\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.170\nI can't tell you that it's going to be,\nwhen you're 50 feet away from your\n\n66\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.460\ncomputer or 75 feet away-\n&gt;&gt; I think that depends on the device and\n\n67\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.380\nwhat kind of building you're in, what\nkind of obstacles are there and then what\n\n68\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.120\nversion of Bluetooth you're running.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n69\n00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.590\nright remember Bluetooth is RF,\nradio frequency.\n\n70\n00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.340\nSo if I'm walking down a long hallway I\nmight have to get really far down that\n\n71\n00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.860\nhallway before it disconnects.\n\n72\n00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.260\nBut if there's several walls and\n\n73\n00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.010\ndoors that I'm going through as I\nwalk away it might occur faster.\n\n74\n00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.180\nDifferent devices maybe\ndepending on the radio and\n\n75\n00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.220\nhow they've got it tuned might\nvary that distance as well.\n\n76\n00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.270\nSo it's not a testable thing\nwhere they're gonna say,\n\n77\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.170\nhow many feet from your computer\ndo you have to be before it locks.\n\n78\n00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.590\n&gt;&gt; Or if you have it in the pocket of your\n\n79\n00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.290\nblue jeans because it seems like\nwhenever I want to listen to music and\n\n80\n00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.950\nI put my phone in my pocket my blue jeans\nit always like starts becoming choppy at\n\n81\n00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.860\nthat point [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; And you get that RF\n\n82\n00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.110\nblocking pockets on your jeans.\n&gt;&gt; I guess so.\n\n83\n00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.456\n&gt;&gt; To keep people from scanning\n\n84\n00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:42.990\nyour credit card as you're\nwalking down the street.\n\n85\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.305\n&gt;&gt; I think you're on to something.\n\n86\n00:03:44.305 --> 00:03:46.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n87\n00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.980\nAnyway, don't steal my idea.\n\n88\n00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.600\nIf you get rich, you owe me a commission.\n\n89\n00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.520\nSo let's take a look at how we do it.\n\n90\n00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.290\nFirst off, you're gonna pair your device.\n\n91\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.610\nThat's not really part of the objectives.\n\n92\n00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.860\nI will show you if you want to\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n93\n00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.790\nLet's just go the shortcut way.\n\n94\n00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.710\nWe're gonna show Bluetooth devices.\n\n95\n00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.451\nSo in your settings, and then you\ngo into Bluetooth &amp; other devices.\n\n96\n00:04:08.451 --> 00:04:11.660\nHere you can see that my phone,\nmy other bad phone.\n\n97\n00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.635\nI know chuckle.\n&gt;&gt; Brother.\n\n98\n00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:15.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, chuckles insterted here, I know.\n\n99\n00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.440\nHas been paired with my laptop.\n\n100\n00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.890\nSo that's step one.\n\n101\n00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.160\nAnd you could have several devices paired.\n\n102\n00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.670\nYou're gonna pick which one.\n\n103\n00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.390\nAnd then once we've got that set up,\n\n104\n00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.752\nwe're gonna go to Accounts and\nthen Sign-in options.\n\n105\n00:04:30.752 --> 00:04:37.430\nAnd in Sign-in options, if I scroll down,\nhere's where I'm gonna see Dynamic lock.\n\n106\n00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.800\nWindows can use devices that are paired\nto your PC to know when you're away.\n\n107\n00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.370\nAllow Windows to detect when you're\naway and automatically lock the device.\n\n108\n00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.660\nI'm going to check that.\n\n109\n00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.000\nNow, interesting thing.\n\n110\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.260\nYou're not picking which device.\n\n111\n00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.520\nI'm not saying my phone or my headphones.\n\n112\n00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.640\nIt's any devices.\n\n113\n00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.270\nAny Bluetooth devices that\nare paired with my computer\n\n114\n00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.210\nthat when I sit next to my computer they\nare in range and their going to pair up.\n\n115\n00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.290\nAnd when I leave to go to lunch or\nto the bathroom or\n\n116\n00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.790\nwhat have you those\nare gonna be out of range.\n\n117\n00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.130\nSo that's any device that's paired\ncurrently will be, if it disconnects,\n\n118\n00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.000\nis going to lock my screen.\n\n119\n00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.790\nSo now to test this,\nnow I've got that turned on, right?\n\n120\n00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.400\nI'm gonna have to go for\na little walk about.\n\n121\n00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.020\nSo I'm gonna leave you here with Cherokee.\n\n122\n00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.620\nI'm gonna leave my screen just like that.\n\n123\n00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.700\nCherokee, keep it busy, and\n\n124\n00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.630\nI'm gonna walk away.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n125\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.220\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna see what happens.\n\n126\n00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.460\nYou're ready for this?\n&gt;&gt; I'm ready.\n\n127\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.060\n&gt;&gt; I need some work\n\n128\n00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.500\nabout music.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n129\n00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.360\nBut I'm gotta look at Mike's screen, so\n\n130\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.890\nI'm gonna kinda shift over here and\nwalk over.\n\n131\n00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.770\nAnd what I'm gonna be looking for\nis just to see right his desktop locks and\n\n132\n00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.560\nwhere our desks are located.\n\n133\n00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.730\nThere's a monitor on the screen.\n\n134\n00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.650\nSo we will go ahead and be responsible for\ngiving Mike a thumbs up whenever\n\n135\n00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.540\nhis computer screen locks, so\nhe knows when to come back.\n\n136\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.440\nSo I'm just trying to talk\nto fill the time also here.\n\n137\n00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.359\nHasn't logged yet, so I wonder how\nfast Mike is really walking here.\n\n138\n00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.040\nAll right, still unlocked.\n\n139\n00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.853\nSo you can see how maybe in this situation\nhaving a stronger Bluetooth connection\n\n140\n00:06:14.853 --> 00:06:16.420\nmight be a disadvantage.\n\n141\n00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:20.535\nIt is still unlocked.\n\n142\n00:06:20.535 --> 00:06:24.320\n[LAUGH]\nAnd it's locked.\n\n143\n00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.460\nOk we're good.\n\n144\n00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.430\nWe're good to go Mike.\n\n145\n00:06:28.182 --> 00:06:32.940\n[LAUGH]\nSo now you can see his screen is locked.\n\n146\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.580\nI wonder how many feet that is actually.\n\n147\n00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.470\nSo it's down a hallway.\n\n148\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:43.290\nThere are a couple of rooms between us and\nthe office space so it's a good distance.\n\n149\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.040\nSo it might not be the best solution for\n\n150\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.120\nsomething that requires high security but\nit definitely works.\n\n151\n00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.410\nSo, that's pretty cool.\n\n152\n00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.550\nAnd Mike is back.\n\n153\n00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.136\nWelcome back Mike we missed you.\n\n154\n00:06:54.136 --> 00:06:55.167\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n155\n00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:56.210\n&gt;&gt; All right did you\n\n156\n00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.462\nget it all my day [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n157\n00:06:57.462 --> 00:07:00.175\nit actually worked.\n&gt;&gt; Good, so you weren't able to read my\n\n158\n00:07:00.175 --> 00:07:03.645\nemails, my text messages even though\nI forgot to lock my computer.\n\n159\n00:07:03.645 --> 00:07:05.205\n&gt;&gt; It was up for a little while.\n\n160\n00:07:05.205 --> 00:07:06.365\nThere was sometimes.\n\n161\n00:07:06.365 --> 00:07:08.345\nSo maybe if I was super stealthy and\n\n162\n00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:11.727\ndid some kind of ninja working was\nreally fast I might have been able to.\n\n163\n00:07:11.727 --> 00:07:15.159\nBut it would have been someone in\nyour close proximity, I think, for\n\n164\n00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:17.487\nthat time frame.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n165\n00:07:17.487 --> 00:07:21.107\nAnd the thing is, if we remember, you\nwere sitting here watching me walk away.\n\n166\n00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.457\nNormally I'd be in my cubicle or\nsomething like that.\n\n167\n00:07:23.457 --> 00:07:26.517\nIt might be 30 minutes before\nanybody realizes I'm gone and\n\n168\n00:07:26.517 --> 00:07:27.657\nhopefully by then it's locked.\n\n169\n00:07:27.657 --> 00:07:29.917\nSo not the end all in security.\n\n170\n00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:35.140\nNot bullet proof, but definitely one more\nlayer of defense and I noticed that,\n\n171\n00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.830\nit didn't unlock when I got back.\n\n172\n00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.923\nIt didn't automatically unlock,\n\n173\n00:07:38.923 --> 00:07:43.735\nmaybe that's the next dynamic lock feature\nthat the [INAUDIBLE] cameras will start\n\n174\n00:07:43.735 --> 00:07:46.958\nunlocking our devices actually\n[INAUDIBLE] to do that.\n\n175\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.235\nBut that's another day, another story.\n\n176\n00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:54.490\nBut yeah, you know, this is something that\nwe try to teach our users all the time.\n\n177\n00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.470\nLock your screen, Windows Key+L.\n\n178\n00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.080\nIt's so easy to do.\n\n179\n00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.840\nEvery time you get up and\n\n180\n00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.720\nwalk away because you've got corporate\ninformation on there, sensitive data.\n\n181\n00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.730\nCould be data that is above\nother people's pay grades.\n\n182\n00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.080\nAnd if you leave your computer unlocked\nanybody that walks by can see that\n\n183\n00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.170\ninformation.\n\n184\n00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.020\nEspecially in areas where,\nespecially nowadays with these\n\n185\n00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.140\nopen office environments where you don't\nhave a lot of privacy at your desk.\n\n186\n00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.750\nAnd people walking by can see your screen.\n\n187\n00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.230\nSo this is a great feature.\n\n188\n00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.006\nEven up at, I was gonna say Starbucks,\nbut typically where you're sitting at\n\n189\n00:08:24.006 --> 00:08:26.768\nthe coffee shop and the-\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully you're not utilizing\n\n190\n00:08:26.768 --> 00:08:30.410\nsensitive corporate data at Starbucks.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're not usually\n\n191\n00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.730\nwalking that far away from your laptop or\ndevice to have it lock.\n\n192\n00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:38.370\nSo a really cool feature there again\nthat's called dynamic lock and all of\n\n193\n00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:43.790\nthese is pairing a Bluetooth device with\nyour computer, your Windows 10 computer.\n\n194\n00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.470\nAnd then checking a little check mark\nwhich is underneath Settings, Accounts,\n\n195\n00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.790\nSign in options.\n\n196\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:53.710\nAnd once I turn that on, it's gonna lock\nas soon as that device again is out of\n\n197\n00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.860\nrange for more than about a minute.\n\n198\n00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.430\nAnd it will, And even if you had started.\n\n199\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.970\nThe one thing I haven't tested.\n\n200\n00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:04.425\nAnd that's if you had walked away and\nyou started using my computer.\n\n201\n00:09:04.425 --> 00:09:05.010\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n202\n00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.580\n&gt;&gt; Yet, my device is way over there.\n\n203\n00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.449\nI don't know how it's gonna\ntreat your devices away-\n\n204\n00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:09.647\n&gt;&gt; My system is active.\n\n205\n00:09:09.647 --> 00:09:10.831\n&gt;&gt; But your system is active.\n\n206\n00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:13.190\nThat's something-\n&gt;&gt; That could be our next test.\n\n207\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.180\n&gt;&gt; That'll be our next test.\n\n208\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.400\nWe'll save that for part two.\n&gt;&gt; You did say that there were\n\n209\n00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.710\na few drawbacks here.\n\n210\n00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.980\nSo what were those?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n211\n00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.560\nyou know it comes down to\nnon-security related things.\n\n212\n00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.150\nLike I found that that if I got up and\nwalked over\n\n213\n00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.550\nto Nate's desk to ask him something and\ncame back it had locked my screen.\n\n214\n00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.489\nSo it's really not a drawback\nit's more of a convenience.\n\n215\n00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:35.127\n&gt;&gt; Were you paired with your phone or\n\n216\n00:09:35.127 --> 00:09:37.770\nwith a different device?\n&gt;&gt; I was paired with my phone.\n\n217\n00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n218\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:40.809\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think if there is\n\n219\n00:09:40.809 --> 00:09:41.720\nanything other than that.\n\n220\n00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.760\nThat's really it.\n\n221\n00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.280\nIt's just that I can see some end users\n\n222\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.300\ncomplaining.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n223\n00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.040\n&gt;&gt; That it's a little,\n\n224\n00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.450\nI don't wanna have to unlock my\ncomputer when I get back to it.\n\n225\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.290\nBut you know what?\n\n226\n00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.010\nThat's security.\n\n227\n00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:54.740\nWe need that.\n\n228\n00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.380\nAll right?\nSo\n\n229\n00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.550\nreally no drawback to this.\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\n\n230\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.078\nruling with an iron fist over here.\n\n231\n00:10:00.078 --> 00:10:02.320\n[LAUGH] No, but that was really cool.\n\n232\n00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.590\nDidn't take long to setup.\n\n233\n00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.580\nThank you for that.\n\n234\n00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.040\nAnd thank you for joining us as well.\n\n235\n00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.280\nMike do you have any final\nthoughts before we sign\n\n236\n00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:08.870\nout?\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n237\n00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.970\nI think we'll save it for the next one.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n238\n00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:11.980\nWell thank you for joining us.\n\n239\n00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.700\nBut we'll go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n240\n00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.030\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n241\n00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.019\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n242\n00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:24.654\n[MUSIC]\n\n243\n00:10:24.654 --> 00:10:28.187\n&gt;&gt;
