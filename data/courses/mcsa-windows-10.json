          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:03.278\n[SOUND] In this segment,\n\n2\n00:00:03.278 --> 00:00:08.316\nwe are going to do an overview of the new\n\n3\n00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:13.047\n70-697 exam for Microsoft.\n\n4\n00:00:13.047 --> 00:00:18.670\nWhich is really a Windows 10 exam,\nwhich is configuring devices and features.\n\n5\n00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.838\nAnd obviously it's going to be\ninside the Windows 10 environment.\n\n6\n00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:25.558\nAnd I brought along Mike here to helps us\nwalk through some of the objectives in\n\n7\n00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:28.547\nthe domains there and\nto see what we can expect from this exam.\n\n8\n00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:31.289\n>> Yeah, it's going to be a little\ndifferent from some of the other client\n\n9\n00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.671\nexams that we've done in the past.\n\n10\n00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.380\nIt's gonna go more towards The Cloud.\n\n11\n00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.240\nWe're gonna bring in a lot of\ndifferent Cloud technologies,\n\n12\n00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.320\nbecause we need to be able to\nsupport these Windows 10 devices and\n\n13\n00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.005\nthere's a lot of integrated features\nin Windows 10 that deal with The Cloud.\n\n14\n00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.547\nOneDrive, for example, and\nRemoteApp, and many others.\n\n15\n00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:53.962\nSo when we look at this, we're gonna be\nlooking at Windows 10 as our platform.\n\n16\n00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:57.770\nAnd we've got to look at Windows\n10 on laptops, on desktops,\n\n17\n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.296\non mobile devices, on tablets and\nintegrating that with The Cloud as well.\n\n18\n00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:07.431\nSo a little bit of a difference from\nwhat we might have seen on Windows 7,\n\n19\n00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:09.462\nfor example, client exam.\n\n20\n00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:13.575\nSo let's take a look at the,\nas Daniel said, it's 70-697,\n\n21\n00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:17.628\nthat's gonna be the exam number,\nconfiguring Windows devices.\n\n22\n00:01:17.628 --> 00:01:20.331\nAnd we take a look at the skills\nthat we're going to be going over,\n\n23\n00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:21.963\nto help you get prepared for this exam.\n\n24\n00:01:21.963 --> 00:01:22.796\nThere's a lot of them.\n\n25\n00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:25.596\nWe're going to be talking\nabout identities and\n\n26\n00:01:25.596 --> 00:01:28.754\nhow we can support Windows Store apps and\nCloud apps.\n\n27\n00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:31.714\nAgain, you'll see a lot of these\nnew technologies being brought in,\n\n28\n00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:34.123\nbecause that's just what our\nusers are gonna be using and\n\n29\n00:01:34.123 --> 00:01:36.046\nyou've gotta be able\nto support this stuff.\n\n30\n00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:41.230\nOffice 365, using Microsoft Intune\nto deploy applications\n\n31\n00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.421\nout to devices, even non-Windows devices,\niOS and Android.\n\n32\n00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:48.671\nSupporting different\nauthentication methods.\n\n33\n00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:52.790\nAnd Windows 10 brings in a lot of\nnew things with biometrics and\n\n34\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.004\nPINs that we can use on\nsome of our mobile devices.\n\n35\n00:01:56.004 --> 00:02:00.278\nWe start getting down into desktop\ndeployment and using migrating user\n\n36\n00:02:00.278 --> 00:02:04.421\nprofiles from their older operating\nsystem, over to Windows 10.\n\n37\n00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:08.379\nCuz we know that Windows 10 does things a\nlot different as far as that profile goes.\n\n38\n00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.494\nWe've gotta see how do we move their stuff\nfrom their old devices over to their new\n\n39\n00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:13.046\ndevices?\n\n40\n00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:19.504\nUsing Hyper-V and supporting remote\ndesktop or virtual desktop infrastructure.\n\n41\n00:02:19.504 --> 00:02:22.337\nMobility options like Windows to go.\n\n42\n00:02:22.337 --> 00:02:24.046\nSynchronizing files.\n\n43\n00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:26.462\nAnd again, it's just a change\nin the way we do things.\n\n44\n00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:30.338\nWe're on more mobile devices, I need to be\nable to work with those files from many\n\n45\n00:02:30.338 --> 00:02:33.086\ndifferent platforms,\nfrom many different locations.\n\n46\n00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.087\nThis is gonna make sure we're ready for\nthat.\n\n47\n00:02:35.087 --> 00:02:36.504\nSetting up BitLocker.\n\n48\n00:02:36.504 --> 00:02:39.379\nMobile devices,\neasy to lose, easy to steal.\n\n49\n00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.629\nGotta make sure that data is safe.\n\n50\n00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.501\nSo supporting those mobile devices, again,\n\n51\n00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:47.379\nyou see a lot of Intune\nin our objectives here.\n\n52\n00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.430\nUsing that to push out updates or\nagain, push out applications.\n\n53\n00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.670\nThen we get down into some of our old,\nI call it old school, like we use to do.\n\n54\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.879\n>> A little more traditional type\nof things that we can expect.\n\n55\n00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.254\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n56\n00:03:00.254 --> 00:03:04.477\nSo dealing with configuring IP,\nbecause we still have to deal with TCPIP\n\n57\n00:03:04.477 --> 00:03:08.011\nconfiguration, network locations,\nwireless networks,\n\n58\n00:03:08.011 --> 00:03:12.582\nsetting up our firewall to allow all of\nthese different types of connections,\n\n59\n00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:14.754\nand yet still keep our devices safe.\n\n60\n00:03:14.754 --> 00:03:15.921\nUsing storage.\n\n61\n00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:18.004\nSo DFS client settings.\n\n62\n00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:22.003\nAnd how do they connect and\naccess those work resources?\n\n63\n00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:28.296\nAgain, keeping that data safe using\nEFS and BitLocker and BitLocker To Go.\n\n64\n00:03:28.296 --> 00:03:32.379\nHow do I manage that from\na enterprise standpoint?\n\n65\n00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.772\nHow do we use things like MBAM,\nMicrosoft's BitLocker administration and\n\n66\n00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:40.683\nmonitoring, so that I don't have\nto touch every single machine and\n\n67\n00:03:40.683 --> 00:03:42.962\nconfigure BitLocker independently.\n\n68\n00:03:42.962 --> 00:03:44.337\nData access protection.\n\n69\n00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:47.534\nWe start getting into\nHomeGroup settings and\n\n70\n00:03:47.534 --> 00:03:52.170\nconfiguring libraries and\nfolder permissions using OneDrive.\n\n71\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.971\nManaging remote access\nwith VPN connections and\n\n72\n00:03:55.971 --> 00:04:00.336\nVPN reconnect and Wi-Fi Direct and\nmore Windows To Go.\n\n73\n00:04:00.336 --> 00:04:03.837\nWe get down into applications and\nwe're looking at Azure.\n\n74\n00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:06.942\nAll right this is a big thing now and\neven on these client exams,\n\n75\n00:04:06.942 --> 00:04:09.650\nthey're gonna expect you\nto understand some of that.\n\n76\n00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.420\nAll right?\n\n77\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.191\nMaybe not going out to Azure and\nsetting everything up, but\n\n78\n00:04:13.191 --> 00:04:14.921\nmaking sure my clients can connect.\n\n79\n00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.003\nWhat do I do when they don't\nget those remote apps?\n\n80\n00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:19.421\nWhy are they not showing\nup on their device?\n\n81\n00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:21.087\nSo how do we support all that?\n\n82\n00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:24.572\nHow do we make these applications\nthat we've had in the past,\n\n83\n00:04:24.572 --> 00:04:27.220\nwork on these Windows 10 devices?\n\n84\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.340\nThings like\nthe Application Compatibility Toolkit,\n\n85\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.220\nusing Hyper-V as your remote app,\nor User Experience Virtualization.\n\n86\n00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.604\nSo allowing those older applications\nto still function, and then, of course,\n\n87\n00:04:39.604 --> 00:04:42.754\nbeing able to recover in\nthe event something does go wrong.\n\n88\n00:04:42.754 --> 00:04:46.129\nSo looking at System Recovery,\nSystem Restore.\n\n89\n00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.209\nAnd Windows 10 has some cool new\nfeatures with the refresh options and\n\n90\n00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:51.504\nthe recycle options.\n\n91\n00:04:51.504 --> 00:04:55.921\nWe can still do stuff that we did in\nthe past, like our driver rollbacks.\n\n92\n00:04:55.921 --> 00:05:00.962\nWe've got our file history,\nstoring some of that up on OneDrive.\n\n93\n00:05:00.962 --> 00:05:04.869\nSo, you're gonna see some of the stuff\nthat we used to do in the past with our\n\n94\n00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:08.296\nclients as well as a lot of new\nstuff being brought into this exam.\n\n95\n00:05:08.296 --> 00:05:10.447\nSo this exam is really designed for\n\n96\n00:05:10.447 --> 00:05:14.463\nanybody that's going to have\nto support Windows 10 devices.\n\n97\n00:05:14.463 --> 00:05:20.004\nWhether that's desktops, laptops,\nphones, tablets, any of that.\n\n98\n00:05:20.004 --> 00:05:22.555\nAnd even some non-Microsoft devices,\n\n99\n00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:26.462\nbecause we know in today's\nnetworks we've got a lot of BYOD.\n\n100\n00:05:26.462 --> 00:05:29.511\nWe've got a lot of people that\nare bringing in devices that are not\n\n101\n00:05:29.511 --> 00:05:30.128\nMicrosoft.\n\n102\n00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:31.619\nWe've got our iOS devices,\n\n103\n00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:35.796\nwe've got our android devices, and we\nneed to be able to support those as well.\n\n104\n00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:39.558\nSo if you're somebody that is planning\non getting into the field and\n\n105\n00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:42.004\nsupporting these types of mobile devices.\n\n106\n00:05:42.004 --> 00:05:45.206\nOr if you're already out there and\nyour network is now changing and\n\n107\n00:05:45.206 --> 00:05:49.035\nthings are moving out to The Cloud, and\nyou've got to continue to support those\n\n108\n00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:51.922\nclient devices,\nthis is gonna be the video series for you.\n\n109\n00:05:51.922 --> 00:05:54.254\nAnd in the end, you're gonna get\na certification out of it, right?\n\n110\n00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:57.563\nWe're gonna go through\nall of these objectives,\n\n111\n00:05:57.563 --> 00:06:00.962\ngetting you ready to\ntake that 70-697 exam.\n\n112\n00:06:00.962 --> 00:06:04.629\nThat's gonna get you that Microsoft\nCertified Professional certification.\n\n113\n00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:09.519\nAnd probably more as they move on\nwith those exam, but that is yet\n\n114\n00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:13.879\nto be seen, it's still kind\nof in the beta at this point.\n\n115\n00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:17.254\nBut you'll definitely get your\nMicrosoft Certified Professional.\n\n116\n00:06:17.254 --> 00:06:20.295\nMost likely other certifications\nat the end of all of this.\n\n117\n00:06:20.295 --> 00:06:25.296\nSo, if that wounds like something that\nyou have to do now or want to move into.\n\n118\n00:06:25.296 --> 00:06:29.586\nIf that's the career path that you want\nto go down, this is the place to be.\n\n119\n00:06:29.586 --> 00:06:31.380\nThese are the videos for you.\n\n120\n00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.586\nThis is going to help you get\nthat 70-697 certification.\n\n121\n00:06:35.586 --> 00:06:38.504\nSo, hope to see you here soon.\n\n122\n00:06:38.504 --> 00:06:44.679\n[SOUND]\n\n",
