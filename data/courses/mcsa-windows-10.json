          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:03.278\n[SOUND] In this segment,\n\n2\n00:00:03.278 --> 00:00:08.316\nwe are going to do an overview of the new\n\n3\n00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:13.047\n70-697 exam for Microsoft.\n\n4\n00:00:13.047 --> 00:00:18.670\nWhich is really a Windows 10 exam,\nwhich is configuring devices and features.\n\n5\n00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.838\nAnd obviously it's going to be\ninside the Windows 10 environment.\n\n6\n00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:25.558\nAnd I brought along Mike here to helps us\nwalk through some of the objectives in\n\n7\n00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:28.547\nthe domains there and\nto see what we can expect from this exam.\n\n8\n00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:31.289\n>> Yeah, it's going to be a little\ndifferent from some of the other client\n\n9\n00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.671\nexams that we've done in the past.\n\n10\n00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.380\nIt's gonna go more towards The Cloud.\n\n11\n00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.240\nWe're gonna bring in a lot of\ndifferent Cloud technologies,\n\n12\n00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.320\nbecause we need to be able to\nsupport these Windows 10 devices and\n\n13\n00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.005\nthere's a lot of integrated features\nin Windows 10 that deal with The Cloud.\n\n14\n00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.547\nOneDrive, for example, and\nRemoteApp, and many others.\n\n15\n00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:53.962\nSo when we look at this, we're gonna be\nlooking at Windows 10 as our platform.\n\n16\n00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:57.770\nAnd we've got to look at Windows\n10 on laptops, on desktops,\n\n17\n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.296\non mobile devices, on tablets and\nintegrating that with The Cloud as well.\n\n18\n00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:07.431\nSo a little bit of a difference from\nwhat we might have seen on Windows 7,\n\n19\n00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:09.462\nfor example, client exam.\n\n20\n00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:13.575\nSo let's take a look at the,\nas Daniel said, it's 70-697,\n\n21\n00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:17.628\nthat's gonna be the exam number,\nconfiguring Windows devices.\n\n22\n00:01:17.628 --> 00:01:20.331\nAnd we take a look at the skills\nthat we're going to be going over,\n\n23\n00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:21.963\nto help you get prepared for this exam.\n\n24\n00:01:21.963 --> 00:01:22.796\nThere's a lot of them.\n\n25\n00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:25.596\nWe're going to be talking\nabout identities and\n\n26\n00:01:25.596 --> 00:01:28.754\nhow we can support Windows Store apps and\nCloud apps.\n\n27\n00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:31.714\nAgain, you'll see a lot of these\nnew technologies being brought in,\n\n28\n00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:34.123\nbecause that's just what our\nusers are gonna be using and\n\n29\n00:01:34.123 --> 00:01:36.046\nyou've gotta be able\nto support this stuff.\n\n30\n00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:41.230\nOffice 365, using Microsoft Intune\nto deploy applications\n\n31\n00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.421\nout to devices, even non-Windows devices,\niOS and Android.\n\n32\n00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:48.671\nSupporting different\nauthentication methods.\n\n33\n00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:52.790\nAnd Windows 10 brings in a lot of\nnew things with biometrics and\n\n34\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.004\nPINs that we can use on\nsome of our mobile devices.\n\n35\n00:01:56.004 --> 00:02:00.278\nWe start getting down into desktop\ndeployment and using migrating user\n\n36\n00:02:00.278 --> 00:02:04.421\nprofiles from their older operating\nsystem, over to Windows 10.\n\n37\n00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:08.379\nCuz we know that Windows 10 does things a\nlot different as far as that profile goes.\n\n38\n00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.494\nWe've gotta see how do we move their stuff\nfrom their old devices over to their new\n\n39\n00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:13.046\ndevices?\n\n40\n00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:19.504\nUsing Hyper-V and supporting remote\ndesktop or virtual desktop infrastructure.\n\n41\n00:02:19.504 --> 00:02:22.337\nMobility options like Windows to go.\n\n42\n00:02:22.337 --> 00:02:24.046\nSynchronizing files.\n\n43\n00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:26.462\nAnd again, it's just a change\nin the way we do things.\n\n44\n00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:30.338\nWe're on more mobile devices, I need to be\nable to work with those files from many\n\n45\n00:02:30.338 --> 00:02:33.086\ndifferent platforms,\nfrom many different locations.\n\n46\n00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.087\nThis is gonna make sure we're ready for\nthat.\n\n47\n00:02:35.087 --> 00:02:36.504\nSetting up BitLocker.\n\n48\n00:02:36.504 --> 00:02:39.379\nMobile devices,\neasy to lose, easy to steal.\n\n49\n00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.629\nGotta make sure that data is safe.\n\n50\n00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.501\nSo supporting those mobile devices, again,\n\n51\n00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:47.379\nyou see a lot of Intune\nin our objectives here.\n\n52\n00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.430\nUsing that to push out updates or\nagain, push out applications.\n\n53\n00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.670\nThen we get down into some of our old,\nI call it old school, like we use to do.\n\n54\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.879\n>> A little more traditional type\nof things that we can expect.\n\n55\n00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.254\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n56\n00:03:00.254 --> 00:03:04.477\nSo dealing with configuring IP,\nbecause we still have to deal with TCPIP\n\n57\n00:03:04.477 --> 00:03:08.011\nconfiguration, network locations,\nwireless networks,\n\n58\n00:03:08.011 --> 00:03:12.582\nsetting up our firewall to allow all of\nthese different types of connections,\n\n59\n00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:14.754\nand yet still keep our devices safe.\n\n60\n00:03:14.754 --> 00:03:15.921\nUsing storage.\n\n61\n00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:18.004\nSo DFS client settings.\n\n62\n00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:22.003\nAnd how do they connect and\naccess those work resources?\n\n63\n00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:28.296\nAgain, keeping that data safe using\nEFS and BitLocker and BitLocker To Go.\n\n64\n00:03:28.296 --> 00:03:32.379\nHow do I manage that from\na enterprise standpoint?\n\n65\n00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.772\nHow do we use things like MBAM,\nMicrosoft's BitLocker administration and\n\n66\n00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:40.683\nmonitoring, so that I don't have\nto touch every single machine and\n\n67\n00:03:40.683 --> 00:03:42.962\nconfigure BitLocker independently.\n\n68\n00:03:42.962 --> 00:03:44.337\nData access protection.\n\n69\n00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:47.534\nWe start getting into\nHomeGroup settings and\n\n70\n00:03:47.534 --> 00:03:52.170\nconfiguring libraries and\nfolder permissions using OneDrive.\n\n71\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.971\nManaging remote access\nwith VPN connections and\n\n72\n00:03:55.971 --> 00:04:00.336\nVPN reconnect and Wi-Fi Direct and\nmore Windows To Go.\n\n73\n00:04:00.336 --> 00:04:03.837\nWe get down into applications and\nwe're looking at Azure.\n\n74\n00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:06.942\nAll right this is a big thing now and\neven on these client exams,\n\n75\n00:04:06.942 --> 00:04:09.650\nthey're gonna expect you\nto understand some of that.\n\n76\n00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.420\nAll right?\n\n77\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.191\nMaybe not going out to Azure and\nsetting everything up, but\n\n78\n00:04:13.191 --> 00:04:14.921\nmaking sure my clients can connect.\n\n79\n00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.003\nWhat do I do when they don't\nget those remote apps?\n\n80\n00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:19.421\nWhy are they not showing\nup on their device?\n\n81\n00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:21.087\nSo how do we support all that?\n\n82\n00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:24.572\nHow do we make these applications\nthat we've had in the past,\n\n83\n00:04:24.572 --> 00:04:27.220\nwork on these Windows 10 devices?\n\n84\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.340\nThings like\nthe Application Compatibility Toolkit,\n\n85\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.220\nusing Hyper-V as your remote app,\nor User Experience Virtualization.\n\n86\n00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.604\nSo allowing those older applications\nto still function, and then, of course,\n\n87\n00:04:39.604 --> 00:04:42.754\nbeing able to recover in\nthe event something does go wrong.\n\n88\n00:04:42.754 --> 00:04:46.129\nSo looking at System Recovery,\nSystem Restore.\n\n89\n00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.209\nAnd Windows 10 has some cool new\nfeatures with the refresh options and\n\n90\n00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:51.504\nthe recycle options.\n\n91\n00:04:51.504 --> 00:04:55.921\nWe can still do stuff that we did in\nthe past, like our driver rollbacks.\n\n92\n00:04:55.921 --> 00:05:00.962\nWe've got our file history,\nstoring some of that up on OneDrive.\n\n93\n00:05:00.962 --> 00:05:04.869\nSo, you're gonna see some of the stuff\nthat we used to do in the past with our\n\n94\n00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:08.296\nclients as well as a lot of new\nstuff being brought into this exam.\n\n95\n00:05:08.296 --> 00:05:10.447\nSo this exam is really designed for\n\n96\n00:05:10.447 --> 00:05:14.463\nanybody that's going to have\nto support Windows 10 devices.\n\n97\n00:05:14.463 --> 00:05:20.004\nWhether that's desktops, laptops,\nphones, tablets, any of that.\n\n98\n00:05:20.004 --> 00:05:22.555\nAnd even some non-Microsoft devices,\n\n99\n00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:26.462\nbecause we know in today's\nnetworks we've got a lot of BYOD.\n\n100\n00:05:26.462 --> 00:05:29.511\nWe've got a lot of people that\nare bringing in devices that are not\n\n101\n00:05:29.511 --> 00:05:30.128\nMicrosoft.\n\n102\n00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:31.619\nWe've got our iOS devices,\n\n103\n00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:35.796\nwe've got our android devices, and we\nneed to be able to support those as well.\n\n104\n00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:39.558\nSo if you're somebody that is planning\non getting into the field and\n\n105\n00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:42.004\nsupporting these types of mobile devices.\n\n106\n00:05:42.004 --> 00:05:45.206\nOr if you're already out there and\nyour network is now changing and\n\n107\n00:05:45.206 --> 00:05:49.035\nthings are moving out to The Cloud, and\nyou've got to continue to support those\n\n108\n00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:51.922\nclient devices,\nthis is gonna be the video series for you.\n\n109\n00:05:51.922 --> 00:05:54.254\nAnd in the end, you're gonna get\na certification out of it, right?\n\n110\n00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:57.563\nWe're gonna go through\nall of these objectives,\n\n111\n00:05:57.563 --> 00:06:00.962\ngetting you ready to\ntake that 70-697 exam.\n\n112\n00:06:00.962 --> 00:06:04.629\nThat's gonna get you that Microsoft\nCertified Professional certification.\n\n113\n00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:09.519\nAnd probably more as they move on\nwith those exam, but that is yet\n\n114\n00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:13.879\nto be seen, it's still kind\nof in the beta at this point.\n\n115\n00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:17.254\nBut you'll definitely get your\nMicrosoft Certified Professional.\n\n116\n00:06:17.254 --> 00:06:20.295\nMost likely other certifications\nat the end of all of this.\n\n117\n00:06:20.295 --> 00:06:25.296\nSo, if that wounds like something that\nyou have to do now or want to move into.\n\n118\n00:06:25.296 --> 00:06:29.586\nIf that's the career path that you want\nto go down, this is the place to be.\n\n119\n00:06:29.586 --> 00:06:31.380\nThese are the videos for you.\n\n120\n00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.586\nThis is going to help you get\nthat 70-697 certification.\n\n121\n00:06:35.586 --> 00:06:38.504\nSo, hope to see you here soon.\n\n122\n00:06:38.504 --> 00:06:44.679\n[SOUND]\n\n",

welcome\nto another great episode of IT ProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.760\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.860\nHere with me today,\nwell, it's Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.640\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.750\n>> It is going well today.\n\n8\n00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.650\nIt's another great day to be right here.\n\n9\n00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.770\nWe're taking a look at more of\nconfiguring Windows 10 devices.\n\n10\n00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.440\nAnd what we're moving into is the realm of\nwell, cloud apps more than anything else.\n\n11\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.140\nMicrosoft has actually got this big\npush where they are trying to move\n\n12\n00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.080\neverybody off of trying to install\napplications directly on your computer.\n\n13\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.020\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n14\n00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.350\nYou can still do it but\n\n15\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.180\nthey really would like you to\nactually manage them differently.\n\n16\n00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.170\nIn other words to depend on cloud\nservices is where they're pushing.\n\n17\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.110\nSo if you've heard of things like\nOffice 365 and Windows InTune and\n\n18\n00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.160\nMicrosoft Azure, that is what Microsoft\nconsiders some of their cloud services\n\n19\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.710\nofferings, and they really want you as\na windows 10 technician to at least me\n\n20\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.130\nthe baseline familiar with these products\nand what they can actually do for us.\n\n21\n00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.240\nNow the whole goal is really simple\nif you are going to be supporting and\n\n22\n00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.680\nenterprise, one of the hardest\nthings inside of the enterprise, and\n\n23\n00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.080\nwe been talking about this now for years\nand years Is a management of software and\n\n24\n00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.800\napplications that we have, is very easy\nfor a single corporation to lose track\n\n25\n00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.840\nof how much software they've actually\ndeployed and pushed out into the world.\n\n26\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.380\nAnd the reason why is it's fairly\nsimple as a small company.\n\n27\n00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.400\nWhere all of a sudden somebody says, oh\nyeah do you mind if I take this disc and\n\n28\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.130\nalso put it on my computer at home?\n\n29\n00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.510\nDo you mind if I take this application and\nput this onto the systems at home?\n\n30\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.300\nNow Daniel, you've worked for\na big organization.\n\n31\n00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.380\nHas that ever happened for you?\n\n32\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.640\n>> Oh yeah, plenty of times.\n\n33\n00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.321\nWith this has been basically the way it's\nbeen done up until cloud apps became\n\n34\n00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:55.927\nsomething of a thing that we can actually.\n\n35\n00:01:55.927 --> 00:01:58.615\nI got a new user that comes\nin with their computer, says,\n\n36\n00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:01.583\nwell if I'm gonna work from home or\nI'm gonna work on the road,\n\n37\n00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:05.540\nI'm gonna need those applications to\nactually do the work you need me to do.\n\n38\n00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.110\nSo we gotta scrounge up a disk, gotta make\nsure they have a licensed copy of it,\n\n39\n00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.900\ngotta make sure that we\nhave enough licenses for\n\n40\n00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.440\nall the copies that we're using.\n\n41\n00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.940\nAnd then, well,\nsomething tends to usually happen.\n\n42\n00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.270\nWell, I also needed it on my daughter's\ncomputer and I also installed it on my\n\n43\n00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.100\nwife's computer, and I put it on my\nhusband's computer, and this and that.\n\n44\n00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.490\nNext thing you know, you've got 12\ndifferent computers from one installation,\n\n45\n00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.770\none authorization that we've given out.\n\n46\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.960\nAnd now we're running out of licenses,\nand we don't want to do that.\n\n47\n00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.220\nThat's when this kind of thing steps in,\nand gives us the ability to say,\n\n48\n00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.110\nit doesn't matter what computer you're on,\nyou can still access the app.\n\n49\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.800\nYou don't have to install any software,\n\n50\n00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.515\nand it doesn't matter\nwhat computer you're at.\n\n51\n00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:41.255\nMakes things very very much easier.\n\n52\n00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:42.725\n>> Right.\nIt's all about the management of\n\n53\n00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:46.165\nthe software that you and\nI have to come into contact with.\n\n54\n00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:50.205\nAnd what that means is now what we can\ndo is we can control those apps a little\n\n55\n00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:52.020\nbit easier and a little bit better.\n\n56\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.990\nAnd depending on how much service and\nhow much control you need,\n\n57\n00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.390\nwill actually give you, you know, a need\nfor what product that we're talking about.\n\n58\n00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.870\nWhat we wanna start off with\nright away is Office 365,\n\n59\n00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.130\nand the reason why is well because Office\nis one of the main line productivity\n\n60\n00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.120\ntypes of software that we\ntend to put on our computers.\n\n61\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.800\nIt generally includes a word processor,\nsome type of spread sheet program.\n\n62\n00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.060\nOf course everybody's favorite PowerPoint.\n\n63\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.460\nYou can't get away without PowerPoint.\n\n64\n00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.770\nEven if you don't ever do\nPowerPoint presentations.\n\n65\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.500\nEverybody for\nsome reason wants PowerPoint.\n\n66\n00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.110\n>> Because it's cool.\n\n67\n00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.470\n>> Because it's so cool, that's right.\n\n68\n00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.720\nYou get to actually make these little\nthings jump across the screen.\n\n69\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.520\n[LAUGH] And, you know,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n70\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.620\nBut you have those applications,\nand then you can\n\n71\n00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.530\nactually use those productivity packs,\nand it is so popular and it's so useful.\n\n72\n00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.570\nAnd so you tend to want to buy that for\n\n73\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.060\nyour whole organization and\ninstall it on every single computer.\n\n74\n00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.040\nBut with office 365 you can do the same\nthing but what they do instead is they say\n\n75\n00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.470\nand go, here's how it's going to\nbe Daniel, for your organization\n\n76\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.190\nwe're going to charge you per\nsubscription is what they're going to do.\n\n77\n00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.933\nYou're going to say how\nmany users you need and\n\n78\n00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:59.219\nthen what they'll do of course is\ndepending on what level you need it at,\n\n79\n00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:03.116\nthey will go ahead and\nactually give you access to Office 365.\n\n80\n00:04:03.116 --> 00:04:06.512\nIn other words online, so what can\nhappen is you don't have to actually\n\n81\n00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:09.530\nhave it installed on any\ncomputer you don't want to.\n\n82\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.300\nBut then they can charge you a little\nbit more and they can say well, Ronnie,\n\n83\n00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.370\nif you really do need that to be\ndownloaded to your computer, we can offer\n\n84\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.690\nnot only the online version for you, but\nalso the ability for you to install it on\n\n85\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.810\nseveral computers as well and\nit'll just cost you this amount of money.\n\n86\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.070\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about\nand show you why this would actually offer\n\n87\n00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.480\na little bit more control for\nyour organization and\n\n88\n00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.960\nsomething that Windows 10 users\nare gonna have get used to doing.\n\n89\n00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.033\nSo on my computer, I went ahead and\nlaunched the Office Online portal.\n\n90\n00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:42.311\nAnd so when your company says\nyou're going to Office 365,\n\n91\n00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:46.440\nyou're gonna end up with a username and\npassword somehow.\n\n92\n00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.200\nSo usually it's gonna\nbe tied to your email,\n\n93\n00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.870\nand then they're gonna issue\nprobably a temporary password, and\n\n94\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.940\nthen you'll log in and\nyou'll change your password.\n\n95\n00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.770\nDepending on the level,\nthe enterprise level\n\n96\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.580\nof what your Office 365\nsubscription is gonna be,\n\n97\n00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.390\nyou'll see something that may look\nsimilar to what I'm seeing right here.\n\n98\n00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.190\nWhich is that you'll have access to all\nof these things that, these tiles up here\n\n99\n00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.840\nthat you see in blue, and even some of\nthese that are actually multicolored.\n\n100\n00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.805\nAnd this means that these applications\nwill run without needing can be\n\n101\n00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:18.945\nphysically installed on the computer\nitself, works perfectly fine.\n\n102\n00:05:18.945 --> 00:05:23.655\nSo if I were to select,\nlet's say Excel, I could simply\n\n103\n00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:28.880\ncreate a brand new spreadsheet and\nit actually feels very much the same.\n\n104\n00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.550\nAs what I would be used to working\nwith in that productivity package\n\n105\n00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.140\nthat was installed right on my computer\nthe nice thing about this though is that\n\n106\n00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.410\nwhen I save it, wanna make changes to it,\nthose are usually automatically stored,\n\n107\n00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.740\nI don't have to his save every time.\n\n108\n00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.640\nI can, that's not a bad idea, but\n\n109\n00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.350\nthen I can go to any computer inside\nof my network and, actually anywhere.\n\n110\n00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.424\nI can go home and still log in Office 365,\nmy work will still be there.\n\n111\n00:05:54.424 --> 00:05:57.889\nAnd, so there is a big advantage of doing\nsome of this, and all that stuff is\n\n112\n00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.244\nactually going to be saved into\na cloud storage, that Microsoft loves,\n\n113\n00:06:01.244 --> 00:06:05.000\nthat's called OneDrive, so that way\nyou'll have access to it wherever you go.\n\n114\n00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.230\nSo it is a neat product for\nus to be able to have access to.\n\n115\n00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.900\nAnd by doing this,\nif your company doesn't want anybody to\n\n116\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.080\ninstall it onto their computers but\nstill have the functional access.\n\n117\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.450\nThis is the way to go.\n\n118\n00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.660\nSo that way you don't have to worry.\n\n119\n00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.200\nIs it on their computer?\n\n120\n00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.560\nDo they need a new computer?\n\n121\n00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.520\nWell, a lot of times in a web app,\nyou don't really have to worry about it.\n\n122\n00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.400\nIt will run directly online, all you need\nis a browser that will actually support\n\n123\n00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.390\nit, and you're ready to go.\n\n124\n00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.720\nSo if they don't need that\nthere's one option, but\n\n125\n00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.670\nif you do need that, you actually do have\nthe option to purchase a subscription\n\n126\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.320\nthat will allow you to download\nthe app onto your computer.\n\n127\n00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.350\nNow, this is where it can get a little\nbit more expensive and the reason why.\n\n128\n00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.840\nIs that, so like my subscription\nthat I have available to me,\n\n129\n00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.720\nnotice this says install it on well Office\ndevices on devices, on more devices here.\n\n130\n00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.270\nIf I click on this install right here.\n\n131\n00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.310\nWell let me see if I can click on it.\n\n132\n00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.200\nIt will actually show me,\nright here it says manage installs,\n\n133\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.960\nif you don't have any installs\nleft you can deactivate and\n\n134\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.450\ninstall on one computer and\nthen install it on another one.\n\n135\n00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.830\nThe nice thing that I know on mine\nis it gives me up to five installs.\n\n136\n00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.900\nSo that scenario that Dan was talked\nabout oh yeah, once I got it home,\n\n137\n00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.400\nI put it on my daughter's computer,\nI put it on my husband's computer.\n\n138\n00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.460\nMy neighbor asked for it, I put it over\nthere, and all of a sudden before I knew\n\n139\n00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.810\nit, it was actually out across\nthe entire neighborhood.\n\n140\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.330\nWell, here it lets you know.\n\n141\n00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.590\nIts gonna be able to look and\nsee if there's five devices\n\n142\n00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.910\nthat that application's been installed to,\nthat's the maximum.\n\n143\n00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.083\nIt doesn't matter how many times you go\nand log in someplace, if you say hey i'm\n\n144\n00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:43.254\ngonna go to my neighbor, I'm gonna go down\nto the Y and just install this on every\n\n145\n00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:47.678\ncomputer it's gonna go ahead and go well I\nsee five devices, which one of these other\n\n146\n00:07:47.678 --> 00:07:50.885\nfive do you want to remove that so\nyou can install it on there.\n\n147\n00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:55.945\nSo it is about good control And now as\nDaniel's actually an enterprise admin for\n\n148\n00:07:55.945 --> 00:08:00.626\nlet's say a thousand users, well he\ndoesn't have to worry if it actually\n\n149\n00:08:00.626 --> 00:08:04.220\ngot installed on somebody's 12 users or\nnot.\n\n150\n00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.170\nHe knows the count,\nhe's already paying for it.\n\n151\n00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.100\nAnd he says, look it's fine for\neverybody in my organization.\n\n152\n00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.620\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n153\n00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.250\nThey can do with the five\nwhatever they want to.\n\n154\n00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.865\nWe know that it's installed on their\nwork machine right there, so that's one.\n\n155\n00:08:15.865 --> 00:08:19.400\nSo they have four left and they can put it\non their laptop that they're working with,\n\n156\n00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.980\non their home computer.\n\n157\n00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.030\nAnd we don't worry about it.\n\n158\n00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.650\nAnd so, all the licensing is managed.\n\n159\n00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.520\nWe don't have to worry about\ndistributing disks anymore.\n\n160\n00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.960\nWe don't have to worry about any of that.\n\n161\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.500\nBecause it can be all\ninstalled from the cloud.\n\n162\n00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.810\nIt is very nifty because now\nwe're no longer having to manage.\n\n163\n00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:37.960\nYeah, where was that last time\nthat we found that office disk?\n\n164\n00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.370\nOh, who has the last product\nkey that's out there.\n\n165\n00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.230\nI don't even have a product key,\nit's all activated right here.\n\n166\n00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.570\nNow this is not the only\nsoftware available but\n\n167\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.970\nit is one of the biggest packages that you\ntend to find especially in an organization\n\n168\n00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.770\nthat they do want to deploy.\n\n169\n00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.540\nNow, if we take a look\nat My Computer again,\n\n170\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.200\nyou can see that there's actually\nsome other apps that are also here.\n\n171\n00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.240\nAnd there's also an Office 365 store.\n\n172\n00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:04.810\nSo if I select this Office 365 store,\n\n173\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.950\nit of course will bring us to\na bunch of applications that we have\n\n174\n00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:13.090\nif it ever comes in and you actually\nend up seeing that a lot of vendors and\n\n175\n00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.360\na lot of different companies, generally\nthere's a lot more than I thought.\n\n176\n00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.550\nA lot of companies have actually developed\nthese smaller little applications that\n\n177\n00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.420\nhelp to enhance the functionality of\nOffice and maybe even offer a little bit\n\n178\n00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.400\nmore of some of the different\nthings that's available out there.\n\n179\n00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.150\nIt's still churning along like it's\nwanting to come in but it's not.\n\n180\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.730\nSo you will find even those situations.\n\n181\n00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:37.120\nLet me see if I can find it\non this other computer that I\n\n182\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.690\nthought I had put it on to.\n\n183\n00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.920\nThere we go, okay.\n\n184\n00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.620\nSo let me show you.\n\n185\n00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.200\nI went ahead and\nloaded it up on this computer as well.\n\n186\n00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.370\nSo right here I selected one that\nsays Salesforce App for Outlook.\n\n187\n00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.870\nI click back on it just a moment,\n\n188\n00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:54.190\nhere's some of these office apps that you\ntend to find inside the Office store.\n\n189\n00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.520\nSo these are small little\napplications that work side by side\n\n190\n00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.440\nwith your office apps,\nand you can pick them\n\n191\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.320\ndepending on the category that you want\nto deal with and a lot of them are free.\n\n192\n00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.850\nSome of them can be a little\nbit pricey as well,\n\n193\n00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.080\nit just depends on what functionality\nthat you need to go along.\n\n194\n00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:16.270\nSo once again a nice little\nhandy place that you as\n\n195\n00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.780\na support technician You don't have to\nworry about, yeah I just have to wait for\n\n196\n00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.790\nDaniel to call me back to tell me whether\nor not I have access to that app or not.\n\n197\n00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.650\nI can actually find it right here.\n\n198\n00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.670\nAnd so\nthis is probably one of the nicer ways\n\n199\n00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.600\nto be able to at least deploy\nsome apps that are out there.\n\n200\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.360\nFor us,\nespecially that big office product which\n\n201\n00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.840\nnone of us really want to manage\nthe licensing to that thing.\n\n202\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.330\nBut, overall though,\nit's a great little utility for us.\n\n203\n00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.710\nAnd that's actually a product that\nwe use right here at ITproTV.\n\n204\n00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.090\n>> Oh yeah,\nwe love Office 365 around here.\n\n205\n00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.230\nIt's made our lives a whole lot easier.\n\n206\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.170\nAnd like Ronnie was showing you,\n\n207\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:51.810\nwe have five devices that each of\nus can install the software on to.\n\n208\n00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.210\nITProTV is already paying the bill for it,\nso it doesn't matter what we put it on,\n\n209\n00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.140\nbut I'll tell you what,\n\n210\n00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.930\nit does curtail a lot of that sharing\nwith everybody kind of business,\n\n211\n00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.910\nbecause once I've reached my limitation,\nI can't install it on any more devices.\n\n212\n00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.590\nSo, neighbor Bob comes over and says,\nhey, you got that latest Office for me?\n\n213\n00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:08.930\nI could say yeah.\n\n214\n00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.510\nBut you are not getting it because-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n215\n00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.000\n>> I've already got it on three devices\n\n216\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.480\nfor my personal use.\n\n217\n00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.153\nMy laptop, my tablet and my phone.\n\n218\n00:11:16.153 --> 00:11:19.870\nAnd I have it on my wife and\nI have it on my kids and that's five,\n\n219\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.270\nI don't have any more to give.\n\n220\n00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.860\nI am literally out of\nways to share this out.\n\n221\n00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.520\nSo it could curtail that up.\n\n222\n00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.730\nIf I did share it with Bob,\nthat'd be fine, but\n\n223\n00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.230\nif I ever wanted to add another device,\nwe'll guess who's probably getting the ax.\n\n224\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.161\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Guess who's getting that revoked out,\n\n225\n00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:36.983\nit's probably going to be Bob,\nit's cuz I'm gonna need it for my devices.\n\n226\n00:11:36.983 --> 00:11:38.172\nSo that's a really good thing.\n\n227\n00:11:38.172 --> 00:11:41.480\nAnd then the Office store,\nbefore what did we have to do?\n\n228\n00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.680\nWe had to hear,\noh did you hear about that cool?\n\n229\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.230\nThe productivity app, that runs on Office?\n\n230\n00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:48.380\nSo it's so awesome.\n\n231\n00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.730\nYou had to kind of hear about\nthese things word-of-mouth.\n\n232\n00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.940\nNow you just go into the store,\nperuse around.\n\n233\n00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.360\nFind some cool stuff, maybe even it's\nfree, you pay a little money for\n\n234\n00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.310\na thing or two but we're used to that.\n\n235\n00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.200\nIt's worth it if it's going to\nhelp you out in your business.\n\n236\n00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.060\nSo you just purchase it right there in\nthe app store, install the software,\n\n237\n00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:06.880\nyou're off to the races.\n\n238\n00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.730\nIt's great stuff.\n\n239\n00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.980\n>> It really is because of\nthe control more than anything else.\n\n240\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.070\nAnd so the way to get access\nto that usually is, again,\n\n241\n00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.720\njust opening up a browser,\n\n242\n00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.270\nmaking sure that you have access to it\nby whatever the logon that you're given.\n\n243\n00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.890\nA lot of times if a company\nis moving to Office 365,\n\n244\n00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.100\nyou're probably gonna see\nthat your email will probably\n\n245\n00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.220\nbe that username that you'll end\nup using at the very beginning.\n\n246\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.380\nAnd then you'll change your password\nonce you log in, and, more than likely,\n\n247\n00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.290\nyour email is actually going\nto be managed from there, too.\n\n248\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.300\nAnd this is a big benefit\ninside of the business\n\n249\n00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.360\nbecause it now means that the email is\nactually handled by Microsoft, itself, and\n\n250\n00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.140\nnow you have access to that client.\n\n251\n00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.480\nAnd that's actually a big kind of relief,\nright?\n\n252\n00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.600\nBecause email is the lifeblood\nof most businesses.\n\n253\n00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.660\nAnd all it takes is somebody thinking\nthat they didn’t get one email.\n\n254\n00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.600\nAnd then that’s when the panic chain\nstarts happening like, I really did,\n\n255\n00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.790\nI needed that one email that didn’t come\nthrough, or I don’t think it came through.\n\n256\n00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:02.520\nAnd you have to go back and now you’re\nscouring your little spam filter to check.\n\n257\n00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.240\nAnd of course you look at the spam filter\nand there’s like 400,000 pieces of email.\n\n258\n00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.350\nAnd you’re like I can’t believe I\njust gotta let this thing scan and\n\n259\n00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.210\nfind that one email.\n\n260\n00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.310\nAnd then when it doesn’t find it, and\nyou come back to them, you’re like no,\n\n261\n00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.050\nI swear it's actually got to\nbe locked in there somewhere.\n\n262\n00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.870\nAnd then you have to go and\nscan it again and try and find that and\n\n263\n00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.540\nyou let them know.\n\n264\n00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.800\nAnd they are like,\nI guess I didn't get it.\n\n265\n00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.640\nIt's one of those headache things, right.\n\n266\n00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.550\nWell now, by doing Office 365,\na lot easier in terms of the management.\n\n267\n00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.910\nEven as an administrator, even though\nI'm the Windows 10 support technician,\n\n268\n00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:35.140\nif I'm given privileges to do so, there's\nan administrative center that I log in and\n\n269\n00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.790\nI can check people's accounts,\nI can do the same thing\n\n270\n00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.730\nwithout having to actually figure\nout what machine is actually on.\n\n271\n00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.350\nIt's just a web portal, great management\nlittle interface that we have.\n\n272\n00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.750\nNow with Office 365, that is one product.\n\n273\n00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:52.360\nMicrosoft is very proud of it's\nCloud based products as well and\n\n274\n00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.300\nthey each do serve a particular function.\n\n275\n00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.532\nThis one is by far the one that's designed\nto give you more productivity in your\n\n276\n00:13:59.532 --> 00:14:01.150\nbusiness right?\n\n277\n00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.930\nSo you combine this with a very stream\nlined operating system like Windows 10,\n\n278\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:09.830\nyou combine that with Office 365,\nwell you now have a mobile user, right?\n\n279\n00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:13.410\nThat regardless of what computer that\nthey're on, they can go anywhere and\n\n280\n00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.180\nnow they have access to all\nthose productivity applications,\n\n281\n00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.800\nthey need to have access to their email,\nthey have everything that they need.\n\n282\n00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.180\nEven if they wanted to go somewhere, let's\nsay that we sent Daniel, I'm gonna use\n\n283\n00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.470\nDaniel as my guinea pig here, we sent them\nout and we said look you just gotta go.\n\n284\n00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.470\nI said well, I don't have my computer.\n\n285\n00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.420\nThey said don't worry about it,\njust go, and\n\n286\n00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.600\nhe still needed to install Office\non a computer where he ended up.\n\n287\n00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.530\nPerfectly fine, he can just deactivate\none on his laptop right then and\n\n288\n00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.580\nthen he can install it on\nwhatever computer he's at.\n\n289\n00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.950\nWhen he's done there,\ndeactivates it, comes back,\n\n290\n00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.440\nreinstalls Office, he's ready to go.\n\n291\n00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.370\nIt really is a sleek management system for\na prod activity.\n\n292\n00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.260\nThat's not the only product that we have.\n\n293\n00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.840\nAnother one is, I'm gonna say it even\nthough Daniel is gonna laugh at me,\n\n294\n00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.044\nit's Daniel's favorite.\n\n295\n00:14:57.044 --> 00:14:59.546\n[LAUGH] It's Windows Intune.\n\n296\n00:14:59.546 --> 00:15:00.102\n>> Intune.\n\n297\n00:15:00.102 --> 00:15:01.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yes, Intune.\n\n298\n00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.950\nIntune is a management swift\nthat Microsoft has come up with.\n\n299\n00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:07.186\nI'm being facetious here.\n\n300\n00:15:07.186 --> 00:15:08.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're having a little fun with\n\n301\n00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.720\nMicrosoft's expense.\n\n302\n00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.760\n>> And Daniel's.\n\n303\n00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.012\n>> And mine as well and\nI'm okay with that, I can laugh at myself.\n\n304\n00:15:14.012 --> 00:15:18.930\nMicrosoft Intune is a management suite,\nallows you to kind of,\n\n305\n00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:23.460\nhow do we say this,\ntake control of devises and\n\n306\n00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:28.055\nuser that are in your organization\nthat aren't in your organization.\n\n307\n00:15:28.055 --> 00:15:29.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you're thinking\n\n308\n00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:29.760\n>> How it that?\n\n309\n00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.370\nIt sounds contradictory.\n\n310\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.655\nRonnie take it away.\n\n311\n00:15:32.655 --> 00:15:34.700\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well what we're talking about here\n\n312\n00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.590\nonce again is more control.\n\n313\n00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.340\nAnd the problem that we have is it is not\n\n314\n00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.770\nsoftware getting distributed like\ncrazy because somebody goes,\n\n315\n00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.870\nthey don't mind if I give this to\nmy junior league softball team.\n\n316\n00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.320\nIt's okay,\nthe company doesn't mind an extra 20 or\n\n317\n00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.250\n30 licenses it's not going to hurt them.\n\n318\n00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:54.257\nThe other problem is fairly simple,\nis now you have company equipment, and\n\n319\n00:15:54.257 --> 00:15:59.026\nnow Daniel goes out They don't mind if I\ninstall this program onto that computer.\n\n320\n00:15:59.026 --> 00:16:02.320\nThey don't mind if I actually go ahead and\nadd this onto the computer.\n\n321\n00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.665\nAnd they don't mind if I do this.\n\n322\n00:16:03.665 --> 00:16:07.660\nAnd all of a sudden, that computer\nnow comes back, we also have viruses,\n\n323\n00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.440\nwe have malware.\n\n324\n00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.310\nWe have a lot of different things.\n\n325\n00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:11.410\nAnd now it's out of control.\n\n326\n00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.170\nThe other thing that also ends up\nhappening when somebody takes a device on\n\n327\n00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.710\nthe road, like these mobile devices,\nlike laptops and tablets and stuff.\n\n328\n00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:18.920\nIt's fairly simple.\n\n329\n00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.110\nThey were working on a network,\nin your nice secured environment.\n\n330\n00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.660\nYou're behind a firewall.\n\n331\n00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:28.940\nDaniel's got the WSUS policies,\nthe Windows server update services,\n\n332\n00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.520\nthat server running, so\nthey're getting regular updates.\n\n333\n00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.060\nGroup policy is being pushed out.\n\n334\n00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.750\nDaniel's got those computers locked down,\nexactly the way that he wants.\n\n335\n00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:42.100\nAnd now here it is, Ronnie goes out\non the road, he takes that laptop.\n\n336\n00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.780\nDaniel, what about the Windows update\nservice and the group policy stuff?\n\n337\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.690\nHow's that working out now?\n\n338\n00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.260\n>> Yeah, it's not gonna do so\ngreat for him.\n\n339\n00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.330\nBecause like I said,\nI was having a little more fun here.\n\n340\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.560\nI've got a user who's in my organization,\nright?\n\n341\n00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.070\nRonnie's at Daniel.net.\n\n342\n00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:00.200\nAs long as he's plugged into a Daniel.net\nnetwork, all my SUS services,\n\n343\n00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.960\nmy group policy updates,\nit's gonna happen.\n\n344\n00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.730\nAs soon as he walks out of the building,\n\n345\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.550\nand he plugs it into the local\ncoffee house, now what?\n\n346\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.070\nHe's not getting those things, and\n\n347\n00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:13.120\nhe's using it for playing games,\nhe's installed this, that and the other.\n\n348\n00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.090\nJust like what he was saying before.\n\n349\n00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:16.500\nI have no control over that.\n\n350\n00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.130\nI can't stop him from what he's doing.\n\n351\n00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.780\nSo what do we do?\n\n352\n00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.980\nThat's where Microsoft N2 comes in.\n\n353\n00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.440\nKind of gives us a finger\non the pulse of our users,\n\n354\n00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.230\nwhen they're not in our network per se.\n\n355\n00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.960\nThey're out in the wild, right?\n\n356\n00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:30.810\n>> It really is.\n\n357\n00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:34.010\nIt's an incredible control\nmanagement system that you have\n\n358\n00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.420\navailable to your organization.\n\n359\n00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.670\nWhere what we can do is\nwe can actually say hey,\n\n360\n00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.360\nhere's the software,\nwe really want to run on your laptop.\n\n361\n00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.370\nAnd you don't have to go out and\nfind it at Bob's Wholesale\n\n362\n00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:51.880\nsoftware download site that you go,\nwhere is that located, exactly?\n\n363\n00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.800\nWho do you know?\n\n364\n00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.270\nI don't know, I just went out\nto the Internet to find it.\n\n365\n00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.910\nWell what you can do then is you\ncan go ahead and clear house.\n\n366\n00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.710\nKind of be the clearing house.\n\n367\n00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.650\nHere's the applications I\nwant you to be able to run.\n\n368\n00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.100\nAnd when your computer connects,\nit can connect to a portal and\n\n369\n00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.780\nthen you can choose those applications\nthat you want to run on that computer.\n\n370\n00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.195\nAnd then you can monitor that computer,\nand\n\n371\n00:18:13.195 --> 00:18:16.979\nget it to actually show inventory\nafter awhile, so that you can say,\n\n372\n00:18:16.979 --> 00:18:21.218\noh there it is, there's the next copy\nof whatever that latest game is sitting\n\n373\n00:18:21.218 --> 00:18:25.820\non this person's computer, and go I\ndon't want that game on that computer.\n\n374\n00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.710\nAnd you can simply uninstall it as well.\n\n375\n00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.770\nIt's kind of neat how much control,\n\n376\n00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:34.110\nIntune can really give you to\nmake it actually work for you.\n\n377\n00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:37.660\nNow, this is actually good,\nbecause we can do it, not only to people\n\n378\n00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.740\ninside of our network, that we chose\nto use that management system.\n\n379\n00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.800\nBut we can do it on computers\nlike portable computers,\n\n380\n00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.780\nlike these laptops that we have.\n\n381\n00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.760\nAnd the reason why that's important,\nis because they do go off of our network.\n\n382\n00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.710\nBut we still do need to control them.\n\n383\n00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:51.880\nWhat about the things like updates?\n\n384\n00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.990\nWe can force updates to happen.\n\n385\n00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.810\nWe can actually see whether or\nnot that computer is in compliance or not.\n\n386\n00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:02.230\nAnd then when we want to, we can even say,\nright now your gonna run a virus scan, and\n\n387\n00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:04.360\nactually make it work, okay.\n\n388\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.080\nSo, let me show you an example\nof what I'm talking about too.\n\n389\n00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.030\nNow, I'm actually using an older operating\nsystem right now as the example,\n\n390\n00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.560\ncuz I went ahead and did this.\n\n391\n00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.610\nI've installed the Intune client on here,\nand\n\n392\n00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.300\nthat means it's part of the Intune\nmanagement system that we have.\n\n393\n00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.380\nAnd you can see right now,\n\n394\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.010\nlet me see if I can bring up the lower\nright hand corner here for a moment.\n\n395\n00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.900\nAnd right now, here is the Intune\nclient that's actually available.\n\n396\n00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.350\nIs this little tiny portal that we have,\nand\n\n397\n00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:34.540\nthere's also this Win Intune\ndefender is what it is.\n\n398\n00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.410\nIt's the endpoint protection manager.\n\n399\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.910\nSo I'm gonna leave this right here.\n\n400\n00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.370\nAnd if I'm on my management console,\nso this can be my laptop,\n\n401\n00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.990\nit doesn't have to be joined to a domain\nor anything, I'm logged into Intune and\n\n402\n00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:47.330\nyou can see that over here\non the left hand side.\n\n403\n00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.687\nAnd once I do that,\nI can go to the groups here.\n\n404\n00:19:51.687 --> 00:19:53.506\nOop, let me see if I can go to groups.\n\n405\n00:19:53.506 --> 00:19:55.462\n>> Now Ronnie, Intune is accessed\nall through the web right?\n\n406\n00:19:55.462 --> 00:19:56.703\n>> It is.\n>> That's why it doesn't matter what\n\n407\n00:19:56.703 --> 00:19:57.287\ncomputer you're on.\n\n408\n00:19:57.287 --> 00:19:58.268\n>> It doesn't matter, yeah.\n\n409\n00:19:58.268 --> 00:20:01.169\nSo you can be on any computer\nas long as you log into it, and\n\n410\n00:20:01.169 --> 00:20:03.475\nyou have the account to\nget access to it here.\n\n411\n00:20:03.475 --> 00:20:05.980\nNow ill have to remember my password.\n\n412\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:06.730\n>> That will help.\n\n413\n00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:07.237\nYep.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n414\n00:20:07.237 --> 00:20:10.352\n>> I hope.\n\n415\n00:20:10.352 --> 00:20:12.050\nRonnie's super secret password.\n\n416\n00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:12.850\n>> I know, yeah.\n\n417\n00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.487\n>> The password is, buffalo.\n\n418\n00:20:14.487 --> 00:20:16.911\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah so once I logged back in,\n\n419\n00:20:16.911 --> 00:20:20.381\nIt's been just a few minutes\nsince I logged into it.\n\n420\n00:20:20.381 --> 00:20:22.970\nBut I select groups over\nhere on the left hand side.\n\n421\n00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.310\nAnd then I can go to all\nthe computers that are managed.\n\n422\n00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.350\nNow I only have this\none computer right now.\n\n423\n00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.160\nActually, two computers, I'm lying to you.\n\n424\n00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.400\nSo I can select the total\nof two devices here.\n\n425\n00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.600\nAnd see if I can get to it,\nI may be rushing it a little bit.\n\n426\n00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.700\nI always do that, I don't know why.\n\n427\n00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:41.209\nSo the Windows 8 computer is actually\nthis one right here, which is client A.\n\n428\n00:20:41.209 --> 00:20:45.973\nNow, I can go to remote task here, and\nif I wanted to, I could run a report and\n\n429\n00:20:45.973 --> 00:20:48.899\nsee when the last time\nthis thing was scanned.\n\n430\n00:20:48.899 --> 00:20:50.404\nIf I didn't think that\nthe person was scanning,\n\n431\n00:20:50.404 --> 00:20:52.500\nand he kept on saying no\nI don't want it scanned.\n\n432\n00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.300\nI can just say hey,\nI want to run a scan right now.\n\n433\n00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.810\nI can do a quick malware scan.\n\n434\n00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:58.750\nAnd now the request was sent.\n\n435\n00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.180\nAnd if I go back over here.\n\n436\n00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.625\nYou're going,\nRonnie that didn't do anything.\n\n437\n00:21:01.625 --> 00:21:06.685\nBut if I take a look down here in\nthe lower right hand corner, I can see.\n\n438\n00:21:06.685 --> 00:21:09.075\nLet's go ahead and see if we can\nshow that lower right hand corner.\n\n439\n00:21:09.075 --> 00:21:11.655\nYou can see that the scan\nis actually going on.\n\n440\n00:21:11.655 --> 00:21:15.405\nSo I was able to force it\nto begin the scan itself,\n\n441\n00:21:15.405 --> 00:21:17.335\nwithout having to do anything.\n\n442\n00:21:17.335 --> 00:21:19.255\nAnd that means that it can\nrun in the background.\n\n443\n00:21:19.255 --> 00:21:22.250\nNow you saw that it didn't actually\npop up anything for the end user.\n\n444\n00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.730\nSo that means a scan can run\nwithout them knowing it.\n\n445\n00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.930\nNow I can even have that ability,\nif I right click, and this,\n\n446\n00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:32.090\noh and I'm gonna go back to the remote\ntask, that's easier since I selected it.\n\n447\n00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.230\nI can even tell it to go ahead and\nrestart the computer,\n\n448\n00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.120\nand normally it gives a little\nbit of a delay in time.\n\n449\n00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.660\nNow, we're not getting\ninto all that right here.\n\n450\n00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.840\nBut there are other episodes where\nwe actually got into that, and\n\n451\n00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.930\nshowed that we could actually go ahead and\nrestart that computer.\n\n452\n00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.450\nAnd we even showed where you could\ndo what's called a remote wipe,\n\n453\n00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.510\nto wipe it clean if you wanted to,\nif someone were to steal it.\n\n454\n00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.070\nNow the whole goal here,\nis about software management.\n\n455\n00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:59.930\nSo notice that what I have over here is\nanother link here, that's called Apps.\n\n456\n00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:03.010\nAnd if I select Apps,\nlet's say that right now, and\n\n457\n00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.740\nthis is just a sample of\nwhat we have available.\n\n458\n00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.200\nBut let's say that I wanna make sure\nthat everybody that used my systems,\n\n459\n00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.530\nregardless of whether they bought\na brand new system or not.\n\n460\n00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:17.120\nThat they actually needed these\npieces of software available to them.\n\n461\n00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.550\nSo if that's exactly what needed to\nhappen, well they could log in and\n\n462\n00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:22.780\ndo that, and get access to the software.\n\n463\n00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.870\nSo let me show you here.\n\n464\n00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.620\nSo over here I have another, I actually\nhave a Windows 10 computer, I've logged\n\n465\n00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:33.070\nDaniel in, so Daniel's actually logged\ninto this computer, let me verify.\n\n466\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.230\nYep.\n\n467\n00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.840\nSo there he is at the top of the list\nthere, and he's logged into this computer.\n\n468\n00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.920\nAnd you can see that, let's say that\nthe Client A is Daniel's home laptop.\n\n469\n00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.100\nAnd here it is,\nhe's now got a work laptop,\n\n470\n00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.600\nhe's also been able to\nmanage from here too.\n\n471\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.010\nBut right now, what's happened is,\nhe was able to log into the portal and\n\n472\n00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.320\nbegin to download the software and\nbegin the part of the install.\n\n473\n00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.740\nAnd it does say that it was joined\naccording to the management portal.\n\n474\n00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:01.300\nBut right now it says this device\nis not enrolled, or can't identify.\n\n475\n00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.000\nIf I select right here, I set,\n\n476\n00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.650\nof course I forgot I've kind\nof timed it out a little bit.\n\n477\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:08.390\nLet me go and log back in.\n\n478\n00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:11.620\nAnd enter in Daniel's super\nsecret password there.\n\n479\n00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.342\n>> You been looking under\nmy keyboard again Ronnie?\n\n480\n00:23:13.342 --> 00:23:15.270\n>> I have.\nI noticed there was tape and,\n\n481\n00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.480\nyou know there we go.\n\n482\n00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.630\nSo now notice that we have these two\ndevices here, let me not save this for\n\n483\n00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:22.150\nthis site.\n\n484\n00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:24.200\nAnd so there it is.\n\n485\n00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.120\nFor the client computer we can actually\nsee that that's the one he has\n\n486\n00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.350\navailable to him.\n\n487\n00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.990\nNow, why is it not?\n\n488\n00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.770\nThere we go, I need to select that.\n\n489\n00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.590\nSo even though it actually recognizes,\nit says hey I can't really see which\n\n490\n00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:41.590\none you're on, so I can now select this\none, and now that's the one that I'm on.\n\n491\n00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:46.900\nI select that one,\nI can't say what I wanted to say there.\n\n492\n00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.405\nAnd in a moment we should now see,\nthere it is,\n\n493\n00:23:49.405 --> 00:23:53.216\nwe have access to those particular\napplications that were in my list.\n\n494\n00:23:53.216 --> 00:23:55.578\nSo if Daniel's not sure,\nif he goes, should I go ahead and\n\n495\n00:23:55.578 --> 00:23:57.860\ndownload this from this site,\nI go whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n496\n00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.640\nNo, just go and\nlog back into your Intune portal instead.\n\n497\n00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.115\nAnd what you need is right here,\nis this Word Viewer, okay?\n\n498\n00:24:05.115 --> 00:24:06.910\nNow this is actually really good, right?\n\n499\n00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.700\nBecause before the way we\nwould have had to do this,\n\n500\n00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.330\nif Daniel were to actually\nsend out on the road, right?\n\n501\n00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:14.370\nAnd he called back and goes, man,\n\n502\n00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:18.320\nI'm really missing this application\nthat I have back on my home computer.\n\n503\n00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.720\nHow do I get that installed?\n\n504\n00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.310\nAnd the only thing I could tell Daniel\nat that point is, well, Daniel,\n\n505\n00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.550\nnext time you come back in, okay?\n\n506\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.440\nBut I'm not coming in for four weeks.\n\n507\n00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.420\nWell, next time you come back in,\nwe can get your laptop, and\n\n508\n00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.080\nI can install it for you.\n\n509\n00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.030\nWell, no.\nAll I have to do now, right, is an Intune.\n\n510\n00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:39.800\nAnd Daniel says,\nI need this app like in an hour.\n\n511\n00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.090\nIf I can find it, and\nit's part of what I can actually manage,\n\n512\n00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:46.240\nI can put that inside of Windows Intune,\nand I can tell Daniel.\n\n513\n00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.960\nDaniel, go ahead and\nlog into the Intune portal.\n\n514\n00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.820\nAnd what should show up is right here.\n\n515\n00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.970\nSo, there's a couple of\nways that this can be done.\n\n516\n00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.190\nThe first way is this,\nwhere you upload those applications.\n\n517\n00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.080\nThe other way is also what's called\nsideloading or hard linking,\n\n518\n00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.985\ndeep linking, being as well.\n\n519\n00:25:02.985 --> 00:25:06.214\nNow, one of these right here is,\nactually if I go to Categories,\n\n520\n00:25:06.214 --> 00:25:08.584\nlet's see if this one\nactually shows up for us.\n\n521\n00:25:10.001 --> 00:25:13.851\nThere is a couple of apps that I have\navailable to us that aren't showing\n\n522\n00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:14.997\nup exactly.\n\n523\n00:25:14.997 --> 00:25:17.307\nIn the Windows 8.1, it shows up,\nbut right here it's not.\n\n524\n00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:19.827\nSo I'm thinking it's the Windows 10 thing,\nit's just not showing up.\n\n525\n00:25:19.827 --> 00:25:22.147\nSo there were two more\napps that I had available.\n\n526\n00:25:22.147 --> 00:25:24.627\nBut one is where it sends\nyou to the website, and\n\n527\n00:25:24.627 --> 00:25:26.407\nthen it says, yes,\nthis is the website you go to.\n\n528\n00:25:26.407 --> 00:25:28.340\nYou might be wondering why is that good.\n\n529\n00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.450\nBecause that's the website that I trust.\n\n530\n00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:33.400\nDaniel could go and find it in many\ndifferent locations and go, oh,\n\n531\n00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.830\nI'll just download any of them.\n\n532\n00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:35.930\nBut if I want Daniel to go and\n\n533\n00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.450\nget it from the website I trust, I can\nput that link right here and ready to go.\n\n534\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.230\nSo it's fairly simple.\n\n535\n00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:45.430\nThen Daniel just sits there and selects\nthat one, and then he clicks Install.\n\n536\n00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:49.415\nAnd from that point, it actually begins\nthe installation process, and there it is.\n\n537\n00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:52.800\nHe can now actually install it,\nonce it's done, he can now use it,\n\n538\n00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.370\nand he can go through and set it that way.\n\n539\n00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:59.360\nNow, we can also set it up differently\nin this way inside of Intune.\n\n540\n00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.250\nWe can say look,\nbecause this is a company owned computer,\n\n541\n00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:07.340\nwe can mark it to where\nit mandatorily installs.\n\n542\n00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.460\nIn other words, it's not optional anymore.\n\n543\n00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.020\nSo as soon as Daniel launches up Intune,\n\n544\n00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.250\nit can begin that process of saying,\nyou have to install this.\n\n545\n00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.255\nAnd it gives him a time limit\nto actually go ahead and\n\n546\n00:26:17.255 --> 00:26:19.080\ninstall that if we want it to.\n\n547\n00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:23.432\nSo there's a lot of benefit to being\nable to use Intune in this way,\n\n548\n00:26:23.432 --> 00:26:26.251\nbecause of that management side, right?\n\n549\n00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:29.004\nWe now have complete\ncontrol over that computer,\n\n550\n00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:33.524\nto the point where we can tell it, hey,\nif Daniels tells me, he calls in and goes,\n\n551\n00:26:33.524 --> 00:26:35.833\nman, that laptop's gone, it's lost.\n\n552\n00:26:35.833 --> 00:26:37.450\nWell, I can remote wipe it.\n\n553\n00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.630\nAnd now all those applications are gone.\n\n554\n00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.080\nBecause they were company information,\nwe can wipe it,\n\n555\n00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.680\nfreeing up company information, or on\na laptop, we can actually do a full wipe,\n\n556\n00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.060\nwhich actually wipes it completely clean,\nand that's pretty much it.\n\n557\n00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:53.710\nSo I mean, there's so\nmuch more control here.\n\n558\n00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:58.810\nAnd Windows 10 is designed to work with\nIntune very well and also Office 365.\n\n559\n00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.810\nIt's designed to integrate\nfairly well into it.\n\n560\n00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:01.480\n>> That's right.\nRonnie,\n\n561\n00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.220\nyou did a great job today showing us\nthe benefits of some of the cloud services\n\n562\n00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:09.110\nthat Windows or Microsoft should I say\n[LAUGH] has to offer for us, Office 365,\n\n563\n00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.290\ntheir productivity software.\n\n564\n00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:13.480\nObviously, it is the industry standard.\n\n565\n00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.680\nIt has been around for\na long time, it's tried-and-true.\n\n566\n00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.780\nAnd now we have a cloud-based version of\nit, so no matter what device we're on,\n\n567\n00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.960\nwe can use that.\n\n568\n00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.060\nOr the management software that we have,\nIntune, if you get that thing humming just\n\n569\n00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:29.580\nright, you're gonna have a lot more\ncontrol over devices when they're outside\n\n570\n00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.660\nof your control sphere and still be\nable push things like an update, right?\n\n571\n00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.090\nIt needs those updates, needs antivirus,\nmaybe I need to run a scan,\n\n572\n00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:42.260\nsomething to that effect, install some\nsoftware, and Intune is a great way to go.\n\n573\n00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.750\nRonnie, have we skipped anything, or\ndo we need to go over any other thing?\n\n574\n00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.467\n>> Well, we don't need to go over any\nother thing right now, but there is more\n\n575\n00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:52.948\nto go over, there are a little bit\nmore in cloud apps that we have to do,\n\n576\n00:27:52.948 --> 00:27:56.334\nbut looking at the time,\nit looks like there's gonna be a part two.\n\n577\n00:27:56.334 --> 00:27:59.284\n>> Yeah, large topics, small time,\nit is our lot in life, so\n\n578\n00:27:59.284 --> 00:28:01.700\nwe're gonna go ahead and call this a show.\n\n579\n00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.580\nThanks for watching.\n\n580\n00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.610\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n581\n00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:06.293\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n582\n00:28:06.293 --> 00:28:10.167\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n583\n00:28:10.167

ITproTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.940\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.190\nHere with me today yet\nagain, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.340\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.410\n>> It is going well today.\n\n7\n00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.170\nIt's another great day to be right here in\nthe studio as we continue on taking look\n\n8\n00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.010\nat configuring Windows 10 devices.\n\n9\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.540\nAnd we are talking about, well,\nreally app location management as well,\n\n10\n00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.620\nwe're talking about.\n\n11\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.040\nIn a previous episode, we went ahead and\n\n12\n00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.230\ntook a look at two cloud services which\ncan help us to manage our apps a little\n\n13\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.250\nbit better, where we talked about\nOffice 365 as well as Windows Intune.\n\n14\n00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.160\nMake sure you check those episodes out,\nand we even have more on Intune And so\n\n15\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.370\nmake sure you also check that one out too.\n\n16\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.270\nAnd today we are now actually taking\na look at more of what we call LOBs,\n\n17\n00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.240\nLine Of Business apps is\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n18\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.840\nNow if that's a new term to\nyou that's perfectly fine.\n\n19\n00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.055\nLine Of Business apps are normally\napplications that we tend to use\n\n20\n00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:06.055\nspecifically for our business and\nit may be due to your industry.\n\n21\n00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:08.295\nThat's the business app that you have.\n\n22\n00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:13.110\nIt may be that your company actually has a\nvery proprietary application that it uses\n\n23\n00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.140\nthat nobody else uses.\n\n24\n00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.210\nWell, those would also be considered\nline of business applications too.\n\n25\n00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.300\nNow, in that particular situation we\ndo you have to still manage those\n\n26\n00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.110\ntypes of applications for us.\n\n27\n00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.145\nAnd Windows 10 does have some\nfeatures that it is designed.\n\n28\n00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:29.310\nOr I shouldn't say features,\n\n29\n00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.090\nsome supporting tools that are out there\nthat are designed to help us to ensure\n\n30\n00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.500\nthat line of business apps will\nalso work inside of Windows 10.\n\n31\n00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.010\nSo, what we're talking about\nnow is actually an unusual term\n\n32\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.890\nthat you will hear.\n\n33\n00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.850\nIt's called side loading an app\nis what we're talking about here.\n\n34\n00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.630\nSo, a lot of times when we directly load\nan app, what we're saying is we normally\n\n35\n00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.700\nfollow the standard procedures\nthat we'd normally see.\n\n36\n00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.386\nBut when we talk about side\nloading an app, we're saying,\n\n37\n00:01:53.386 --> 00:01:55.277\nhey don't do it from that point instead.\n\n38\n00:01:55.277 --> 00:01:58.099\nSo, for example,\nif you go to the Windows Store, right?\n\n39\n00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:59.910\nAnd you select go ahead and install that.\n\n40\n00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.000\nPerfectly fine.\n\n41\n00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.120\nBut if you're actually installing\nan app from outside the Windows store\n\n42\n00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.500\nthat would be considered\nsideloading as well.\n\n43\n00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.470\nWell we can sideload apps into, well not\nonly our Windows 10 install that's going\n\n44\n00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.600\non right now but we can also sideload\napps into images that we have too.\n\n45\n00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.160\nWhen we start taking a look at sideloading\napps, what we're talking about of\n\n46\n00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.330\ncourse is then loading that app not in the\ndirect way that you normally would find.\n\n47\n00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.140\nFor example,\nif you go to the Win Store, and\n\n48\n00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.830\nyou click Install, well that's directly\ninstalling and that's perfectly fine.\n\n49\n00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.680\nSideloading is when we choose not\nto follow those same procedures.\n\n50\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.920\nInstead, that we actually put\nthem into our Windows 10 install\n\n51\n00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.130\nthe way that we want to.\n\n52\n00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.719\nWell business apps don't normally\nget to the Windows 10 store.\n\n53\n00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.802\nNot saying you can't put them there,\nyou more than likely can.\n\n54\n00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:49.915\nBut what if we really just wanted it not\nactually to be out there in the Windows\n\n55\n00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:54.750\nstore, and we still needed it actually on\nour installs of our operating systems?\n\n56\n00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.890\nWell, that's where we get into\nthe realm of Sideloading.\n\n57\n00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.040\nNow when we start talking about that,\n\n58\n00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.210\nthat's more in the realm of deployment,\nis what we're talking about.\n\n59\n00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.950\nThere are probably gonna be future shows\non the Windows 10 deployment where we also\n\n60\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.150\nside load apps in there.\n\n61\n00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.380\nBut we do wanna discuss\nit at least briefly.\n\n62\n00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.390\nThat the way that you'll generally\nhave to do something like that.\n\n63\n00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.630\nAnd there is a piece of software\nthat is proprietary to you.\n\n64\n00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.522\nThat's what you want to\nactually be able to do.\n\n65\n00:03:18.522 --> 00:03:20.172\nNow when we start doing that,\n\n66\n00:03:20.172 --> 00:03:24.924\nthat's when we actually start heading into\nthe realm of things like the Windows ADK,\n\n67\n00:03:24.924 --> 00:03:29.365\nthe Application Development Kits that\nyou would need to download and install.\n\n68\n00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:34.262\nBecause on that particular kit,\nthat's where you get access to things like\n\n69\n00:03:34.262 --> 00:03:39.926\nthe DISM, the Deployment Installation and\nSoftware Management something like that,\n\n70\n00:03:39.926 --> 00:03:45.710\nthat you actually have to be able to use,\nto get all those apps running in there.\n\n71\n00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.110\nYou can also, of course,\nuse PowerShell and those,\n\n72\n00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.110\nof course PowerShell commands to\nalso get an application ready.\n\n73\n00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.950\nNow, so when you actually wanna put\nthe image in there, that's perfectly fine.\n\n74\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.110\nThat's exactly what you have to do,\nis you need to use those utilities,\n\n75\n00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.410\nyou need to make sure that you have\na graph of how that's gonna be done.\n\n76\n00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.440\nBut that again is gonna be more in\nthat deployment side of things.\n\n77\n00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.857\nBut, what does it mean for you and\nme then as a Windows 10 technician?\n\n78\n00:04:10.857 --> 00:04:14.650\nWhat that means is that we have\nto get the computers ready for\n\n79\n00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.760\nsomething like sideloading to happen.\n\n80\n00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.010\nAnd that's something that we can do, and\n\n81\n00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.540\nit actually does require\na little bit of typing.\n\n82\n00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.360\nBut it is something that you wanna\nmake sure that you understand\n\n83\n00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.420\nwhat's going to happen.\n\n84\n00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.957\nSo let me go to bring up my computer and\nlet's see where I am.\n\n85\n00:04:28.957 --> 00:04:29.720\nThere we go.\n\n86\n00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.913\nOkay, so what I've done is I've brought\nup just the Windows 10 computer.\n\n87\n00:04:34.913 --> 00:04:38.461\nAnd if I were to prepare this computer for\nside loading is to configure it,\n\n88\n00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:42.395\nyou've gotta actually do a couple of\ndifferent commands here to make this work.\n\n89\n00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:46.720\nAnd one of them has to do with\nthe idea of activation of\n\n90\n00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.260\nwhatever software you're putting in there.\n\n91\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.930\nRight?\n\n92\n00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.850\nSo normally you also end up,\nlike if you were to install Office 2012 or\n\n93\n00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.590\nwhatever it is, 2013,\n\n94\n00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.430\ninto your computers you normally also\nhave to provide a product key to do that.\n\n95\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.100\nWell, what we wanna do is we wanna\nactually know that if we're sideloading\n\n96\n00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.460\nthe app to prepare the computer, we need\nto go ahead and run a couple of different\n\n97\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.930\nones that will actually not only\nput the key into the image itself.\n\n98\n00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.462\nBut also then tell it to activate,\nand so what we're going to use is,\n\n99\n00:05:18.462 --> 00:05:21.366\nis a special command that's called SLMGR.\n\n100\n00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:24.966\nOkay, so, if you wanna, what the heck\ndoes that stand for, stands for\n\n101\n00:05:24.966 --> 00:05:28.420\nSite License Manager is what\nit actually stands for here.\n\n102\n00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.070\nAnd so when you actually do something\nlike that, you then would actually\n\n103\n00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.660\ntype in ipk for the independent\nproduct key or whatever it might be.\n\n104\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.980\nNow this is actually gonna be something\nspecific to what you would normally need\n\n105\n00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.390\nto have on hand.\n\n106\n00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.310\nAnd you would type that key in afterwards,\nand then of course you would press Enter.\n\n107\n00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.660\nSo you would need to have that and\nready to go.\n\n108\n00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.490\nNow I'm not actually\ninstalling anything and\n\n109\n00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.710\nI'm not preparing mine for\nanything like that.\n\n110\n00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.770\nBut that's kind of the first\nline that you need.\n\n111\n00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.540\nYou need to make sure that you\nunderstand that's what's gonna happen.\n\n112\n00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.198\nThe second one is always gonna be the same\nwhich is the one that we really do need,\n\n113\n00:06:01.198 --> 00:06:06.181\nSLMGR and this time it's going to be\nthe activation token something or\n\n114\n00:06:06.181 --> 00:06:10.770\nwhatever it might be,\nATO is what we want so slngr/ato.\n\n115\n00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.450\nAnd this one we'll also have in our notes,\nso you don't have to actually type it or\n\n116\n00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.960\ntry and scramble for a pen right\nnow unless you really just want to.\n\n117\n00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.630\nAnd I'll probably type\nit in wrong anyways.\n\n118\n00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.775\nBut I'm simply just copying it\ndown from my notes right here.\n\n119\n00:06:24.775 --> 00:06:29.025\nAnd you can even find this\none online if you need to.\n\n120\n00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:31.985\nBut it's a long key here\nthat we have to have.\n\n121\n00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:35.875\nAnd remember that regardless of whatever\napplication that we are running\n\n122\n00:06:35.875 --> 00:06:38.865\nthis is the one that you\nwill have to have here.\n\n123\n00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:42.055\nAnd this last one is actually\na little bit longer.\n\n124\n00:06:42.055 --> 00:06:47.140\nThe af7229 and\n\n125\n00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.003\nthen dle.\n\n126\n00:06:50.003 --> 00:06:50.860\nOkay?\n\n127\n00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.910\nSo remember we'll have these in the notes,\nso don't worry about scrambling for them.\n\n128\n00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.540\nThey'll actually be along\nwith the episode as well.\n\n129\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.950\nAnd this is the one that says,\nhey activate this key.\n\n130\n00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.010\nSo when you have\neverything ready to go and\n\n131\n00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.120\nyou’re side loading it to your image,\noffline image when you're doing this.\n\n132\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.400\nThe first one is saying,\n\n133\n00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.940\ninsert the product key when\neverything is ready to go.\n\n134\n00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.140\nAnd then the second one is\ntelling it to activate.\n\n135\n00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.580\nSo that second number will actually be\nthe same regardless of what you have.\n\n136\n00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.869\nSo remember, it's a two step process\nwhen you talk about sideloading.\n\n137\n00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:22.610\nIt's not enough just to say,\noh I've got the application ready to run.\n\n138\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.248\nRight?\nFor it to be deployed properly,\n\n139\n00:07:24.248 --> 00:07:27.900\nit needs to have the product key,\nit needs to be activated as well.\n\n140\n00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.505\nAnd you have to make sure that happens.\n\n141\n00:07:29.505 --> 00:07:30.480\nRight?\n\n142\n00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.240\nSo once that's done, you might go\nall right, now I know it, I'm done.\n\n143\n00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.765\nYou're not done.\n\n144\n00:07:35.765 --> 00:07:38.870\n[LAUGH] Like anything\nelse inside of Windows,\n\n145\n00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.610\nthere's always more than just that.\n\n146\n00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.690\nSo it seems easy enough,\nif I were just to type in two lines.\n\n147\n00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.180\nEven though fairly complicated lines here,\nyou might go, I'm done, well you're not.\n\n148\n00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.390\nThe other part of it, of course,\n\n149\n00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.580\nis what you would have to do\ninside of your group policy.\n\n150\n00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.810\nNow remember in an organization.\n\n151\n00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.572\nRight?\nYou're\n\n152\n00:07:56.572 --> 00:08:00.204\nnot gonna be doing this on\nthe individual Windows 10 machine, but\n\n153\n00:08:00.204 --> 00:08:04.409\nyou're probably gonna be doing it through\nactive directory group policy, or\n\n154\n00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:08.251\nwe do it as far as the other configuration\npart that we do, All the time.\n\n155\n00:08:08.251 --> 00:08:12.494\nIt gives us that ability to ensure that\nwe can make the changes that we need\n\n156\n00:08:12.494 --> 00:08:15.760\nto across more than one\nindividual computer.\n\n157\n00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.970\nNow, if you want to do it one at a time,\nyou can.\n\n158\n00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:18.580\nOkay?\n\n159\n00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.951\nBut Daniel actually knows since he's\nactually been a system admin for a company\n\n160\n00:08:22.951 --> 00:08:27.840\nthat actually had thousands of users where\ndoing it one at a time is not ever good.\n\n161\n00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.400\nAnd it's not only because you might have\na thousand users in the building, but\n\n162\n00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.630\nDaniel, what are the chances,\nsince you actually know,\n\n163\n00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.790\nthat you have users all over the state and\nyou had to worry about it?\n\n164\n00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.490\n>> Yeah.\nThat would be a little difficult for\n\n165\n00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.920\nme to do if I had to do this one at\na time go to each one of my computers,\n\n166\n00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.530\nbecause a lot of organizations, especially\nin today's day and age, have remote users.\n\n167\n00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:50.710\nThey have remote sites, they have got\na WAN, and they've got client offices.\n\n168\n00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.480\nThey don't just have one building\nwith all the users inside of it.\n\n169\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.630\nMany, many times you've got\nusers in other offices,\n\n170\n00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.650\nsatellite branches,\nthat are out there in the wild.\n\n171\n00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.570\nHow am I supposed to get to them?\n\n172\n00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.840\nAm I supposed to send a technician,\nget in a car and drive out?\n\n173\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.410\nWell yeah, we can do that and\nactually have done that kind of thing.\n\n174\n00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.630\nBut if I can do it from\nthe comfort of my office\n\n175\n00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.810\nusing something like Active Directory,\nGroup Policy, hey,\n\n176\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.530\nthat sounds like a little\neasier way to go, Ronnie.\n\n177\n00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.200\n>> That's exactly the way\nthat we wanna show you.\n\n178\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.130\nSo, that's what we're\ngonna show you instead.\n\n179\n00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.050\nNow, we're using the local group policy,\ndon't get me wrong,\n\n180\n00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.610\nyou can do it individually like that.\n\n181\n00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.100\nBut don't forget,\neven if you see the commands here,\n\n182\n00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.980\nyou'll probably see the same thing inside,\ninteractive directory group policy.\n\n183\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.940\nSo let me show you how to do that.\n\n184\n00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.625\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and pop it up\nhere in the search web and Widows.\n\n185\n00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:38.855\n>> I'm going to type in gpedit.msc\n\n186\n00:09:38.855 --> 00:09:40.865\nto bring up our local\ngroup policy management.\n\n187\n00:09:40.865 --> 00:09:45.075\nOh, I don't have permissions\nbecause I'm logged in as Daniel.\n\n188\n00:09:45.075 --> 00:09:46.345\nDaniel, you don't have permissions yet.\n\n189\n00:09:46.345 --> 00:09:46.845\n>> That'll teach you.\n>> I know.\n\n190\n00:09:46.845 --> 00:09:48.665\n>> Steal my password, will you?\n\n191\n00:09:48.665 --> 00:09:49.600\n>> Tell me about it.\n\n192\n00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.110\nLet me see if I can actually\nget some permissions.\n\n193\n00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:59.510\nI'm gonna run it as the administrator\ninstead and do my best practices here,\n\n194\n00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.960\nwhere I'm not actually logging\non as anybody, but using this.\n\n195\n00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.000\nAnd there we go, I was able to do so.\n\n196\n00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.971\nSo remember a right click, if you actually\ndo see a command line like that that tells\n\n197\n00:10:07.971 --> 00:10:09.760\nyou you need to run as administrator.\n\n198\n00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.165\nAnd it's here that we need to also\nset up a couple of things, okay?\n\n199\n00:10:13.165 --> 00:10:16.637\nSo what we're doing is we're going\nto go under computer configuration,\n\n200\n00:10:16.637 --> 00:10:21.440\nand then administrative templates, we're\nexpanding out administrative templates.\n\n201\n00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.670\nAnd then we're gonna look for\nWindows components right here as well.\n\n202\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:30.250\nNow, under Windows component, what we're\nlooking for is App package deployment.\n\n203\n00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.690\nAnd we go into App package deployment,\n\n204\n00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.380\nnow that I've gotten the SLM\nthose two commands running,\n\n205\n00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.830\nwhen we actually say what, here's the\nright product key, here's the activation.\n\n206\n00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.950\nThat now turns it into what we call\na trusted application as well, and\n\n207\n00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.220\nso what I would also need to do is\nallow all trusted Apps to install.\n\n208\n00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.650\nNow, by default, right?\n\n209\n00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.930\nReally, the trusted apps are places like\nthe Windows Store is what they're really\n\n210\n00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.100\ntalking about.\n\n211\n00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:54.910\nBut for us,\n\n212\n00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.240\nif we actually are gonna do that, that's\nwhat we're taking a look at right here.\n\n213\n00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.980\nAnd we would just need to enable that\none to ensure that we are ready to go.\n\n214\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.970\nSo once we actually have it enabled,\nit is there that we'd click okay,\n\n215\n00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.550\nor click apply and okay, and\nthen that would be set up and ready to go.\n\n216\n00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.760\nSo, remember those two steps.\n\n217\n00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.830\nYou not only need that activation and that\nproduct key, but also to come in here and\n\n218\n00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.490\nmake sure that you actually do allow for\nthe trusted apps to install\n\n219\n00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:27.438\nregardless of what location they came\nfrom is a big one that you also need.\n\n220\n00:11:27.438 --> 00:11:32.330\nNow, when you're doing this you also want\nto make sure that you understand that you\n\n221\n00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:37.070\ncan do this without joining\nthe computer to the domain.\n\n222\n00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.510\nAnd when you do that, right, so if this is\na stand alone computer in a work group,\n\n223\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:45.800\nboth of those commands on the SLMGR\n\n224\n00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.840\nneed to be installed there, or\ntyped in, and that's the key.\n\n225\n00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:57.500\nBut if your computer is domain joined, so\nyour computers already part of a domain.\n\n226\n00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.890\nYou really only need to insert in,\nwell, the product key itself.\n\n227\n00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:06.050\nInside of your domain, because you tend\nto actually manage the activation itself,\n\n228\n00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:10.590\nyou don't actually need to send that\nactivation command automatically as well.\n\n229\n00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.820\nSo, if you're in the domain,\nyou only need that one line.\n\n230\n00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.240\nIf you're outside of a domain,\nyou'll need both of them to do that, too.\n\n231\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.450\nTrying to make sure I hit\nthe ones that we need to, right?\n\n232\n00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.840\nNow, there's unusual terminology\nthat you'll find, not only when\n\n233\n00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.780\ntalking to other technicians about this,\nand trying to get support on this, but\n\n234\n00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:32.950\nyou'll also find just kind of unusual for\nthe exam more than anything.\n\n235\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:38.340\nWhen you actually have your application\nnow installed onto an image and\n\n236\n00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.290\nit's ready to be deployed\nout to your computers,\n\n237\n00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.780\nthat image is no longer\ncalled a side-loaded image.\n\n238\n00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.820\nDon't know why.\n\n239\n00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.430\nThey've changed the terminology for\nsome reason.\n\n240\n00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.880\nBut when you hear about\nthe idea of now applications\n\n241\n00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.970\ngoing out with the image it's\nwhat we call a provisioned app.\n\n242\n00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.560\nI would hate for you to just miss\nsome easy exam points by thinking,\n\n243\n00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.670\nRonnie said side loaded apps but\nI've never heard of provision apps,\n\n244\n00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.930\nhe never even mentioned it.\n\n245\n00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.810\nWell provisioned apps are the same thing.\n\n246\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:06.600\nThey just change it.\n\n247\n00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.200\nOnce it's side loaded into an image,\nit's now considered a provisioned app.\n\n248\n00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.320\nYou also need to know that\nthe maximum number of provisioned\n\n249\n00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.060\napps that can be on a single\nimage is gonna be twenty-four.\n\n250\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.160\nSo you don't actually have\nto know exactly how many.\n\n251\n00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.510\nBut that's the maximum number, right, that\nyou can have on a single image if you're\n\n252\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:30.480\ngoing to be deploying that\nto a Windows 10 computer.\n\n253\n00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.220\nSo it's very important that we\nunderstand some of those limitations and\n\n254\n00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.540\ndetails when we talk about\nthe issue of side loading here and\n\n255\n00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.470\ngetting everything actually\ninstalled the way that we want to.\n\n256\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:44.870\nMost of us, and we've been inside of\nan enterprise, side loading the app has\n\n257\n00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.670\nactually been part of what\nwe've been doing all the time.\n\n258\n00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:48.990\nWe just didn't call it side loading.\n\n259\n00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.020\nWe just called it installing\napplications onto a reference image, and\n\n260\n00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.590\nthen capturing that reference image and\ndeploying it out.\n\n261\n00:13:55.590 --> 00:14:00.670\nBut Windows 10 is different in the very\nfact that they really don't like the idea\n\n262\n00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:05.240\nof having to actually capture a reference\nimage and then deploying apps to it.\n\n263\n00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.550\nThey would rather you actually say, look,\nwe're gonna actually just provision or\n\n264\n00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.530\nside load apps into the image that's on\nthe computer that you bought anyways, and\n\n265\n00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.800\nthat way you don't have to worry about\nkeeping track of all of these different\n\n266\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.660\nimages that you have to have on hand.\n\n267\n00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.480\nBut can it be done?\n\n268\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.130\nYes.\nOkay?\n\n269\n00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.270\nAnd once you actually do that,\n\n270\n00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:25.250\nremember it's the term provisioned\napp is what we're talking about.\n\n271\n00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.440\nNow, the other way, of course, side load,\nand I've mentioned it before in a previous\n\n272\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.330\nepisode is, if you don't have that line of\nbusiness app, let's say right there, but\n\n273\n00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.130\nyou know if it needs to be deployed\nacross your entire organization.\n\n274\n00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.930\nWhether it's actually right\nthere in the building, or\n\n275\n00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.620\nwhether they are remote users,\nyou can use our best friend,\n\n276\n00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:46.480\nwhich is Windows In Tune,\nto also side load apps as well.\n\n277\n00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.400\nSo, when you do something like this,\nyou might hear the term deep linking?\n\n278\n00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.340\nIs that what I call it here?\n\n279\n00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.420\n>> Deep linking?\n>> Deep linking.\n\n280\n00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.860\nSee, I couldn't remember\nexactly what I called it.\n\n281\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.960\nI was gonna call it something else.\n\n282\n00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.350\nI don't know what I was gonna call it.\n\n283\n00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.220\nBut it's called deep linking\nan app is what it's called.\n\n284\n00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.720\nAnd you can do this as well.\n\n285\n00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.750\nNow, when you start to do\nsomething like this, right,\n\n286\n00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.090\nyou have your own app that\nyou can put right up there.\n\n287\n00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:09.778\nYou can load it right into Windows In Tune\nand then have it appear on the company\n\n288\n00:15:09.778 --> 00:15:13.340\nportal for all of your users to\ngo ahead and find and do that.\n\n289\n00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.460\nAnd when you do something like that,\nthat means you're uploading it and\n\n290\n00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.620\nyou're actually having\nto store it someplace.\n\n291\n00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.820\n>> And that's fine.\n\n292\n00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.880\nBut there are times, though, what you\ncan do instead is, if you choose to, or\n\n293\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.440\nyour company chooses to,\nto take your application and\n\n294\n00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.120\nthen submit it to the Windows store so\nthat it can be published out there.\n\n295\n00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.620\nSo regardless of where they go,\nyou don't have to worry about whether or\n\n296\n00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.210\nnot you can get access to it or not.\n\n297\n00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:38.080\nIt could be in the Windows store and\nyou can download it and\n\n298\n00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.530\nyou're perfectly fine and ready to go.\n\n299\n00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.520\nBut how do you do that if you\nare actually using Windows In Tune?\n\n300\n00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.270\nWell, the way that you do that is\nsomething that is called deep linking, and\n\n301\n00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.085\nlet me show you the result of\nwhat deep linking does and\n\n302\n00:15:49.085 --> 00:15:51.750\nwe'll show you a little bit of\nhow this begins to happen here.\n\n303\n00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.430\nLet's see if I can get\nto the right machine.\n\n304\n00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.480\nMaybe.\n\n305\n00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.220\nThere we go.\n\n306\n00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.850\nOkay.\nSo it hadn't actually logged me out yet.\n\n307\n00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.877\nSo here I've got a couple of different\napps stored in different ways.\n\n308\n00:16:02.877 --> 00:16:07.196\nThe first two that you see right here,\nthe Adobe Reader and Silverlight,\n\n309\n00:16:07.196 --> 00:16:12.085\nthese are applications that I downloaded\nAnd then I upload it into Intune, right?\n\n310\n00:16:12.085 --> 00:16:14.453\nAnd so that means I have\na stored copy of that app.\n\n311\n00:16:14.453 --> 00:16:18.588\nAnd you can actually see where it's at\na Windows installer that's available right\n\n312\n00:16:18.588 --> 00:16:19.790\nthere and ready to go.\n\n313\n00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.820\nPerfectly fine, we download it and you can\nsee where it actually lists the size here.\n\n314\n00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:28.820\nAlso, this word viewer is\nanother 24 MB that you can see.\n\n315\n00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.457\nThere it is, so\n\n316\n00:16:29.457 --> 00:16:32.850\nI 'm taking up that much space on whatever\nstorage drive that I have inside of M2.\n\n317\n00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.865\nPerfectly fine, we can deal with that.\n\n318\n00:16:35.865 --> 00:16:41.368\nBut notice these other two, the Skype for\nWIFI and also this SyncToy 2.1.\n\n319\n00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:43.770\nYou can see where it is actually\na Microsoft published app.\n\n320\n00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:48.450\nYou can see where it says Web app, but\nnotice that the size doesn't appear.\n\n321\n00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:52.580\nThe reason why it doesn't appear is\nbecause I am not storing files for that.\n\n322\n00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:57.060\nThe only thing I've done is I've listed\nthe link here, where it's going to go and\n\n323\n00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.830\npick up that app instead.\n\n324\n00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.830\nSo for example,\nif I take a look at Skype for WIFI,\n\n325\n00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.410\nlet me see if I can View the Properties\nhere so we can it a little bit better.\n\n326\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.330\nNotice this link down here where\nit says the application URL.\n\n327\n00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:16.080\nBut now it's tiny, but you can see where\nit actually says microsoft.com and\n\n328\n00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.640\nthen /store.\n\n329\n00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.663\nSo this is coming directly\nfrom the Window Store.\n\n330\n00:17:19.663 --> 00:17:21.598\nLet me see if I can zoom\nthat in a little bit maybe.\n\n331\n00:17:21.598 --> 00:17:24.962\nWe can make it look a little bit bigger,\nwhoa!\n\n332\n00:17:24.962 --> 00:17:25.983\n>> That seemed big, Ronnie.\n\n333\n00:17:25.983 --> 00:17:27.400\n>> Now, that's pretty big.\n\n334\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.850\nLet me at least.\n\n335\n00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:30.697\nMaybe I was.\n\n336\n00:17:30.697 --> 00:17:31.419\nThere we go.\n\n337\n00:17:31.419 --> 00:17:33.680\nYou can actually see where\nit actually says store.\n\n338\n00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.970\nSo it is actually saying, hey,\n\n339\n00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.760\ngo to the Windows Store and\nfind this link in the app.\n\n340\n00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.870\nWell, if I were to go to the Windows Store\nand I were to take a look at this thing,\n\n341\n00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:47.320\nDaniel, I don't see anything\nURL links anywhere, I don't.\n\n342\n00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.900\nThere's the app that I just kinda\nchose just as an example when I was\n\n343\n00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.040\nlooking around here.\n\n344\n00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.590\nSo let's say I select Facebook right here.\n\n345\n00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.420\nDaniel, I don't see any links here.\n\n346\n00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.850\nIt doesn't look like it\nactually posts any links for\n\n347\n00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.160\nme to be able to do anything like that.\n\n348\n00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:06.260\nSo, what I need to do, though, is I need\nto find that link is what I need to do.\n\n349\n00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.120\nAnd there's a couple of ways to do it,\nbut the easiest way, and\n\n350\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.720\nthis is the cheating way, but\nit's the easiest way to find this if\n\n351\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.310\nyou're gonna do the deep link,\nis to click on Share.\n\n352\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:19.070\nAnd once you click on Share,\nthen you can actually open it up.\n\n353\n00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.760\nLet's see if it lets me do it\nin OneNote here for a moment.\n\n354\n00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.520\nAnd there it is.\n\n355\n00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.600\nNotice that I now have the link for\nit right here.\n\n356\n00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:32.010\nSo now I can copy and copy that link\ndirectly from that, that one I can't.\n\n357\n00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.363\nBut I open it up in an email I can or\nat least I can type it in.\n\n358\n00:18:35.363 --> 00:18:37.232\nI can actually go ahead and copy that.\n\n359\n00:18:37.232 --> 00:18:43.232\nAnd then when I copy that, oops,\nlet me change that up here.\n\n360\n00:18:43.232 --> 00:18:45.230\nSee I keep going to the wrong thing there.\n\n361\n00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:49.770\nOkay, then I can come here to Apps,\nand I can paste it in\n\n362\n00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:54.810\nthe little wizard that they have and\npaste that directly in there.\n\n363\n00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.960\nAnd that means anytime somebody\ncomes back to the portal,\n\n364\n00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:02.820\nwhat they'll actually get is redirected\nto go directly to that location instead.\n\n365\n00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.850\nSo I don't have to worry about managing\nand storing and worrying about updates.\n\n366\n00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.600\nAnd that's kind of the key\nreason behind this, right?\n\n367\n00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.710\nIf whatever company it is,\n\n368\n00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.820\nin that app that I that I want,\nthey update it and stuff.\n\n369\n00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:18.231\nWell, I could have an old,\nold app here like the Adobe Reader, right?\n\n370\n00:19:18.231 --> 00:19:21.134\nThat thing gets updated every six hours or\nsomething, I don't know.\n\n371\n00:19:21.134 --> 00:19:23.290\n[LAUGH] Whatever it might be.\n\n372\n00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:24.814\nWell, if I actually say,\nlook, I don't wanna do that.\n\n373\n00:19:24.814 --> 00:19:29.200\nI just wanna go ahead and link it directly\nto their site, so they get the latest\n\n374\n00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.650\napp there, that might be the reason\nwhy we do something like that.\n\n375\n00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:36.420\nNow if it's a line of business app,\nprobably not so much so.\n\n376\n00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.810\nBut the very fact is you do have\nthose options available to you\n\n377\n00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.200\nif you wanted to sideload an app\ndirectly even from Windows Intune.\n\n378\n00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.080\nSo there's a lot of stuff here.\n\n379\n00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.750\nAnd sideloading is gonna be a big part\nas you go deeper into the enterprise.\n\n380\n00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:49.980\nYou're not gonna get away from it.\n\n381\n00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.060\nI don't care, you're not going to.\n\n382\n00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.480\nCuz nobody's gonna use every single\nmain line business app that's out there.\n\n383\n00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.178\nCompanies are gonna say,\nno, here's the app.\n\n384\n00:19:57.178 --> 00:19:58.022\nAnd you're gonna say, never heard of it.\n\n385\n00:19:58.022 --> 00:19:59.773\nAnd say, well,\nthat's because it was designed for us,\n\n386\n00:19:59.773 --> 00:20:01.330\nthat's why you never heard of it.\n\n387\n00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.690\nAnd you're still gonna have to deploy it.\n\n388\n00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.540\nAnd they show you a couple ways to do it.\n\n389\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.060\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n390\n00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.513\nAnd that deep linking business,\nit seems very, well,\n\n391\n00:20:08.513 --> 00:20:11.090\nthat's kinda cool I guess, kinda that.\n\n392\n00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.100\nBut it actually is a very helpful\nthing for us as administrators,\n\n393\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.105\npeople that are trying to support\nusers that don't know about computers.\n\n394\n00:20:18.105 --> 00:20:19.730\nAnd how is that you might ask?\n\n395\n00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:20.840\nWell, it's really simple.\n\n396\n00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.586\nIf Ronnie is just average Joe user,\nhe just comes to work, he does his job,\n\n397\n00:20:24.586 --> 00:20:26.021\nhas to deal with a computer.\n\n398\n00:20:26.021 --> 00:20:29.345\nAnd I'm telling him hey, Ronnie, you have\nto get this app installed if you want\n\n399\n00:20:29.345 --> 00:20:31.940\nit on your tablet, then you gotta go here,\nyou gotta go here.\n\n400\n00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.169\nAnd he's, I'm looking for\nthe app in the store.\n\n401\n00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:38.500\nI see some that looks similar,\nyou're trying to describe it.\n\n402\n00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.260\nWith deep linking, all that gets cut out.\n\n403\n00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.180\nI don't have to worry about Ronnie\nnot getting the right app installed.\n\n404\n00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.440\nI say it's not a problem.\n\n405\n00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.180\nWe deep link that out.\n\n406\n00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.630\nJust follow the link.\n\n407\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.960\nIt takes you directly to the app\nthat we want them to install.\n\n408\n00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.810\nThere is no more guessing game to it.\n\n409\n00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.100\nSo that helps us out.\n\n410\n00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.280\nWe're not on the phone supporting someone,\n\n411\n00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.340\ntrying to guide them through\nthe woods into the correct app.\n\n412\n00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.330\nWe go right straight to the heart of\nthe thing and get things working.\n\n413\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.560\nAnd that's the way we like it,\nright Ronnie?\n\n414\n00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.250\n>> That is.\nThat's a great point to actually make,\n\n415\n00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.800\nbecause that is usually the key, right?\n\n416\n00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.600\nIs that even though you are preparing for\nWindows 10 and learning about it daily cuz\n\n417\n00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.570\nyou're in it, hopefully,\nthat you're actually learning about it.\n\n418\n00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.330\nIt doesn't mean that every user that you\nsupport is gonna know more than just\n\n419\n00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:24.170\nclicking on the Windows button and\nthen wondering what they do next.\n\n420\n00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:28.950\nSo having everything kind of lined up for\nthem where all they're doing is clicking.\n\n421\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.860\nIn other words,\nthey know how to actually use the mouse.\n\n422\n00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.000\nThat's the way to go.\n\n423\n00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.340\nI truly believe it's\nkind of neat technology.\n\n424\n00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.970\nIt is stuff that you're gonna have to\nlearn as a Windows 10 support technician.\n\n425\n00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:38.975\nSo get used to it.\n\n426\n00:21:38.975 --> 00:21:39.675\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n427\n00:21:39.675 --> 00:21:41.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so, wise words, right?\n\n428\n00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.040\nGet used to it.\n\n429\n00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.810\nIt is part of our jobs.\n\n430\n00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.470\nIt is a very cool part of our jobs,\nthough.\n\n431\n00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.200\n>> Yeah.\n>> You gotta admit being able to say,\n\n432\n00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.370\nhey we're developing\nour own in-house apps.\n\n433\n00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.220\nAnd we're installing those\nonto our user's machines,\n\n434\n00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.580\nusing the Intune software,\nthat's pretty sweet business right there.\n\n435\n00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.638\nRonnie, great demonstrations.\n\n436\n00:21:56.638 --> 00:21:59.810\nIs there anything else you'd like\nto add to this lovely show of ours?\n\n437\n00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:04.522\n>> I would, but we're actually out of time\nand we still have a little bit more to go.\n\n438\n00:22:04.522 --> 00:22:05.346\n>> It happened again, didn't it?\n\n439\n00:22:05.346 --> 00:22:05.846\n>> It did.\n\n440\n00:22:05.846 --> 00:22:08.430\n>> We always come to the end\nof these shows so quickly.\n\n441\n00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.722\nWell hopefully,\nyou guys have enjoyed the content so far.\n\n442\n00:22:10.722 --> 00:22:12.859\nWe’re having a great time\nmaking these shows for you.\n\n443\n00:22:12.859 --> 00:22:14.580\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this one.\n\n444\n00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.050\nBut hopefully,\nwe'll see you in part three.\n\n445\n00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:19.006\nWell, hopefully, we'll see you.\n>> The revenge.\n\n446\n00:22:19.006 --> 00:22:21.135\n>> That's right,\nthe revenge of Intune, maybe.\n\n447\n00:22:21.135 --> 00:22:22.830\n>> [LAUGH] All right, guys.\n\n448\n00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:23.560\nHopefully, we'll see you there.\n\n449\n00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.610\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n450\n00:22:26.610

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:17.910\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.690\nHere with me, yet\none more time, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.480\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.380\n>> It's going well.\n\n7\n00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.400\nIt's another great day to be right\nhere as we continue on taking look at\n\n8\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.555\nWindows 10 and\nconfiguring Windows devices.\n\n9\n00:00:29.555 --> 00:00:34.305\nIn this particular segment, we are talking\nnow about managing the actual identity.\n\n10\n00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:38.175\nIn previous segments, we've actually\nwent ahead and talked at what we can do\n\n11\n00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:41.523\nto side load apps, to make sure that we\ncan get the applications that we need.\n\n12\n00:00:41.523 --> 00:00:45.335\nWe talked at ways that we can\nactually work with applications, but\n\n13\n00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:49.880\nit has nothing really to do with identity\nuntil this particular episode itself.\n\n14\n00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.170\nAnd when we start talking about\nthe idea of identity itself.\n\n15\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.050\nAnd that is because Microsoft really\nwants us to use what they call of\n\n16\n00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.920\ncourse the Microsoft Account.\n\n17\n00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.930\nIs what they really want us to use,\nwhen working with Windows 10.\n\n18\n00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.170\nThat Windows 10 environment.\n\n19\n00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.580\nIs really designed around that ability.\n\n20\n00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.150\nSo you have multiple\ndevices if you have a phone\n\n21\n00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150\nif you have a tablet of some\nsort like the surface pro.\n\n22\n00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.100\nIf you have a laptop,\nif you have a desktop they want it to\n\n23\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.470\nbe a consistent environment all the way\nthrough all of those different devices.\n\n24\n00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.670\nAnd for you to do that, that means\nthere's one type of login that you need,\n\n25\n00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.010\nand the way that they want to do that,\nof course, is using a Microsoft Account.\n\n26\n00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.330\nWhat does this allow you to then do?\n\n27\n00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.190\nIt allows you to really end up\nsynchronizing settings and app,\n\n28\n00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.920\napp data, all of the stuff that you\nwould normally go to on a computer.\n\n29\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.150\nAs long as those things are synced\nup you have that ability to.\n\n30\n00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.790\nTo be able to use a computer just like you\n\n31\n00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.350\nwent from your laptop to your desktop it\nshould be about the same environment.\n\n32\n00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.980\nEven going to your own you should have the\nsame settings same information available\n\n33\n00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.030\nto you right there.\n\n34\n00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.970\nAs you would even on your desktop.\n\n35\n00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.970\nNow, you will have some differences, but\n\n36\n00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.010\nthe way to do this of course\nis to use a Microsoft Account.\n\n37\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.260\nThat is really what they want to do.\n\n38\n00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.450\nSo, at the very beginning when you\ninstall Windows 10 onto your computers,\n\n39\n00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.690\none of the earliest options that\nthey give you the ability to do.\n\n40\n00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.390\nIs to create a Microsoft Account or to go\nahead and sign on to a Microsoft Account.\n\n41\n00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.780\nAnd when you do so and\nyou finished installing Windows 10.\n\n42\n00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.410\nIf you had already been signed on with\na Microsoft Account on a previous\n\n43\n00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.640\nversion of Windows.\n\n44\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.570\nYou're gonna be amazed at how much stuff\nautomatically appears onto your computer.\n\n45\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.590\nEven your desktop background,\n\n46\n00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.630\neven though it's actually nice in\ndefault into the windows 10 by default.\n\n47\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.150\nWell, if you have a Microsoft account,\n\n48\n00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.210\nall your old stuff will actually make it\nappear as close as you can to windows 10.\n\n49\n00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.410\nIt is quite amazing that how they've\nactually linked all this stuff together.\n\n50\n00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.190\nBut when it comes down to it,\n\n51\n00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.310\nit really is about synchronization of\ndata, that's really what it boils down to.\n\n52\n00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.970\nSo what we wanna show you in this\nparticular segment of course\n\n53\n00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.440\nis working with\nthe Microsoft Account as well.\n\n54\n00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.950\nAnd so, and even show you how\nto create one if we need to.\n\n55\n00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.740\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n56\n00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.650\nSo on my computer, I went ahead and have\nmy Windows 10 computer up and running.\n\n57\n00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.880\nNow I've already signed on\nwith a Microsoft Account.\n\n58\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.280\nLet me see if I can show you that too.\n\n59\n00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.390\nSo the way that you can actually\ntell if you're signed on with\n\n60\n00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.990\nMicrosoft Account or not.\n\n61\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.380\nCouple of ways to do that.\n\n62\n00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.030\nThe one of the easiest ways,\nis simply click on the Windows button.\n\n63\n00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.890\nAnd then click on Settings, and\n\n64\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.970\nonce you're in Settings,\nyou're gonna go down to the Accounts icon.\n\n65\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.150\nAnd when you're actually in the Accounts\nicon, let me fullscreen this so\n\n66\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.520\nwe can see a little bit better.\n\n67\n00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.790\nYou can look right here.\n\n68\n00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.671\nAnd you can see right\naway that there it is.\n\n69\n00:03:34.671 --> 00:03:38.859\nI'm logged on with this unusual email,\nand I created this specifically for\n\n70\n00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:39.750\nthe show itself.\n\n71\n00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.880\nAnd so\nI'm now logged on with this account.\n\n72\n00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.630\nIf I go to another Windows 10 machine,\nand log on,\n\n73\n00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.470\nall those settings will also be\ncarried with me at this point, too.\n\n74\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.840\nNow if you haven't, in other words if\nyou haven't actually done this yet, and\n\n75\n00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.900\nyou're actually logged in with just\na regular local account, perfectly fine,\n\n76\n00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.040\nyou can do that.\n\n77\n00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.700\nBut more than likely, you'll see\na link right here that talks about\n\n78\n00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.920\ncreating a Microsoft Account\nif you don't have one.\n\n79\n00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.110\nSo what I'm gonna do instead, and\n\n80\n00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.040\nI'm simply gonna select\nManage my Microsoft account.\n\n81\n00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.160\nSo that we can see what\nthe big deal is and\n\n82\n00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.710\nwhy we actually want\nsomething like this too.\n\n83\n00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.320\nSo it brings me of course to\nthe Microsoft Account itself.\n\n84\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.210\nAnd it actually is just\nkinda of a login page.\n\n85\n00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.050\nYou see where I have my username.\n\n86\n00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.350\nAnd now you see some other information\non subscription and services.\n\n87\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.360\nThey want that all tied to one identity.\n\n88\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.930\nSo that really it becomes where,\nregardless of where you are on the planet,\n\n89\n00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.070\nyou have one digital identity\nthat you can be tied to.\n\n90\n00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.800\nAnd that's what they actually\nwant you to be able to do.\n\n91\n00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.020\nSo of course, you can change things\nlike your Account settings, and\n\n92\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.100\neverything like this.\n\n93\n00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.650\nBut what we're really looking for is down\nhere on the lower right-hand corner.\n\n94\n00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.670\nWhere it talks about the devices.\n\n95\n00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.440\nAnd the reason why this is important\nis because the Microsoft Account is\n\n96\n00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.300\nalso going to be limiting to the device\nthat are actually assigned to you as well.\n\n97\n00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.220\nSo you have a desktop,\nif you have a laptop, if you have a phone.\n\n98\n00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.220\nThose devices will also\nend up showing up here.\n\n99\n00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.220\nIt says hey, you can use\nthe Microsoft Account on those devices.\n\n100\n00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.955\nIf for\nsome reason I had lost my Windows phone.\n\n101\n00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:12.690\nWell and Daniel found it,\nhe tried to get into it,\n\n102\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.380\nwell after a while it's actually\ngonna say you can't do that anymore.\n\n103\n00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.970\nAnd what will happen is I'll\nget an email saying hey,\n\n104\n00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.450\nsomebody is trying to\nsign on to this device.\n\n105\n00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.660\nOr it may be where that device has now\nlost its connection with Microsoft, and\n\n106\n00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.150\nnow as I continue to use it,\nit's gonna say, wait a minute.\n\n107\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.450\nCan you verify that you are who\nyou say you are, and whether or\n\n108\n00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.020\nnot this is a trusted device, you name it.\n\n109\n00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.310\nThere's a couple of different\nthings that can happen.\n\n110\n00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.020\nSo notice it said I can add\na Windows Phone in by signing in that\n\n111\n00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.950\nphone right here.\n\n112\n00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.900\nI don't have one.\n\n113\n00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.430\nBut let me go ahead and\nsay see more devices in the store, and\n\n114\n00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.760\nthat way I can actually go ahead and\n\n115\n00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.150\ncheck out if there's actually any other\ndevices that they want me to buy.\n\n116\n00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.150\nOf course, that's not something\nthat I'm interested in right now.\n\n117\n00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.810\nBut you can actually see where that's\nwhat they really want you to do,\n\n118\n00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.740\nis to go ahead and do that.\n\n119\n00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.030\nNow they logged me into that too.\n\n120\n00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.390\nNow, the other thing that we want\nto be able do is to select up here.\n\n121\n00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.800\nThis is the device I was actually\nlooking for, I won't link to buy things.\n\n122\n00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.270\nIs click up here on devices and\nit's right here.\n\n123\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.060\nNotice that at this point,\nif I wanted to make sure that\n\n124\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.010\nthis particular computer was\nassociated with my account.\n\n125\n00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.940\nI would have it listed here.\n\n126\n00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.340\nIf I didn't, I simply can remove it.\n\n127\n00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.450\nIf I want to add in additional\ndevices I can click on Add More.\n\n128\n00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.550\nAnd it's right here that I can add in\na Windows Phone, a surface tablet,\n\n129\n00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.010\nan XBox, you name it.\n\n130\n00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.107\nAnd more and more it's actually all tied\nto your one Microsoft identity as what\n\n131\n00:06:30.107 --> 00:06:32.340\nthey really want you to do.\n\n132\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.030\nNow, most of the time.\n\n133\n00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.930\nIn a regular home environment.\n\n134\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.910\nThis is probably something you're\ngonna actually want to do.\n\n135\n00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.200\nBut just when I say that, with security\nconcerns you may choose not to,\n\n136\n00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.420\nwhich is again no skin off me\nwhether you choose to or not.\n\n137\n00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.430\nBut this makes it easier for\nMicrosoft to work with you.\n\n138\n00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.660\nAnd there are security concerns,\njust like anything else, right?\n\n139\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.420\nAll of your stuff, even though\nyou're logging onto your computer,\n\n140\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.740\nis being verified by some server\nout there in the Cloud somewhere.\n\n141\n00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.000\nSo you do have to actually\nkind of weigh out whether or\n\n142\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.880\nnot you are going to trust this or not.\n\n143\n00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.840\nMost of the time it's usually\nperfectly safe for you to do so.\n\n144\n00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.590\nBut I'm not gonna make that decision for\nyou, I'd be silly to say that all the time\n\n145\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.130\nbecause stuff like that does happen\nwhere there are security breaches.\n\n146\n00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.780\nBut overall though, I've used one of\nthese things for several years now.\n\n147\n00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.420\nAnd I've really had no\nissues with it at all.\n\n148\n00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.250\nThe problem that you\nwill have though is that,\n\n149\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.190\nespecially if you're adding a new device\ninto this is, well a lot of times\n\n150\n00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.870\nif your profile is fairly large, it's\ngonna actually take a lot of bandwidth.\n\n151\n00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.020\nAnd if you have a bandwidth cap,\nlike I have,\n\n152\n00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.560\nit's probably not gonna be the best thing\nfor you as you log in the first time.\n\n153\n00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.750\nSo you wanna make sure that you\nactually take care of that.\n\n154\n00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.540\nBefore you do that as well.\n\n155\n00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.040\nSo, a lot of these things are actually\nfairly good, fairly easy and\n\n156\n00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.610\nyou see how it's actually easy to set\nthat up right inside of Windows 10.\n\n157\n00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.776\nAnd once you do that you\nwill be ready to go.\n\n158\n00:07:51.776 --> 00:07:52.875\nNow, if you do.\n\n159\n00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:57.084\nIf you don't have one it won't actually\nallow you to set one up for yourself too.\n\n160\n00:07:57.084 --> 00:07:58.669\nIt will tell you how to create one.\n\n161\n00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:00.475\nYou end up getting an email address, or\n\n162\n00:08:00.475 --> 00:08:02.459\nyou can use a previous\nemail if you want to.\n\n163\n00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:04.280\nI just went ahead and\ncreated one from Hotmail.\n\n164\n00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.470\nI can't even remember the last time\nI actually had a Hotmail account.\n\n165\n00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.460\nSo I created one right here.\n\n166\n00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.610\nAllows me to be able to do that and\nget connected right in.\n\n167\n00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:17.100\nSo any device that I go to, now I can\nactually go to any of those devices,\n\n168\n00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.830\nuse this to log in, and I'm ready to go,\n\n169\n00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.860\nhave all of my settings on that\nparticular computer as well.\n\n170\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.845\nAnd we're off to the races, like that.\n\n171\n00:08:24.845 --> 00:08:28.153\nThe problem that we have though\nis not being able to do this.\n\n172\n00:08:28.153 --> 00:08:31.110\nFairly simple, you can follow\nthe instructions on how to do it.\n\n173\n00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.590\nIt's how do you balance that out.\n\n174\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.130\nWell, I'm pretty sure that if\nDaniel's a network administrator for\n\n175\n00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:41.040\nhis insurance company, the idea of me\nsaying Daniel, I wanna use this Microsoft\n\n176\n00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.510\naccount instead to log in, what do you\nthink, Daniel, will what be a good idea?\n\n177\n00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.990\n>> Yeah, we're probably not gonna do that.\n\n178\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:50.360\nAnd for the very good reasons of A we have\na domain most likely set in place and\n\n179\n00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.290\nwe're using those credentials because,\n\n180\n00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.710\nwell, I can administrate\nthose credentials.\n\n181\n00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.670\nI have the ability to control\nwhat that user can and cannot do.\n\n182\n00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.590\nIf Microsoft is controlling\nthat then well,\n\n183\n00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.380\nI've kind of delegated\nthat role out to them.\n\n184\n00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.810\nUsually not something that a company\nwide decision is gonna happen, so\n\n185\n00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.260\nit's not gonna work very well for\nour security platform.\n\n186\n00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.370\nThat's not what we wanna do.\n\n187\n00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.080\nLike Ryan said, as a home user,\nthis integration, using that one Microsoft\n\n188\n00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.600\naccount through Windows 10,\nall the different Windows 10 applications,\n\n189\n00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.430\nwhether it be a mobile phone that's\nrunning Windows 10 mobile, or\n\n190\n00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:28.770\nyou have a surface, or a laptop,\nor a desktop computer,\n\n191\n00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.970\nhow that integrates as well into your\nXbox, all those Microsoft environments\n\n192\n00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:38.020\nbecoming more homogenous where you are you\nno matter what device you're logging onto.\n\n193\n00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.500\nThat's fantastic, but\n\n194\n00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.460\nit doesn't really translate that well\nover to a corporate-type of environment.\n\n195\n00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.870\nRight?\nSo, that's why we tend to\n\n196\n00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.160\nseparate those out.\n\n197\n00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.440\nSo, if you work in\na corporate environment,\n\n198\n00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.560\nyou're probably gonna have two accounts.\n\n199\n00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.820\nYou're gonna have your Microsoft account\nfor all of your personalized stuff,\n\n200\n00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.230\nall the devices that you own for\nyour own systems.\n\n201\n00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.280\nThat's gonna be your Microsoft account.\n\n202\n00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.060\nAll your work devices,\nthat's gonna be your work account.\n\n203\n00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.520\nSo, it's gonna be your active\ndirectory type of credentials,\n\n204\n00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.720\nusername and password.\n\n205\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.380\nSo it can be a little difficult for\n\n206\n00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.150\nsome people to keep the two\nstraight in their head.\n\n207\n00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.930\nYou know it's like,\noh I'm trying to log into this thing and\n\n208\n00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.120\nit's just not going well.\n\n209\n00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.900\nYou're probably using the wrong account,\nit could be just a wrong password,\n\n210\n00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.520\nthat's easy enough done as well.\n\n211\n00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.892\nBut don't get too confused, just\nbecause it says it's .microsoft.com or\n\n212\n00:10:21.892 --> 00:10:25.389\n@microsoft.com, or\n@hotmail.com, @outlook.com,\n\n213\n00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:29.440\nthat should be letting you know that\nthat is your own personal account.\n\n214\n00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.311\nAnd then if you work for\nXYZ company or Catoso.com or\n\n215\n00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:35.779\nwhatever the other fake names\nthey give you in Microsoft land.\n\n216\n00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:39.341\n[LAUGH] You can see that at\nthe end of your email address.\n\n217\n00:10:39.341 --> 00:10:41.398\nThat's basically your login name.\n\n218\n00:10:41.398 --> 00:10:43.251\nWhich is gonna be, for me,\n\n219\n00:10:43.251 --> 00:10:48.015\nit would probably be It would be\ndlowrie@xyz.com or contoso.net.\n\n220\n00:10:48.015 --> 00:10:51.835\nThat's how you can keep those two\nseparate and straight in your mind.\n\n221\n00:10:51.835 --> 00:10:52.415\n>> Yeah.\n\n222\n00:10:52.415 --> 00:10:55.521\nNow the key issue here,\nthough, right, also is for\n\n223\n00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:59.200\nthe very fact that users that\nbegin with Windows 10 at home.\n\n224\n00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.550\nThis is normally what they'll\nnormally also see inside of a work\n\n225\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.860\nenvironment, too.\n\n226\n00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.820\nInside the work environment, what they're\ngonna see is right here on the desktop.\n\n227\n00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.910\nSo let's say this is one of the desktops\ninside of your work environment.\n\n228\n00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:15.130\nAnd so now they come right here and\nthey get a regular logon screen.\n\n229\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.350\nAnd if they're already used to\nsigning onto a Microsoft account\n\n230\n00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.040\nwith their logon screen,\nthey may go ahead and start to see that,\n\n231\n00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.616\nhey, let me go ahead and\nlogon right there, too.\n\n232\n00:11:24.616 --> 00:11:29.130\nAnd when Windows 10 is\ndesigned to accept it.\n\n233\n00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.870\nSo it could be where you are actually\ngoing to go ahead and accept that.\n\n234\n00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.550\nWell, you're probably not gonna accept it.\n\n235\n00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.250\nBut it could be where they go ahead and\nthey type in their\n\n236\n00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:43.040\nMicrosoft account credentials, and\nthen they type in their password.\n\n237\n00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.610\nAnd when they do that, guess what?\n\n238\n00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.908\nIt's actually going to accept it,\nat least, I think it's going to.\n\n239\n00:11:46.908 --> 00:11:48.900\n[LAUGH] Let's see.\n\n240\n00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.580\nSo it's gonna accept it, and\nall the sudden there it is.\n\n241\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.040\nYou now have a domain computer.\n\n242\n00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.850\nOop, I'm lying to you.\n\n243\n00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.720\nOh, wrong password.\n\n244\n00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.633\nLet me see if I can actually do that.\n\n245\n00:12:03.233 --> 00:12:04.127\nOopsy.\n\n246\n00:12:04.127 --> 00:12:07.168\nAnd now I am.\n\n247\n00:12:07.168 --> 00:12:08.145\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n248\n00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:10.160\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> I know tell me about it.\n\n249\n00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.030\nThat's actually quite\nembarrassing right now.\n\n250\n00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.490\nBut actually that makes a good point for\nus, that we need to be able to do, too.\n\n251\n00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.560\nSo if I could actually remember it,\nit would help.\n\n252\n00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.780\nAll right, let me go ahead and\n\n253\n00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.720\nmake another point while I'm actually\ntrying to remember what my password is.\n\n254\n00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.960\nIt's kind of funny.\n\n255\n00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.900\nYou're hoping that's what really happens.\n\n256\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.350\nBut the nature and the reality of\nit though, is if it accepts it,\n\n257\n00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.970\nit logs them in,\nnow you have a computer on your network.\n\n258\n00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:37.650\nRight?\n\n259\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:42.710\nThat now is, well, connecting\noutside to get credentials in so\n\n260\n00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.620\nthat they can actually use that machine.\n\n261\n00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.230\nAnd even though it might not\ndisturb any other of your other,\n\n262\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.950\nyour resources inside your network,\n\n263\n00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.910\nit's still someone on your network\nlogging in really to a different network.\n\n264\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.850\nAnd that's something we really,\nreally don't want to end up happening.\n\n265\n00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.690\nSo the way that we prevent that, right?\n\n266\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:04.380\nIs that we can actually put some\nsettings in place domain wide,\n\n267\n00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:09.498\nor even on that individual computer, that\nwill help prevent this from happening.\n\n268\n00:13:09.498 --> 00:13:12.610\nSo let me go ahead and show you what\nwe're talking about, which is right here.\n\n269\n00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.700\nOkay, so on my machine,\n\n270\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.520\nwhat we need to do is we need to\nget into our local policy settings.\n\n271\n00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.733\nNow if you're in a domain environment,\nyou're probably gonna set this through\n\n272\n00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:23.534\ngroup policy, but on the Windows\nmachine you can also do this as well.\n\n273\n00:13:23.534 --> 00:13:27.799\nIf I can go ahead, oops, let me see\nif I can actually get logged in here.\n\n274\n00:13:33.162 --> 00:13:37.121\nSo now, if my machine will\nactually let me get access in.\n\n275\n00:13:44.505 --> 00:13:46.200\nSee if that will actually launch up.\n\n276\n00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.060\nSo I will launch the group policy\nmanagement, or the local policy editor.\n\n277\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.540\nI'm always used to group\npolicy management console now.\n\n278\n00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.050\nAnd so what we want to do is we wanna know\nwhere those settings actually are going to\n\n279\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.940\nbe that will help block this.\n\n280\n00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.660\nSo remember that this policy\nactually affects this computer, and\n\n281\n00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.750\nI wanna make sure it affects\neveryone on this computer.\n\n282\n00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.490\nSo I wanna go under\nComputer Configuration, and\n\n283\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:11.930\nfrom there we are going to\nexpand out Windows Settings.\n\n284\n00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.560\nAnd then Security Settings is\nwhat we're taking a look at.\n\n285\n00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.810\nAnd underneath Security Settings,\nwe're going to go to Local Policies.\n\n286\n00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.090\nAnd under Local Policies,\nunder Security Options,\n\n287\n00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.540\nlet me expand that out a little bit more.\n\n288\n00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.630\nAnd it's over here on the right hand side\n\n289\n00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.100\nthat we can actually\nchoose a couple of things.\n\n290\n00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.620\nWhat we're really looking for\nis this setting right here.\n\n291\n00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.320\nIt says Accounts Block Microsoft accounts.\n\n292\n00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.810\nWell, I'm inside of a domain and\nI wanna ensure that my users are not\n\n293\n00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.400\ngoing to be using Microsoft accounts,\nit's gonna be right here, and\n\n294\n00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.060\nI need to make sure that that\nsetting's actually gonna be there.\n\n295\n00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.660\nAnd now I have a couple\nof decisions to make.\n\n296\n00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.030\nNotice that I actually have\nthree different decisions.\n\n297\n00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.180\nThis policy is disabled.\n\n298\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.620\nUsers can't add Microsoft accounts.\n\n299\n00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:05.340\nUsers can't add or\nlog on with Microsoft accounts.\n\n300\n00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.550\nSo in this setting,\n\n301\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.640\nright, it could be that somebody's already\ngot Microsoft accounts on that computer.\n\n302\n00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.450\nYou just want to prevent them\nfrom adding additional ones.\n\n303\n00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:16.790\nWhen you do that, you're gonna select\nthat second option where users can't add\n\n304\n00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.120\nMicrosoft accounts.\n\n305\n00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.640\nBut, if you wanna make sure that they\ncan't add Microsoft accounts and\n\n306\n00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.210\nalso log on with them,\n\n307\n00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:27.600\nthat third option is gonna be the one that\nyou want instead, and then you click OK.\n\n308\n00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.800\nAnd once you do that, and you need to\nmake sure you run your GP update, and\n\n309\n00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.780\nthen from that point you actually have\nenabled that particular policy as well.\n\n310\n00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.550\nSo that is something that you want\nto make sure that you do understand,\n\n311\n00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.980\nespecially in an environment where you\nwant to prevent them from logging on.\n\n312\n00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.520\nYou may have good reasons to do that.\n\n313\n00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.840\nThe reasons Daniel talked about.\n\n314\n00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.959\nThe very fact that you're\nmanaging your own domain.\n\n315\n00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:52.589\nYou don't want somebody actually\nbeing able to sit in your network and\n\n316\n00:15:52.589 --> 00:15:55.000\nthen logging onto a remote\nserver somewhere.\n\n317\n00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.102\nTo have their credentials be validated\nthat way, instead you want to manage that\n\n318\n00:15:59.102 --> 00:16:03.383\nall on your own, the way to prevent that,\nsince Windows 10 is natively designed to\n\n319\n00:16:03.383 --> 00:16:06.750\naccept both, well this is the way\nthat you do that instead.\n\n320\n00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.650\nAnd that will actually allow\nyou then to go ahead, and\n\n321\n00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.260\nbe able to feel nice and safe and\nsecure, even thought it's not\n\n322\n00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.580\nthe way that Microsoft would like you to\ndo it, it's the way that you can do it and\n\n323\n00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.600\nthat's actually a better setting for\nyou to understand and to know as well.\n\n324\n00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.670\nNow, along with that of course then,\nare the idea of synchronizations and\n\n325\n00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.870\nwhat we have to actually pay attention to,\ntoo.\n\n326\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.670\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee just a couple of other things here,\n\n327\n00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.230\nas we kind of close out this session.\n\n328\n00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.390\nSo if I want to talk\nabout synchronization,\n\n329\n00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.890\nwhat I need to do is actually\nfind the settings here.\n\n330\n00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.760\nFor me to get access to those settings,\n\n331\n00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.100\nI'm going to click on the Start button and\nthen go to Settings.\n\n332\n00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.130\nThat's what I've been looking for.\n\n333\n00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.418\nAnd from there, go back to User Accounts.\n\n334\n00:16:48.418 --> 00:16:51.570\nAnd notice that they\nhave a nice big option on\n\n335\n00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.675\nthe left hand side that talks\nabout syncing your settings.\n\n336\n00:16:53.675 --> 00:16:56.550\nAnd this is fairly important\nbecause it actually does say,\n\n337\n00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.060\nwhat you are gonna allow to sync\nup to your Microsoft account,\n\n338\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.146\nwhat you aren't gonna allow to do it,\nand so that does provide this.\n\n339\n00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:06.680\nSo it tell's you Sync settings,\nto other devices, how does it work if you\n\n340\n00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.170\nwant to turn it completely off,\nwell that's it, you just turn it all off.\n\n341\n00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:14.700\nBut if you don't want to carry over things\nlike passwords or language preferences, or\n\n342\n00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:19.610\nease of access, or other Window settings,\nyou simply can choose those options\n\n343\n00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:23.390\nto allow you to go ahead and\nchange those settings as well.\n\n344\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:27.010\nSo this will actually allow you\nto be able to do stuff like that.\n\n345\n00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.420\nAnd to ensure that you actually only allow\n\n346\n00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.580\nthe Microsoft account to only\nsync what you want them to sync.\n\n347\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.910\nAnd that's pretty much a big part of it,\nas far as the different settings go.\n\n348\n00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:40.280\nNow in terms of your profile and\nstuff, that will always be synced up.\n\n349\n00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.320\nYou are already using that\nMicrosoft account, as well.\n\n350\n00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.550\nNow the last thing that we also\nwant to talk about of course,\n\n351\n00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.380\nis that with the Microsoft account comes\na lot of other things, like OneDrive.\n\n352\n00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.280\nI know there's Cloud storage, and\n\n353\n00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.310\nother things that you actually do\nhave the ability to access, and\n\n354\n00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:58.530\nto be able to use if you need to,\nat least at the most basic level.\n\n355\n00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.010\nEven for free users, you get a little\nbit of storage space up there and\n\n356\n00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.590\navailable for you to do.\n\n357\n00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:07.250\nBut the problem is, well, who's\ncomputer do you want to leave that on?\n\n358\n00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:12.930\nSo if Daniel were to go to a different\nlocation, that was remote,\n\n359\n00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:17.450\nand Daniel would sign on with his\nMicrosoft account, and now all that stuff\n\n360\n00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:22.400\nreally is downloaded, or synced up to,\nDaniel's account there on that computer.\n\n361\n00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.240\nWell, instead what we can do, is we can\nset up what we call Trusted Devices.\n\n362\n00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.130\nAnd this will actually say, hey, is\nthis a trusted device for Daniel or not?\n\n363\n00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.860\nAnd it'll only allow him to sync\nthose settings down to those trusted\n\n364\n00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.080\ndevices too.\n\n365\n00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.490\nSo let's show you where that also\nis going to be done as well.\n\n366\n00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.530\nSo let me go ahead and close that out.\n\n367\n00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.330\nAnd then I'm gonna click back\non the Start button, and\n\n368\n00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.510\nthen go to Settings, and\nback to Accounts again.\n\n369\n00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.880\nAnd now in my Microsoft account,\nover here.\n\n370\n00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.745\nLet me go ahead and\nclick on Manage my Microsoft Cccount.\n\n371\n00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.865\nAnd it's back on these devices right here.\n\n372\n00:18:59.865 --> 00:19:01.610\nSo I select these devices.\n\n373\n00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:05.880\nRemember that if I add in more devices,\nthese are actually gonna be the devices\n\n374\n00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.150\nthat I need to add in,\nthat will allow Daniel to do that.\n\n375\n00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.010\nIf he actually is on a machine\nthat's not a trusted machine, well,\n\n376\n00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:15.525\nit's not gonna bring access to\nall those other devices with him.\n\n377\n00:19:15.525 --> 00:19:18.310\nIt'll bring his settings with him,\nand access to some of his files,\n\n378\n00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.860\nbut its not gonna leave all\nthat on that other machine.\n\n379\n00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.232\nSo only on those trusted\nmachines will it do that.\n\n380\n00:19:24.232 --> 00:19:29.340\nSo its another security feature on those,\nbut\n\n381\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.610\nit at least gives you peace of mind,\nif nothing else.\n\n382\n00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.870\nThat only my stuff is gonna be\nto those trusted devices, and\n\n383\n00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:38.310\nis not gonna be left all over the planet,\nas Daniel is a jet setter and travels\n\n384\n00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.620\neverywhere around the country, logging\nout with his Microsoft account as well.\n\n385\n00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.293\nSo do kinda realize that\nthere's a lot of this, and\n\n386\n00:19:45.293 --> 00:19:48.660\nit is all about trying to tie\neverything to one identity.\n\n387\n00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.970\nThis is true whether you're\nactually accessing your Office 365,\n\n388\n00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:54.290\nor whether you're accessing Intune,\n\n389\n00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.576\nthey really want it to be tied to\nthat one identity if they can.\n\n390\n00:19:57.576 --> 00:20:00.310\nMost businesses probably\naren't gonna do that, but\n\n391\n00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:03.630\nthere are opportunities though for\nyou to do that if you actually need to.\n\n392\n00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.350\nAnd it is an opportunity that Microsoft\nwould like you to take advantage of.\n\n393\n00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.650\n>> Yeah, I found it interesting that,\nyou notice that when Ronny\n\n394\n00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.300\nwent to check those settings to manage\nthe devices, where did it take him?\n\n395\n00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.070\nTo the web, right?\n\n396\n00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.773\n>> That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n397\n00:20:14.773 --> 00:20:15.280\n>> To the web.\n\n398\n00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.052\nIt's all about being able to manage from\n\n399\n00:20:17.052 --> 00:20:19.563\nwherever you're at,\nwith that one set of credentials.\n\n400\n00:20:19.563 --> 00:20:21.265\nI can say here are the devices that I\n\n401\n00:20:21.265 --> 00:20:25.287\ntrust, here are the settings that I need.\nHere I can do all this stuff with my\n\n402\n00:20:25.287 --> 00:20:29.430\nusername and my password that I’ve\ncreated on my Microsoft account.\n\n403\n00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:33.020\nAnd from any device that I’m at,\nI can make some settings changes.\n\n404\n00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.910\nIt doesn’t matter if I’m at an Internet\ncafé, or if I’m at a local coffee shop, or\n\n405\n00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.520\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n406\n00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.290\nI can always make some changes, and\n\n407\n00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:45.700\ndo some administration to my own Microsoft\naccounts, that I have for my personal use.\n\n408\n00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.470\nSo, remember that it is different\nthan the Active Directory stuff.\n\n409\n00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.740\nAnd if you do need to\nseparate those two out, and\n\n410\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.010\nthat's kinda what we're talking about\ntoday, is managing these accounts.\n\n411\n00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.080\nWhat is what, why do I want to\nuse this one over that one.\n\n412\n00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.080\nIntunes, same kind of thing, you get to\nuse your Microsoft account in your Intune\n\n413\n00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.725\ndevice, or you have to create an Intune\naccount specifically, very cool stuff.\n\n414\n00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:08.435\nHopefully you guys got\na lot out of this though.\n\n415\n00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:12.055\nWe've gone through great lengths to make\nsure that you understand the difference\n\n416\n00:21:12.055 --> 00:21:15.517\nbetween these different types of accounts,\nthat they want you to use inside of\n\n417\n00:21:15.517 --> 00:21:18.580\nWindows 10, and\nhow it natively processes these things.\n\n418\n00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.730\nHopefully you've got a lot out of this.\n\n419\n00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.727\nWe've enjoyed making this program,\nbut we're gonna go ahead and\n\n420\n00:21:22.727 --> 00:21:23.752\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n421\n00:21:23.752 --> 00:21:25.085\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n422\n00:21:25.085 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.850\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry, here with me\ntoday is none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.850\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.680\n>> It is going well today, it's another\ngreat day to be right here in the studio\n\n6\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.530\nas we continue on taking look at some\nof the topics that we'll be covering\n\n7\n00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.150\nin getting ready for our Windows 10 exam.\n\n8\n00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.230\nRight?\nA brand new exam as it comes out.\n\n9\n00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.160\nBut we are configuring Windows devices and\n\n10\n00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.140\nspecifically taking look at\nthe devices that support Windows 10.\n\n11\n00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.740\nSo what we're going through right now,\nis we're taking a look then,\n\n12\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.540\nat supporting authentication,\nand kind of moving to the future,\n\n13\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.500\nis what Windows 10 really is about.\n\n14\n00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.180\nIn the past, all of the Windows operating\nsystems, they really did depend on the old\n\n15\n00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.350\nfashion user name and password, and all of\nthem have pretty much depended on that.\n\n16\n00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.980\nAnd actually even in domain settings,\nwe still do depend on user name and\n\n17\n00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.740\npasswords fairly heavily.\n\n18\n00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.020\nThat's because it's cheap,\nit actually works fairly well, and\n\n19\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.980\na lot of times we'll actually\nhave it going perfectly fine.\n\n20\n00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.590\nBut we are now in this day and age in\nwhich passwords are, I don't wanna say\n\n21\n00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.640\npasse, but we're starting to see\nwhere they are becoming more and\n\n22\n00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.520\nmore of a security weakness.\n\n23\n00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.180\nAnd so what Windows 10 has tried to\nintegrate into the operating system itself\n\n24\n00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.270\nIs to try and push us, I mean really\npush hard, so that what we do is we\n\n25\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.110\nkind of put passwords behind us is\nwhat's really trying to happen when we\n\n26\n00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.860\nstart talking about using\nWindows 10 to help us out here.\n\n27\n00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.960\nSo when it begins, we need to understand a\nlittle bit about authentication and then,\n\n28\n00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.950\nwe need to see some of the ways that\nwe actually do authentication, and\n\n29\n00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.740\nthen talk about the way that\nWindows 10 really helps us,\n\n30\n00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.720\ntrying to push us away from just\nthat username and password.\n\n31\n00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.080\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nthe factors of authentication and\n\n32\n00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.480\nthen we'll round this up and\nbring us back into Windows 10 here.\n\n33\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.340\nSo on my screen I went ahead and created\n\n34\n00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.725\nsome different factors that we can talk\nabout in terms of authentication that we.\n\n35\n00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:06.795\nHave to at least know about, right?\n\n36\n00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:12.095\nSo if you've been working with Windows all\nalong, and actually any type of computing,\n\n37\n00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:15.645\nbasic authentication boils down\nto three different factors.\n\n38\n00:02:15.645 --> 00:02:18.440\nThose factors include, of course,\nsomething that you know,\n\n39\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.920\nsomething that you might have on you and\nthen something you are.\n\n40\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.640\nSo those are the three separate\nauthentication factors by itself.\n\n41\n00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.200\nBy far the most popular one and probably\nthe cheapest one that's implemented\n\n42\n00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.070\nis something that you know, which is\na combination of a user name and password.\n\n43\n00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.120\nAnd that one's been around for\na long time.\n\n44\n00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.250\nEverybody's been using it forever and\never, and so much so\n\n45\n00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.730\nthat this has become almost second\nnature to everything that we log into.\n\n46\n00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.960\nThe problem with actually the idea of just\nusing user name and password is simple.\n\n47\n00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.150\nSometimes you get ones like\nthe ones that I've listed here.\n\n48\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.190\nLower case password.\n\n49\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.010\nIf you don't think that people are still\nusing that you're absolutely dead wrong.\n\n50\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.050\nThere was just a survey put out just\na couple of months ago actually\n\n51\n00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.110\nthat still says about 80% of the passwords\nthat are used on the internet\n\n52\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.770\nare actually the top ten\nare these two right here.\n\n53\n00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.620\nPassword in all lowercase letters and\n1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\n54\n00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.840\nAt least to me an insanity that's\nout there where people say oh yeah,\n\n55\n00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.000\nI'll connect to a remote machine\nthat I don't know anything about and\n\n56\n00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.840\nI'll enter in a password like this and\nexpect nobody to actually figure out\n\n57\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.940\nhow that password's actually\ngoing to come back and harm me.\n\n58\n00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.210\nIt is amazing, but\nthe very fact that something like this can\n\n59\n00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.540\nbe easily guessed because it's on 80%\nof the machines out there in the world.\n\n60\n00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.060\nWell, what are the chances that\neven inside of your own domain,\n\n61\n00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.300\nunless you set some complexity settings,\nthat this is probably true as well.\n\n62\n00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.600\nOr the other factor of this is not the\nusername part that we give that provides\n\n63\n00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.590\nsome issues.\n\n64\n00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.900\nBut it's actually the password\ncomplexity level,\n\n65\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.790\njust like what we were talking about.\n\n66\n00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.490\nWhat we can do is that Daniel can\nactually go to an active directory domain\n\n67\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.040\ncontroller and\nsay you wanna know something?\n\n68\n00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.260\nI'm not gonna allow anybody to do this.\n\n69\n00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.060\nWe're gonna get complexity levels.\n\n70\n00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.410\nThat's gonna require all of\nthese complex settings, and\n\n71\n00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.720\nwe're gonna make the password,\nlet's say, 20 characters long.\n\n72\n00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.350\nOkay.\n\n73\n00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.540\nYeah, Daniel's sitting there like,\nyeah, sure thing.\n\n74\n00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.160\nThat sounds great to me.\n\n75\n00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.620\nThe problem is somebody silly like me is\n\n76\n00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.760\nnot gonna remember that\n20 character password.\n\n77\n00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.470\nSo every time I'm gonna start typing it in\nwrong, and after a while it's just gonna\n\n78\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.630\nlock me out, and\nthen I'm gonna have to wait five minutes.\n\n79\n00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.610\nAnd now it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon\ncuz I've spent every five minutes actually\n\n80\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.660\nrunning through all\nthe possible combinations.\n\n81\n00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.100\nIt's 3 o'clock and\nI haven't actually gotten anything done.\n\n82\n00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.000\nOr I finally have to go to Daniel.\n\n83\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.860\nDaniel, you have to reset my password.\n\n84\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.260\nHe resets it,\nanother 20 character password.\n\n85\n00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.560\nI'm still in trouble.\n\n86\n00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.510\nSo, when we start doing\nsomething like that,\n\n87\n00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.540\nthat's really the problems we have, right?\n\n88\n00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.540\nEither it's too easy,okay?\n\n89\n00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.720\nOr it's too guessable, or it's so\n\n90\n00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.020\ncomplex someone like me is\nnot going to remember it.\n\n91\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.170\nAnd so by itself it has this\nweakness supported right there,\n\n92\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.700\nwhich you actually start seeing.\n\n93\n00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.060\nThe more news that you read,\n\n94\n00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.910\nthe more you're starting to see\npassword vulnerability hack.\n\n95\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.230\nAnd they're happening\nout on the Internet and\n\n96\n00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.470\nyou can guess that they're happening\ninside of your business too.\n\n97\n00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.070\nNow, of course to move away\nfrom that then is to say look\n\n98\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.110\nwe need to get away from passwords, which\nis something that's absolutely true And\n\n99\n00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.310\nsome of the other ways that we've done\nthat is by simply providing something\n\n100\n00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.790\nelse, what we call some type\nof something that you have.\n\n101\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.310\nSo it could be that you have to\npresent a smart card or a key fob or\n\n102\n00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.820\nsome type of token is\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n103\n00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.000\nSome type of token authentication and\nthis is absolutely better.\n\n104\n00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.840\nThe very fact that you're not actually\nexposing any part of what that\n\n105\n00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.770\nkey is gonna be It's encoded\nonto that device perfectly fine.\n\n106\n00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.670\nThe hard part about it is,\nagain somebody like me is fairly easily,\n\n107\n00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.950\nleaves his house, leaves it at home.\n\n108\n00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.410\nIt'll be possible or he doesn't like\nhanging it on lanyard around his neck, so\n\n109\n00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.770\nduring work day, he takes it off and\nhe puts it in his desk drawer.\n\n110\n00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.700\nHe goes home without it and\ncomes in the next day and it's gone.\n\n111\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.560\nNow what happens, now you actually\nhave something that is missing.\n\n112\n00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.690\nWhether somebody stole it, whether it's\nmissing, or whether it dropped out of his\n\n113\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.300\npocket as he was running when\nit was actually raining one day.\n\n114\n00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.800\nDropped right in a puddle.\n\n115\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.930\nDaniel with his truck backs right over\nthat thing and it's now in pieces.\n\n116\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.430\nNow there's other\nproblems that also go on.\n\n117\n00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.720\nSo there's a lot of advantage\nto this in the form of privacy.\n\n118\n00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.420\nThat somebody's not gonna\njust pick it up and go,\n\n119\n00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.320\noh, there's Ronnie's password right\nthere encoded on that metal strip.\n\n120\n00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.010\nAnd he's gonna be able to figure that out.\n\n121\n00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.240\nBut, it is actually possible\nthat somebody can take it and\n\n122\n00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.770\nthen use of course the proper hardware\nauthentication to help us out here.\n\n123\n00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.730\nSo that is a workable possibility, but\nit does have its limitations as well.\n\n124\n00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.170\nAnd then of course when we actually go\nto full hardware we're now talking about\n\n125\n00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.350\nsomething that you are, which we bring in\nthat big term of biometric at this point.\n\n126\n00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.560\nBiometric really depends\non a behavioral or\n\n127\n00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.080\na physical characteristic that you have.\n\n128\n00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.870\nNow if you're like, well pretty much\nthe entire human race just about,\n\n129\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.150\nyou have a fingerprint.\n\n130\n00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.100\nWell now imagine being\nable to authenticate,\n\n131\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.000\nproving who you are by just\nusing your fingerprint.\n\n132\n00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.450\nThat sounds like a great deal,\nthat's the way to go.\n\n133\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.505\nOr it could be something\nlike a retinal scan, or\n\n134\n00:06:53.505 --> 00:06:57.430\na voice-recognition scan, or\na facial recognition scanner.\n\n135\n00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.350\nAll these are possibilities.\n\n136\n00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.420\nThe problem that we have here on this end,\nit's not that they're not good.\n\n137\n00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.140\nIt actually works fairly well.\n\n138\n00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.780\nBut, the problem is, once again on some\nof these as far the business goes, right?\n\n139\n00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.350\nSome of this hardware can be little\nbit expensive to actually implement\n\n140\n00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.920\neven though the prices\nare starting to come down.\n\n141\n00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.970\nWe actually do have factors where it\nmaybe a little bit complicated set up.\n\n142\n00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.660\nIt may actually be costly,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n143\n00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.740\nThe very fact is, by themselves,\n\n144\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.495\nall three of these different factors here,\nhave their own weaknesses in themselves.\n\n145\n00:07:29.495 --> 00:07:33.875\nAnd so we don't want to depend\non any one methodology.\n\n146\n00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:37.895\nSo instead the best way to do\nauthentication is to be able to support\n\n147\n00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:41.585\nwhat we call MultiFactor Authentication,\nwhat I have down here in bold print.\n\n148\n00:07:41.585 --> 00:07:45.745\nI wanted to emphasize that more than\njust those other three individually.\n\n149\n00:07:45.745 --> 00:07:48.415\nAnd even though we still\nwork with those other three,\n\n150\n00:07:48.415 --> 00:07:52.230\nthe fact is what we wanna actually do is\nwhat we call MultiFactor Authentication.\n\n151\n00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.700\nAnd this actually is much stronger.\n\n152\n00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.670\nRight?\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n153\n00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.320\nIt's way better way to go.\n\n154\n00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.789\nBecause well,\nit doesn't rely on any one system.\n\n155\n00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:01.369\nIt gives you a multitude of systems so\n\n156\n00:08:01.369 --> 00:08:04.790\nthat you really are basically\nsaying This is me.\n\n157\n00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.930\nI've proven it not once, maybe not even\ntwice, but maybe even three times.\n\n158\n00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.020\nNow, obviously, you can shift and\nmove however you wanna do this.\n\n159\n00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.150\nMaybe you can do something you know,\nwith something you are,\n\n160\n00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.350\nmaybe something you have\nwith something you know.\n\n161\n00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.640\nOr anyway you like, obviously I\nthink the best way to go would be\n\n162\n00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.000\nsomething you know,\nplus something you are, right?\n\n163\n00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.130\nBecause those are two things that\nare always gonna be with you.\n\n164\n00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.320\nSomething you have is possible\nthat you could leave it at home,\n\n165\n00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.980\nlike Ronnie said, maybe it gets lost or\nstolen, that does occur as well.\n\n166\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.060\nAnd then because you don't\nhave that one factor,\n\n167\n00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.050\nyou won't be able to access whatever\nit is you're trying to access.\n\n168\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.440\nBut it still is a better than\njust one-factor authentication,\n\n169\n00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.770\nwhere if I lost my key fob,\nI'm completely out of the system.\n\n170\n00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:47.690\nI'm done like dinner.\n\n171\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.580\nI have no way of proving who I am,\n\n172\n00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.990\nit was that key fob that proved who I was,\nverse if I have something I know,\n\n173\n00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.080\nmaybe I can get some maybe lower access,\nthings like that.\n\n174\n00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.880\nBut again having that multi factor login,\nor that multi\n\n175\n00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.390\nfactor authentication is a better term for\nit is a really, really secure way to go.\n\n176\n00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.365\nAnd that's why Windows 10 is really\npushing this type of authentication, so\n\n177\n00:09:11.365 --> 00:09:14.810\nthat, laptops and computers and\n\n178\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.900\nidentities these days getting stolen\nis a big deal, it happens a lot.\n\n179\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.930\nThey're trying to help out with that,\n\n180\n00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.510\nbeating it to the punch via\nthe operating system itself.\n\n181\n00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.260\nSo that knuckleheads like you and\n\n182\n00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.030\nI out there that are trying to remember\na password that's 20 characters and\n\n183\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.470\ncrazy complexity, even though I\nmight do that in my own stead.\n\n184\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.040\nI can't trust that everyone\nis gonna be able to do that.\n\n185\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.160\nIt is a hard thing to ask\npeople to try and do.\n\n186\n00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.170\nSo if we can just have the operating\nsystem give us the ability to do that\n\n187\n00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.800\nwithout having to go crazy,\nwell that's a really nice feature.\n\n188\n00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.850\nAnd so Windows 10 has really stepped\nup the game when it comes to this.\n\n189\n00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:50.820\n>> It really has, Daniel.\n\n190\n00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.050\nAnd what we talked about here is that the\nbasic factors of authentication that we\n\n191\n00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.540\njust mentioned,\nwhether it's multi-factor or not.\n\n192\n00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.970\nThe problem that we have even with this\nmultifactor authentication is that what we\n\n193\n00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:06.040\nnormally have is, if it is something\nthat I know, such as my password, and\n\n194\n00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.900\neven if it is something biometric\nlike what Daniel mentioned.\n\n195\n00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.380\nIt actually does require us to have\na device that's hooked up to it.\n\n196\n00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.700\nWell, what Windows 10 does is tries to\nnormalize two-factor authentication\n\n197\n00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.030\nby making the device\nthat you're logging into\n\n198\n00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.790\nactually be that second hardware\nbased factor, is what its doing.\n\n199\n00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.870\nSo that way you're not having to bring\nthat third piece, right, the idea of\n\n200\n00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.880\nthe smart card, that something that you\nactually present to the operating system.\n\n201\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.170\nAnd then you also present something\nlike a pin number to it, and\n\n202\n00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.220\nthose are two external factors that\nthen tie in to the computer itself.\n\n203\n00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:41.990\nWith Windows 10,\n\n204\n00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:47.050\nthey work based on the hardware that's\nactually right there in the system.\n\n205\n00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:50.960\nWhen you run it, they really do want\nyou to use the hardware itself.\n\n206\n00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.710\nSo what they're saying is the second\nfactor of your authentication\n\n207\n00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.930\nis gonna be the hardware itself.\n\n208\n00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.161\nSo it's really trying to help you do that.\n\n209\n00:10:58.161 --> 00:10:59.187\nNow the way it does that,\n\n210\n00:10:59.187 --> 00:11:02.805\nis that inside most the hardware that's\nactually out there for computers today,\n\n211\n00:11:02.805 --> 00:11:06.965\nyou're gonna find a little hardware based\nmodule, and then they're called a TPM,\n\n212\n00:11:06.965 --> 00:11:12.115\na Trusted Platform Module and that becomes\nthe second factor of authentication.\n\n213\n00:11:12.115 --> 00:11:14.835\nSo when you present a password,\nwhen you present a PIN,\n\n214\n00:11:14.835 --> 00:11:19.155\nwhatever you actually present,\nwhat you also have to have that device, so\n\n215\n00:11:19.155 --> 00:11:24.050\nthat even if Daniel were able to guess my\nportion of it he doesn't have access to\n\n216\n00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:28.800\nthe computer that I'm currently sitting at\nguess what it's not going to work for him.\n\n217\n00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.520\nAnd that's what Windows 10 is really\ntrying to do is to make that second\n\n218\n00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.350\nfactor so normalized and so\nseamless that you and I still think\n\n219\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.620\nall I'm doing is I'm typing in my password\nand this pin number That’s all it’s doing.\n\n220\n00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.315\nWell guess what?\n\n221\n00:11:42.315 --> 00:11:44.980\nIt actually does tie it\nto that one device and\n\n222\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.190\nthat makes it a much stronger possibility.\n\n223\n00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.450\nAnd that’s what Windows 10 is really\ntrying to do to help us out to make sure\n\n224\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.100\nthat we actually are using that\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n225\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.020\nNow the way that we can\ndo that of course and\n\n226\n00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.900\nwe’ve always been able to do multi-factor\nauthentication for a while now.\n\n227\n00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.770\nAnd I’d say even in the last 10\nyears we’ve been able to but\n\n228\n00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.230\nmost people would just bypass\nit because they're saying, well,\n\n229\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.700\nwe're in this secure environment all\nready, it's all ready inside of my domain,\n\n230\n00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.920\nif I know that something else is going on,\nthat's fine.\n\n231\n00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.860\nBut, with Windows 10,\nbecause you're actually seeing it not\n\n232\n00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.030\nonly inside your domain, but\nwith the BYOD, bring your own device.\n\n233\n00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.280\nIt's not BYOB,\nthat's not the same one, is it?\n\n234\n00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:21.990\nBYOD!\n\n235\n00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.450\n>> That's after the party!\n\n236\n00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.960\n>> That's after work, BYOB.\n\n237\n00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.780\nBut BYOD, Bring Your Own Device,\n\n238\n00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.620\nwhat is starting to happen now is that we\nare, we're bringing our own devices, and\n\n239\n00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.620\nthe problem is, well once again,\nit's not actually easy to authenticate.\n\n240\n00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.400\nSo instead they're actually making that\nas part of it instead to help us out.\n\n241\n00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.820\nSo we are starting to see that more and\nmore.\n\n242\n00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.840\nSo what does Windows still\nprovide us the ability to do?\n\n243\n00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.910\nWell, if you are at this point using\ncertificates as your authentication basis\n\n244\n00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.960\nWindows 10 says that's fine,\nthat absolutely works with us but\n\n245\n00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.950\nit still relies on that\nhardware basis as well.\n\n246\n00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.220\nYou still take the certificate and\nyou can actually use that if you\n\n247\n00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.800\nare given the certificate on the key\nfob or part of one of those little\n\n248\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.650\ntiny keys that come from RSA or from one\nof those device companies, perfectly fine.\n\n249\n00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.460\nWindows 10 will actually work fine with\nit, it's designed to integrate in and\n\n250\n00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.490\nyou will actually end up working with it.\n\n251\n00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.200\nBut the way that Windows 10\nreally wants you to use this and\n\n252\n00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.780\nthe way that Microsoft really wants\nyou to go about this is much stronger,\n\n253\n00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.080\nit's what we call using\nthe Microsoft Task Port instead.\n\n254\n00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.570\nNow the Microsoft.\nMicrosoft Passport is very interesting\n\n255\n00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.790\nbecause it really does say you're going\nto use two factor authentication.\n\n256\n00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.060\nThat's it, you're not gonna\nactually use anything less.\n\n257\n00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.160\nIt's gonna be that device,\n\n258\n00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.860\nit's going to be something that you\nknow that will actually make that work.\n\n259\n00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.320\nNow, the way that this actually works for\nus,\n\n260\n00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.220\nit actually makes it a lot more secure,\nand so let me show you what we're talking\n\n261\n00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:52.710\nabout when we start talking about the idea\nof supporting Microsoft Passport.\n\n262\n00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:57.360\nRemember that the problem that we have\nwith the way we authenticate is that\n\n263\n00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.880\nwhen we talk about just basic password,\nthese things are easy to crack.\n\n264\n00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.565\nThey are easy to phish, in other words\nDaniel could probably by buying me a beer.\n\n265\n00:14:06.565 --> 00:14:08.925\nAfter a while beer to talk\nmy password out of me, okay.\n\n266\n00:14:08.925 --> 00:14:11.875\nHe’s fairly good at doing that.\n\n267\n00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:15.055\nSo social engineering will end\nup working after a while when\n\n268\n00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:16.425\nsomething like that happens.\n\n269\n00:14:16.425 --> 00:14:19.015\nSomebody could then steal\nthat password like Daniel.\n\n270\n00:14:19.015 --> 00:14:20.965\nAnd Daniel doesn’t actually\nhave to presented at any time.\n\n271\n00:14:20.965 --> 00:14:25.015\nHe can actually just weighed until\nit’s opportune time for Daniel and\n\n272\n00:14:25.015 --> 00:14:29.510\nthen he can apply it back to some system\ninside of my network if you wanted to and\n\n273\n00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.080\nbe able to get access\ninto those resources.\n\n274\n00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.620\nSo it's open to phishing.\n\n275\n00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.740\nIt's open to what we call replay attacks,\nand\n\n276\n00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.540\nit's open to the idea of some\ntype of security breach.\n\n277\n00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.120\nAnd that's really kinda\nhard factor behind this.\n\n278\n00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.600\nThe very fact is, that if I am\na network administrator, right?\n\n279\n00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.140\nA domain administrator, from my network.\n\n280\n00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.360\nAnd Daniel's able to steal that password.\n\n281\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.560\nWell Daniel what do you have access to?\n\n282\n00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.280\n>> I have the keys to the castle.\n\n283\n00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.020\nI can get access to anything I want.\n\n284\n00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.890\nIf I have that domain admin account\nit just allows me to do just about\n\n285\n00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:00.150\nanything I damn well please.\n\n286\n00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.270\nI can add user accounts,\nadd group accounts,\n\n287\n00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.190\nchange permissions,\ndelete log files to cover up my tracks for\n\n288\n00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.860\nall the nasty little things I've done and\nmess up Ronnie's system.\n\n289\n00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.640\nThat's something we really have\nto worry about as domain admin.\n\n290\n00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.375\nSo, it's not something you wanna\nlet out into the wild as a habit.\n\n291\n00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:20.250\n[LAUGH]\n>> Mm hm, and so, even in the past, right?\n\n292\n00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.260\nBeginning with Windows Vista, what is\nalso ended up happening is that they've\n\n293\n00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.150\nrecommended some, maybe in 2003,\nserver 2003, I think I remember this too,\n\n294\n00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.280\nis that I said, look, as domain admin it's\nperfectly fine that you're a domain admin.\n\n295\n00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.160\nBut you should only use that\naccount if you really need\n\n296\n00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.400\ndomain administrative privileges.\n\n297\n00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.720\nSo Ronnie, if you're a domain admin and\nyou're just using it everyday to do\n\n298\n00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.510\nyour regular things,\ndon't need domain privileges.\n\n299\n00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.650\nThey recommended a second account for\nwell, people like you and\n\n300\n00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:50.230\nme to just have a second account\nthat we log in to every day.\n\n301\n00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.982\nWell, that became a little bit more,\nI don't want to say challenging, but\n\n302\n00:15:52.982 --> 00:15:54.280\na little bit frustrating, right?\n\n303\n00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.776\nTo remember which one that you\nactually were logging in to, so\n\n304\n00:15:56.776 --> 00:15:57.937\na lot of people never did it.\n\n305\n00:15:57.937 --> 00:16:00.199\nSo beginning with things like Vista,\nright?\n\n306\n00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:03.033\nEverybody pretty much\nbecame that standard user.\n\n307\n00:16:03.033 --> 00:16:06.746\nAnd then it gave you the opportunity\nif you actually were part of\n\n308\n00:16:06.746 --> 00:16:11.583\nthe administrative team of that particular\nmachine all you had to do was select Yes\n\n309\n00:16:11.583 --> 00:16:15.365\nor No in the User Account Control and\nthat really did help.\n\n310\n00:16:15.365 --> 00:16:17.835\nIt allowed you to stay logged\nin as Standard User, but\n\n311\n00:16:17.835 --> 00:16:21.125\nwhen you did need to do something that\nactually required domain administrative\n\n312\n00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:24.575\nprivileges, it was then that you\nwould use those log-in credentials,\n\n313\n00:16:24.575 --> 00:16:27.330\nto allow you to elevate what\nyou were doing at that point.\n\n314\n00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.910\nSo that way, you didn't ever have\nto sign in as a domain admin.\n\n315\n00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.910\nYou always just had to sign in\nas regular standard user and\n\n316\n00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.490\ndo everything that you wanted to.\n\n317\n00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:42.250\nSo that actually works as a system, but\ntoday, because of Microsoft Passport they\n\n318\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.200\nrecommend that you actually do think about\nimplementing this inside your network,\n\n319\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.680\nwe're not really talking about that so\nmuch in this class.\n\n320\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.890\nAs you actually head on towards server\nclasses you'll probably talk about it\n\n321\n00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:53.850\neven more.\n\n322\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.150\nBut we do wanna show you some of the\ncomplexities that are actually involved in\n\n323\n00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.916\nthis, and why they recommend that\nyou use this method instead.\n\n324\n00:16:59.916 --> 00:17:02.397\nSo when we take a look at\nthe Microsoft Passport,\n\n325\n00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:05.860\nthe way that it actually begins is\nover here on the left-hand side.\n\n326\n00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:06.600\nOkay?\n\n327\n00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.670\nSo when you take a look at that,\nlet me see if I can zoom that in,\n\n328\n00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.860\njust a little bit more here.\n\n329\n00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.800\nMaybe.\nDoes that stand out\n\n330\n00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.230\njust a little bit more, so\nthe way that this ends up working\n\n331\n00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:22.355\nis notice on the left hand side we\nhave a user and we have his laptop.\n\n332\n00:17:22.355 --> 00:17:23.025\nRight?\n\n333\n00:17:23.025 --> 00:17:27.484\nOn that laptop is a TPM module and\nthat is kind of the key here.\n\n334\n00:17:27.484 --> 00:17:30.133\nWhen you decide that you\nare going to log in and\n\n335\n00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:32.522\nget access to some network credential.\n\n336\n00:17:32.522 --> 00:17:36.274\nWhat ends up happening is that when\nyou present that biometric, so\n\n337\n00:17:36.274 --> 00:17:40.093\nwhether it's finger print scanners,\nany type of biometric that,\n\n338\n00:17:40.093 --> 00:17:44.046\nwhen does biometric foundation or\nframework supports or pin number,\n\n339\n00:17:44.046 --> 00:17:49.310\nthe only thing that you're doing is you\nare unlocking the computer at that point.\n\n340\n00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.180\nNow when I talk about\nunlocking the computer,\n\n341\n00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.770\nI'm not just saying that the login screen,\n\n342\n00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:59.070\nwhat you are really doing at this point\nis that you are accessing the TPM.\n\n343\n00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:04.400\nTelling the TPM to go ahead and\nrelease your public key pair.\n\n344\n00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.810\nThat is what is happening.\n\n345\n00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:06.390\nOkay?\n\n346\n00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.130\nSo that bio-metric pen\nwill end up doing that.\n\n347\n00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.818\nBecause that's associated\nwith your username, pass,\n\n348\n00:18:11.818 --> 00:18:15.620\nI wouldn't say password, but\nyour account your identity somewhere.\n\n349\n00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.860\nWell now when it actually\ndoes that it goes in and\n\n350\n00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.990\ngenerates it because you've also keyed\nthat into what your identity is,\n\n351\n00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.600\nwell that's going to end\nup sending your identity.\n\n352\n00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.460\nSo the user provides his\nidentity over to the,\n\n353\n00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.760\ntoday the language is IDP which stands for\nIdentity Provider.\n\n354\n00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.752\nSo this could be your active domain,\n\n355\n00:18:34.752 --> 00:18:39.078\nyour active directory domain on premises\nthat you have, so when you have that.\n\n356\n00:18:39.078 --> 00:18:43.081\nOr it could be something like Azure Cloud,\ntheir Active Directory as well,\n\n357\n00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:45.219\nit could be google it could be anything.\n\n358\n00:18:45.219 --> 00:18:46.821\nOkay?\nThey actually do support this type\n\n359\n00:18:46.821 --> 00:18:48.030\nof framework.\n\n360\n00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.653\nSo by doing this, what ends up happening\nis that you are actually providing your\n\n361\n00:18:52.653 --> 00:18:56.103\nidentity to whatever identity\nprovider that you need to and\n\n362\n00:18:56.103 --> 00:18:59.432\nalso at the same time you\nare extending your public keys.\n\n363\n00:18:59.432 --> 00:19:02.149\nNow remember that when we talk\nabout public and private key pairs.\n\n364\n00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:03.415\nRight?\nOur public keys,\n\n365\n00:19:03.415 --> 00:19:05.130\nwe can send that anywhere.\n\n366\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.800\nSo that's the portion that's\nalways gonna be exposed.\n\n367\n00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.980\nSo it doesn't matter\nif Daniel is great and\n\n368\n00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.370\nactually sniffing the network\ntraffic out there.\n\n369\n00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.900\nThe only thing he's gonna get is\nexactly what anybody else would get\n\n370\n00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.570\nwhich is the public key pair.\n\n371\n00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:22.400\nWhen it goes over to that identity\nprovider, what is going to happen at this\n\n372\n00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.130\npoint, and this is what Microsoft passport\ndoes for us, is it's going to essentially\n\n373\n00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:33.180\nask my computer to validate that\nthose keys came from this TPM module.\n\n374\n00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.960\nNow, when we start taking a look at that,\nwell, that means what?\n\n375\n00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.580\nThat means that somebody else\non a different hardware device,\n\n376\n00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.110\ncannot just sign in.\n\n377\n00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:46.630\nCannot just take my user name,\ncannot just take my pin number and\n\n378\n00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:50.730\ngo to another machine here and be able to\nsign in and log in however they want to.\n\n379\n00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.800\nIt's not gonna give them access because\nthe only thing that's happening here.\n\n380\n00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.450\nRight?\n\n381\n00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:59.940\nIs that the identity provider is\nessentially asking for a validation.\n\n382\n00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.400\nIn other words, are these keys,\ndo they belong to this TPM?\n\n383\n00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.000\nAnd what happens here on this side is\n\n384\n00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.215\nthat there is a way to prove\nthat it came from that TPM.\n\n385\n00:20:11.215 --> 00:20:15.785\nSo, when these TPMs are created,\nthere is what they call an Attestation,\n\n386\n00:20:15.785 --> 00:20:19.805\nthat's a key on there that says yes,\nthese are my keys.\n\n387\n00:20:19.805 --> 00:20:21.440\nNobody can duplicate that.\n\n388\n00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.916\nSo nobody else can actually\nduplicate that at this point.\n\n389\n00:20:23.916 --> 00:20:27.944\nAnd so if it validates that,\nit just sends that back and\n\n390\n00:20:27.944 --> 00:20:33.737\nsays yes I am validating that this is my\nkeys and at that point then the IDP here.\n\n391\n00:20:33.737 --> 00:20:38.320\nSo regardless of whichever one it is, It\nsends an authentication token saying yes,\n\n392\n00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.739\nyou are authenticated and\n\n393\n00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:44.610\nof course then along with that is the\nauthorization and sends security tokens.\n\n394\n00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:49.400\nAnd windows 10 then can use those security\ntokens now to get access to whatever\n\n395\n00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.820\nresources that are available to whatever\naccount that you've signed into.\n\n396\n00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:58.160\nSo at this point notice that we're not\nreally exchanging anything that's actually\n\n397\n00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.840\nsuper secret here.\n\n398\n00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.740\nThe only thing that we've actually done\nis that we've received these tokens and\n\n399\n00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.640\nthese tokens again are only for\nyour Windows 10 machine.\n\n400\n00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.800\nSo even if Daniel were to be able to\nintercept that token, it doesn't work for\n\n401\n00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.580\nhim, there is no replay attack,\n\n402\n00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:18.140\nbecause it requires the ADA\nstation of the TPM module.\n\n403\n00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:22.060\nSo that's what makes this\nparticular type of factor, or\n\n404\n00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.325\nthis way of doing it, of using\nthe Microsoft Passport a lot better.\n\n405\n00:21:26.325 --> 00:21:30.375\nAnd it's what Windows really wants\nyou to actually be able to use and\n\n406\n00:21:30.375 --> 00:21:32.025\nunderstand when you do this.\n\n407\n00:21:32.025 --> 00:21:35.815\nNow along with this, remember it actually\ndoes support the idea of biometrics.\n\n408\n00:21:35.815 --> 00:21:37.620\nThat's what they want you to do.\n\n409\n00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.960\nAnd in that second factor has to\nbe that device that you're on.\n\n410\n00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.060\nBut you go well Ronnie, what about times\nwhen you don't, when you're not at that\n\n411\n00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.770\nmachine and you still need to\ngain access to network resources?\n\n412\n00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:51.190\nWell, you can tie this in to\nsomething like well, your phone.\n\n413\n00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.700\nSo if you have your mobile phone on you,\nyou can actually create that as being part\n\n414\n00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.110\nof that trusted type of device,\nthat says as long as you're doing it from\n\n415\n00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:01.460\nthat device, or it can provide\nyou a PIN or something like this.\n\n416\n00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.480\nSo you've seen this if\nyou had that Google,\n\n417\n00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.380\none that would allow you to do\nthe two-factor authentication as well.\n\n418\n00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.750\nSo it really works in the same fashion.\n\n419\n00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.380\nSo regardless of what devices you're on,\n\n420\n00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.220\nif you still need to gain access\nto your network resources, and\n\n421\n00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.400\nyou're not at that Windows 10 machine,\nyou're at Daniel's Windows 10 machine.\n\n422\n00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.560\nWell you might have to\nprovide something else.\n\n423\n00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.860\nSo it might be a phone,\nit might be something else.\n\n424\n00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.210\nAnd this is what they\ncall the Passport To Go.\n\n425\n00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.210\nSo I wanna make sure I say that right.\n\n426\n00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.020\nWe have the Microsoft Passport.\n\n427\n00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.055\nIf you're on the device\nthat you're logging into.\n\n428\n00:22:31.055 --> 00:22:31.840\nOkay?\n\n429\n00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.570\nWithout that device, whatever we've\njust talked about doesn't work,\n\n430\n00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:39.100\nunless you actually do use that\npassport to go to validate.\n\n431\n00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.950\nSo you have to have one of those\ntwo factors to be able to work\n\n432\n00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.620\nwith what we're talking about.\n\n433\n00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.870\nSo this is a much stronger method\nof authentication when we do that.\n\n434\n00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:51.540\nNow the passport to go like\nwe said can be that phone or\n\n435\n00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:56.580\nit might be an actual physical device\nlike a USB key, USB download of some sort\n\n436\n00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.260\nthat you have to plug into whatever\ndevice you go to make it work as well.\n\n437\n00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:05.270\nSo by understanding at least the basics of\nthe authentication, the factors that you\n\n438\n00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.740\nnormally have to go through and then you\ncan see why the push with Windows 10\n\n439\n00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:13.560\ntowards Microsoft Passport is so big\nthat this is what's starting to happen.\n\n440\n00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.680\nSo this is a huge part of what\nwe actually are taking a look at\n\n441\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.590\nwhen we start talking about\nMicrosoft authentication.\n\n442\n00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.864\nSo when we start seeing\nit inside of Windows 10,\n\n443\n00:23:22.864 --> 00:23:25.627\nyou'll see that there's gonna\nbe multiple ways that you and\n\n444\n00:23:25.627 --> 00:23:28.839\nI can set this up to make sure that we\nare actually using what we need to.\n\n445\n00:23:28.839 --> 00:23:31.277\n>> Yeah, it's a really good idea\nthat they've started doing this.\n\n446\n00:23:31.277 --> 00:23:33.836\nRight?\nThat they've added the passport feature,\n\n447\n00:23:33.836 --> 00:23:35.120\na very, very nice idea.\n\n448\n00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:35.723\nRight?\n\n449\n00:23:35.723 --> 00:23:40.681\nBecause my computer then becomes\nmy second form of identification.\n\n450\n00:23:40.681 --> 00:23:41.319\nHow smart is that.\n\n451\n00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:41.870\nRight?\n\n452\n00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:46.140\nI'm gonna log in to a computer,\nthis one specifically.\n\n453\n00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.600\nWhy not make it part of that\nauthentication process?\n\n454\n00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.098\nIt says hey I'm only gonna allow people\nto login that I have that passport\n\n455\n00:23:54.098 --> 00:23:55.362\ncombination with.\n\n456\n00:23:55.362 --> 00:23:58.985\nSo you type in a pin together with my key,\nwe come together and\n\n457\n00:23:58.985 --> 00:24:00.562\nI allow authentication.\n\n458\n00:24:00.562 --> 00:24:04.710\nThat way, I don't have to remember a thing\nlike a fob or a lanyard or anything that\n\n459\n00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:08.440\nmight have something on, maybe a USB\nkey to get into the machine itself.\n\n460\n00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.560\nThat's just an extra piece of hardware\nthat's easily forgotten or lost or\n\n461\n00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.990\nstolen, anything like that can happen.\n\n462\n00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.170\nSo I just thought that was\na brilliant move by Microsoft.\n\n463\n00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:22.300\nMake the actual device the second\npart of the authentication.\n\n464\n00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.300\nVery, very easily done.\n\n465\n00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.060\nI mean I'm gonna log into it.\n\n466\n00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.530\nIt's gonna be here in front of me.\n\n467\n00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.050\nJust use that hardware.\n\n468\n00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:32.430\nA very, very nice idea, and\nthen the fact that you can still, well\n\n469\n00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.240\nI'm not going to log into that computer\nspecifically but I still need access.\n\n470\n00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.300\nWell then I can use my smartphone,\nI can use Passport to go,\n\n471\n00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:44.470\nor USB key, to transfer those credentials\nto somewhere else, so I do have now,\n\n472\n00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.540\nobviously that does put us back in\nthe realm of needing something with us.\n\n473\n00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.580\n>> Always.\n>> And not the machine, but\n\n474\n00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.640\nit still gives us that two factor.\n\n475\n00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.850\nAnd usually you're probably not signing\ninto machines that aren't your own,\n\n476\n00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:58.940\nso you won't need that for\nmany different occurrences.\n\n477\n00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.190\nUsually you're just going to be\nsigning into your own computers.\n\n478\n00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.350\n>> We were pretty much laughing about\nthis right before the show came on.\n\n479\n00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.500\nWe started talking about the idea\nthis two factor authentication.\n\n480\n00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.290\nAnd what it came down to, as Daniel and\nI were talking about this,\n\n481\n00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:15.790\nis that what it means is if you can't pry\nthis laptop from my cold dead fingers,\n\n482\n00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:16.920\nI know, I'm misquoting the line.\n\n483\n00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:22.320\nBut if you can't do that, then it doesn't\nmatter if you steal my PIN number or not.\n\n484\n00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:27.140\nYou can steal it but if you can't get this\naway from me, well, it doesn't matter.\n\n485\n00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.610\nSo, you can actually take that, you can go\nto the, oh, I'm gonna log in as Ronnie.\n\n486\n00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.220\nNo, it's just not gonna work.\n\n487\n00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.740\nIt has to rely on that TPM module\nthat's in that device itself.\n\n488\n00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.170\nNow, the other thing that I wanted to\nmention cuz I just looked at my notes and\n\n489\n00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:43.700\nI realized I forgot this too,\nis that what's happening right in\n\n490\n00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.830\nthe background is that it is\ngenerating a certificate, right?\n\n491\n00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:50.440\nThat's really what's going on,\nit's generating key paros for us too.\n\n492\n00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.440\nSo when you don't have an established\npublic key infrastructure, whether it's\n\n493\n00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.940\nin your organization or you're using\na third-party one, you don't have that.\n\n494\n00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.990\nWindows itself will essentially tell,\nwell the TPM to go ahead and\n\n495\n00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:07.190\ngenerate those keys anyway, so it's not\nreally based inside of Windows itself.\n\n496\n00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.700\nWindows is using it as part of what it\nsays I'm gonna use to validate, but\n\n497\n00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.880\nit really is actually secured\neven from somebody actually being\n\n498\n00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.730\nable to do this cuz nobody\ncan hack into that TPM.\n\n499\n00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.450\nSo it does generate on its own if\nyou don't have that third party.\n\n500\n00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:24.240\nBut if you do, Windows actually\nsays I can use that as well.\n\n501\n00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.900\nSo don't sit there and go well, if we\nuse that, we've got to abandon our PKI.\n\n502\n00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.395\nYou don't.\nYou actually can use either or.\n\n503\n00:26:29.395 --> 00:26:32.385\nIt actually will use both if you need to.\n\n504\n00:26:32.385 --> 00:26:35.855\nYou can actually use just a TPM\non your own personal account.\n\n505\n00:26:35.855 --> 00:26:40.115\nAnd then you can use your own company's\nPKI, public key infrastructure,\n\n506\n00:26:40.115 --> 00:26:42.797\nif you actually need access to\nthose network resources instead.\n\n507\n00:26:42.797 --> 00:26:44.687\nSo it is really a great product, and\n\n508\n00:26:44.687 --> 00:26:47.459\nMicrosoft is really pushing\nhard towards this, and\n\n509\n00:26:47.459 --> 00:26:51.809\nI guarantee you're gonna probably see more\nthan one question on this on the exam.\n\n510\n00:26:51.809 --> 00:26:54.927\nSo make sure you pay attention,\nespecially about Microsoft Passport.\n\n511\n00:26:54.927 --> 00:26:56.200\n>> Yeah, awesome stuff.\n\n512\n00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.830\nHopefully you guys are getting\na lot out of this.\n\n513\n00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.890\nI'm looking at Ronnie's notes here, we've\ngot plenty more to talk about when it\n\n514\n00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:05.780\ncomes to authentication and authorization\nusing our Windows 10 devices, but\n\n515\n00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.360\nwe're running out of time so\nwe're gonna have to make a part two.\n\n516\n00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.840\nHopefully we'll see you there.\n\n517\n00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.700\nAs for this episode, thanks for watching.\n\n518\n00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.000\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been

great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.890\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n5\n00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.070\nHere with me, none other than the master\nof disaster himself, mister Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.940\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.370\n>> It is going great.\n\n8\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.550\nAs we get started here,\nwe're taking a look at Windows 10 and\n\n9\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.600\nspecifically at\nauthentication in Windows 10.\n\n10\n00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.200\nWe've already taken a look at a little bit\nabout the use of Microsoft Passport, and\n\n11\n00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.770\ntalking about the basics of\nmultifactor authentication and\n\n12\n00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.200\nwhat Windows 10 is really\ntrying to push us towards.\n\n13\n00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.900\nGetting us away from passwords\nis pretty much the key.\n\n14\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.520\nAnd this episode is a continuation\nof that, as we start seeing more and\n\n15\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.580\nmore what Microsoft is trying\nto head us towards here.\n\n16\n00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.820\nSo, the Microsoft Passport\nis a part of that.\n\n17\n00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.260\nIt's the infrastructure behind\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n18\n00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.980\nBut what is the front end behind that?\n\n19\n00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.360\nWhat is the user going to\nend up expecting or seeing?\n\n20\n00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.110\nWhen they start using something\nlike Microsoft Passport?\n\n21\n00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.540\nWell, where it really begins,\n\n22\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.780\nis gonna be something like\nwe call virtual smart cards.\n\n23\n00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.240\nNow remember,\nI said the term virtual smart cards and\n\n24\n00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.369\nthe reason why I said that,\nis because we talked about smart cards.\n\n25\n00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.274\nAnd smart cards themselves are a great\ndevice as long as people will use them and\n\n26\n00:01:18.274 --> 00:01:19.626\nwill remember them.\n\n27\n00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:23.049\nAnd if they are assigned them,\nthat they will only use that one.\n\n28\n00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.945\nI know that I did some contract teaching a\nfew years ago now, hard to believe it was\n\n29\n00:01:27.945 --> 00:01:32.496\nthat long ago, but I did some contract\nteaching at a government facility.\n\n30\n00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:34.732\nAnd when I did that,\nit was funny because for one reason or\n\n31\n00:01:34.732 --> 00:01:37.247\nanother I didn't get the credentials\nthat I needed, in words,\n\n32\n00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:39.450\nthey didn't issue me\na visitors smart card.\n\n33\n00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.424\nSo one of the team members said,\noh, you can use mine.\n\n34\n00:01:41.424 --> 00:01:45.366\nAnd so the whole week I was there,\nI was using somebody elses smart card and\n\n35\n00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:48.111\nthen at the end of the week,\nit was perfectly fine.\n\n36\n00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:50.271\nI said, oh, I'm glad I didn't\nleave the base without it.\n\n37\n00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:52.268\nHe said, no big deal,\nI've got another one.\n\n38\n00:01:52.268 --> 00:01:54.680\nAnd all of a sudden you're like,\nwhoo, didn't realize that,\n\n39\n00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.809\nthat could actually happen.\n\n40\n00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:58.003\nBut yes,\nmultiple smart cards can be either.\n\n41\n00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:01.845\nAnd what can end up happening then,\nis that what should happen,\n\n42\n00:02:01.845 --> 00:02:05.403\nis you turn in your old one that\nyou're not using anymore and\n\n43\n00:02:05.403 --> 00:02:08.126\nthat of course gets terminated or\ndisabled.\n\n44\n00:02:08.126 --> 00:02:13.070\nNot terminated but simply disabled and\nthen you're only with one smart card.\n\n45\n00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.490\nBut the problem is, again,\nthings like that can happen.\n\n46\n00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.390\nSomebody leaves it in their room, somebody\nleaves it outside, somebody steals it,\n\n47\n00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.420\nwhatever it might be, the very fact is,\nsomething like that can happen and\n\n48\n00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.480\nthat is one of the disasters with\nsmart cards that can happen.\n\n49\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.489\nWhether it's broken,\nwhether they leave it somewhere,\n\n50\n00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.919\nwhether they don't know where it went and\nthey go and assign a new one.\n\n51\n00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.025\nHopefully somebody else on the back\nend will take care of that and\n\n52\n00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:35.158\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n53\n00:02:35.158 --> 00:02:36.188\nBut if it doesn't,\n\n54\n00:02:36.188 --> 00:02:39.895\nthat's where you start having the other\nbreaches that you have in mind.\n\n55\n00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:44.725\nSo instead Microsoft actually does prefer\nyou to use what we call the virtual smart\n\n56\n00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:46.190\ncard instead.\n\n57\n00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.550\nNow, just like what we talked about in\nthe previous episode, where it depends on\n\n58\n00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.140\nthe TPM module, the Trusted Platform\nModule inside of your computers.\n\n59\n00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.790\nThat will itself become\na smart card base for you.\n\n60\n00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.590\nSo it ties your credentials\nto that machine so\n\n61\n00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.270\nthat you can actually use\nit only on that machine.\n\n62\n00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.090\nSo that's what ends up happening and\nthat's really what they want\n\n63\n00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.090\nto push your towards, but\nthe problem that you and I have is simple.\n\n64\n00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.700\nWe know about it, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.620\nAnd we know that it works.\n\n66\n00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.650\nWe know Microsoft actually prefers it.\n\n67\n00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.230\nBut how the heck do we get it to work?\n\n68\n00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.750\nThat is really kinda the key here,\nwhen you start thinking about the idea and\n\n69\n00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.050\nthe use of smart cards.\n\n70\n00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.386\nWell, there's a couple of\nthings that you need to do.\n\n71\n00:03:26.386 --> 00:03:30.733\nOne of them of course is actually figuring\nout where do you go in the policy settings\n\n72\n00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:32.130\nto turn this thing off?.\n\n73\n00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.490\nSo you have to actually get into the local\npolicy settings, if you're only working on\n\n74\n00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.810\nthat Windows machine, or you have to have\ninside of your active directory domain,\n\n75\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.540\ninside a group policy to be\nable to enable that as well.\n\n76\n00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.480\nAnd then there is a command line utility\nthat you have to be able to run to make\n\n77\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.140\nsure that everything is actually going\nto work for you when you start doing it.\n\n78\n00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.860\nSo, in the use of virtual smart cards,\nwhat has to happen at the very beginning\n\n79\n00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.930\nis that you need to be on what we\ncall a domain joined computer.\n\n80\n00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.680\nSo, that actually kind of limits you\nto the use of these smart cards.\n\n81\n00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.150\nBecause it tells you something,\n\n82\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.230\nthat it has to actually have some\ninfrastructure in the background.\n\n83\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.650\nNow we're not setting up that\ninfrastructure in the background.\n\n84\n00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.610\nWhat we're actually doing,\nis showing you the front end of this.\n\n85\n00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.657\nA lot of times when you are supporting\nWindows 10 as a support technician, or\n\n86\n00:04:17.657 --> 00:04:22.091\nas even an administrator, well, you\nhave to know that it does require both.\n\n87\n00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:23.563\nSo let's say that, for\n\n88\n00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:28.000\nexample, we're in a scenario in\nwhich everything else is set up.\n\n89\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.310\nSo a certificate\nthe authorities are set up.\n\n90\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.410\nEverything else is actually in place.\n\n91\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.700\nAnd all that we're supposed to do, is that\nwe actually need to be able to enable\n\n92\n00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.282\nthe use of smart cards on my\ndomain joined Windows 10 computer.\n\n93\n00:04:40.282 --> 00:04:43.430\nThat pretty much the side\nthat we're talking about.\n\n94\n00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.150\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at how we do that, and\n\n95\n00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.690\nthat will kind of help us along.\n\n96\n00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.970\nOn a domain joined computer,\nI need to make sure that I log in.\n\n97\n00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.910\nSo you can tell right here,\nthere it is, my domain credentials.\n\n98\n00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.400\nAnd hopefully I can remember this.\n\n99\n00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.060\nI've made so\nmany passwords for this class,\n\n100\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.390\nit's amazing that I can actually\nremember any one of them overall.\n\n101\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.330\nAnd so once we're here,\nwe need to go ahead and\n\n102\n00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.660\nlaunch up a command prompt\nin the administrative mode.\n\n103\n00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.512\nNow there's multiple ways you can do that,\n\n104\n00:05:08.512 --> 00:05:11.122\nI'm simply gonna select this\nSearch the Web in Windows here.\n\n105\n00:05:11.122 --> 00:05:16.140\nI'm gonna type in cmd for\nthe command prompt to come up.\n\n106\n00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.040\nAnd then I'm gonna run it\nin administrative mode.\n\n107\n00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.190\nWhen I do so at the UAC prompt,\nI'm gonna say, Yes.\n\n108\n00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.900\nAnd to be able to do that, now that's\nthe shortcut that I can mention to you.\n\n109\n00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.110\nIt's not really of help for\nyou on the exam, but\n\n110\n00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.015\nif you are running Windows, a lot of\ntimes most of us would simply do that,\n\n111\n00:05:31.015 --> 00:05:34.810\ntype cmd and then right-click on\nthe icon and run as administrator.\n\n112\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.699\nInstead if you type that in,\nonce you see it in the start menu there in\n\n113\n00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.010\nthe search features, all you have to\ndo is hold down Shift+Ctrl+Enter and\n\n114\n00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.280\nthat will actually launch\nyou into that as well.\n\n115\n00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.600\nSo just another little brief\nthing that can help you out too.\n\n116\n00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.560\nNow once we're actually in here,\nwhat we want to actually be able to do,\n\n117\n00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.590\nis type in tpm,\ncuz that's what we're getting access to.\n\n118\n00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.820\nAnd we're gonna be using\nvirtual smart cards.\n\n119\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.520\nSo it's tpmvsc, for\n\n120\n00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.700\nvirtual smart card, mgr.exe.\n\n121\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.700\nSo this is the tpm virtual\nsmart card manager.\n\n122\n00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.240\nSo, I know it's a little bit long but it\nis something that you do want to get used\n\n123\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.400\nto seeing here if you wanted\nto set this thing up.\n\n124\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.110\nAnd then we want to type\nin the term create and\n\n125\n00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.620\nthen we're gonna give this\nparticular one a name, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.660\nSo I'm just gonna call it,\nlet's say, testvsc, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.990\nSo for a test virtual smart card.\n\n128\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.680\nFrom that point, we need to also\nassociate a pin number with it.\n\n129\n00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.360\nNow, we can create the pin right now or\n\n130\n00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.290\nwhat I'm gonna do is just tell it,\nI wanna create a default pin\n\n131\n00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.670\ncuz we're gonna require a user to\nchange it a little bit later on.\n\n132\n00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.408\nAnd once we have that,\nthen we're gonna actually also\n\n133\n00:06:50.408 --> 00:06:54.220\nneed an adminkey, if I can spell adminkey.\n\n134\n00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.030\nAnd from this point,\nI'm gonna tell it to create a random one.\n\n135\n00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:05.370\nAnd then I'm gonna use the term\ngenerate as what we're gonna do.\n\n136\n00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.810\nSo, that's the entire length of the key.\n\n137\n00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.280\nNow, that actually does matter\nwhen you start taking a look here.\n\n138\n00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.255\nSo, if you wanna do searches on it,\nmake sure you take a look.\n\n139\n00:07:14.255 --> 00:07:17.824\nYou can change this default pin to\nwhatever number that you want to, and\n\n140\n00:07:17.824 --> 00:07:20.755\nmake sure that it actually\ncomes out to whatever you want.\n\n141\n00:07:20.755 --> 00:07:24.404\nBut overall though, by doing this,\nyou can have a default one like 1234 and\n\n142\n00:07:24.404 --> 00:07:27.950\nthen it'll actually allow you to\nchange it a little bit later on.\n\n143\n00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:33.230\nNow, this absently only really\nworks on hardware machines itself\n\n144\n00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.600\nthat support the TPM module.\n\n145\n00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.394\nSo what happens when you run this\nwithout a machine that supports the TPM?\n\n146\n00:07:38.394 --> 00:07:41.720\nWell what you'll see is,\nthat it will actually generate this.\n\n147\n00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.162\nAnd so here's the default PIN and\nI was lying, it wasn't 1234,\n\n148\n00:07:46.162 --> 00:07:49.450\nit was 12345678 instead.\n\n149\n00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.380\nSo notice it actually generates a pin for\nus.\n\n150\n00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.370\nIt says, hey I am now creating that TPM\nsmart card, which is a virtual smart card.\n\n151\n00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.369\nIt says it's initializing\nthe smart card component itself.\n\n152\n00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:02.623\nIt's beginning to create it.\n\n153\n00:08:02.623 --> 00:08:04.539\nAnd then it says it failed to create it.\n\n154\n00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:07.152\nAnd it tells me exactly why\nit failed to create it.\n\n155\n00:08:07.152 --> 00:08:10.617\nBecause it says that\nthe device that is required by\n\n156\n00:08:10.617 --> 00:08:14.173\nthis cryptographic provider\nis not ready for use.\n\n157\n00:08:14.173 --> 00:08:17.438\nAnd the reason why,\nis that in this virtual environment,\n\n158\n00:08:17.438 --> 00:08:19.070\nit doesn't access the TPM.\n\n159\n00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.440\nSo, it's actually saying,\nlook, you can try this.\n\n160\n00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.630\nBut there's no TMP for\nme to generate this number for.\n\n161\n00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.370\nSo you need to be on a computer that\nactually does have a TMP and ready to go.\n\n162\n00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.610\nSo remember that we need to be\non a domain joined computer.\n\n163\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.600\nWe need to be able to run\nthis command right here.\n\n164\n00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.200\nRemember that other things\nare in the background,\n\n165\n00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.870\ninside of your infrastructure\nthat are set up to handle this.\n\n166\n00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.100\nAnd once this thing is run, and\neverything's actually joined,\n\n167\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.450\nwhat will end up happening is,\nthat it will actually end up generating.\n\n168\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.220\nAnd then you'll actually\nhave to enroll this\n\n169\n00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.900\nvirtual smart card into\nthat infrastructure.\n\n170\n00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.960\nAnd there's other things that\nyou have to do after that.\n\n171\n00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.150\nBut overall,\nthis is the important point right here.\n\n172\n00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.210\nSo, once you do this, it may take a little\nbit of time for it to actually finish.\n\n173\n00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.991\nSo it can take several minutes and\nthen you'll actually be told,\n\n174\n00:09:05.991 --> 00:09:07.874\neverything is good and you're ready to go.\n\n175\n00:09:07.874 --> 00:09:11.540\nFrom that point, you would actually\nstart that enrollment process.\n\n176\n00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.920\nNormally it brings you up to a webpage and\n\n177\n00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.410\nyou actually just enroll\nthat particular key.\n\n178\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.710\nAnd from that point, you're ready to\ngo with your virtual smart cards, too.\n\n179\n00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.460\nBut remember that that\nmeans that this machine,\n\n180\n00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.490\nthen, is gonna be registered only\nwith that virtual smart card.\n\n181\n00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.530\nSo, any other place that you use that\nPIN number, it's not gonna work as well.\n\n182\n00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:33.860\nSo you can see why this is the basis\nof something like Microsoft Passport.\n\n183\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.200\nBecause it really does tie\nyou down to that one machine.\n\n184\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.880\nSo it doesn't matter if Daniel\nsteals the PIN, whatever it is.\n\n185\n00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.210\nIf he can't get access to my machine,\nit doesn't work for him.\n\n186\n00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.420\nIt's a really great technique.\n\n187\n00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.620\n>> Right, and then also,\nobviously, the reverse is true.\n\n188\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.530\nIf I only have the machine and\nI do not have the pen.\n\n189\n00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.130\nWell, I am getting a whole lot of nowhere\nbecause those things are tied together.\n\n190\n00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.238\nYou need both forms of authentication\nto be able to log in and\n\n191\n00:09:59.238 --> 00:10:02.361\ngain access to the resources\nthat are built in the machine.\n\n192\n00:10:02.361 --> 00:10:03.998\nSo it is a very, very smart way to go.\n\n193\n00:10:03.998 --> 00:10:05.577\nIt is why we harp on it so much.\n\n194\n00:10:05.577 --> 00:10:09.500\nIt's why we tout its greatness\nof multi-factor authentication.\n\n195\n00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.018\nBecause it is a whole lot more difficult\nto gain unauthorized access to a device\n\n196\n00:10:14.018 --> 00:10:16.350\nthat implements that type of security.\n\n197\n00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.033\nVery cool demonstration Ronnie.\n\n198\n00:10:18.033 --> 00:10:21.841\n>> Yeah, the other thing that we can\nalso take a look at then, of course,\n\n199\n00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:25.900\nis taking a look at the idea of\ndifferent methods that are out there.\n\n200\n00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.160\nSo not only can we use\nsomething like this, okay?\n\n201\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.530\nThis is probably by far the safest.\n\n202\n00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.056\nAgain, I keep using that word,\n\n203\n00:10:32.056 --> 00:10:36.133\nit's probably the more secure of the ones\nthat we're talking about remedially, but\n\n204\n00:10:36.133 --> 00:10:39.723\nthere are other features that are out\nthere that are a little bit more cool.\n\n205\n00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:43.643\nAnd they even implement it as being\na bit more safer than passwords but\n\n206\n00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:46.040\nI'll let you be the judge of that.\n\n207\n00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.150\nSo, the other thing we can do is implement\nwhat we call a picture password instead.\n\n208\n00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.270\nSo let me show you that.\n\n209\n00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.620\nSo, I remember this actually\nwith Windows 8 and 8.1 and\n\n210\n00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.560\nI even used the picture password\nbecause I had a touchscreen,\n\n211\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.290\nan XPS12, that had a nice\ntouchscreen monitor for me.\n\n212\n00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.770\nAnd so, instead of me having to remember a\npassword to be able to type in every time,\n\n213\n00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.176\nall I did is I went to the computer and I\nwas able to actually use that touchscreen.\n\n214\n00:11:09.176 --> 00:11:13.730\nAnd essentially draw a line, a dot, and\na circle something, that I wanna do on\n\n215\n00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.219\nthat picture and that would essentially\nbecome my password on that picture.\n\n216\n00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:22.245\nNow if I'm talking about it like that,\nthat doesn't sound secure at all, Ronnie.\n\n217\n00:11:22.245 --> 00:11:25.950\nIt sounds totally insecure\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n218\n00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.320\nWell, there's been debate about that,\nright?\n\n219\n00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.950\nAt one point Microsoft said no, it’s\nactually even more secure because there\n\n220\n00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.380\nare so many other points and variables\nthat you have to consider instead of just\n\n221\n00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.610\na limited amount of characters\nthat you would type in a password.\n\n222\n00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.980\nBut overall and after time, right?\n\n223\n00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.670\nSo it wasn't too long ago,\nthat as you read security articles,\n\n224\n00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.760\nlike we tend to pick up\nevery once in a while.\n\n225\n00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.260\nYou start seeing where people are saying\nyeah, picture passwords are a bad idea.\n\n226\n00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.210\nBut, Microsoft doesn't tend to\nleave off security features.\n\n227\n00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.350\nThey just tend to ignore them after\na while is what ends up happening.\n\n228\n00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.830\nSo in Windows 10 you can still do this.\n\n229\n00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.406\nSo the way that we get access to that,\n\n230\n00:11:58.406 --> 00:12:01.320\nif we wanted to set up the picture\npassword, we can do it.\n\n231\n00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.600\nNow, it doesn't really work\nthat well with my screen,\n\n232\n00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.590\nsince I don't have a touchscreen setting.\n\n233\n00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.865\nBut overall what we wanna do,\nis when wanna click on Start and\n\n234\n00:12:07.865 --> 00:12:11.830\nwanna go to that link there in\nthe Start menu that says Settings.\n\n235\n00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.029\nI kind of did that really quickly so\nI probably shouldn't have.\n\n236\n00:12:14.029 --> 00:12:15.446\nRight there where it says Settings.\n\n237\n00:12:15.446 --> 00:12:19.346\nAnd once we select that this is what we'll\ncome up with right here under Settings.\n\n238\n00:12:19.346 --> 00:12:23.470\nAnd what we're gonna look for\nis underneath the Accounts icon.\n\n239\n00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.518\nIf I select Accounts,\n\n240\n00:12:24.518 --> 00:12:27.608\nnotice that there are actually some\nof these other accounts and you\n\n241\n00:12:27.608 --> 00:12:31.209\ncan see right now some of these settings\nare managed by our own organization.\n\n242\n00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:36.821\nBut then I can go to Sign-in options,\nand we'll give it a moment and\n\n243\n00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:42.842\nonce I have a sign-in option,\nnotice that I can add a Picture password.\n\n244\n00:12:42.842 --> 00:12:45.466\nSo it says sign into Windows\nusing a favorite photo.\n\n245\n00:12:45.466 --> 00:12:50.887\nIf I click Add, it's right here where it\ntells me what I need to be able to do and.\n\n246\n00:12:50.887 --> 00:12:53.516\nAnd so to make sure it's actually me,\n\n247\n00:12:53.516 --> 00:12:56.850\nI simply type in my lab password and\nthere it is.\n\n248\n00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.280\nIt's showing me what I need\nto be able to do here.\n\n249\n00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.646\nWelcome to your picture's password,\nnew way to protect your touchscreen PC, so\n\n250\n00:13:03.646 --> 00:13:07.839\nme doing it right here is not exactly the\nbest thing but we can at least show you.\n\n251\n00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:10.997\nSo what you have to do,\nis you need to choose a picture, okay?\n\n252\n00:13:10.997 --> 00:13:12.620\nAnd then you draw directly on it.\n\n253\n00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.354\nThey recommend a combination\nof either circling and\n\n254\n00:13:15.354 --> 00:13:18.782\nthen you have a line and you have\nto have a dot of some sort, right?\n\n255\n00:13:18.782 --> 00:13:20.060\nYou can do more than that, but\n\n256\n00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.280\nthose are usually the three\ncombinations that you'd actually do.\n\n257\n00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.810\nSo, I'm gonna choose a picture\nthat I've downloaded here, and\n\n258\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.370\nI just have this football and\nI click Open.\n\n259\n00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.140\nSo there it is.\n\n260\n00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.620\nI now have this bigger football.\n\n261\n00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.610\nNow I'm not gonna be able to do this\nvery easily but what we want to do,\n\n262\n00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.870\nis if I want to use this picture,\nI'm gonna select use this picture.\n\n263\n00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.830\nAnd now notice it says draw\nthree gestures on the picture,\n\n264\n00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.910\nyou can use any combination of\ncircles straight lines and taps.\n\n265\n00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.501\nRemember the size and\nposition in the gesture here.\n\n266\n00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:53.002\nSo, if I actually do,\nlet's say, two lines here,\n\n267\n00:13:53.002 --> 00:14:00.730\nand then I go ahead and I draw\na circle here, and I tap the strings.\n\n268\n00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.660\nAt least I think I tapped the strings,\nthere we go.\n\n269\n00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.620\nI tap the strings, notice that all three\nof them lit up and then I can go ahead and\n\n270\n00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.400\nclick Cancel.\n\n271\n00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.897\nOr I can start all over if I didn't\nremember but once I do that,\n\n272\n00:14:10.897 --> 00:14:12.910\napparently it didn't like that.\n\n273\n00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.430\nSo let me start all over here.\n\n274\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.060\nSo let me draw a line here.\n\n275\n00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.200\nAnd then I'll draw a circle\nhere in the center and\n\n276\n00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.012\nthen I'll do a tap on that string.\n\n277\n00:14:24.012 --> 00:14:26.060\nAnd it says to confirm it again.\n\n278\n00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:31.740\nDraw a line, oops, draw a circle,\nand then a tap and there it goes.\n\n279\n00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.300\nNow, if you actually saw me,\n\n280\n00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.000\nit doesn't look like I actually\ndrew the exact same thing.\n\n281\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.420\nIt actually just knows from\nthe way that you're doing it,\n\n282\n00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.760\nthat you're pretty much close\nto what ends up happening there.\n\n283\n00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.078\nSo I'm gonna select Finish.\n\n284\n00:14:43.078 --> 00:14:46.719\nNow that it's congratulated me, it's gonna\ntake a moment and try and generate and\n\n285\n00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:48.830\ndo everything else that it needs to.\n\n286\n00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.170\nNow once we have that picture password,\nwhat it actually ends up\n\n287\n00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.730\nmeaning there if it actually just\nlocked up my computer more than likely.\n\n288\n00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.490\nBut, it's just taking a moment to\nmake sure that everything's actually\n\n289\n00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.420\nworking there.\n\n290\n00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.730\nSo, if everything is actually working,\nthen my log in screen,\n\n291\n00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:06.130\nmy lock screen,\nshould turn into this football and\n\n292\n00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:10.290\nfrom that point if I had a touchscreen,\nit would actually end up working for me.\n\n293\n00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.400\nNow the problem is,\nI don't really have a touchscreen but\n\n294\n00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.730\nlet's see what ends up happening here.\n\n295\n00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.710\nSo I'm simply going to\nlog off at this point.\n\n296\n00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.570\nLet me Sign out.\n\n297\n00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.530\nGuess that's the new term.\n\n298\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:23.810\nA newer term is Sign out.\n\n299\n00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.130\nIt's not log off anymore or log in.\n\n300\n00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.160\nIt's always sign in or sign out.\n\n301\n00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.820\nSo it's taking a little bit of\ntime to actually sign out here.\n\n302\n00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.810\nAnd once everything sets up,\nthat's what we should end up seeing.\n\n303\n00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.762\nIs that's the screen that's gonna allow\nme to log back in if I can actually do\n\n304\n00:15:36.762 --> 00:15:38.840\neverything correctly on that.\n\n305\n00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.390\nThat's really where that\npicture password comes in.\n\n306\n00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.660\nNow, when we start talking about it you\ngo, wow, but I showed it to you, right?\n\n307\n00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.560\nIf you actually had a picture\nthat had multiple points\n\n308\n00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.430\nthat really wasn't focused on one object,\nmore than likely,\n\n309\n00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.860\nyou'd be a little bit more hard-pressed if\nwe made it a little bit more difficult.\n\n310\n00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.126\nBut the very fact is, especially on\ntouchscreens, what you'll notice is,\n\n311\n00:15:58.126 --> 00:15:59.543\nthat there are oils on your hand.\n\n312\n00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:03.451\nYou actually continue to use that same\npattern over again, it doesn't take long\n\n313\n00:16:03.451 --> 00:16:06.624\nbefore somebody can kind of see\nwhat pattern you've been using.\n\n314\n00:16:06.624 --> 00:16:08.449\nAnd what will end up\nhappening after awhile,\n\n315\n00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:11.581\nis that it's just not going to work\nthe way that you think it's going to work.\n\n316\n00:16:11.581 --> 00:16:13.733\nAnd that's where people are saying that,\n\n317\n00:16:13.733 --> 00:16:17.670\nhey, picture passwords are not as\nsecure as you think that they are.\n\n318\n00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.450\nSo even though I did use it,\n\n319\n00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.990\nI kinda knew that I was the only one that\nwas ever really gonna touch that computer.\n\n320\n00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.080\nI wasn't going to leave it somewhere\nwhere I didn't know about.\n\n321\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.060\nSo at this point,\n\n322\n00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.340\nthat's what would end up happening when\nyou start talking about picture password.\n\n323\n00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.430\nI don't see a lot of people really saying,\nthat's the way that I want to go.\n\n324\n00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.653\nBut it was a neat little tool and\ntechnology, but only if\n\n325\n00:16:36.653 --> 00:16:41.124\nyou have touchscreen PC's or touchscreen\nlaptops is it really even viable.\n\n326\n00:16:41.124 --> 00:16:45.691\n>> Yeah and the fact that Windows 10 is\nmeant for also like Surface type devices\n\n327\n00:16:45.691 --> 00:16:49.495\ntablets and smartphones they\nhave Windows 10 mobile as well.\n\n328\n00:16:49.495 --> 00:16:54.118\nSo it will correlate to that, but again it\ngoes back to that old phone hackers trick\n\n329\n00:16:54.118 --> 00:16:55.793\nif I could steal your phone and\n\n330\n00:16:55.793 --> 00:17:00.230\nkind of look at it from the angle the oils\non your finger They leave those marks.\n\n331\n00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:05.220\nI might not know exactly which, I can see\nwhere the dot it, I can see where the line\n\n332\n00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.810\nis, I can see where the circle is, and\nthat's just gonna take me a few times\n\n333\n00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:12.630\nbefore I actually figure out which\ncombination it is that you're using.\n\n334\n00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.050\nSo yeah,\nis there some insecurity with it, yeah.\n\n335\n00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:20.290\nBut there's also some great ease of\nuse when it comes to mobile devices,\n\n336\n00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.340\nI really find that to be a handy item.\n\n337\n00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:28.250\nOf course, I wouldn't use it to\nsecure my Enterprise networks, right?\n\n338\n00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:32.330\nNot the way you're gonna go have a bunch\nof Enterprise users out there swiping at\n\n339\n00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.000\ntheir screens.\n\n340\n00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.478\nWe're probably gonna stick with\nthe good old-fashioned type of logins,\n\n341\n00:17:35.478 --> 00:17:35.999\nright Ronnie?\n\n342\n00:17:35.999 --> 00:17:36.880\n>> No doubt.\n\n343\n00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.911\nYou know, we do have a good question in\nour chat room as well that asks about\n\n344\n00:17:40.911 --> 00:17:42.731\nthe very fact, is there a way, or\n\n345\n00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:46.140\ncan virtual smart cars be\nused with multiple domains.\n\n346\n00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.950\nYou can actually use it that way.\n\n347\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.350\nRemember that what has to happen, right,\n\n348\n00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.000\nis that you'll actually end up\ngenerating another certificate.\n\n349\n00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.540\nThat will actually only be for\nthat domain and\n\n350\n00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.470\nthe way that Windows 10 works with\nthat is that it keeps it stores in\n\n351\n00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:01.060\nseparate containers as well so they can\nbe used with separate domains here.\n\n352\n00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.510\nYou won't be able to use them\nsimultaneously of course but\n\n353\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.130\nit does know to pick\nthe different certificate if it\n\n354\n00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.140\nneeds to to log into that new\ndomain as you actually do switch.\n\n355\n00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.680\nThe different domains\nI should say instead.\n\n356\n00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.977\nWe've been hoping that the actual log\nin would actually finish at this point,\n\n357\n00:18:18.977 --> 00:18:19.701\nyeah it has.\n\n358\n00:18:19.701 --> 00:18:22.233\nSo let's go ahead and try here.\n\n359\n00:18:22.233 --> 00:18:26.239\nSo now you actually see that my lock\nscreen was actually just the simple one\n\n360\n00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:29.856\nthat was before and I just simply\nclick on it and the screen went up so\n\n361\n00:18:29.856 --> 00:18:32.220\nnow here is my particular sign in.\n\n362\n00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.560\nAnd so, if I remember right,\nI actually drew a line down here,\n\n363\n00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.460\nI drew a circle here and then it was\non this one that I click and you\n\n364\n00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.930\ncan see that it's now logging me back in,\nor it's gonna reject me if I did it wrong.\n\n365\n00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.640\nSo it'll give you a couple of attempts,\nand there it is.\n\n366\n00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.970\nI was able to actually log back in.\n\n367\n00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.730\nI'm actually kind of happy the reason why\nis it's very difficult to do that with\n\n368\n00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.980\na touchpad or a track pad or.\n\n369\n00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.670\nIt's very difficult to do it if you\ndon't have a touch screen at all.\n\n370\n00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.880\nSo when you start seeing stuff like\nthis and you're like Ronnie, and\n\n371\n00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.100\nyou're sweating a little bit more.\n\n372\n00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:05.220\nBecause sometimes it doesn't work out\nthe way I think it's gonna work out and\n\n373\n00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.330\nso you will see stuff like that.\n\n374\n00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.230\nNow the next method that we\nwant to show you of course\n\n375\n00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:14.660\nis the idea of using biometrics\nwith your Windows 10 machine.\n\n376\n00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.370\nThis one is a little bit tricky.\n\n377\n00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:20.750\nNow the reason why I say that is that when\nyou have everything built into the device\n\n378\n00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.920\nsuch as your laptop biometric\nlike a fingerprint scanner or\n\n379\n00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.290\nanything It works perfectly fine and\n\n380\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.390\nall the things show up the way that\nyou think that they're gonna show up.\n\n381\n00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.650\nBut when you don't,\nthe things don't show up.\n\n382\n00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.300\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n383\n00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.830\nWhen I started talking about biometrics,\n\n384\n00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.700\nremember it's gonna be\nusing some type of scanner.\n\n385\n00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.464\nAnd what I have right here is just\na simple finger print scanner is what we\n\n386\n00:19:42.464 --> 00:19:46.370\nare going to be using as the device,\nand I've got it unplugged right now.\n\n387\n00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.786\nThe reason why is I wanted to\nshow you what it looks like when\n\n388\n00:19:49.786 --> 00:19:53.150\nyou don't actually have\na biometric device plugged in.\n\n389\n00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.580\nAnd so it says,\nyou need to implement biometrics.\n\n390\n00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.800\nWell this is what you\nactually end up seeing.\n\n391\n00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.140\nSo, in my Windows computer, I'm on\na domain joined computer at this point.\n\n392\n00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.400\nIt can be any of them,\n\n393\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.762\nthis doesn't necessarily have\nto be a domain joined machine.\n\n394\n00:20:05.762 --> 00:20:08.730\nBut I'm going to select settings again and\n\n395\n00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.520\ninside of settings I'm going\nto go back to accounts.\n\n396\n00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:18.230\nSo when you actually have an option to\nsign in I'm going to select sign-in\n\n397\n00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:23.660\noptions, and\nit is over here on the right-hand side,\n\n398\n00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:28.200\nyou can see where it actually\nsays I can choose a password, or\n\n399\n00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.360\na PIN number, or\na picture password, as well.\n\n400\n00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.260\nI'm gonna select remove right now,\nbecause we don't need that one.\n\n401\n00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.720\nAnd let it simply remove it in a moment.\n\n402\n00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.150\nBut notice that I don't see anything for\nbiometrics here.\n\n403\n00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.040\nNow Daniel, you would think that if\nWindows 10 supported biometrics,\n\n404\n00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.970\nit would just show up, right?\n\n405\n00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.985\nWell, of course,\nnotice it doesn't show up at all.\n\n406\n00:20:49.985 --> 00:20:55.000\nAs I scanned down through here, there's no\noption that show up for it so here it is.\n\n407\n00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.200\nI'm kind of lost.\n\n408\n00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.050\nI don't know exactly how I'm\ngoing biometrics to work.\n\n409\n00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.530\nIf I can't even find the setting.\n\n410\n00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.770\nThe strange thing is Windows\ntries to be helpful about this.\n\n411\n00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:09.610\nSo if I use this find a setting, and\nI type in let's say, fingerprint.\n\n412\n00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:10.850\nOop, if I can spell print.\n\n413\n00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:11.640\nHow's that?\n\n414\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.340\nFingerprint here, and\ntell it to do a search.\n\n415\n00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:18.100\nAfter a while,\nat least it did a little bit earlier here,\n\n416\n00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.530\nit should show where it\nsays set of fingerprint.\n\n417\n00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.230\nAnd all of the sudden,\nyou actually have that option showing up.\n\n418\n00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.330\nAnd what it leads you back\nto is this same place, and\n\n419\n00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:29.410\nthe problem is that you don't\nhave a fingerprint option here.\n\n420\n00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.650\nAnd the reason why you don't is that,\nWindows is really good at this.\n\n421\n00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.440\nIt's not going to show up until you have\na device that's actually right there,\n\n422\n00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.650\nready to work.\n\n423\n00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.150\nSo it's very context-specific.\n\n424\n00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.300\nSo what happens when you actually\ndo plug in a biometric device?\n\n425\n00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.180\nLet me go ahead and close this out.\n\n426\n00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.360\nAnd now I'm gonna take that\nsingle fingerprint reader.\n\n427\n00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.120\nThis one's a little bit sensitive on\nthe oils that we leave behind on it.\n\n428\n00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.410\n>> And Ronnie you're a greasy beast.\n\n429\n00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.570\n>> I am for one reason or another.\n\n430\n00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.021\nThat's exactly what ends\nup happening here and\n\n431\n00:21:58.021 --> 00:22:00.113\nsee if I can actually plug that thing in.\n\n432\n00:22:00.113 --> 00:22:04.223\nAnd in a moment it's gonna ask\nme if I want to actually connect\n\n433\n00:22:04.223 --> 00:22:05.603\nthis thing and I do.\n\n434\n00:22:05.603 --> 00:22:10.790\nI need to connect this to client one and\nclick okay.\n\n435\n00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:16.330\n>> And so now this machine is actually\ngoing to be loading in all the drivers for\n\n436\n00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.310\nthis fingerprint reader,\nand that is actually key.\n\n437\n00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.010\nMost of the time you probably\nwon't deal with this too often,\n\n438\n00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.125\nthis one's actually designed for\nat least for our display here.\n\n439\n00:22:25.125 --> 00:22:26.195\nSo it works over USB.\n\n440\n00:22:26.195 --> 00:22:27.655\nIt's simple to find.\n\n441\n00:22:27.655 --> 00:22:29.325\nIt actually works fairly well.\n\n442\n00:22:29.325 --> 00:22:32.925\nSo once everything is actually loaded up\nwhat we'll end up seeing in that settings\n\n443\n00:22:32.925 --> 00:22:37.185\nplace is that we will now see\nsomething that we call Windows hello,\n\n444\n00:22:37.185 --> 00:22:38.795\nis what this is about.\n\n445\n00:22:38.795 --> 00:22:44.765\nWhenever you hear Windows hello that is\npart of that Windows biometric framework.\n\n446\n00:22:44.765 --> 00:22:48.180\nIt's really what they want you\nto actually be able to use\n\n447\n00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.530\nwhen you start talking about it.\n\n448\n00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.900\nBut at this point we're really just\nsetting up the idea of just that\n\n449\n00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.760\nfingerprint reader instead.\n\n450\n00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.050\nIt's gonna take a few moments here,\nbut let me go back and\n\n451\n00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.580\nsee if the settings\nare already showing up.\n\n452\n00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:58.230\nActually look.\n\n453\n00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.800\nIt looks like it's done.\n\n454\n00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.740\nNow let me put on my glasses so I can see.\n\n455\n00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.059\nI clicked on the start buttons, settings.\n\n456\n00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:10.130\nAnd accounts and now this time\nwhen I select sign in options\n\n457\n00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.620\nyou'll actually see a little bit more,\nor at least I think you will.\n\n458\n00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.520\nWell, I am lying to you.\n\n459\n00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.150\nIt should actually be right here.\n\n460\n00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:18.330\nLet me see it.\n\n461\n00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:24.243\nSo what normally happens here is that you\nwould see the actual sign in options.\n\n462\n00:23:26.229 --> 00:23:28.980\nOh there it is, it just took a moment.\n\n463\n00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.500\nNow all of a sudden you actually\nsee where it says Windows Hello\n\n464\n00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.160\nis now actually ready to go.\n\n465\n00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.820\nIt takes a little bit of time it's a\nlittle bit scary at the beginning because\n\n466\n00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.800\nyou're like it's supposed\nto be showing up.\n\n467\n00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.180\nBut it does actually show up you just\nhave to be a little bit more patient\n\n468\n00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:43.880\nwhich I am not.\n\n469\n00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.760\n>> Yeah you got to wait for those\ncomputers to compute from time to time,\n\n470\n00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.460\nthey're not on our timetable,\nand that is for sure.\n\n471\n00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.500\nBut this is pretty cool.\n\n472\n00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.975\n>> It is.\n>> Now that we have this installed its\n\n473\n00:23:53.975 --> 00:23:57.479\ndetective that the finger print scanner is\n>> Actually connected,\n\n474\n00:23:57.479 --> 00:23:58.505\nit's ready to be used.\n\n475\n00:23:58.505 --> 00:24:00.270\nNow all I've got to do is set it up,\nright?\n\n476\n00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.830\n>> You do, and this is where you have\nto being to pay attention again.\n\n477\n00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:04.870\nDon't get me wrong,\n\n478\n00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.300\nI know you're paying attention to every\nword that Daniel and I are saying.\n\n479\n00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.349\nI know you're hooked on\nevery single word of it.\n\n480\n00:24:09.349 --> 00:24:12.679\nIf you're getting ready for the exam\nyou do want to pay attention here,\n\n481\n00:24:12.679 --> 00:24:16.176\nbecause sometimes it does matter what\nHas to be done in the right order, and\n\n482\n00:24:16.176 --> 00:24:17.023\nthat's the key.\n\n483\n00:24:17.023 --> 00:24:19.560\nSo the good thing is Windows\nactually tells you that.\n\n484\n00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.870\nSo if you're going to be\nsetting up Windows Hello,\n\n485\n00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:25.100\nwhich essentially is the bio-metrics here,\nnotice it tells you you\n\n486\n00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:29.470\nmust set up the PIN before you\ncan enroll in Windows Hello.\n\n487\n00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.280\nNow Daniel, it says it in red letters.\n\n488\n00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.960\nIt says, you must set up a PIN.\n\n489\n00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.800\n>> So it's obviously optional.\n\n490\n00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.650\n>> Yeah, it's obviously optional.\n\n491\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.450\n>> If you want to.\n\n492\n00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.140\n>> Yeah, at this point,\nyou've got to realize that\n\n493\n00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.060\nif there is an order to setting this up,\nfirst of all you have to have a PIN.\n\n494\n00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.612\nNow, you might be wondering,\nI'm going to be using bio-metrics,\n\n495\n00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:50.260\nwhy the heck do I need a PIN?\n\n496\n00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.100\nJust in case you have\na flaky bio-metric scanner.\n\n497\n00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.650\nEvery once in a while it does happen.\n\n498\n00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.290\nThis one's not flaky, it could be\nme that's flaky as I set it up.\n\n499\n00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.870\nAnd also I start trying to use\nthe fingerprint reader, it's not working.\n\n500\n00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.270\nAnd so what I need,\nI need a backup option.\n\n501\n00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.730\nAnd that's why they're asking us for\na PIN here.\n\n502\n00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.330\nSo what I need to do is I need to go\nout and click add and notice that\n\n503\n00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:14.360\nit's grayed out, so if this is grayed out\nmore than likely you haven't setup a PIN.\n\n504\n00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.130\nI'm going to click add,\nand then, from here,\n\n505\n00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.782\nit's going to ask me\nto verify my password.\n\n506\n00:25:21.962 --> 00:25:24.585\nAnd once I do that,\nit's going to ask me for a PIN number.\n\n507\n00:25:28.228 --> 00:25:32.610\nNow, on this PIN number, you don't have to\nmake up something crazy, you really don't.\n\n508\n00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:36.670\nBecause this pin number is never\ngoing to go outside of this computer.\n\n509\n00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:39.420\nSo remember that all the pin's\nreally doing is saying,\n\n510\n00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.930\nall right TPM get ready to\nsend your public keys out and\n\n511\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.070\nget ready to actually be\nable to validate those keys.\n\n512\n00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.320\nThat's all it's doing.\n\n513\n00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.720\nSo when we do something like this, that's\npretty much what it's talking about here.\n\n514\n00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.260\nSo we have that, and once that's set up,\n\n515\n00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.500\nnow notice that we have the option\nhere to set up the fingerprint reader.\n\n516\n00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.660\nSo I simply click on setup and\nthen it says welcome to Windows Hello.\n\n517\n00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.510\nYour device just got more personal.\n\n518\n00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.950\nSay goodbye to entering\ncomplex passwords and\n\n519\n00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.560\nstart using Windows Hello\nto unlock your device.\n\n520\n00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.720\nWell that's very friendly, yeah.\n\n521\n00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.020\nVerify your identity,\n\n522\n00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.230\neven buy things in the Windows Store\nby using your fingerprint.\n\n523\n00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:14.580\nSo that's a great idea.\n\n524\n00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.670\nGo ahead and get started.\n\n525\n00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.670\nAnd now it's going to say hey,\nhow do I know this is you?\n\n526\n00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:20.320\nAnd there it is.\n\n527\n00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.210\nNow at this point you simply\nfollow the directions.\n\n528\n00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.040\nOops, it says it disconnected.\n\n529\n00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:25.810\nLet me see here.\n\n530\n00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.080\nFor one reason or another.\n\n531\n00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:27.660\nDisconnected.\n\n532\n00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.658\nLet me see if I can do that again.\n\n533\n00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.090\nSo that's where it actually\ndid get a little bit flaky.\n\n534\n00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:39.010\nIt didn't like the way that\nthe USB got positioned.\n\n535\n00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.600\nWell I should do that\none more time at least.\n\n536\n00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.660\nFor good measure.\n\n537\n00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.830\nYeah. [LAUGH] >> Tell me about it.\n\n538\n00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:47.360\n>> Just to make sure all the folks at\nhome really understand how this works.\n\n539\n00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.110\n>> So I've got to actually do that, and\n\n540\n00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.730\nnow it's going to ask me\nto scan my fingerprint.\n\n541\n00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.040\nAnd what should start happening\nif it actually is working,\n\n542\n00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.010\nhere, is that I simply scan this.\n\n543\n00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.090\nSo now it's actually all set.\n\n544\n00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.720\nIt took a few times before we\nactually got everything done.\n\n545\n00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.630\nAnd that's what's going to have to happen.\n\n546\n00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.640\nAnd then it actually asks me if I\nwant to enroll another fingerprint.\n\n547\n00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.090\nThat'd be silly if I did [LAUGH].\n\n548\n00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.900\nAnd if I wanted to enroll another one,\nbut yes, normally you would actually\n\n549\n00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.540\nenroll a couple of them,\nis what you want to make sure that you do.\n\n550\n00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.790\nFrom this point,\nyou simply click close, and\n\n551\n00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:24.570\nnow everything is actually ready to go and\nset up on this fingerprint reader.\n\n552\n00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:30.360\nSo if now, I log off again, let me\nsee if I can log off here, sign off.\n\n553\n00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.004\nSign out.\nSee,\n\n554\n00:27:31.004 --> 00:27:34.270\nI'm going to remember that terminology\nat some point in the future, but\n\n555\n00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.540\napparently not today.\n\n556\n00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.400\nSo once everything actually signs out,\nwhat should happen then is it gives me\n\n557\n00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.830\noptions that should come up when we're\nactually back and ready to log back in.\n\n558\n00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:47.010\nNow, the way that you actually know that\neverything's actually working the way that\n\n559\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.190\nit needs to, right,\nis it will actually give you options.\n\n560\n00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.720\nIt'll tell you what\nare the sign-in options and\n\n561\n00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.400\nyou just choose the one that\nlooks like a partial fingerprint.\n\n562\n00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:57.050\nAnd once you do that, if you do happen\nto actually use the scanner and\n\n563\n00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:01.500\nit works, you end up getting a little\ntiny smiley face that will pop up\n\n564\n00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.520\nthat will tell you that\neverything's actually okay.\n\n565\n00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.420\nI know that there's a proper name for\n\n566\n00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.430\nthat little icon that will show up, but\nit will do that same thing for you.\n\n567\n00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:10.630\nSo you'll actually be able to use that.\n\n568\n00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:14.220\nNow it's actually taking a little bit of\ntime signing out here, but overall though,\n\n569\n00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.615\nonce So everything was\nactually done at that point,\n\n570\n00:28:16.615 --> 00:28:20.365\nyou should be ready to go with your\nfingerprint and then log back in.\n\n571\n00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:22.435\nSo when we start talking\nabout bio-metrics,\n\n572\n00:28:22.435 --> 00:28:24.065\nwe can do something like that.\n\n573\n00:28:24.065 --> 00:28:26.665\nNow you can of course also\ndo that with other things,\n\n574\n00:28:26.665 --> 00:28:30.130\nsuch as your facial recognition and\nwhatever else it is,\n\n575\n00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.370\nat least that's the basics of what were\ntalking about in terms of bio-metrics.\n\n576\n00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:36.850\nAnd when everything's done here\nwe'll actually try and log back in.\n\n577\n00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:37.650\nYup.\n\n578\n00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.600\n>> Yeah, not every company is so\n\n579\n00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:45.430\nfortunate to have a facial recognition\nhardware built into all their machines.\n\n580\n00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:49.240\nThey might be able to use a webcam\nlike that sometimes, right, Ronnie?\n\n581\n00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.030\n>> It's very possible,\nand we'll talk about that\n\n582\n00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:56.500\nwhen we start talking about the idea\nof using the proper Windows hello.\n\n583\n00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.720\nEven though we could do that in the past\nwith some of the bio-metrics and\n\n584\n00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:04.810\nthe facial recognition hardware then,\nWindows 10 is a little bit different.\n\n585\n00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:09.770\nThat's because what they're talking about\nis actually proof of liveness and when\n\n586\n00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.850\nwe get in to that a little bit deeper, but\nthat's actually going to need to be done\n\n587\n00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:17.270\nfor a different segment, because there's a\nlittle bit more for us to discuss on that.\n\n588\n00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:21.040\nBut we're just waiting at this\npoint to see if I can log back in.\n\n589\n00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:21.990\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right so\n\n590\n00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:26.630\nmy machine has now logged off and now\nI'm actually back at the sign in screen.\n\n591\n00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.830\nAnd so when we take a look at it,\nnotice it looks regular and\n\n592\n00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.190\nthen actually now it changes,\ninstead of a password,\n\n593\n00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.400\nit tells me I can enter a pin number\nright here, which is perfectly fine, and\n\n594\n00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.858\nthat's probably what will end up having\nto happen, but let's see what happens.\n\n595\n00:29:37.858 --> 00:29:39.960\nI'm going to select sign in options, and\n\n596\n00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.175\nnow I have a key,\nI have this fingerprint here.\n\n597\n00:29:43.175 --> 00:29:47.625\nSo, this actually, gives me the idea\nof entering a password, fingerprint, or\n\n598\n00:29:47.625 --> 00:29:49.485\nI can use that pin number.\n\n599\n00:29:49.485 --> 00:29:50.025\nLet's go ahead and\n\n600\n00:29:50.025 --> 00:29:55.120\ntry our incredible luck, Daniel,\nat actually using this fingerprint reader.\n\n601\n00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.570\nSo if everything works fine i should just\nsimply be able to take my fingerprint and\n\n602\n00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:02.950\nswipe and it should work.\n\n603\n00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:07.440\nAnd so after awhile though if this doesn't\nend up working the good thing is we did\n\n604\n00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:12.369\nend up adding in a PIN\nnumber to this process.\n\n605\n00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:17.028\nNow for one reason or another,\nit is not working, we will do that.\n\n606\n00:30:20.186 --> 00:30:23.160\nSo there it goes, so\nit actually timed out, oh,\n\n607\n00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.720\nlook it actually does look like it is,\nnope, it did not.\n\n608\n00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.150\nSee, it kind of rejected me at that point.\n\n609\n00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:33.210\nSo the good thing is it will reject you,\nif If somebody else is trying to do\n\n610\n00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:37.690\nthis and it's not working out, I'm going\nto try just one or two more times here.\n\n611\n00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.380\nSo every once in a while\nyou just kind of catch it.\n\n612\n00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:44.400\nAnd if it works you'll actually see\na little smiley face in-between there.\n\n613\n00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.810\nAnd it just doesn't look like it's\nactually allowing me to do it.\n\n614\n00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:49.310\nAnd, more than likely,\nit's because I rushed the process.\n\n615\n00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.920\nAnd even though it took the fingerprint,\n\n616\n00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.890\nit's not taking it now, no matter what\nangle I try and slide my finger in at.\n\n617\n00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.030\nSo I'll try to do it as\nnatural as possible.\n\n618\n00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:01.340\nSo if that doesn't end up working,\nlike it's not working on mine,\n\n619\n00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.630\nI simply select the PIN number,\nand I type in my PIN number.\n\n620\n00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:06.260\nAnd there it is.\n\n621\n00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.330\nI'm back in.\n\n622\n00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:11.410\nWhat it might mean is I have to go\nback and re register my fingerprint.\n\n623\n00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:13.410\nGet that process started all over again,\n\n624\n00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.460\nwhich you don't really\nwant to see anyways.\n\n625\n00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.820\nOverall, that's some of\nthe process that you'd have\n\n626\n00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.050\nwhen you start talking\nabout using bio-metrics,\n\n627\n00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:26.840\nit is a great way to get us away from\nthose incredibly complex passwords or even\n\n628\n00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:30.625\njust regular passwords that we are just\nnot sure if we should be using anymore.\n\n629\n00:31:30.625 --> 00:31:35.080\nBio-metrics, virtual smart cards,\na great feature for us to have access to.\n\n630\n00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.180\n>> Very, very cool stuff.\n\n631\n00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.480\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed that,\nI know it's really cool to be able to see\n\n632\n00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.830\nthat the fact that you can grab these\nthird party pieces of hardware,\n\n633\n00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:47.090\nadd them to your machine, and Windows\n10 integrates with that just natively.\n\n634\n00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.710\nYou don't have to do a bunch\nof crazy configurations.\n\n635\n00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:53.333\nBasically, go in there, create your PIN,\nand then say, you know what, I want to use\n\n636\n00:31:53.333 --> 00:31:57.190\na bio-metric device, and it allows you to\ngo ahead and start setting those settings.\n\n637\n00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.410\nSo that you can implement\nthe device in your logins.\n\n638\n00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:01.610\nVery, very cool stuff Ronnie.\n\n639\n00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:03.420\nThanks, prescient\nthe demonstrations today.\n\n640\n00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.640\n>> No problem.\n>> Have we forgotten anything guess what?\n\n641\n00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.580\n>> We have another part\nthat we’ve got to come to.\n\n642\n00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.780\nWe still have a little more to talk\nabout in terms of authentication\n\n643\n00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:14.650\nwhen we talk about the idea of what\nWindows Hello really does mean for\n\n644\n00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:17.340\nus, the fullest sense of it,\nso that we really\n\n645\n00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.210\nunderstand what we're actually walking\ninto when we start talking about\n\n646\n00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:23.620\nthe nature of the way that bio-metrics\nis meant to be done in Windows 10.\n\n647\n00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.220\n>> That's right, so guess what people?\n\n648\n00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.360\nThat means we're going to\nhave a part three on this,\n\n649\n00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.440\nits a lot of good information so\nhopefully we'll see you there.\n\n650\n00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.480\nThanks for watching signing off for IT\npro TV, I've been your host Daniel Lowry,\n\n651\n00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.193\n>> And I'm Ronny

another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.690\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n5\n00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.370\nWith me here today is my\ngood friend Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.160\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.425\n>> It is going great today.\n\n8\n00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.180\nIt's another great day to be right\nhere in the studio cuz we're\n\n9\n00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.660\ntaking a look at more Windows 10 content.\n\n10\n00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.490\nConfiguring Windows 10 devices.\n\n11\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.730\nAnd what we want to talk about today of\ncourse is the idea of authorization and\n\n12\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.740\nauthentication.\n\n13\n00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.765\nI kind of said that backward, but\nit's authentication and authorization.\n\n14\n00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:39.510\nIt's a great place for us to be.\n\n15\n00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.260\nEven though we've already gone through\na couple of episodes, make sure you\n\n16\n00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.960\ncheck those episodes out as you actually\nsee some of the ways you can set it up.\n\n17\n00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.850\nThere are sometimes,\n\n18\n00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.840\nthough, where you actually have to\ngo beyond that of just username and\n\n19\n00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.470\npassword, and we're gonna take a look at\nthat today as well as try to resolve some\n\n20\n00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.540\nof the issues you may face when it\ncomes down to well, authentication.\n\n21\n00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.400\nSo, the first thing that we wanna take\na look at is that remember that in\n\n22\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.470\nthe context environment that you're\nin,.logons can happen to your computer\n\n23\n00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.100\nin two ways, right?\n\n24\n00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.042\nOne is as a standalone machine.\n\n25\n00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:12.760\nA standalone machine is when you actually\nput in something like your username and\n\n26\n00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.800\npassword or whatever authentication\nmethod you choose, and\n\n27\n00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.020\nyou're authenticating against\nthat one single machine.\n\n28\n00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.580\nAnd that means that it keeps its\nstorage of whatever your password is\n\n29\n00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.220\non that machine.\n\n30\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.790\nAnd that's perfectly fine and\nyou can do that.\n\n31\n00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.230\nBut, if you're actually in a corporate\nenvironment or an enterprise environment,\n\n32\n00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.360\nmore than likely your authentication is\ngoing out and actually authenticating\n\n33\n00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.640\nagainst an authentication somewhere else,\nan authentication server somewhere else.\n\n34\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.790\nAnd that's actually critical and key,\nbecause to actually know the difference\n\n35\n00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.980\nhere will actually allow you\nto figure out whether or\n\n36\n00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.790\nnot you can gain access to resources\nthat are actually across your network or\n\n37\n00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.640\nare you only gonna gain access to\nresources right on your computer?\n\n38\n00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.170\nSo, let's verify that we understand that\nthere is a difference between these two as\n\n39\n00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.390\nwe take a look.\n\n40\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.720\nSo, the easiest way to actually\nfind out when you're authenticating\n\n41\n00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.250\nis to take a look at, well, how is your\ncomputer configured to authenticate?\n\n42\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.030\nSo let me show you when you're actually\nconfigured to authenticate right here on\n\n43\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.450\nthis computer.\n\n44\n00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.048\nSo, what I actually normally do\nis I go and find the system menu.\n\n45\n00:02:14.048 --> 00:02:18.720\nSo, I right-click on the Windows\nbutton and then I go to System.\n\n46\n00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.430\nAnd then that brings up\nthe System window for us.\n\n47\n00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.340\nAnd what we're normally looking for,\nhopefully everything,.there we go,\n\n48\n00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.230\nit finally through, is you're looking\nright here where it says Workgroup.\n\n49\n00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.090\nIf you see the term Workgroup right here,\ninstead of the word domain, well you\n\n50\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.590\nactually know that you're authenticating\nagainst that single local machine.\n\n51\n00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.510\nNow, you may have more than one\nmachine inside of a workgroup, but\n\n52\n00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.960\nthat means if you go and sit at somebody\nelse's machine, you authenticate and\n\n53\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.190\nyou're actually only authenticating\nagainst that machine right there as well.\n\n54\n00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.100\nEven if you were connecting and\nusing the same printer, you have to go\n\n55\n00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.620\nto every machine that you actually\ngo to to be able to authenticate and\n\n56\n00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.410\nthat's actually doing it on each and\nevery machine.\n\n57\n00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.440\nBut if you end up seeing\nthe term here that says domain,\n\n58\n00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.670\nwell such as ITProTV, right?\n\n59\n00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.590\nIf you see the term domain and it says\nITProTV, well, then you actually know that\n\n60\n00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.380\nhey, when you authenticate, it's sending\nyou authentication credentials somewhere\n\n61\n00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.640\nelse to authenticate and verifying\nthat you're part of that network.\n\n62\n00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.640\nAnd that way you can gain access to all\nthe resources on that network as well.\n\n63\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.120\nSometimes your computer can kind of trip\nyou up here, because it's actually fairly\n\n64\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.626\ndifficult to identify which one you're\nactually going to authenticate against.\n\n65\n00:03:25.626 --> 00:03:29.000\nSo you normally, well, either have either\nregular workgroup accounts like this,\n\n66\n00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.690\nwhere you're actually authenticating\nagainst that machine, or\n\n67\n00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.690\nyou're going across a network\nto authenticate as well.\n\n68\n00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.160\nSo those are usually the two different\nones that you have to be aware of.\n\n69\n00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.050\nIf for\nsome reason you're inside of a domain,\n\n70\n00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.081\nin other words, if you're actually\nsupporting domain users and they tell you,\n\n71\n00:03:45.081 --> 00:03:48.720\nwell, Daniel, I can't get access to\nthat shared network resource, or\n\n72\n00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.140\nI can't gain access to the printer\nanymore, I used to be able to, well,\n\n73\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.350\nusually this is the one first\nthings that you wanna check.\n\n74\n00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.060\nAre they logged on as a local user,\nwhich is actually as a workgroup, or\n\n75\n00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.580\nare they logged on as,\nwell, a domain user?\n\n76\n00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.180\nSometimes computers inside of\na network will stop communicating\n\n77\n00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.460\nwith that authentication server in\nbetween, and what that ends up doing\n\n78\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.040\nis that your machine will then\nlose trust with that network.\n\n79\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.270\nWhen something like that happens, all of\na sudden, even though they're logging in\n\n80\n00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.380\nwith their credentials, they're actually\nusing what they call cached credentials.\n\n81\n00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.970\nThey're actually a little bit stale.\n\n82\n00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.120\nAnd that means they still might not be\nable to gain access to all those resources\n\n83\n00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.710\nthat are available as well.\n\n84\n00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.280\nSo just kinda realize you do need to\ncheck those things when it comes along.\n\n85\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.870\nSo, what do you do if that machine\ndoes lose access to that network?\n\n86\n00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.650\nWell, what you'd have to do is you'd\nneed to rejoin that computer to\n\n87\n00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.095\na domain network, is what we'd need to do.\n\n88\n00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:41.090\nSo let me go ahead and\nclick on Change settings here.\n\n89\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.170\nAnd where you would go to do that is once\nyou select Change settings it's right here\n\n90\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.840\nwhere it says, Rename this computer\nto change its domain or workgroup.\n\n91\n00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.680\nAnd you select Change.\n\n92\n00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.900\nWell, maybe, let me click on it.\n\n93\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.010\nAnd it's right here that\nyou would select Domain,\n\n94\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.700\nand then you would type in\nthe name of the domain.\n\n95\n00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.570\nAnd you might see where it actually pops\nup a little authentication window for\n\n96\n00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.340\nsomebody that has credentials\nto that domain to log into.\n\n97\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.770\nNow I don't have a domain environment\nset up, but that's what you would do.\n\n98\n00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.050\nAnd then you'd have to\nreboot the computer, and\n\n99\n00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.060\nthen you'd get the option of whether or\nnot you're logging into the domain or\n\n100\n00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.040\nwhether you're logging\ninto the local computer.\n\n101\n00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.720\nSo that's usually some of the ones\nthat you do have to worry about\n\n102\n00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.020\nas well when you start dealing with\nthe idea of authentication too.\n\n103\n00:05:24.082 --> 00:05:27.990\nAll right, now, even though\nthose are fairly common, another\n\n104\n00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.960\nparticular issue that you might run into\nof course is, what if you actually wanted\n\n105\n00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.460\nto join let's say a homegroup, and\nyou couldn't actually do that?\n\n106\n00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.580\nWell, sometimes it actually ends up\nbeing one of two things automatically.\n\n107\n00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.400\nLet me show you the one that it\nnormally actually is going to be.\n\n108\n00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.660\nWhat we need to do is find\nour network setting here.\n\n109\n00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.320\nSo, I'm going to click\non the Windows button.\n\n110\n00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.055\nRight-click on the Windows button,\nand go to Control Panel.\n\n111\n00:05:55.095 --> 00:06:01.515\nAnd inside of Control Panel I'm\ngonna select Network and\n\n112\n00:06:01.515 --> 00:06:04.685\nInternet, maybe, [LAUGH] and\nalso Network and Sharing Center.\n\n113\n00:06:06.235 --> 00:06:09.345\nAnd this is where it becomes\na little bit key here.\n\n114\n00:06:09.345 --> 00:06:12.415\nWhen you actually say hey, I need to join\na workgroup, and it doesn't give you that\n\n115\n00:06:12.415 --> 00:06:17.650\noption, the reason why, a lot of times, is\nright here where it says Public Network.\n\n116\n00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.595\nWhen you see the term Public Network,\nwell, that's not gonna work because\n\n117\n00:06:20.595 --> 00:06:24.660\nworkgroups only work in what we call\nthe Private Network setting instead.\n\n118\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.160\nSo without the idea of us\nbeing on a private network,\n\n119\n00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.040\nthe very fact is you probably\nwill not see workgroups, either.\n\n120\n00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.730\nSo if I click on my file explorer,\nand if workgroups are appearing\n\n121\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.440\ninside of your network, those show up over\nhere on the left-hand side somewhere,\n\n122\n00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.740\nand it will say workgroup, and then you\ncan click on it, and a lot of times if\n\n123\n00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.300\nyou're able to join it you will\nactually go ahead and be able to do so.\n\n124\n00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.990\nSo you can actually go ahead and\njoin that, but if you don't see it, and\n\n125\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.570\nyou know that there's\na workgroup out there.\n\n126\n00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.240\n>> You mean a homegroup.\n\n127\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.440\n[LAUGH]\n>> A home group, not workgroup.\n\n128\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.170\nOh man-\n>> Somebody's gonna get the two confused.\n\n129\n00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.970\nThey're very similar.\n\n130\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:56.880\n>> Yeah.\n\n131\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.600\nThey are fairly similar\nbecause they do reside,\n\n132\n00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.920\nagain, and without needing that domain,\nthat centralized authentication,\n\n133\n00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.340\nbecause every machine is actually\nable to join that group here.\n\n134\n00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.670\nBut for us, though, it's right\nhere where it says Public Network.\n\n135\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.650\nNow the problem is fairly\nsimple in Windows 10.\n\n136\n00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.000\nThey don't give you an easy way to change\nit, as far as just right-clicking on\n\n137\n00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.900\nsomething up here and changing what your\nWindows firewall directory is going to be.\n\n138\n00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.160\nBut there is an easy way to do it,\n\n139\n00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.400\nsince everything actually does\nsupport a homegroup as well.\n\n140\n00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.010\nNow, if you take a look in\nthe lower left-hand corner,\n\n141\n00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.930\nyou'll also see where it\nsays Homegroups down here.\n\n142\n00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:40.970\nAnd if I select homegroup, it's right here\nwhere I can change that network location.\n\n143\n00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.500\nAnd what this is going to do,\nit's gonna run a troubleshooter for me.\n\n144\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.870\nAnd it actually pops this\nwindow out right over here,\n\n145\n00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.120\ngiving me the ability to\nselect a new network setting.\n\n146\n00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.630\nAnd when I do that it's searching for\nhomegroups on the network right away.\n\n147\n00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.108\nAnd if there are any found it will\ntell us the name of those groups.\n\n148\n00:07:57.108 --> 00:08:01.274\nAnd then, you have to actually\nget whatever password was set for\n\n149\n00:08:01.274 --> 00:08:04.527\nthat homegroup, and\nyou would simply type it in.\n\n150\n00:08:04.527 --> 00:08:08.370\nAnd you can see right now that there's\nno homegroups actually on this network.\n\n151\n00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.669\nBut the only thing that we really needed,\nright,\n\n152\n00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:14.224\nis that if there are at this point we can\ncreate a new homegroup if we choose to or\n\n153\n00:08:14.224 --> 00:08:16.920\nif there's one available we can join it.\n\n154\n00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.320\nNow, once we actually\nselect the troubleshooter,\n\n155\n00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.270\nif I go ahead and close out of that.\n\n156\n00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.090\nLet me get back to that\nNetwork & Sharing Center.\n\n157\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.180\nSo Control Panel.\n\n158\n00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.340\nAnd I don't know why it does that\nkind of flash and then come back up.\n\n159\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.190\nBut it's still working, so we're fine.\n\n160\n00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.120\nAnd now notice I am on\nthe Private Network instead.\n\n161\n00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.310\nSo now this is where my\ncomputer is now ready to go and\n\n162\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.880\nfind whatever homegroup's available.\n\n163\n00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.670\nAnd all I need right now is if there is\none existing, it's whatever that generated\n\n164\n00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.070\npassword is gonna be or if somebody's\nactually set up a new password,\n\n165\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.780\nwe are ready to go for\nthe idea of homegroups as well.\n\n166\n00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:57.180\nSo just on these two things, you can see a\ncouple of issues will arise fairly easily.\n\n167\n00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.420\nThe first one is when you can't\ngain access to network resources.\n\n168\n00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.330\nCheck whether or not you are actually\nin a workgroup versus a domain.\n\n169\n00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.490\nAnd then secondly, if somebody says yeah,\njust join my homegroup and\n\n170\n00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.910\nyou cannot see it, check right here and\n\n171\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.810\nverify that you are actually on a private\nnetwork and not a public network.\n\n172\n00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.130\nAnd then once you actually have that\nall you need now from them, of course,\n\n173\n00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.750\nis the proper password.\n\n174\n00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.900\nAnd that allows you to connect\nthe network just by using a password\n\n175\n00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.470\ninstead of having to set up a lot\nof other extra things too, okay?\n\n176\n00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.930\nSo there is a lot of configuration and\nsometime these issues do arise.\n\n177\n00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.750\nNow one I did mention just\na little bit earlier here,\n\n178\n00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.920\nright, is that even if your\ncomputer is a part of a domain, and\n\n179\n00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.300\nit doesn't happen super often,\nbut it does happen.\n\n180\n00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.710\nIf it doesn't communicate and\nconnect to that authentication server,\n\n181\n00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.220\nafter a while, what can happen is\nthe authentication server says,\n\n182\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.980\neh, I don't really trust who\nyou say you are anymore.\n\n183\n00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.500\nSo my computer, even though it can be\njoined to a domain that actually is\n\n184\n00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.900\na member of it, after a while,\nif my computer has been off, let's say for\n\n185\n00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.070\nseveral days, and then I turn it back on,\nand even though it still says, Ronnie,\n\n186\n00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.190\nyou can log on as a domain member.\n\n187\n00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.210\nWell, all of a sudden I use my network\ncredentials and what it says is,\n\n188\n00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.570\nlook, I like your credentials, but\n\n189\n00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.700\nthe guy that you're joining from,\nI don't trust him anymore.\n\n190\n00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.160\nAnd what you'll get is a little\ntiny paragraph that will say\n\n191\n00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.660\nthis computer has lost trust with its\nmain authentication server authorization.\n\n192\n00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.350\nAnd so what it's actually telling is,\n\n193\n00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:26.320\nat this point, you need to actually\nrejoin that computer to a domain or\n\n194\n00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.520\nyou need to go to another machine\nthat I will actually recognize.\n\n195\n00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.310\nNow this is, by far, one of the most\ncommon things as a support technician\n\n196\n00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.230\nthat I've done for years, Daniel.\n\n197\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.775\nDaniel, is there, have you done,\n\n198\n00:10:36.775 --> 00:10:39.935\nI'm pretty sure you have, have you\never done this where it's like, hey,\n\n199\n00:10:39.935 --> 00:10:42.435\nmy computer's lost trust with the domain,\nI don't know what to do.\n\n200\n00:10:42.435 --> 00:10:44.195\nWhat's the number one\nthing that we have to do?\n\n201\n00:10:44.195 --> 00:10:47.125\n>> Yeah, the easiest thing to do when\nthis kind of thing happens is just to\n\n202\n00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:49.215\nrejoin the computer to the domain.\n\n203\n00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:53.830\nJust login using a local user account and\nmake sure it has administrator privileges\n\n204\n00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.125\nso you can do some swapping and\nswipping out of there.\n\n205\n00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:57.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Go in there right where\n\n206\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:57.970\nRonnie showed you.\n\n207\n00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.930\nGo into the system properties.\n\n208\n00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.820\nFind that domain workgroup change area.\n\n209\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.560\nGo in there and change.\n\n210\n00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.180\nPut it in a workgroup.\n\n211\n00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.850\nRestart the computer, jump back in.\n\n212\n00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.120\nDo the exact same thing.\n\n213\n00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.437\nRejoin at the domain using your domain\ncredentials that has administrative\n\n214\n00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:12.290\nprivileges.\n\n215\n00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.780\nBy doing that, and\nyou should be back in action.\n\n216\n00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.450\nIt will rebuild that trust, and your\nuser will then be able to log back in.\n\n217\n00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:21.190\nTheir profile and everything will\nbe the same, nothing will change.\n\n218\n00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.710\nA lot of people were, oh, you,\nyou're doing some major changes here.\n\n219\n00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.380\nDon't worry.\n\n220\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.700\nAll that profile stuff will still\nbe there, backgrounds, folders,\n\n221\n00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.870\nfiles, you name it.\n\n222\n00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:30.770\nIt will all be waiting for\n\n223\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.930\nthem as soon as they log in\nusing their domain credentials.\n\n224\n00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.340\n>> Yeah.\nPart of this is what we call that\n\n225\n00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.770\nuse of a secure channel.\n\n226\n00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.610\nWhat happens is my computer is reaching\nout and the problem is that that\n\n227\n00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.060\ncomputer's saying, yeah this is\nnot as secure as it used to be.\n\n228\n00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.980\nSo let me go ahead and make you do that.\n\n229\n00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.300\nNow when you do it, there are a couple\nof things we need to pay attention to.\n\n230\n00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.580\nSo let's show you that process that\nDaniel just described briefly,\n\n231\n00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.130\nat least a portion of it.\n\n232\n00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.780\nSo I'm going to select system again.\n\n233\n00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.450\nSo I right click on the Windows button.\n\n234\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.630\nAnd I'm going to select system.\n\n235\n00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.300\nAnd inside of system,\n\n236\n00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.530\nif you do have that issue where it's\ntelling you it's no longer, you first\n\n237\n00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.590\nhave to log on as a local user account\nthat has administrative privileges.\n\n238\n00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.062\nAnd that's the key,\nis what you want to be able to do.\n\n239\n00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:13.527\nSo, if you do that and then all you\ndo is you come to this location,\n\n240\n00:12:13.527 --> 00:12:15.104\nyou select change settings.\n\n241\n00:12:15.104 --> 00:12:18.966\nAnd it's right here, you select change\nagain and even if yours is joined,\n\n242\n00:12:18.966 --> 00:12:23.196\nlet's say, to a domain right here, you\nwould will simply select workgroup, and\n\n243\n00:12:23.196 --> 00:12:25.210\nyou don't have to type in workgroup.\n\n244\n00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.810\nYou have to type in something.\n\n245\n00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.270\nAnd now, you have to type\nin at least something here.\n\n246\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.370\nBut everyone normally does\nsomething different, so\n\n247\n00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.780\nI usually type in like the letter A.\n\n248\n00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.540\nWhy?\nWell because it's fast.\n\n249\n00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.165\n>> I've been in the ASDF\nworkgroup plenty of times.\n\n250\n00:12:38.165 --> 00:12:41.050\n[LAUGH]\n>> ASDF is just a natural line of\n\n251\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.600\nkeys that are on the keyboard.\n\n252\n00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.452\nASDF, and then you hit okay.\n\n253\n00:12:45.452 --> 00:12:50.470\nAnd it used to be where you didn't have\nto enter credentials in at one point.\n\n254\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.620\nNow, even in that, and that actually\npops up automatically, and you're like,\n\n255\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.000\nwell, I don't know what\nthe credentials of the computer are.\n\n256\n00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.890\nThe good thing is it doesn't matter.\n\n257\n00:12:58.890 --> 00:12:59.713\nThe credentials don't matter.\n\n258\n00:12:59.713 --> 00:13:00.530\nYou can do what I did.\n\n259\n00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.000\nJust type in the letter A and\nlink to those credentials.\n\n260\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.400\nIt will join the workgroup and\nthen the computer will have to reboot.\n\n261\n00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.660\nNow it's key when the computer reboots,\nbecause it tells you that,\n\n262\n00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.360\nhey, you're about to sign off of this\nmachine or sign out of this machine.\n\n263\n00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.460\nAnd you need to know what the\nadministrator password is to that machine.\n\n264\n00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.560\nIf you don't, you're going to\nbe locked out of that machine\n\n265\n00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.610\nbecause now you don't know how to\nget access back to that machine.\n\n266\n00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.480\nWhen you log in again, what will happen\nis you'll do the same exact thing.\n\n267\n00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.860\nYou'll come back to this location,\nright, the start button.\n\n268\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.710\nGo back to system, and then inside of\nsystem you're going to actually launch\n\n269\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.100\nthe system properties button by\nthe chain settings over here, and\n\n270\n00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.640\nthen you're going to select change, and\nthis is where you join the domain again.\n\n271\n00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.900\nAnd you type in the name of your domain,\nand\n\n272\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.120\nonce you do that, this is the time\nwhen those credentials will matter.\n\n273\n00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.660\nYou have to be a domain\nuser on that network.\n\n274\n00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.150\nAnd then once you actually\nenter those credentials,\n\n275\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.900\nyou should be joined to the domain and\nit will reboot the computer again.\n\n276\n00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.860\nAnd you'll log in using your domain\ncredentials, and you'll be off and\n\n277\n00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.020\nready to go.\n\n278\n00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:05.240\nSo it's not the most complex problem in\nthe world, but it's one of the more common\n\n279\n00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.920\nproblems that you'll also face with issues\narising from authentication settings too.\n\n280\n00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:15.390\nNow, of course, sometimes when we\nstart talking about authentication,\n\n281\n00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:19.150\none of the hardest things to actually\nset up and to get people used to,\n\n282\n00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.810\nis that well, you actually have to\nhave policies a lot of times too.\n\n283\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:28.020\nSo remember that today, some of the most\ncommonly used passwords are 123456 and\n\n284\n00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.480\nthe word password, of all the ones\nthat you actually end up using.\n\n285\n00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.630\nThese are fairly common but\n\n286\n00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.560\nthe problem is they're nowhere\nclose to even being secure.\n\n287\n00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.550\nAnd they're so easily guessable,\nyou really even treat them as passwords.\n\n288\n00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.610\nWell, what if you wanted to set it up so\n\n289\n00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:46.190\nthat your network actually used\nsomething much more complex to do so?\n\n290\n00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.180\nYou can even do it on your\nown individual computer,\n\n291\n00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.820\nbut what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna show you that as well.\n\n292\n00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.390\nWhat we're talking about now is,\nof course,\n\n293\n00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.910\nis using from an active directory group\npolicy to establish what we call,\n\n294\n00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.160\nof course, the account policies\nthat we want to set up here.\n\n295\n00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.690\nSo in the same way,\nI'm gonna cancel out of all this.\n\n296\n00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.015\nAnd then, maybe I am.\n\n297\n00:15:06.015 --> 00:15:06.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n298\n00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.995\nthen from here in the search Windows and\nWindows feature.\n\n299\n00:15:09.995 --> 00:15:11.305\nSearch Web and Windows feature.\n\n300\n00:15:11.305 --> 00:15:12.895\nI'm gonna type in gpedit.\n\n301\n00:15:12.895 --> 00:15:15.335\nIf I can spell it.\n\n302\n00:15:16.685 --> 00:15:18.165\nAnd remember, don't trust my typing.\n\n303\n00:15:18.165 --> 00:15:21.975\nI guarantee you that my typing\nis not gonna help you out here.\n\n304\n00:15:21.975 --> 00:15:24.705\nBut this is our local group policy editor.\n\n305\n00:15:24.705 --> 00:15:29.570\nNow if you're inside of a domain, this is\nnot exactly where you will be setting it.\n\n306\n00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.260\nBut this is fairly similar, if not exactly\nidentical to what you normally see when\n\n307\n00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.690\nyou set it up for\nthe active directory group policy instead.\n\n308\n00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.360\nSo when we talk about\nsetting up policies for\n\n309\n00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.770\naccount policies here,\nwhat we're looking for\n\n310\n00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.770\nis gonna be under the Local Group Policy\nand the Computer Configuration.\n\n311\n00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.900\nWe're actually making sure\nthat we set this policy up,\n\n312\n00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.730\nof course, for\nusers that are logging into this computer.\n\n313\n00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.490\nFrom there,\nwe're gonna go down to Windows settings.\n\n314\n00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.124\nAnd that should expand out\nhere in just a moment.\n\n315\n00:15:56.124 --> 00:16:00.501\nAnd then we're gonna select security\nsettings to expand out as well.\n\n316\n00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:03.431\nInside of security settings,\nwhat we're looking for\n\n317\n00:16:03.431 --> 00:16:06.816\nis the First option that you can\nsee which is account policies.\n\n318\n00:16:06.816 --> 00:16:09.247\nAnd notice that there\nare two account policies.\n\n319\n00:16:09.247 --> 00:16:12.347\nThere's a password policy that\nwe can modify and correct or\n\n320\n00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:15.955\nadjust the way that we need to and\nthen the account lockout policies.\n\n321\n00:16:15.955 --> 00:16:19.820\nThey're going to be used in tandem with\neach other that will apply the user that\n\n322\n00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.122\nlogs into this computer.\n\n323\n00:16:21.122 --> 00:16:23.821\nIf you're setting this\nin Active Directory or\n\n324\n00:16:23.821 --> 00:16:28.860\napply to whatever group you apply it to,\nor even across your entire domain.\n\n325\n00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.230\nSo, some of the policies you may choose\nto set up, is when I go in here,\n\n326\n00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.350\nnotice I can enforce a password history.\n\n327\n00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:40.053\nEnforcing a password history guarantees\nthat I can say, you must actually use so\n\n328\n00:16:40.053 --> 00:16:43.246\nmany passwords before you\ncan use the first one again.\n\n329\n00:16:43.246 --> 00:16:47.372\nSo that can actually be from\nI think 0 to 24 passwords.\n\n330\n00:16:47.372 --> 00:16:48.375\nThat is what it will allow you to do.\n\n331\n00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:50.480\nNow, you might say, well, no big deal.\n\n332\n00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.520\nI can remember 24 different\npasswords before I use it again.\n\n333\n00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.720\nAnd you're probably right cuz\nI'm pretty sure Daniel can, but\n\n334\n00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.430\nI can't do anything like that.\n\n335\n00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:03.250\nBut, if I use that in combination though\nwith a couple of these other options here,\n\n336\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.920\nis what we want to do, right?\n\n337\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.590\nSo, what I can also do is say, well,\nDaniel, you might be able to remember 24\n\n338\n00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:13.420\npasswords, but what if I require you\ninstead to remember those 24 passwords but\n\n339\n00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:19.730\nactually make sure that you have to use\nthem for at least a minimum of seven days?\n\n340\n00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.430\nSo, I can do that if I wanted to.\n\n341\n00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.330\nI can actually say seven days here.\n\n342\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.350\nAnd when I do something like that,\nthat means that Daniel can't\n\n343\n00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:30.240\nenter 24 passwords in, just one after\nthe other, one after the other, and go,\n\n344\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.470\nfinally I've hit number 24,\nnow I can reuse the first one again.\n\n345\n00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.860\nWhat this means is it's gonna\nat least take Daniel 24 weeks\n\n346\n00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.520\nbefore he can actually reuse\nthose passwords again.\n\n347\n00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.240\nAnd even though Daniel's mind may\nbe strong, and his Kung Fu is good,\n\n348\n00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.060\nI don't know about 24 passwords there.\n\n349\n00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.380\nI don't know, he's looking at me saying,\nyeah, I can do it.\n\n350\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.580\n>> I might be able to\nget away with it [LAUGH]\n\n351\n00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:50.247\n>> And, that's fine.\n\n352\n00:17:50.247 --> 00:17:53.120\nNow, the other problem that we also have,\nof course,\n\n353\n00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.497\nis that somebody reusing\nthe same password.\n\n354\n00:17:55.497 --> 00:17:59.100\nAnd I used to do this all the time,\nbecause when we talk about security,\n\n355\n00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.340\neven in classes that that\nI've led at different places.\n\n356\n00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.760\nI said, all right who's had\nan e-mail account for ten years?\n\n357\n00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.482\nAnd all the hands go up.\n\n358\n00:18:06.482 --> 00:18:08.840\nAll right, who's actually changed\ntheir password in the last month?\n\n359\n00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.242\nWell, all the sudden, two hands go up.\n\n360\n00:18:11.242 --> 00:18:13.770\nAnd then, I'm like who has the same\npassword they had when they first created\n\n361\n00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.740\nthe account?\n\n362\n00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.690\nAnd 50 hands might go up and\nall of the sudden you're like, whoa!\n\n363\n00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:18.600\nWhat has happened to you?\n\n364\n00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.900\nYou mean you've had a password for\nten years and you haven't changed it?\n\n365\n00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.800\nAnd you're using that on the Internet,\nare you crazy?\n\n366\n00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.450\nAnd people are like no,\nnobody will ever guess that password.\n\n367\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:28.550\nI'm like, somebody's guessed it.\n\n368\n00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.914\nSomebody has already guessed your\npassword if that's what's happening here.\n\n369\n00:18:31.914 --> 00:18:36.508\nSo what we can do is we can limit that\npassword by actually setting also\n\n370\n00:18:36.508 --> 00:18:37.706\nthe maximum age.\n\n371\n00:18:37.706 --> 00:18:39.169\nAnd what we're saying is, hey,\n\n372\n00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:42.010\nyou might be able to change\na password every seven days.\n\n373\n00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:45.650\nBut the longest you can use a single\npassword, we can set that up as well.\n\n374\n00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.610\nAnd this one by default\nis set up to six weeks.\n\n375\n00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:52.690\nAnd that's all up to whatever security\npolicies that you also have in place.\n\n376\n00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:56.580\nOf course, you use that in combination\nwith minimum password link as well.\n\n377\n00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.800\nMaking sure you actually say,\nhey, the password is gonna be,\n\n378\n00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.830\nlet's say 10 or 12 characters.\n\n379\n00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:05.060\nDaniel's over there scoffing at me like,\n10 or 12 that's easy, no big deal.\n\n380\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.015\nSomeone like me, all of a sudden,\nit's a challenge.\n\n381\n00:19:07.015 --> 00:19:09.100\n[LAUGH] It's really\na challenge at this point.\n\n382\n00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.040\nBut yes,\nonce you use all of these in combination,\n\n383\n00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.770\nthat's what makes the password\npolicy strong is what it does.\n\n384\n00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.340\nNow, don't get me wrong, in today's\nworld passwords, and Microsoft says,\n\n385\n00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.250\npasswords, don't use them.\n\n386\n00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:23.180\nThey're terrible, you shouldn't\nhave to use passwords at all.\n\n387\n00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.383\nBut the very fact is,\nin corporate settings,\n\n388\n00:19:25.383 --> 00:19:26.913\na lot of times we still use them.\n\n389\n00:19:26.913 --> 00:19:27.620\nWhy?\nIt's easy.\n\n390\n00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.050\nIt's cheap.\n\n391\n00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:32.040\nAnd it works effectively because\nwe're not letting everybody\n\n392\n00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.230\noff the street come in and\nuse our computers.\n\n393\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.880\nIt's really the users that are on our\nnetwork that we're really trying to make\n\n394\n00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.130\nsure that we protect.\n\n395\n00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.830\nSo, you can see that there's a lot of\nthese different requirements there.\n\n396\n00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.900\nNow some of the other ones,\n\n397\n00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.230\nof course, are in combination with\nthis account lockout policy here.\n\n398\n00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:51.540\nNow, the account lockout policy, of\ncourse, is a duration setting that says,\n\n399\n00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.420\nif I let Daniel log in, how many times\ncan he log in with an incorrect password\n\n400\n00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.220\nbefore I stop him from doing so.\n\n401\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.710\nWell, why might you do\nsomething like that?\n\n402\n00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.315\nWell, the attack is what we\ncall a brute force attack.\n\n403\n00:20:03.315 --> 00:20:07.500\nCuz if you're like me, you can probably\nset this to one and I'd be locked out for\n\n404\n00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.150\na good amount of time.\n\n405\n00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.380\nDaniel though,\nwho can type like a madman and\n\n406\n00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.130\ndo it skillfully and accurately, yeah,\nhe's the one that you have to worry about,\n\n407\n00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:19.180\nwho types in 15, 20 passwords\nvery easily just by doing that.\n\n408\n00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.770\nI can barely spell my\nname when I'm typing.\n\n409\n00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:23.400\nSo, those are some of the things\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n410\n00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.620\nSo, the account lockout\npolicy is right here too.\n\n411\n00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:31.580\nThe duration, how long is somebody locked\nout for, once they enter in, well,\n\n412\n00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.210\nsome wrong passwords.\n\n413\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.770\nUse that in combination with how\nmany invalid login attempts.\n\n414\n00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.770\nSo, we might do three or five.\n\n415\n00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.430\nSo, if Daniel enters in a wrong password\nfive times in a row, it locks him out,\n\n416\n00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.150\nwell, for how long?\n\n417\n00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.270\nI can set it to five minutes or\nten minutes.\n\n418\n00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.380\nUsually, five to ten minutes is not\nbad cuz it allows Daniel to instead of\n\n419\n00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:54.290\npunching the actual keyboard or destroying\nthe actual monitor by shaking it\n\n420\n00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.250\ngives them time to go and\nget a cup of coffee.\n\n421\n00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.580\nCome back and just retype his\npassword in and then get back in and\n\n422\n00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.520\nthat's what we are also doing too.\n\n423\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.100\nAnd there's also this reset after so\noften.\n\n424\n00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.996\nNow, you might not want\nto actually do that.\n\n425\n00:21:06.996 --> 00:21:10.367\nYou might wanna actually leave it to this\npoint where you go look I'm not going to\n\n426\n00:21:10.367 --> 00:21:11.538\nreset it for 30 minutes.\n\n427\n00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:12.331\nI'm not going to do that.\n\n428\n00:21:12.331 --> 00:21:16.810\nI'm gonna make him go and talk to\nsomebody to say, look, I locked it out.\n\n429\n00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.570\nAnd, the reason why I did because I\nwant to know who's actually doing this.\n\n430\n00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.191\nSo, that way they have to come to you,\n\n431\n00:21:22.191 --> 00:21:24.538\nand then you can actually\nunlock the account for them.\n\n432\n00:21:24.538 --> 00:21:28.789\nAnd, that's probably, by far, the more\nsecure of the things that we have to do.\n\n433\n00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:31.989\nRemember that authentication,\nat least using passwords,\n\n434\n00:21:31.989 --> 00:21:35.050\nis kind of the first line of defense for\nour systems.\n\n435\n00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.331\nIt's definitely not\nthe last line of defense.\n\n436\n00:21:37.331 --> 00:21:40.225\nSo that's why we might to\nchoose that instead as, hey,\n\n437\n00:21:40.225 --> 00:21:43.735\nif Daniel locks us out three times\nin a row, yeah, he's gonna go and\n\n438\n00:21:43.735 --> 00:21:47.081\nsee somebody else and go, yeah,\nI typed in the password wrong.\n\n439\n00:21:47.081 --> 00:21:50.851\nBut the funny thing is, if Daniel now\ncomes to me and says, I don't know why I'm\n\n440\n00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:54.550\nlocked out, I haven't been logged\ninto my machine this week at all.\n\n441\n00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:58.480\nNow, Daniel can go,\nnow we've got actually an issue, right,\n\n442\n00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.720\nbecause somebody else is trying to\nlog in using Daniel's credentials and\n\n443\n00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.271\nthat's where we would have an issue,\nright.\n\n444\n00:22:03.271 --> 00:22:06.914\n>> Time to start checking the event\nlogs to see if anything is going wrong.\n\n445\n00:22:06.914 --> 00:22:11.123\nA lot of times it's just maybe\na phone with an old password in it.\n\n446\n00:22:11.123 --> 00:22:11.998\nIt could be just that.\n\n447\n00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:15.954\nAnd when we can track down the fact that\nthere's just a device with an old password\n\n448\n00:22:15.954 --> 00:22:19.460\nthrowing it at the server and\nit's giving you the lockout status.\n\n449\n00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.425\nBut, every now an then, it could be\nsomeone trying to brute force their way in\n\n450\n00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:26.123\nto Ronnie's computer and\ngain access to his files.\n\n451\n00:22:26.123 --> 00:22:27.539\nAnd that's what we want to know.\n\n452\n00:22:27.539 --> 00:22:31.794\nAnd that's why we set password policies so\nwe can be alerted to those facts when and\n\n453\n00:22:31.794 --> 00:22:32.789\nif they do happen.\n\n454\n00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:35.998\nAnd try to find out what\nthe heck is actually going on.\n\n455\n00:22:35.998 --> 00:22:39.281\n>> Now, one of the other things that we\ncan also check out of course is to be able\n\n456\n00:22:39.281 --> 00:22:42.780\nto change the way we logging into\nan individual computer, right?\n\n457\n00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.160\nRight now,\nmost of us just use a local user account.\n\n458\n00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.663\nBut Microsoft really pushes\nthe Microsoft Passport.\n\n459\n00:22:47.663 --> 00:22:50.646\nAnd if you haven't checked out that\nepisode, make sure you check out\n\n460\n00:22:50.646 --> 00:22:54.320\nthe reason why they are really emphasizing\nthis idea of Microsoft Passport.\n\n461\n00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.050\nIt's because it allows us to be able\nto take pretty much what we have,\n\n462\n00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.770\nall of our settings with\nus wherever we go and\n\n463\n00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.960\nthat way we can actually use just a single\nidentity across multiple machines.\n\n464\n00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.740\nNow, the reason why this is very important\nto us is because Windows gives us\n\n465\n00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.030\nthe ability to be able\nto change how we log in.\n\n466\n00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:15.664\nSo, currently on this machine,\nI am logged in using a Microsoft account.\n\n467\n00:23:15.664 --> 00:23:17.485\nBut, if you are logged in\nusing a local account,\n\n468\n00:23:17.485 --> 00:23:18.957\nyou could do that as well and change it.\n\n469\n00:23:18.957 --> 00:23:23.190\nNow, this time, I'm just going\nto click on the start button.\n\n470\n00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.280\nAnd from here, I'm gonna select Settings.\n\n471\n00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.640\nAnd it's right here in the Settings\nwhen you go to Accounts,\n\n472\n00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.280\nthat you need to verify what\nuser you're logged in as.\n\n473\n00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:32.870\nSo here it is.\n\n474\n00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:35.890\nI'm actually logged in using my\nMicrosoft account right here.\n\n475\n00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.920\nI can manage it, but\nif I wanted to change it,\n\n476\n00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.670\nI could select Ssign in with\na local account, instead.\n\n477\n00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.030\nAnd that gives you the ability\nto go backward and forward,\n\n478\n00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.777\nwhether you actually want to use\nthe local account or this Microsoft\n\n479\n00:23:45.777 --> 00:23:48.831\naccount to be able to synchronize\nbetween all of your different machines.\n\n480\n00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:53.810\nNow, once you select the Microsoft\naccount, and you actually are logged in,\n\n481\n00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:58.489\nyou also end up getting some other\nadditional benefits by increasing that\n\n482\n00:23:58.489 --> 00:24:01.216\naccount strength of\nthe way that we log in.\n\n483\n00:24:01.216 --> 00:24:05.032\nAnd so notice that we also have\nthis option for sign in options,\n\n484\n00:24:05.032 --> 00:24:06.045\nis what we have.\n\n485\n00:24:06.045 --> 00:24:09.589\nNow, if you select sign in options now,\nand I’m logged in with a Microsoft\n\n486\n00:24:09.589 --> 00:24:12.303\naccount Notice you do have a password,\nwhich you can do.\n\n487\n00:24:12.303 --> 00:24:17.020\nAnd then you also have PIN, and\nthen you also have this Windows Hello.\n\n488\n00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.130\nNow this is actually very important\nbecause I know I've messed\n\n489\n00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.400\nthis one up before, just on my own.\n\n490\n00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.450\nYou might go to a machine, go I don't\nsee a Windows Hello in Windows 10,\n\n491\n00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:29.020\nI dunno what you're talking about Ronnie,\non my machine it doesn't work.\n\n492\n00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.941\nWell what you have to have is\nsomething like a biometric reader.\n\n493\n00:24:31.941 --> 00:24:36.614\nSo here I've got just a little fingerprint\nscanner that we're using so as long as it\n\n494\n00:24:36.614 --> 00:24:41.090\nactually recognizes the biometric device\nthat Windows Hello will show up, but\n\n495\n00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.160\nif it's not plugged in like\nan external one like this or\n\n496\n00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.065\nit's not built in you might\nnot see it right there.\n\n497\n00:24:47.065 --> 00:24:50.446\nSo that's actually a key if you come\nhere to sign in options Windows Hello is\n\n498\n00:24:50.446 --> 00:24:51.036\nnot there but\n\n499\n00:24:51.036 --> 00:24:55.520\nmore than likely you're missing that\nbiometric device that's actually built in.\n\n500\n00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.460\nNow, once you have it,\n\n501\n00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.900\nthis is the way that Microsoft prefers\nyou to actually be able to use this.\n\n502\n00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.860\nIs to use this Windows Hello.\n\n503\n00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.540\nNow, if you had one of\nthe features that they talk about.\n\n504\n00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.630\nWindows Hello, wants you to be\nable use like a fingerprint.\n\n505\n00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.960\nThey really want you to use like\na facial recognition if you can.\n\n506\n00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.230\nBut that facial recognition is incredibly\nneat and the reason why is that they've\n\n507\n00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:19.500\ntried to improve on the technology\nto make it as seamless as possible.\n\n508\n00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.660\nThey've tried to make the set\nup as easy as possible as well.\n\n509\n00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.155\nSo we're gonna see this with\nthe fingerprint scanner but\n\n510\n00:25:25.155 --> 00:25:29.455\nthere're requirements for doing this,\na little bit hefty at this point, so\n\n511\n00:25:29.455 --> 00:25:32.495\nas the prices drop you'll probably\nsee more of this built into these.\n\n512\n00:25:32.495 --> 00:25:34.495\nBut the price right now\nis a little bit hefty,\n\n513\n00:25:34.495 --> 00:25:38.612\nit requires an infrared type of\ncamera that you have available, and\n\n514\n00:25:38.612 --> 00:25:41.592\nthat way regardless of the lighting\ncondition, you're fine.\n\n515\n00:25:41.592 --> 00:25:45.482\nThe other reason for the infrared camera\nis that way you can't just take a picture.\n\n516\n00:25:45.482 --> 00:25:47.932\nSo like right now, if you're,\nI don't know why you would do this,\n\n517\n00:25:47.932 --> 00:25:52.122\nif you decided to actually do a screen\ncapture of me right now saying, I'm gonna\n\n518\n00:25:52.122 --> 00:25:56.512\nsee if I can use Ronnie's biometrics to\nlog in, with the new Windows Hello it\n\n519\n00:25:56.512 --> 00:25:59.800\nwon't let you do that, because it\nactually has an infrared camera and\n\n520\n00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.530\nwhen it actually took the original image\nit's trying to match up those different\n\n521\n00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:09.250\npoints on the infrared to verify what\nwe call liveness of that image as well.\n\n522\n00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:13.280\nAnd so there's a lot built into it and\nthey try to make it that seamless.\n\n523\n00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.400\nSo the good thing is just by plugging in\nthis little biometric finger reader here\n\n524\n00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.370\nI do get the Windows Hello.\n\n525\n00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.710\nNow you have to set up two\nthings when you do it.\n\n526\n00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.320\nFirst if you're going to use this you have\nto make sure you have a PIN number set up\n\n527\n00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.440\nand I do.\n\n528\n00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.590\nYou might be wondering why.\n\n529\n00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.350\nWell, just in case\nthe biometric doesn't work.\n\n530\n00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:30.160\nSo that makes sense,\nit's your fallback is what it is.\n\n531\n00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.300\nBut if you do have it setup and\nyou're ready to go, the good thing is,\n\n532\n00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.040\nlook at how simple this is.\n\n533\n00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.960\nI don't have to try and find out where\nI'm gonna setup the fingerprint.\n\n534\n00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.140\nIt says Fingerprint Setup.\n\n535\n00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.540\nOh, that makes sense.\n\n536\n00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.690\nSo once I do that it says hey,\nhere's the Welcome Screen, and we're now\n\n537\n00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.260\ngoing to walk through essentially a,\nwell a little wizard system, right?\n\n538\n00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.290\nSo I can select that, and\n\n539\n00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:53.730\nnow it's actually saying hey,\nhow do I know it's you?\n\n540\n00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:58.100\nI type in that, and then I have to\nrun my finger across a scanner.\n\n541\n00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.030\nAnd when I do so,\nas long as I do it consistently,\n\n542\n00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.060\nit is gonna recognize And so there it is.\n\n543\n00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.370\nI did it a little bit inconsistently.\n\n544\n00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:14.180\nAnd in just a moment here,\nit might take me the whole bar.\n\n545\n00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:14.720\nAnd there we go.\n\n546\n00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.390\nIt says you're all set up.\n\n547\n00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:19.610\nNotice you can add in multiple\nfingerprints if you choose to.\n\n548\n00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:21.840\nUsually not a bad idea, right?\n\n549\n00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.240\nBut sometimes though, right now,\nwe're not gonna add in another one.\n\n550\n00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.230\nBut I'm just gonna click Close.\n\n551\n00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.830\nAnd now, if I log out.\n\n552\n00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.320\nAnd then go and sign out.\n\n553\n00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.220\nI got to get used to that terminology,\nsign out.\n\n554\n00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.519\nI know it's actually been in\na previous edition of Windows,\n\n555\n00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:39.107\nI'm still not used to it in this edition.\n\n556\n00:27:39.107 --> 00:27:40.192\nStill call it log out after years.\n\n557\n00:27:40.192 --> 00:27:41.816\n>> We're old dogs, Ronnie,\nit's hard to teach us new tricks.\n\n558\n00:27:41.816 --> 00:27:44.130\n>> I know, tell me about it.\n\n559\n00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.300\nSo now here's what it actually looks\nlike that's a little bit different.\n\n560\n00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.040\nSo there it is,\nI'm signed in with my Microsoft account.\n\n561\n00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.070\nOr actually at least the login is here.\n\n562\n00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.520\nBut notice I have these sign in options.\n\n563\n00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.550\nSo if I select sign in options,\nI have these three in a pin number,\n\n564\n00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.680\nI can even do the typing but\nI'm gonna select this fingerprint,\n\n565\n00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.880\nthis little kind of half fingerprint\nhere and then it says to sign in,\n\n566\n00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.160\nscan your finger on\nthe fingerprint reader.\n\n567\n00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.780\nAnd when I do so, and\nnow you have that little tiny widget that\n\n568\n00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:18.070\nthen turned into a little smiley face\nthat said you signed in successfully.\n\n569\n00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:22.090\nI know there's a name for it, for that\nlittle guy, but whether you're actually\n\n570\n00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:25.170\ndoing the facial recognition or\nyou're doing the fingerprint reader,\n\n571\n00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.540\nwhatever other biometrics scanner\nyou can do, that's what it does.\n\n572\n00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.540\nIf you can't do it it\njust kind of sits there.\n\n573\n00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.220\nBut if everything happens, all of that\nstuff just kinda falls into place and\n\n574\n00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.740\nit makes a little smiley face.\n\n575\n00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.880\nOn the facial recognition,\nit will kinda look side to side.\n\n576\n00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.730\nI know it's kinda weird, but it will\nactually kinda turn angles to try and\n\n577\n00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:45.540\nshow you where you should be looking and\nstuff, so it really is a neat thing.\n\n578\n00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.480\nSo, by setting that up notice now\nI don't actually need to type in\n\n579\n00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.170\na password at all.\n\n580\n00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:51.790\nI still have my pin number.\n\n581\n00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:55.460\nBut overall though it really does work\nfairly well, when we start talking about\n\n582\n00:28:55.460 --> 00:29:00.460\nthe idea of using the biometrics here, and\nthat is a big push, right, is to move away\n\n583\n00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:05.310\nfrom passwords because regardless of\nhow long your password is, it really is\n\n584\n00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:09.210\nsomething that Microsoft now says that you\nshouldn't use it's really that insecure.\n\n585\n00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.980\nAnd of course since they're\npushing the Microsoft Passport.\n\n586\n00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.260\nWhich is something you're\ngoing to use on every device,\n\n587\n00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:15.920\nregardless of where you are in the world.\n\n588\n00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.790\nThey would rather you not actually use,\n\n589\n00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.610\nwell, you know,\npasswords if you don't need to.\n\n590\n00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:24.720\nSo as getting things up to do that, and\nrealizing that you do have to have things\n\n591\n00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.000\nin place to do something\nlike the Windows Hello.\n\n592\n00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.610\nYou do need to make sure that you know\nthe difference between these accounts and\n\n593\n00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:32.020\nsome of the issues you'll be dealing with,\n\n594\n00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.850\nif you're actually supporting users\ndealing with authentications as well.\n\n595\n00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.710\nThere's a lot of stuff for us right here.\n\n596\n00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.740\n>> Yeah, great stuff though.\n\n597\n00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.190\nI love that fingerprint scanner.\n\n598\n00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.720\nThat is such cool tech.\n\n599\n00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.780\nI feel like we've been to the future age,\nright?\n\n600\n00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.290\nJust oh, just swipe my finger.\n\n601\n00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:47.555\nKinda hard to forget my finger at home,\nyou know?\n\n602\n00:29:47.555 --> 00:29:49.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or, oh, what was my finger again?\n\n603\n00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:51.410\nOh, it's just swipe.\n\n604\n00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:55.140\nVery, very cool stuff, so if you have\nthe ability to grab a fingerprint scanner,\n\n605\n00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.720\nwe were looking on them the other day,\nnot really that expensive for\n\n606\n00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.710\nthe actual device.\n\n607\n00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:03.090\nFor some of the cheaper ones,\ncan implement that Windows Hello stuff and\n\n608\n00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.775\nget back into action using that Nah,\nforget that password business.\n\n609\n00:30:05.775 --> 00:30:06.345\nGet you a pin.\n\n610\n00:30:06.345 --> 00:30:07.285\nGet you a fingerprint scanner.\n\n611\n00:30:07.285 --> 00:30:08.665\nYou're off to the races.\n\n612\n00:30:08.665 --> 00:30:09.325\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n613\n00:30:09.325 --> 00:30:12.025\nHave we covered everything we need for\nthis topic?\n\n614\n00:30:12.025 --> 00:30:13.885\n>> We've just about covered\neverything that we need.\n\n615\n00:30:13.885 --> 00:30:17.895\nBut remember that there are some devices\nout there that are not designed to join\n\n616\n00:30:17.895 --> 00:30:20.015\na Active Directory domain.\n\n617\n00:30:20.015 --> 00:30:24.565\nBut you can include them in what we call,\nof course, workplace joins as well.\n\n618\n00:30:24.565 --> 00:30:26.015\nNow sometimes you may run into this.\n\n619\n00:30:26.015 --> 00:30:26.995\nSometimes you may not.\n\n620\n00:30:26.995 --> 00:30:29.070\nIf you do have a device like a tablet.\n\n621\n00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:32.450\nOr a phone that you need access to,\nor your network documents or\n\n622\n00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:34.790\nyour network whatever you\nmight actually add there.\n\n623\n00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:37.290\nWell, there is a location that\nyou can go on your computer\n\n624\n00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.730\nto do this if all the infrastructure\nin the backgrounds setup.\n\n625\n00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.040\nLet me show at least\nwhere that location is.\n\n626\n00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.160\nSo of course everything is kinda\nfound in the Settings here.\n\n627\n00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.060\nSo if I click on the Start button and\ngo to Settings, and\n\n628\n00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:53.190\nthen is going to back to Accounts is\nwhat we're taking a look at here.\n\n629\n00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:57.560\nAnd then you go to Work Access, and\nit's right here in work access,\n\n630\n00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.890\nin just a moment as everything\nkind of finishes up,\n\n631\n00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.200\nwhere it says you're gonna\nconnect to a work or school,\n\n632\n00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.670\nan that's where you would select,\nand then it normally requires you to\n\n633\n00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.850\nhave your email address of that account\nthat you're going to be logging in at.\n\n634\n00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:12.130\nSo, technically it's not,\nexactly, an email address, but\n\n635\n00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:16.920\nthey're calling it the email address,\nit's that specific universal identity,\n\n636\n00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:21.210\nthat looks exactly like an email address,\nso they just said use the email address.\n\n637\n00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.440\nAnd if everything's right,\nyou actually establish that connection, so\n\n638\n00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.220\nyour tablet can essentially access some\nof those what they call claims, so\n\n639\n00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.930\nthat you can gain access to\nthose network resources as well.\n\n640\n00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:35.660\nBut usually on a regular computer we're\nprobably joining to a domain or we're\n\n641\n00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.930\nactually probably using something like VPN\nto help us get connected to our network.\n\n642\n00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:42.040\nSo as neat as it is it's only designed for\n\n643\n00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:46.410\nthose devices that don't have\nthe capability to join that domain.\n\n644\n00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.065\n>> Excellent.\nWell that makes it nice and neat for\n\n645\n00:31:49.065 --> 00:31:52.700\nin those times when all you've done is\nthrown your, your tablet in your bag.\n\n646\n00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.480\nOr all you have is your phone or\nsome other type of mobile device.\n\n647\n00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.030\nYou need to do some quick work.\n\n648\n00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:58.810\nHopefully you can use\nthat option right there.\n\n649\n00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:00.010\nGain access to those resources.\n\n650\n00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:01.800\nMake the changes you need.\n\n651\n00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.260\nAll right, Ronny looks like\nwe've come on to the end of yet\n\n652\n00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.690\nanother really awesome show.\n\n653\n00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:06.815\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n654\n00:32:06.815 --> 00:32:07.941\nThat fingerprint stuff was awesome.\n\n655\n00:32:07.941 --> 00:32:10.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know I had a good time with that.\n\n656\n00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.680\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n657\n00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.550\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n658\n00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.150\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n659\n00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.482\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n660\n00:32:18.482 -->

to\nanother fantastic episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.671\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\n\n5\n00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:22.020\nhere with me is none other than\nthe Hyper-V man himself, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.810\nHow is it going Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.173\n>> It is going, well,\nHyper-V is what we're talking about here.\n\n8\n00:00:26.173 --> 00:00:30.206\nWe we're taking a look at Windows 10,\nespecially at securing things like\n\n9\n00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:34.680\nHyper-V, and it's authentication as well,\nand the reason why were talking about\n\n10\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.164\nWindows 10 and Hyper-V,\nwhy would we do something like that?\n\n11\n00:00:38.164 --> 00:00:42.939\nBecause, inside of Windows 10\nEnterprise you can actually turn on\n\n12\n00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:48.170\nthe Hyper-V features and ensure, and\nactually run a client hypervisor.\n\n13\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.860\nSo that way you can run virtual machines\non top of your Windows 10 machines\n\n14\n00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.050\nto make everything actually\nwork the way that you want to,\n\n15\n00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.920\nto do a testing environment if you want.\n\n16\n00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.481\nBut the problem with Hyper-V is fairly\nsimple and actually all the hypervisor\n\n17\n00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:05.111\nmanagers is that there is a chance,\nespecially on the host machine that you're\n\n18\n00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:09.948\nrunning, that someone could get access to\nthose machines by doing what they call,\n\n19\n00:01:09.948 --> 00:01:13.850\nthe idea of ripping passwords\nout when you're running Hyper-V.\n\n20\n00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.759\nAnd there's a utility out there called\nMemcats, is a utility that's out there,\n\n21\n00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.460\nthat's actually been shown\nthat you can do this.\n\n22\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.820\nWell of course Microsoft doesn't want\nanybody being able to do this and\n\n23\n00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.270\nsince we are talking about\nsupporting authentication,\n\n24\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.190\none of the ways that you and\nI can secure this, right?\n\n25\n00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.525\nIs to ensure that we're not\ngonna allow this to happen.\n\n26\n00:01:33.525 --> 00:01:37.070\nSo the way that we do that\nis fairly simple, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.370\nWhat you actually need to make\nsure that you understand though,\n\n28\n00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.530\nis that this helps to only\nprotect your domain credentials.\n\n29\n00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.450\nIt doesn't protect the local\nhost machine account itself.\n\n30\n00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.695\nSo if you do have that account out there,\nit's not going to protect that one, but\n\n31\n00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:53.152\nit will actually protect someone.\n\n32\n00:01:53.152 --> 00:01:57.536\nIf Daniel is logged in with his domain\ncredentials, and running Hyper-V,\n\n33\n00:01:57.536 --> 00:02:02.194\nit will protect his account, and it will\nalso protect other domain accounts that\n\n34\n00:02:02.194 --> 00:02:06.740\nare actually running inside of\nthat Hyper-V instance itself, too.\n\n35\n00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.650\nSo that is what we're really looking at.\n\n36\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.130\nAnd this is a fairly simple feature for\nus to be able to understand and\n\n37\n00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.270\nrealize, right?\n\n38\n00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.490\nSo, if you do have a machine\nthat's running there,\n\n39\n00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.990\nwhat you want to be able\nto do is fairly simple.\n\n40\n00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.210\nRemember you have to have a Windows\n10 Enterprise to run the Hyper-V,\n\n41\n00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.040\nyou have to make sure that\nfeature is turned on and\n\n42\n00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.080\nthat everything is actually\nworking the way that you need to.\n\n43\n00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.280\nAnd then at that point,\n\n44\n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.680\nthe way that this works is based off\nof something that we call Device Guard.\n\n45\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.490\nDevice Guard is a feature that is\ndesigned to ensure the applications that\n\n46\n00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.350\nare running inside of Windows 10,\nthat they are all digitally signed.\n\n47\n00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.428\nIn other words, it actually says, hey let\nme verify that you are digitally signed.\n\n48\n00:02:47.428 --> 00:02:50.010\nWell, the Hyper-V normally\ndoesn't run inside of Windows,\n\n49\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.280\nit runs outside of Windows itself, and\nso that's where the problem comes in.\n\n50\n00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.820\nSo what they've actually implemented\nis a way to do this inside of\n\n51\n00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.940\nthe virtualization\ntechnology software instead.\n\n52\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.990\nSo making sure that's actually all\nrunning, all you have to do is\n\n53\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.810\nonce everything else is running\nin the background and is up, and\n\n54\n00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.600\nI am running my virtual machine, you now\nhave a log-in for your domain credentials.\n\n55\n00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.870\nYou need to go back inside\nthe group policy and\n\n56\n00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.050\nmake sure that this setting\nis actually enabled.\n\n57\n00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.543\nLet me show you where that\nsetting actually is gonna be.\n\n58\n00:03:17.543 --> 00:03:21.434\nSo here it is,\nI'm on a domain logged on machine and so\n\n59\n00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:24.750\nI want to get into my group policy here.\n\n60\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.340\nI'm gonna do gpedit.msc and\nmake sure that I launch that up.\n\n61\n00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.200\nAnd once that comes on we wanna make sure\nthat we get into the actual settings here.\n\n62\n00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.720\nNow the problem that we have with this\nsetting is it doesn't show up with every\n\n63\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.440\nsingle machine because it does require\nsome hardware requirements as well.\n\n64\n00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.810\nSo if underneath computer configuration\nand administrative settings or\n\n65\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.190\nadministrative templates.\n\n66\n00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.179\nSo if computer configuration\nadministrative templates and system.\n\n67\n00:03:55.179 --> 00:04:00.060\nInside of system notice I have this\noption here and its called device guard.\n\n68\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.640\nNow the reason why I'm telling you this,\n\n69\n00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.150\nis that you might actually get on to a\ncomputer where you go, I'm gonna look for\n\n70\n00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.500\nthis setting, and\nyour setting may not be there.\n\n71\n00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.060\nAnd that is because for your machine\nto be able to use this Device Guard,\n\n72\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.070\nthat really is actually not dependent\non the operating system well,\n\n73\n00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.950\nyou have to have underlying\nhardware that supports this.\n\n74\n00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.000\nAnd so with that underlying hardware,\nif you have it, it will show up here.\n\n75\n00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.050\nIf you don't, it's not going to show up.\n\n76\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.170\nThat's really what it comes down to.\n\n77\n00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.810\nSo if you have this option,\nwhat you're looking for\n\n78\n00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.390\nis right here where it says\nTurn On Virtualization Based Security.\n\n79\n00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.410\nAnd once I do that the setting\nthat we're looking for\n\n80\n00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.160\nis only gonna show up once we hit enable.\n\n81\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.760\nAnd inside of enabled notice this,\nyou have enable credential guard and\n\n82\n00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.058\nenable virtualization\nprotection of code integrity.\n\n83\n00:04:49.058 --> 00:04:53.206\nSo notice it actually says hey we're going\nto actually implement at the platform\n\n84\n00:04:53.206 --> 00:04:54.550\nlevel at the secure boot.\n\n85\n00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.000\nAnd we can even do it with DMA protection\nnormally I'm just gonna leave it\n\n86\n00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.060\nat secure boot.\n\n87\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.190\nAnd the option that we're looking for\nis right here.\n\n88\n00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.070\nEnable credential guard instead.\n\n89\n00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.840\nAnd when you enable the credential guard,\n\n90\n00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.920\nit tells you the setting let's you\ndecide whether or not users can turn on\n\n91\n00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.140\ncredential guard with virtualization\nbase don't protect credentials.\n\n92\n00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.820\nAnd since we're talking about\nsupport authentication that's\n\n93\n00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.870\nwhat this setting is designed to do.\n\n94\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.873\nIt helps to protect domain-based\ncredentials inside of Hyper-V as well as\n\n95\n00:05:23.873 --> 00:05:29.122\na machine that's joined to your domain\nrunning Hyper-V and that is part of it.\n\n96\n00:05:29.122 --> 00:05:32.250\nAnd that's why it can actually work is\nbecause it's based in the hardware.\n\n97\n00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.060\nThat's one of the factors that they\nreally want you to actually know for\n\n98\n00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.150\na setting if you actually need to do that.\n\n99\n00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.950\nYou need to be able to know that device\nguard may appear and it may not.\n\n100\n00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.340\nIf it is, you're looking for\n\n101\n00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.130\njust that setting itself where it\nsays to enable credential guard,\n\n102\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.180\nyou need to know its location by turning\non virtualization based security.\n\n103\n00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.756\nOnce you have that in place,\nyou reboot the machine, and now\n\n104\n00:05:54.756 --> 00:05:59.598\nyou will actually be running that device\nguard and everything else that you work,\n\n105\n00:05:59.598 --> 00:06:03.339\nthis will prevent things like\nmemcats from actually working.\n\n106\n00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:07.133\nBecause memcats really does depend on\nbeing able to access you RAM whereas\n\n107\n00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.040\nthe way that the device guard works.\n\n108\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.977\nIt works inside of a very secure\nspace inside a RAM that memcats will\n\n109\n00:06:13.977 --> 00:06:15.960\nnot be able to access.\n\n110\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.834\nSo it is really a protective feature,\nit is really an advance feature,\n\n111\n00:06:19.834 --> 00:06:24.033\nsomething that you can implement inside\nof Windows 10 to help to protect for\n\n112\n00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:25.923\nauthentication's sake as well.\n\n113\n00:06:25.923 --> 00:06:29.751\nSo when we take a look at this episode,\nas short as it is, it's a very\n\n114\n00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:34.547\nimportant episode because virtualization\nis a technology that's not going away.\n\n115\n00:06:34.547 --> 00:06:39.859\nSo much so we actually have another\nseparate episode just on Hyper-V and\n\n116\n00:06:39.859 --> 00:06:41.170\nWindow's 10.\n\n117\n00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:46.240\nSo there is more coming up, but as far as\nthe authentication part, that's about it.\n\n118\n00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.990\nMaking sure you know where that\nsetting is is gonna be very key for\n\n119\n00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.630\nyou when getting ready for the exam.\n\n120\n00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.760\n>> That's right.\nThat's one of\n\n121\n00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.920\nthe favorite things that\nMicrosoft likes to do,\n\n122\n00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.970\nis to find those little hidey\nhole things that they put away.\n\n123\n00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:57.880\nBut it's very,\n\n124\n00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.250\nvery important because like Ronnie said\nvirtualization that isn't going anywhere.\n\n125\n00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.310\nDomains and crackers and credentials and\n\n126\n00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.940\nthings of that nature, they're gonna\nstick around for quite some time.\n\n127\n00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.870\nSo we've gotta do what we can to make\nsure those environments are safe, secure,\n\n128\n00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.860\nthat our users don't gets compromised, and\nthat our data doesn't get compromised.\n\n129\n00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.420\nThey build that feature right into the\nHyper-V, you gotta really love Microsoft\n\n130\n00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.510\non this, they really think about\nthese things a lot because well,\n\n131\n00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.920\nthey're one of the largest\ncompanies on the Earth.\n\n132\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.050\nThey hold so much of the market\nshare when it comes to desktops, and\n\n133\n00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.630\nserver applications,\nand operating systems.\n\n134\n00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.020\nThey're a large target,\npeople are coming after them.\n\n135\n00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.300\nThey have to start forward thinking,\nwhich they've done, obviously.\n\n136\n00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.940\nThis is built-in to the new Windows 10\nversion here, to be able to stave off\n\n137\n00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.040\nthose attacks, help keep you, as a user,\nsecure in your knowledge that,\n\n138\n00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.760\nI can buy a Windows operating system and\nknow that I can keep the thing secure.\n\n139\n00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.660\nI just gotta know what buttons to push,\n\n140\n00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.050\nwhat checkmarks to check,\nto keep that thing up and\n\n141\n00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.520\nrunning if I implement certain types of\ntechnology that they allow me to use.\n\n142\n00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.380\nVery cool stuff, Ronnie.\n\n143\n00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.740\nI like it a lot.\n>> It really is.\n\n144\n00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.060\nIt's a technology that remember you're\ngonna have to be able to secure it.\n\n145\n00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.120\nSo if you run it,\nyou've gotta be able to secure it.\n\n146\n00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.360\nAuthentication is a huge part of\nwhat we have to worry about and\n\n147\n00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.340\ndeal with everyday as support technicians.\n\n148\n00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.670\nSo make sure you do pay attention not\nonly to the things like the Hyper-V here,\n\n149\n00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.550\nall of the actual supporting\nauthenticating sections\n\n150\n00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.580\nare really gonna help you to at least get\nfamiliar with what Windows 10 can support.\n\n151\n00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.200\nSo make sure you do view them.\n\n152\n00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.630\n>> All right, great words Ronnie.\n\n153\n00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.440\nHope you guys are listening out there and\npaying to that, because it is wisdom.\n\n154\n00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.470\nTake it in, soak it in.\n\n155\n00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.330\nNow, I know this episode's been short and\nsweet, but we're gonna go ahead and\n\n156\n00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.190\ngive it a call, and call it a day.\n\n157\n00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.500\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n158\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.206\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n159\n00:08:38.206 --> 00:08:40.425\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n160\n00:08:40.425 --> 00:08:45.674\n[SOUND]\n\n",

exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.920\nI'm your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n5\n00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.200\nJoining me today in the studio is\nnone other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.290\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.360\n>> It is going well today.\n\n8\n00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.570\nIt's another great day to be right here,\ntaking a look at more Windows 10 content.\n\n9\n00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.070\nRight?\nWe're getting ready for\n\n10\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.690\nthat exam that 70697 exam,\nconfiguring Windows devices.\n\n11\n00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.460\nAnd what we're doing today is taking\na look at one of these neat technologies\n\n12\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.840\nthat now are included in\nthe client side operating system.\n\n13\n00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.390\nIt used to be just in the realm of servers\nand production networks, but today you and\n\n14\n00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.580\nI can actually run something\nthat we call a Client Hyper-V.\n\n15\n00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.668\nNow Daniel, do you know what\nClient Hyper-V actually is for?\n\n16\n00:00:53.668 --> 00:00:55.130\n>> Yes, Client Hyper-V's well,\n\n17\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.270\nthey are the hyper visor,\nthat is the virtual machines.\n\n18\n00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.090\nI wanna create virtual environment inside\nof my actual physical environment.\n\n19\n00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.650\nSo I've got a computer.\n\n20\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.270\nI said, you know what?\n\n21\n00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.750\nIt'd be nice if I could maybe work\nwith another operating system.\n\n22\n00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.470\nOr, maybe I want to install the latest.\n\n23\n00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.741\nWindows 10 is out,\nmaybe I'm still running Windows 8.1.\n\n24\n00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:15.380\nI wanna give it a shot before\nI do a full blown upgrade.\n\n25\n00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.228\nWell, I could use Hyper-V, and\n\n26\n00:01:17.228 --> 00:01:22.190\nthe good thing is is Windows 10 comes with\nHyper-V installed, ready to rock and roll.\n\n27\n00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.190\nAnd, Ronnie, that's what you're\ngoing to kind of walk us through and\n\n28\n00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.160\nguide us hand by hand, down the path\nof using Hyper-V and Windows 10.\n\n29\n00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.800\n>> That is true.\n\n30\n00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.745\nEverything that Daniel told you is why we\nwould actually choose to do something like\n\n31\n00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:34.770\nHyper-V.\n\n32\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.740\nAnd now, it's included in the client\noperating system that is Windows 10.\n\n33\n00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.430\nNow, just because I say that, you might be\nrunning out like, I don't see it anywhere.\n\n34\n00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.050\nI don't know how to do that.\n\n35\n00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.940\nWe're gonna show you how to put\nthat on your computer and also,\n\n36\n00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.075\nof course, how to actually bring up and\n\n37\n00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:53.285\ncreate your first VM inside a client\nHyper-V if you have not done so before.\n\n38\n00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:58.115\nNow of course, before we do so, like\neverything else, there are some caveats.\n\n39\n00:01:58.115 --> 00:02:00.842\nThere are a little bit of\nthings that we have to go over.\n\n40\n00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:04.452\nWhich is to understand that there\nare system requirements that are involved\n\n41\n00:02:04.452 --> 00:02:07.392\nif you are gonna run the client Hyper-V.\n\n42\n00:02:07.392 --> 00:02:11.182\nNow, Daniel and I have been working\nwith virtualization technology for,\n\n43\n00:02:11.182 --> 00:02:13.092\nI'm gonna say a decade at least, right?\n\n44\n00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:16.402\nSo close to a decade of not actually,\nover a decade now, and\n\n45\n00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.802\nwe've seen many forms of it come along.\n\n46\n00:02:18.802 --> 00:02:22.330\nAnd during those days, it's always\nbeen about the requirements, right?\n\n47\n00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.220\nCan your machine do what it needs to do?\n\n48\n00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.030\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n49\n00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.830\ntalk about some of those requirements\nthat we have to understand?\n\n50\n00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.150\nAnd we're running Windows 10,\nyou might think all right.\n\n51\n00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.790\nI've got Windows 10 on my computer,\ncan I run?\n\n52\n00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.930\nWell, you have to actually have some\nof the special editions of Windows.\n\n53\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.917\nNow I say special, it's not really as\nspecial as much as these editions, right?\n\n54\n00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:43.877\nSo you have to be running Windows 10 Pro,\n\n55\n00:02:43.877 --> 00:02:48.253\nthe professional edition of it,\nor Windows 10 Enterprise.\n\n56\n00:02:48.253 --> 00:02:50.213\nThose are the two that I knew about, but\n\n57\n00:02:50.213 --> 00:02:53.196\nthere's also another one\ncalled Windows 10 Education.\n\n58\n00:02:53.196 --> 00:02:56.681\nWhich is of course, it sounds like it's\ndesigned for educational facilities to be\n\n59\n00:02:56.681 --> 00:03:00.065\nable to actually install those on\ncomputers in different licensing model.\n\n60\n00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:01.456\n>> It went to Oxford.\n\n61\n00:03:01.456 --> 00:03:02.773\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it might be very educated.\n\n62\n00:03:02.773 --> 00:03:05.096\nWe might have a degreed Windows 10 there.\n\n63\n00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:07.227\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we might have something like that.\n\n64\n00:03:07.227 --> 00:03:11.357\n>> But, this also means that there are\nadditions of Windows 10 it can’t run on.\n\n65\n00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:16.057\nSo if you are running the home\nedition of Windows 10, no bueno,\n\n66\n00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:17.817\nas Dan likes to say it.\n\n67\n00:03:17.817 --> 00:03:18.837\nHe says no bueno.\n\n68\n00:03:18.837 --> 00:03:20.217\nAnd that’s what we really mean.\n\n69\n00:03:20.217 --> 00:03:21.627\nOr mobile addition or\n\n70\n00:03:21.627 --> 00:03:26.517\neven mobile enterprise, these are the\neditions that you cannot actually find\n\n71\n00:03:26.517 --> 00:03:30.820\nthe way that you have Hyper-V\ninstalled into your machines as well.\n\n72\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.880\nSo just kinda realize that.\n\n73\n00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.850\nThe Pro, the Enterprise, and\nthe educational version, perfectly fine.\n\n74\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.200\nThey actually have those on there and\nready to go.\n\n75\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.130\nNow, that is kinda the only real\nsoftware limitation that you and\n\n76\n00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.950\nI are going to actually have to deal with.\n\n77\n00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.180\nOr requirement, I should say,\nI shouldn't say limitation.\n\n78\n00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.750\nRequirement that you have to deal with.\n\n79\n00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.480\nThe other one is on the hardware\nthat you're gonna run it on,\n\n80\n00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.270\nit requires a minimum of 4 GB of RAM.\n\n81\n00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.500\nNow Daniel, it doesn't sound bad,\nbut it's not great, right?\n\n82\n00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.880\n>> Yeah, when it comes to virtualization,\nbigger is always better.\n\n83\n00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.032\nThe more RAM you have, the better.\n\n84\n00:04:08.032 --> 00:04:12.680\n4 GB is, it's okay, but\nyou're gonna wanna really.\n\n85\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.660\nBecause you gotta remember,\n\n86\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.440\nyou're allocating actual hardware\nto the virtual environment, right?\n\n87\n00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.770\nYou're sharing it out.\n\n88\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.285\nIt's like kindergarten, we learn to share.\n\n89\n00:04:21.285 --> 00:04:25.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So these computers, four will do you,\n\n90\n00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.330\nit'll get you there.\n\n91\n00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.690\nBut if you can get more,\nit's definitely better.\n\n92\n00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.990\n>> There is no doubt that normally what\nwe're actually saying here is fairly.\n\n93\n00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.530\nLet me put it in better layman's terms.\n\n94\n00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.962\nIf you're running one virtual machine and\none WIndows 10 machine,\n\n95\n00:04:36.962 --> 00:04:41.762\n4 GB is probably enough cuz what you can\ndo then, is share that memory, right?\n\n96\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.690\n2 GB for the machine you are running,\nand then 2 GB for\n\n97\n00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.786\nthe virtual machine, but\nDaniel said is key here.\n\n98\n00:04:47.786 --> 00:04:50.780\nThe more RAM that you can have for\n\n99\n00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.960\nyour virtual machines,\nthe better it's going to be.\n\n100\n00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.890\nBecause what you don't\nto do is say all right,\n\n101\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.410\nI think I'm just going to\ngive it 256 megs of RAM.\n\n102\n00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.780\nWell, you can't even install Windows\n10 with that, so you can limit it, but\n\n103\n00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.190\nyou actually want to make\nsure you give enough RAM.\n\n104\n00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.760\nAnd usually the minimal parameters for\n\n105\n00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.730\ninstalling an operating system\nis what we're talking about.\n\n106\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.880\nAnd then if you're trying to\nrun multiple VMs, multiple\n\n107\n00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.180\nvirtual machines on a single host,\nyou'll want to have more and more RAM.\n\n108\n00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.880\nThe more, the better at this point, too,\nis also what we're looking for, as well.\n\n109\n00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.980\nNow, we also want to make sure that\nwe understand something else, too,\n\n110\n00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.760\nwhich is really about the processor\n>> And this is key.\n\n111\n00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.550\nThere are other virtual machine\nenvironments that are out there.\n\n112\n00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.240\nIf you've heard of Oracle's Virtual Box.\n\n113\n00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.597\nI just can't remember that name,\nand I've used it for years.\n\n114\n00:05:38.597 --> 00:05:42.450\nVM Fusion, VM Workstation,\nall those, right?\n\n115\n00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.510\nAll them can actually work and\ndo what they need to do.\n\n116\n00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.270\nBut, this one also requires\nyou to have what we call\n\n117\n00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.710\nsecond level address\ntranslation on your CPU.\n\n118\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.490\nNow, this is actually important because it\nmeans that if your CPU cannot handle that.\n\n119\n00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.360\nIn other words, if it doesn't support, and\n\n120\n00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.770\nsometimes you see this written as SLAT,\nS-L-A-T.\n\n121\n00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.180\nAll in capital letters.\n\n122\n00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.090\nIf your CPU does not support SLAT,\nthen the client Hyper-V,\n\n123\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.930\nyou may be able to see it,\nbut it's gonna be grayed out.\n\n124\n00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.320\nAnd, we'll show you what we're\ntalking about there too.\n\n125\n00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.880\nYou might see it, and it's like yeah,\nI know I'm running pro.\n\n126\n00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.670\nAnd then you go and your like,\noh I can't select it.\n\n127\n00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.490\nMore than likely it doesn't support that.\n\n128\n00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.230\nSecond level address\ntranslation is kind of special,\n\n129\n00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.570\nit's what we call nested\npaging a lot of times.\n\n130\n00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.660\nSo, you might see like in Intel,\nthat's what they call it, nested paging.\n\n131\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.680\nIn AMD, they call it, actually in Intel,\nit's called extended paging tables.\n\n132\n00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.680\nAnd you also hear the term nested paging.\n\n133\n00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.970\nIn the AMD, it's RDI or\n\n134\n00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.300\nrapid virtualization indexing\nis what they're calling.\n\n135\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.180\nAnd you're like, what is all this about?\n\n136\n00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.130\nWell, in the regular VF that doesn't\nsupport it, what does it do for RAM?\n\n137\n00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.090\nWhat it does is it creates a paging phone.\n\n138\n00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.820\nIt really does, it's a virtual\npaging phone that represents RAM.\n\n139\n00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.070\nSo it's not really\naccessing RAM on your PC.\n\n140\n00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.880\nAnd it doesn't actually have\na place to be able to do that.\n\n141\n00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.960\nSo what it does it says,\nwell we'll kinda lie to the VM and\n\n142\n00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.210\nsay your RAM's actually this file.\n\n143\n00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.410\nAnd that can make it run\na little bit slower than normal.\n\n144\n00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.770\nAnd today's speed machines, it doesn't\nreally seem to make a difference.\n\n145\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.150\nBut Client Hyper-V says no, no, no,\nno, we're not having any of that.\n\n146\n00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.850\nSo second level address translation\nallows them to represent\n\n147\n00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.280\nRAM as actual spaces in RAM,\nin the virtual machine.\n\n148\n00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.750\nSo when the virtual machine looks\nat it and tries to write it,\n\n149\n00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.480\ndoesn't have to translate it in that\nspecial virtual machine language.\n\n150\n00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.550\nIt just says oh yeah, that looks\nlike a RAM address, let me use it.\n\n151\n00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.690\nSo that's what we really want.\n\n152\n00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.424\nSo if you're gonna try and do that, make\nsure that your CPU on the machine that\n\n153\n00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:44.962\nyou're running supports\nthe actual requirement.\n\n154\n00:07:44.962 --> 00:07:49.676\nNow, you might be wondering, how the heck\ndo I find out all that information?\n\n155\n00:07:49.676 --> 00:07:50.639\nYou can go and do research.\n\n156\n00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:53.831\nWe love going to our favorite\nsearch engine and do all that.\n\n157\n00:07:53.831 --> 00:07:55.179\nBut, Daniel, I have an easier way.\n\n158\n00:07:55.179 --> 00:07:56.397\n>> You do have an easier way.\n\n159\n00:07:56.397 --> 00:08:00.077\nI was looking at this before the show,\nand I'm like wow,\n\n160\n00:08:00.077 --> 00:08:02.310\nI wish I knew this before the show.\n\n161\n00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.610\nThis would have been so much more helpful.\n\n162\n00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.160\nRonnie, Windows actually has it built\nin to show you exactly whether or\n\n163\n00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.820\nnot you can run this business, doesn't it?\n\n164\n00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.510\n>> It really does.\n\n165\n00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.170\nLet's show you how to actually\nsee that if you're not sure.\n\n166\n00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.860\nSo, if you want to actually run and\n\n167\n00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.570\nbe able to install something like Hyper-V,\non your machine.\n\n168\n00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.980\nThe easiest way to do this is\nto bring up the command prompt.\n\n169\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.281\nAnd once we bring up the command prompt,\noh let me make that a little bit larger,\n\n170\n00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:26.429\nI know that everybody has.\n\n171\n00:08:26.429 --> 00:08:28.125\n>> Everyone else loves their tiny,\nfaded fonts.\n\n172\n00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:30.063\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, they love that.\n\n173\n00:08:30.063 --> 00:08:33.213\nYeah, it's awesome until\nyou can't see it and\n\n174\n00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:37.770\nyou're standing two feet away\nfrom the actual device itself.\n\n175\n00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.620\nSo, that should be a lot better there.\n\n176\n00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.252\nHopefully, you can see that.\n\n177\n00:08:41.252 --> 00:08:46.143\nThe key here for\nus is gonna be systeminfo.exe,\n\n178\n00:08:46.143 --> 00:08:49.375\nand when I go ahead and run that.\n\n179\n00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:53.655\nWhat's gonna happen here is it's gonna\ntell me whether or not it can support it.\n\n180\n00:08:53.655 --> 00:08:55.175\nSo what we're looking for, and\n\n181\n00:08:55.175 --> 00:08:57.755\nthis actually scrolled it all\nthe way down to the bottom,\n\n182\n00:08:57.755 --> 00:09:00.645\nyou can use this command to see a lot\nof information about your machine.\n\n183\n00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:04.040\nAnd don't get me wrong, there's a lot\nthat we could talk about here but\n\n184\n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.815\nI need to focus in or I'm not gonna\never get through with this episode.\n\n185\n00:09:06.815 --> 00:09:09.295\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I know I get so distracted.\n\n186\n00:09:09.295 --> 00:09:10.411\nOh, that's some neat information.\n\n187\n00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:11.044\n>> He's like a cat,\n\n188\n00:09:11.044 --> 00:09:13.336\nhe's sees something sharp or\nshiny and he starts batting at it.\n\n189\n00:09:13.336 --> 00:09:14.253\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n190\n00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:15.437\nSquirrel!\n\n191\n00:09:15.437 --> 00:09:20.450\n[LAUGH] That actually is me more\ndescriptively than anything else.\n\n192\n00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.810\nIf I can actually get all the way down to\nthe bottom that's what we're looking for,\n\n193\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:24.370\nwhich is right here.\n\n194\n00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.000\nI was trying to highlight it and\nhighlighted everything else.\n\n195\n00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.860\nSo, what we're looking for is right there\nwhere it says Hyper-V requirements.\n\n196\n00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.570\nAnd yes, every single one of\nthese needs to actually be a yes.\n\n197\n00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.110\nOkay?\n\n198\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.830\nIf you're gonna try and\nrun the client Hyper-V.\n\n199\n00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.740\nIf one of these is a no, that means\nyou will not be able to support it, so\n\n200\n00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.610\nthat is an easier way to do that.\n\n201\n00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.760\nNow if you didn't do that,\nyou actually probably have to go and\n\n202\n00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.810\nfind the info on your CPU and\ngo, oh yes, I have that.\n\n203\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.010\nAnd you go and find out,\ndo I have enough RAM, do I have that?\n\n204\n00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.120\nAnd then of course your\nhard drive as well.\n\n205\n00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.100\nSo the hard drive is not really so\nmuch of a concern.\n\n206\n00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.330\nBut the better,\n\n207\n00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:03.010\nthe faster the drive, of course the better\nyour machines are also gonna run as well.\n\n208\n00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.550\nSo you can kind of call\nit a Ronnie requirement.\n\n209\n00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.380\nLet's put it that way.\n\n210\n00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.075\nYeah, and let's not say that Windows\nrequires you to have a gigantic\n\n211\n00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:09.597\nhard drive.\n\n212\n00:10:09.597 --> 00:10:12.147\nBut the faster the hard drive,\nthe more space you have,\n\n213\n00:10:12.147 --> 00:10:14.876\nthe better your machines are also\ngoing to end up being too.\n\n214\n00:10:14.876 --> 00:10:16.576\nA Ron-quirement.\n\n215\n00:10:16.576 --> 00:10:17.878\n>> Yes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n216\n00:10:17.878 --> 00:10:19.415\n>> That was, oh my side, yeah,\n\n217\n00:10:19.415 --> 00:10:21.082\nI can't believe you said that.\n\n218\n00:10:21.082 --> 00:10:22.545\nSo, no, that's fine.\n\n219\n00:10:22.545 --> 00:10:24.077\nSo, when we start taking a look here.\n\n220\n00:10:24.077 --> 00:10:25.060\nRight?\n\n221\n00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.100\nWhat we want to do is just simply go,\nall right.\n\n222\n00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.230\nSo now we have the minimum requirements.\n\n223\n00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.590\nWe know that we can identify them,\nwe know what they are,\n\n224\n00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.600\nwe know what additional windows\nwe're running so we are ready to go.\n\n225\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.320\nRight?\n\n226\n00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.760\nSo all we need to do is go and\nfind Hyper-V.\n\n227\n00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:44.020\nWell Daniel, if I try and look for it in\nall my apps over here I don't see it.\n\n228\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:50.068\nI should be able to go down to the H's\nhere, I see an HP AiO printer remote.\n\n229\n00:10:50.068 --> 00:10:51.090\n>> Maybe the search bar.\n\n230\n00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.494\n>> Maybe the search bar.\n\n231\n00:10:52.494 --> 00:10:53.853\nThat'll help you find stuff.\n\n232\n00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:55.020\n>> I can actually do that.\n\n233\n00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.545\nHyper-V.\n\n234\n00:10:57.545 --> 00:10:58.960\nOh, no.\n\n235\n00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.982\nBut it is actually leaving.\n\n236\n00:10:59.982 --> 00:11:00.596\n>> We lost.\n\n237\n00:11:00.596 --> 00:11:01.444\n>> Yeah, we did.\n\n238\n00:11:01.444 --> 00:11:04.249\nIt is showing me where I do need\nto go to turn this thing on, but\n\n239\n00:11:04.249 --> 00:11:07.445\nlet's show you exactly where it is,\ninstead of you trying to guess.\n\n240\n00:11:07.445 --> 00:11:09.995\nSo I just need to get\ninto my Control Panel.\n\n241\n00:11:09.995 --> 00:11:14.325\nSo I'm gonna right-click on the Windows\nbutton and go to Control Panel.\n\n242\n00:11:14.325 --> 00:11:17.780\nDon't forget, there's many ways that you\ncan get access to the Control Panel.\n\n243\n00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.970\nAnd I don't know why my machines\ndoes that kind of fade in and\n\n244\n00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.720\nthen fades it all the way back out again,\nbut we have it here.\n\n245\n00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.630\nAnd then we go down to where it says\nprograms, and once we have programs.\n\n246\n00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.000\nI'm going to select\nTurn Windows Features On and Off.\n\n247\n00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.610\nI'm gonna repeat everything that I say.\n\n248\n00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.502\nI'm gonna do my own echo.\n\n249\n00:11:38.502 --> 00:11:39.401\n>> [SOUND]\n>> Yeah.\n\n250\n00:11:39.401 --> 00:11:42.780\nSo, here we are, and\nthis is what we're looking for.\n\n251\n00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.100\nIf you see Hyper-V and\n\n252\n00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.030\nit is active, in other words,\nyou can put a check mark into it.\n\n253\n00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:50.730\nYou're gonna find that means that hey,\nWindows has met all the requirements.\n\n254\n00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:56.010\nYou see this and it's grayed out and\nit doesn't allow you to check that box.\n\n255\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.690\nIt means, again,\nyou're not going to be able to do it.\n\n256\n00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.180\nThat's a very key feature to think about.\n\n257\n00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.410\nNow, you'll notice that there's\na little plus sign in front of this.\n\n258\n00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.810\nIf I go and expand that out,\nI have two options here.\n\n259\n00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:12.140\nIf I'm going to create virtual machines,\nI'm going to need the Hyper-V platform.\n\n260\n00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.205\nAnd the little screen tells you.\n\n261\n00:12:14.205 --> 00:12:17.510\nProvides the services that you need,\nthat you can use to create and\n\n262\n00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:21.270\nmanage virtual machines and\ntheir resources.\n\n263\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.800\nNotice that I also have a Hyper-V\nmanagement tools as well.\n\n264\n00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:32.100\nIncludes [LAUGH] GUI and command\nline tools for managing Hyper-V too.\n\n265\n00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.900\nNow when you take a look at both of those,\n\n266\n00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.960\nyou might wonder why in\nthe world would I want that?\n\n267\n00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.580\nWell you may actually be\nscripting a lot of this stuff out.\n\n268\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.510\nOr you might be able to get someone\nlike Daniel to script it out for\n\n269\n00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.720\nyou, to be able to do a lot of this stuff\nthat we need to be able to do here.\n\n270\n00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.430\nSo it's fairly easy if,\nI'm saying I know I need to run it,\n\n271\n00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.370\nbut I don't know how to\nactually get it installed.\n\n272\n00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.660\nI don't know how to do all that.\n\n273\n00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.490\nIt could be that someone in your\nenterprise says, no problem, let me script\n\n274\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.270\nit out and all you have to do is run\nthe script and get all that done.\n\n275\n00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.460\nAnd it actually may even be to that\npoint where you can turn it on\n\n276\n00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.060\nfrom the command line as well.\n\n277\n00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.340\nNow here we show you\nthe GUI way of doing it,\n\n278\n00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.390\nthe GUI, the graphical user interface,\nbut there is another way to do this.\n\n279\n00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.420\nNow, we're going to come\nback to this because, well,\n\n280\n00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.800\nI don't really like typing that much but\nI will kind of show you the command here.\n\n281\n00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.495\nSo there is actually a command.\n\n282\n00:13:18.495 --> 00:13:21.445\nI'm gonna run it in administrative\nmode because I am making a fundamental\n\n283\n00:13:21.445 --> 00:13:23.045\nsystem change.\n\n284\n00:13:23.045 --> 00:13:27.793\nAnd I am gonna run this as\nthe administrator, but this command is.\n\n285\n00:13:27.793 --> 00:13:29.255\nActually I'm even telling\nyou the wrong one.\n\n286\n00:13:29.255 --> 00:13:30.625\nIt's actually in PowerShell.\n\n287\n00:13:30.625 --> 00:13:32.095\nSo I need to run it from PowerShell.\n\n288\n00:13:32.095 --> 00:13:33.705\nThat's actually even better.\n\n289\n00:13:33.705 --> 00:13:35.097\nI type in PowerShell.\n\n290\n00:13:35.097 --> 00:13:39.620\nI'm going to right-click on that and\nselect run as administrator.\n\n291\n00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.040\nI was about to run it in the entire wrong\nconsole, and that would not have worked.\n\n292\n00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.310\nAnd here in PowerShell,\nif it ever kicks in, there we go.\n\n293\n00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.100\nIt is taking a little bit of\nits sweet time in looking for\n\n294\n00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.140\nthe command prompt to come up.\n\n295\n00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.210\nI was like maybe it's the half PowerShell\nis what we're taking a look at here.\n\n296\n00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.982\nSo, oh, there it goes.\n\n297\n00:13:58.982 --> 00:13:59.678\nSee?\n\n298\n00:13:59.678 --> 00:14:00.810\nJust have to wait.\n\n299\n00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.794\nAgain, the patience that I'm supposed\nto have is not my patience with\n\n300\n00:14:03.794 --> 00:14:05.017\nWindows 10 for right now.\n\n301\n00:14:05.017 --> 00:14:06.821\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So then,\n\n302\n00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:12.030\nwe simply start typing in enable,\nand then Windows optional.\n\n303\n00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.410\nAnd after a while, if I actually can type\nenough of it, I can use the tab key and\n\n304\n00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.580\nthat will fill it in.\n\n305\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.580\nAnd that helps a lot because it\nprevents things like typos here.\n\n306\n00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.980\nWindowsoptionalfeature and\nthen I'm gonna do a space dash online,\n\n307\n00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:32.032\nand then a feature name.\n\n308\n00:14:32.032 --> 00:14:34.900\nNow you might be wondering,\nwhat the heck is the online about?\n\n309\n00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.450\nIt's because I'm actually\nrunning it on this one and\n\n310\n00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.450\nright now Windows 10 is actually on.\n\n311\n00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.470\nSo I'm not doing an offline\ntype of servicing here.\n\n312\n00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:51.540\nAnd what I want here would\nbe microsoft-hyper-v.\n\n313\n00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.315\nAnd then I would do a -all.\n\n314\n00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.080\nIs what we would do.\n\n315\n00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.439\nNow I'm not going to do this right now\nbecause I'd like to show you through\n\n316\n00:14:58.439 --> 00:14:59.372\nthe GUI interface.\n\n317\n00:14:59.372 --> 00:15:01.729\nAnd just see it's gonna have to reboot and\ndo everything and\n\n318\n00:15:01.729 --> 00:15:03.310\ntell you what happens from here.\n\n319\n00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:04.940\nBut you simply run this, and\n\n320\n00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.730\nthen it will do all the same\nthings that we're going to do.\n\n321\n00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.180\nNow, it is essential at this point,\nand when you're preparing for\n\n322\n00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.130\nthe exam, you've gotta know\nthat both ways are possible.\n\n323\n00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.090\nAnd if you take a look here,\nthe syntax actually does make sense.\n\n324\n00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:16.600\nRight.\n\n325\n00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.680\nYou're enabling an optional feature\nin Microsoft called Hyper-V and\n\n326\n00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.600\nyou're telling it to install\nboth of those components,\n\n327\n00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.060\nall the components that are there.\n\n328\n00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.200\nSo that's what we see.\n\n329\n00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.310\nAnd we're going to do it the other way,\ncuz that's probably more common and\n\n330\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:33.390\nwhat most of us are going to probably end\nup opening the PowerShell to do this.\n\n331\n00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:38.318\nSo I'm going to go back to Control Panel\nand inside of Control Panel\n\n332\n00:15:38.318 --> 00:15:42.908\ngo down to Programs and\nthen Turn Windows Features On and Off.\n\n333\n00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.956\nThen I'm going to verify that when I put\na check mark it actually selects both of\n\n334\n00:15:48.956 --> 00:15:49.830\nthose features.\n\n335\n00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.285\nAnd then click OK.\n\n336\n00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.584\nNow when I do this,\n\n337\n00:15:53.584 --> 00:15:58.720\nwhat is actually going to happen\nhere is kind of a neat thing, right?\n\n338\n00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.820\nSo it used to be that you'd actually\ndownload some type of a hypervisor,\n\n339\n00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.660\nlike the Oracle VirtualBox, right?\n\n340\n00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.940\nThat runs on top of your operating system,\nand runs as another application.\n\n341\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.830\nAnd then you can install\nan operating system, and\n\n342\n00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.100\nrun that as an application,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n343\n00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.870\nWhat Hyper-V is doing right here,\nwhen it's asking me to restart,\n\n344\n00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.999\nis that it's gonna do something\na little bit different.\n\n345\n00:16:21.999 --> 00:16:23.043\nWhat it's gonna do,\n\n346\n00:16:23.043 --> 00:16:26.410\nit's gonna install the hypervisor\ndirectly on top of the hardware.\n\n347\n00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.151\nNow, you're like, what is that about?\n\n348\n00:16:28.151 --> 00:16:32.040\nWell, remember that what we have now\nis gonna actually change the way that\n\n349\n00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.375\nthe operating system is going to function.\n\n350\n00:16:34.375 --> 00:16:37.311\nSo, whereas before, when you and\nI would buy a piece of hardware,\n\n351\n00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:38.995\nwe'd install Windows 10, great.\n\n352\n00:16:38.995 --> 00:16:41.787\nWell, that runs on top of\nthe hardware at that point and\n\n353\n00:16:41.787 --> 00:16:44.289\nthen we install our\napplications on top of that.\n\n354\n00:16:44.289 --> 00:16:48.790\nWell the way that the hypervisor works in\nWindows 10 is that it wants to install\n\n355\n00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.229\nthe hypervisor underneath your\ncurrent operating system.\n\n356\n00:16:52.229 --> 00:16:55.697\nSo what you're gonna end up seeing after\na while is, actually it's gonna reboot\n\n357\n00:16:55.697 --> 00:16:59.267\na couple of times, and I don't know if our\nscreen sharing will actually show us that\n\n358\n00:16:59.267 --> 00:17:02.329\nhere, but my machine will reboot twice or\nmaybe even three times or so.\n\n359\n00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:06.057\nAnd the first time is letting Hyper-V\nget installed into Windows and\n\n360\n00:17:06.057 --> 00:17:10.572\nthen it's gonna reboot again and\nwhat's gonna happen is it's going to flip.\n\n361\n00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:13.880\nThe Hyper-V and\nthe operating system is gonna flip so\n\n362\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.340\nthat now the hypervisor is\nactually on the bare metal.\n\n363\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:21.450\nIt's actually running and using all the\nsystem resources, and now the operating\n\n364\n00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.810\nsystem that I'm using is really just\na host virtual machine instead,\n\n365\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.580\nand then we can create other virtual\nmachines along inside of it.\n\n366\n00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:35.030\nSo this allows, then, for even all of\nyour other virtual machines to access, or\n\n367\n00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:39.380\nto at least think it's accessing, all of\nthe hardware underneath it without having\n\n368\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.040\nto go through, well, the Windows operating\nsystem that was hosting it already and\n\n369\n00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.420\nthen do the same thing.\n\n370\n00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.450\nSo it's a very neat and\nimportant process, and\n\n371\n00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.240\nthat's why the second\nlevel address translation\n\n372\n00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.150\nis having to do what it's having to do,\nbut it does take a little bit of time.\n\n373\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.270\nAll right, so my machine has now finished\nit's rebooting process, and here I am.\n\n374\n00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.170\nI'm now ready to get back on\nmy machine and log in, and\n\n375\n00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.260\nlet's see what a difference it made here.\n\n376\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.370\nSo I'm simply going to get\nby the lock screen and\n\n377\n00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.850\nI'm gonna enter in my PIN, well maybe.\n\n378\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.380\nAnd that way we'll log right in.\n\n379\n00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:16.890\nThis time what I should end up seeing, of\ncourse, is inside of my Windows button and\n\n380\n00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:21.070\nmy start menu is I should also see,\nof course, the Hyper-V manager, and\n\n381\n00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:22.320\nthat's what we want to get to.\n\n382\n00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:27.660\nSo once everything is up, I should be able\nto come over here to the Windows button,\n\n383\n00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.490\nand that's actually good so far.\n\n384\n00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.760\nAll apps, and we'll give it a moment here.\n\n385\n00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.640\nAnd then if I scroll down,\nI try to scroll down,\n\n386\n00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.102\nI should see,\nthe Hyper-V did not actually install.\n\n387\n00:18:43.102 --> 00:18:45.651\nSo give it, wait,\nsomething is happening here,\n\n388\n00:18:45.651 --> 00:18:48.093\nmaybe I'm just not being\npatient enough here.\n\n389\n00:18:48.093 --> 00:18:49.209\n>> [CROSSTALK] your fatal flaw.\n\n390\n00:18:49.209 --> 00:18:51.060\n>> I know, yeah.\n\n391\n00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.340\nSo let's see if I can search for it.\n\n392\n00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.150\nHyper, oh, see, it is there,\nit just hasn't shown up in the menu.\n\n393\n00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:02.510\nSo my patience again, Daniel,\nyou might as well just say, Ronnie,\n\n394\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.240\njust chill, and\nthat would actually work better.\n\n395\n00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.090\nSo there it is, I actually did use\nthe future that Daniel asked me to use to\n\n396\n00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.375\nprovide better zen for\nme, the search feature.\n\n397\n00:19:11.375 --> 00:19:13.533\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And there it is, a Hyper-V manager.\n\n398\n00:19:13.533 --> 00:19:16.680\nAnd so I’m simply going to select\nthat from the nice search feature and\n\n399\n00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.700\nI better, no, no.\n\n400\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I’m joking,\n\n401\n00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:23.000\nit should come up here in just a moment\nand we should see the management console.\n\n402\n00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.200\nThe nice thing about the management\nconsole inside of an enterprise,\n\n403\n00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.490\nright, if you’re running Server 2008,\n\n404\n00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:33.260\nServer 20012, the Hyper-V manager\nlooks identical, it really does.\n\n405\n00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.460\nThe only thing that you actually end\nup will finding usually inside of that\n\n406\n00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.700\nenterprise situation, is there's going\nto be a lot more virtual machines and\n\n407\n00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.819\na lot of times you're going to see,\nof course,\n\n408\n00:19:42.819 --> 00:19:45.560\nstorage area networks attached and\neverything else, but\n\n409\n00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.080\nhere you're normally actually just\npulling up this one right here.\n\n410\n00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.490\nNow, when we take a look,\n\n411\n00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.850\nwe normally do not see virtual\nmachines already attached to this, but\n\n412\n00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:59.990\nthere was a time when I was running other\nvirtual machines on this, and so what's\n\n413\n00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:04.310\nactually happened is that it's even found\nthose already in existence, which is fine.\n\n414\n00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.860\nBut we wanna show you, though, is how\nto actually create a virtual machine,\n\n415\n00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.090\njust get started and\nrunning and ready to go.\n\n416\n00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.100\nSo what do we need there?\n\n417\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.080\nWell, we definitely need\nan installation disk, right?\n\n418\n00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.290\nIf you're gonna run Windows 10,\nif you're gonna run Server 2012,\n\n419\n00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.120\nif you're gonna run Windows 8.1,\nwhatever it is that you choose to run,\n\n420\n00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.710\nyou actually need to make sure\nyou have that installation disc.\n\n421\n00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.070\nSecondly, you need to make sure that\nyou have the proper licensing to run\n\n422\n00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.330\nthis as well.\n\n423\n00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.260\nSo that means you have to have, of course,\na product key and it's going to\n\n424\n00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.370\nneed to activate if you're going to keep\nthis machine up and running to do so.\n\n425\n00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.400\nNow you may say, yeah, but\nI only have one copy of it.\n\n426\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.520\nThe nice this is this,\n\n427\n00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.260\nright, is that even if you only have one\ncopy, you can go to Microsoft sites.\n\n428\n00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.110\nSo I'm not saying anything illegal for\nyou.\n\n429\n00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.680\n>> No bootlegging.\n\n430\n00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.540\n>> No bootlegging, don't bootleg.\n\n431\n00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.388\nThat is not a good thing.\n\n432\n00:20:47.388 --> 00:20:48.519\n>> I'm kidding, don't bootleg.\n\n433\n00:20:48.519 --> 00:20:49.156\n>> Yeah, don't bootleg.\n\n434\n00:20:49.156 --> 00:20:53.024\nBut you can go to Microsoft site and\nyou can download evaluation editions and\n\n435\n00:20:53.024 --> 00:20:56.920\nthey'll come in that same format\nthat you need it to, which is ISOS.\n\n436\n00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.290\nAnd all you do is you need to download\nthose and know exactly where you put them.\n\n437\n00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.957\nOnce you have that, just rename it,\ncuz it's gonna give it some funky,\n\n438\n00:21:02.957 --> 00:21:04.028\nlong name that you'll get.\n\n439\n00:21:04.028 --> 00:21:07.830\nI always just rename mine as Windows\n10 Eval, is what I normally do.\n\n440\n00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.280\nThat way I can find it easily, and so\nonce I know that, and let's say it's for\n\n441\n00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.540\nexample, it's in my downloads folder.\n\n442\n00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:19.350\nIn my downloads folder, well, I normally\nmove mine off to a USB hard drive,\n\n443\n00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.830\nbecause I like the speed that I get off\nthe USB hard drive, and I know I can\n\n444\n00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:27.460\naccess those faster without it having to\ncache anything too much between them.\n\n445\n00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.990\nSo, let's go ahead and\nshow you how to create a virtual machine.\n\n446\n00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:34.370\nSo, inside the Hyper-V manager you have\nthis console over here as a navigation\n\n447\n00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.980\npane on the left-hand side.\n\n448\n00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.660\nDetails here in the center, and\n\n449\n00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.490\nwe'll show you what those details\nwill actually show in a moment.\n\n450\n00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:45.680\nAnd of course we wanna get right into\nthe action, so we will select New, and\n\n451\n00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.470\nthen I'm going to select the first option,\nwhich is New Virtual Machine.\n\n452\n00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:55.450\nOnce I do that I should end up with\na nice wizard, a new virtual machine, so\n\n453\n00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.810\nHarry Potter is gonna guide us through.\n\n454\n00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:00.210\nWere gonna click Next, and\nfrom there I'm gonna give it a name.\n\n455\n00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:07.990\nAnd we will call this one Lab01, here.\n\n456\n00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:12.196\nAnd then I have an option right now to\nchange where it's default location is\n\n457\n00:22:12.196 --> 00:22:12.940\ngoing to be.\n\n458\n00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.935\nNow, this can be important at\nthe very beginning, right?\n\n459\n00:22:15.935 --> 00:22:19.336\nIf you know that you need to store your\nvirtual machine someplace you're gonna\n\n460\n00:22:19.336 --> 00:22:23.460\nfind them before, you can't be me, Mr.\nJim Niclick, and just not pay attention.\n\n461\n00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.290\nSo if you want to, you slow down right\nhere and then you put a check mark here,\n\n462\n00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:30.340\nand then you can change\nthe file path location here.\n\n463\n00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.893\nSo if I wanted to, I can go to browse,\nand let's do that right now.\n\n464\n00:22:33.893 --> 00:22:36.871\n>> Ronnie, you mean all those words on\nthe screen that they show in the pop ups\n\n465\n00:22:36.871 --> 00:22:39.048\nactually have information\nthat I might need to know?\n\n466\n00:22:39.048 --> 00:22:41.666\n>> No, no,\nthere's never anything like that.\n\n467\n00:22:41.666 --> 00:22:42.850\n[LAUGH] Absolutely.\n\n468\n00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:47.750\nSo, I already created a VM folder under\nmy documents, so if I want to do that I\n\n469\n00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.880\ncan select it and that way I can relocate\nwhere those virtual machines are gonna be.\n\n470\n00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.650\nI select it and you can see right\nhere where it changes that path\n\n471\n00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.410\nwhere those machines\nare going to be stored.\n\n472\n00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:01.330\nThe other thing that I want to do is\ngo ahead and click Next here, and\n\n473\n00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.610\nnow I have to choose between\nwhat generation that I'm using.\n\n474\n00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:08.450\nToday it's recommended you do\na generation two, but the rule of thumb,\n\n475\n00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:12.960\nat least from Microsoft's website is this,\n32-bit operating systems\n\n476\n00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.650\ndo generation one, 64-bit operating\nsystems do generation two, but there's\n\n477\n00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.690\na lot more that goes into that depending\non what you're using it for as well.\n\n478\n00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.740\nSo, if you know that you're gonna be\ntransferring them between different\n\n479\n00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:29.280\nmachines, but you're not sure what\nversion of Hyper-V that you're running,\n\n480\n00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.610\nsafer to user version one at this point,\nright?\n\n481\n00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.769\nSo if I'm going back to Server\n2008 system, I might actually go,\n\n482\n00:23:34.769 --> 00:23:37.607\nbecause I don't know if it\nactually understands everything,\n\n483\n00:23:37.607 --> 00:23:41.209\nI might choose generation one, and\nthen once it's over there, that's fine.\n\n484\n00:23:41.209 --> 00:23:45.293\nBut right now,\nthat's what Microsoft normally recommends,\n\n485\n00:23:45.293 --> 00:23:49.847\ngeneration one for 32-bit and\nthen generation two for 64-bit.\n\n486\n00:23:49.847 --> 00:23:52.693\nIf you're doing that as well\nas the uefi systems, so\n\n487\n00:23:52.693 --> 00:23:57.990\nif you're creating windows ten machines,\nthey really do recommend generation two.\n\n488\n00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.340\nSo that's what we're going to do.\n\n489\n00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:03.500\nClick next, and then we can tell it\nhow much start up memory we want to\n\n490\n00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.380\ngive this machine, and this is where it\nactually is important about the amount of\n\n491\n00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.210\nram you have on your computer.\n\n492\n00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.605\nIf you only have two gigs of ram,\nthis is why it won't work.\n\n493\n00:24:11.605 --> 00:24:14.610\nBecause your machine probably is\nactually running probably right around\n\n494\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.020\none gig already or somewhere close,\nif not a little bit higher.\n\n495\n00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.080\nBut when you start this virtual machine\nand say, I'm going to give it one gig,\n\n496\n00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.070\nit's going to take that one gig,\nbecause it's not going to actually say,\n\n497\n00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.570\nwell I'll wait for it.\n\n498\n00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:26.790\nIt will just take it.\n\n499\n00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:30.130\nSo what you actually want to do here\nis actually give it as much as you can.\n\n500\n00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:30.830\nThe nice thing is,\n\n501\n00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:34.550\nlater on if you don't need it,\nyou can actually take some RAM away.\n\n502\n00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:38.300\nThat's the nice thing about being Virgil,\nyou can kind of give more or take it away\n\n503\n00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.290\nif you need to without having to do\na lot of removal if you need to as well.\n\n504\n00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.140\nNow they also talk about\nthis dynamic memory, and\n\n505\n00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.200\nthat's perfectly fine, because that\nmeans it can manage it for you.\n\n506\n00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.761\nWhat we're saying is we're going\nto give it up to two gigs, so\n\n507\n00:24:52.761 --> 00:24:57.060\nif it only needs 890 gigs,\nor 890 megabytes of RAM,\n\n508\n00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.903\n[CROSSTALK] I know man, I buy the best.\n\n509\n00:24:59.903 --> 00:25:01.370\n>> Apparently.\n\n510\n00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:06.520\n>> If it only needs that, then the Hyper V\nmanager will manage that for us.\n\n511\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.320\nIn a test machine, definitely use it.\n\n512\n00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.740\nIn a production network,\ndo not use this, okay?\n\n513\n00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.540\nMake sure you give it all the RAM\nthat it needs, and make it dedicated.\n\n514\n00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.050\nThat's what you really want\nto be able to do here.\n\n515\n00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.810\nSo we're going to do dynamic, maybe.\n\n516\n00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:26.500\nClick next, and now I can actually have,\nwell I can't have a connection right now.\n\n517\n00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.470\nAnd we do have other episodes\nin which we'll go in and\n\n518\n00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:32.090\nwe'll show you how you actually make\na connection to a network later on.\n\n519\n00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:36.590\nSo make sure you also check those\nepisodes out as we record them too.\n\n520\n00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:37.720\nSo I'm just going to click next, and\n\n521\n00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:42.220\nfrom this point on, it's asking me what\nis the name that I want to actually have.\n\n522\n00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.690\nAnd you can see where it's storing\ninside of documents, VM lab01.\n\n523\n00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.930\nAnd where my virtual hard\ndrive's going to be, and\n\n524\n00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.060\nI choose the size of my hard drive.\n\n525\n00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.640\nSo I'm simply going to\njust do half of that.\n\n526\n00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.220\nRight?\n\n527\n00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.640\nI only have a 256 gig hard\ndrive on this machine.\n\n528\n00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.530\nAnd what I actually am\ndoing right here is saying,\n\n529\n00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.240\nhow big do you want to allow\nthis hard drive to grow?\n\n530\n00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.870\nWell, this one by default says 127 gigs.\n\n531\n00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.750\nThat's perfectly fine,\nas long as I have that much free space.\n\n532\n00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:11.620\nIt's not fine if I don't\nhave that much free space,\n\n533\n00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:16.420\nso you shouldn't do that just because it\nwill, it will take it up if it needs to.\n\n534\n00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.960\nAnd so try and say, hey what's\nthe upper limit that I have, and\n\n535\n00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.490\nlimit it to the free space on your drive\nright then if you're going to do that.\n\n536\n00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:29.280\nOkay, now notice that there's\nalso a couple of other options.\n\n537\n00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.270\nI don't have to create a hard drive right\nnow, I could just create the machine.\n\n538\n00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.000\nNow, what is that about?\n\n539\n00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.440\nThe machine is simply a file\nin the configurations and\n\n540\n00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.810\nall of the settings, right?\n\n541\n00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.670\nIt's how we actually\ntell the operating system\n\n542\n00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.710\nthat this is what the hardware looks like.\n\n543\n00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:46.360\nSo, we don't actually have to create\na virtual hard drive right now, so\n\n544\n00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.890\nwe can create one later, but\nlet's go ahead and create it since that's\n\n545\n00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:52.480\nwhat we're doing, or we can attach\nit to another one if we wanted to.\n\n546\n00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.390\nI'm going to click next,\nand now it's asking me,\n\n547\n00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.970\ndo I want to install an operating\nsystem now or later?\n\n548\n00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.300\nGoing to select install now, and\nthen I'm going to click browse, and\n\n549\n00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.310\nI'm simply going to look for, well,\nmy thumb drive which I've already attached\n\n550\n00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:08.870\nhere, select my Windows 10\nEnterprise Edition DVD.\n\n551\n00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.301\nClick open and then click next.\n\n552\n00:27:11.301 --> 00:27:16.363\nFrom this point it just gives me summary\ninformation, and I select finish.\n\n553\n00:27:16.363 --> 00:27:19.930\nHere.\n\n554\n00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:24.810\nAnd once I select finish, it will\nbegin the installation process for me.\n\n555\n00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.140\nAnd at this point you actually see\nthere is that third one right there.\n\n556\n00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.390\nRight there where it says Lab 01,\nthat's currently off.\n\n557\n00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:35.470\nAll I have to do is right-click and\nstart the installation process, and\n\n558\n00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.820\nnow it's actually beginning to start.\n\n559\n00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.770\nAnd I can even watch it just\nbriefly here if I select connect.\n\n560\n00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:43.590\nSo in a moment it should\npop up a little window for\n\n561\n00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:45.990\nme, as I start to see\nit's connection here.\n\n562\n00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:51.430\nIt just takes a moment of time,\nthere it goes, and\n\n563\n00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.040\nthis is what we are actually\ntaking a look at, and\n\n564\n00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.770\nyou'll see that it really does look like\nyou are booting into a piece of hardware.\n\n565\n00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:01.370\nNow the problem that we're having it says\nlook no operating system was loaded, so\n\n566\n00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.230\neither I did not attach the media and\n\n567\n00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:08.090\nI'm known to do this, let me verify\nthere it is, it is actually attached.\n\n568\n00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:10.610\nSo I just simply need\nto do the control alt,\n\n569\n00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:15.270\nactually I just need to select the dvd,\nsee there we go.\n\n570\n00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.550\nSo I just needed a number one.\n\n571\n00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.730\nI was about to reboot the whole thing,\nand I just needed to read once again,\n\n572\n00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:20.800\n>> The information on the screen.\n\n573\n00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.511\nThat might be useful.\n\n574\n00:28:21.511 --> 00:28:22.168\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, why?\n\n575\n00:28:22.168 --> 00:28:24.939\nYou keep pointing that out, and you\nthink it means something to me, Daniel.\n\n576\n00:28:24.939 --> 00:28:26.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's the problem.\n\n577\n00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.620\nNo, it really should.\n\n578\n00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.960\nRead, don't be like Ronnie, and\njust, I don't know what's going on.\n\n579\n00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.280\nLet's just reboot the whole system.\n\n580\n00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.420\n>> It's a patience issue.\n\n581\n00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.030\n>> It is.\n\n582\n00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.730\nI'm going ta take some classes and\nmake sure that I get that covered.\n\n583\n00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.300\nSo at this point here you see\nit's just a regular install.\n\n584\n00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.670\nThis is what we would normally\nsee on a real machine.\n\n585\n00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.280\nAnd you start seeing\nsome of the limitations.\n\n586\n00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:49.050\nRight, it's kind of not really\nwanting me to adjust it too much.\n\n587\n00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:51.190\nI have to use the scroll\nbar to scroll down.\n\n588\n00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:54.250\nI simply click next and install, and\n\n589\n00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:57.290\nnow the rest of the process\nis exactly the same thing.\n\n590\n00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:00.900\nSo we are beginning the installation\nof this virtual machine.\n\n591\n00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.290\nAnd once everything is done,\nI'll still have to do the same things.\n\n592\n00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:07.410\nI'll have to type in a user name,\na password at the very beginning, and\n\n593\n00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:10.160\nit may even about\nlanguage stuff sometimes.\n\n594\n00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.440\nBut once everything is set, and maybe\neven a time setting or time zone, but\n\n595\n00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.790\nonce everything is set, I now have\naccess to that virtual machine, but\n\n596\n00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.760\nit's really not fully ready yet.\n\n597\n00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.310\nThere's still some different\nconfigurations we'll need to do.\n\n598\n00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:26.370\nBut we'll actually end up probably\nhaving to do that in another episode.\n\n599\n00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:29.580\n>> Yeah, I'm looking at the clock and\nwe're run a little short on time, but\n\n600\n00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:33.560\nthe good thing is we've gotten through\nthe portion where we've installed Hyper-V,\n\n601\n00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:38.320\nright, we've got that going, and now we're\nmoving into installing an actual client\n\n602\n00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.470\nvirtual machine on that system\nallowing us to use that system later.\n\n603\n00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.010\nAnd while well we'll get into\nthat in that part two system,\n\n604\n00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:49.800\nshowing you some of the post-installation\nprocedures that we need to go through\n\n605\n00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.330\nto make it really ready for prime time.\n\n606\n00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.320\nBut Ronnie,\nthis has been a great demonstration,\n\n607\n00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.280\nshows the people out there that if you\nhave a pretty good understanding of\n\n608\n00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.830\nhardware really, then virtualization\nreally isn't much of a deviation,\n\n609\n00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.050\nit's just how do you configure that?\n\n610\n00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:08.610\nHow do you get the actual hypervisor\nsoftware itself to work with the hardware\n\n611\n00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:12.100\nthat you do have, so that you can\ncreate those virtual machines and\n\n612\n00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.460\nhave yourself a nice virtual environment?\n\n613\n00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.240\nRonnie, is there anything else we need to\ncover before we let these good people go?\n\n614\n00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.460\n>> Not really,\nwhat we just need to understand right?\n\n615\n00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.590\nMake sure you understand\nthose requirements and\n\n616\n00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:25.920\nif you don't see it, realize that you\nmight not be able to run it as well and\n\n617\n00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.740\nonce you actually have that down,\nhave fun.\n\n618\n00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.080\nCreate some virtual machines,\n\n619\n00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.473\nplay around with it, watch the rest\nof the episodes in this series,\n\n620\n00:30:33.473 --> 00:30:36.220\nbecause you're going to see it's going to\nbe very helpful when you want to get them\n\n621\n00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.720\nconnected to other machines, and\neven out to the Internet if you want to.\n\n622\n00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.810\nSo, make sure you do that.\n\n623\n00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.670\nDon't forget that one of the most\nimportant things about this\n\n624\n00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:47.510\nis the licensing, which means you\nhave to have a valid install disk and\n\n625\n00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:51.400\nyou have to have your valid install\nkey to do this at some point.\n\n626\n00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.910\nSo if you don't have that it's not\ngoing to allow you to do it either.\n\n627\n00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.156\nBut if you're practicing,\ngo ahead and get that eval copy,\n\n628\n00:30:56.156 --> 00:30:58.030\nit's not going to ask you for that key.\n\n629\n00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:01.050\nAnd watch, you can actually install it,\nrun it for 30 days, and\n\n630\n00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.430\nthen destroy it if you want to,\nstart again.\n\n631\n00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:04.850\n>> That's right, awesome stuff.\n\n632\n00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.860\nThank you guys for watching so\nmuch, we're going to go ahead and\n\n633\n00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.070\nwrap up this episode.\n\n634\n00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:11.180\nSo, signing off for ITPRO TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lawry.\n\n635\n00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:11.800\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n636\n00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.279\n>> And we'll see

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.859\nI'll be your host Daniel Lowry here\nwith me today none other than well, Mr.\n\n4\n00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:21.510\nRonnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.370\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.270\n>> It is going great.\n\n7\n00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.980\nIt's another great day to be right here.\n\n8\n00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.280\nTaking a look at some more Windows 10.\n\n9\n00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.616\nSpecifically continuing on in our series\nhere, a little mini series on Hyper-V.\n\n10\n00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:36.651\nAnd what we did in the previous episode,\nright, is that we went ahead and\n\n11\n00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:40.553\nshowed you how to install the Hyper-V\nroll to get ready for, really,\n\n12\n00:00:40.553 --> 00:00:44.723\nthe main attraction which is, of course,\ngetting virtual machines up and\n\n13\n00:00:44.723 --> 00:00:47.280\nrunning on your Windows 10 machine.\n\n14\n00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.800\nAnd that's what this\nshow is designed to do\n\n15\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.650\nis to help you understand all of the\ndifferent things that have to happen and\n\n16\n00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.930\nsome of the things you will\nalso just need to make sure of.\n\n17\n00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.920\nThe simple thing is, and the wonderful\nthing is it's not really difficult to get\n\n18\n00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.690\na hyper machine running, [LAUGH] or\na HyperV virtual machine\n\n19\n00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.710\nrunning on your computer, so it's not\nreally difficult to get it up and running.\n\n20\n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.944\nIt does take a little bit of time to\nkind of get used to that environment and\n\n21\n00:01:12.944 --> 00:01:14.630\nto see what else is happening.\n\n22\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.720\nBut overall though, in getting it up and\n\n23\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.880\nrunning is fairly fine and\nworks fairly easily.\n\n24\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.470\nSo when we start talking\nabout getting everything,\n\n25\n00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.310\nrunning the way that we want to,\n\n26\n00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.330\nwe again need to make sure that we have\neverything installed the way that we need.\n\n27\n00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.397\nAnd the first thing that we\nneed to do of course, then,\n\n28\n00:01:31.397 --> 00:01:34.532\nis verify that we have\nthe Hyper-V role installed, and\n\n29\n00:01:34.532 --> 00:01:37.820\nverify that we have\nthe Hyper-V Manager also ready to go.\n\n30\n00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.096\nSo let's go ahead and do that,\nand then we'll go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:43.275\ntake a look at getting started here, and\nseeing all the things that we need to do.\n\n32\n00:01:43.275 --> 00:01:44.385\nAll right?\n\n33\n00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:48.645\nSo on my machine,\nI'm running is fairly simple,\n\n34\n00:01:48.645 --> 00:01:52.650\nI'm just gonna click on\nthe Windows Start button over here.\n\n35\n00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.200\nAnd from there, I'm just gonna\nright-click on it cuz it's easier.\n\n36\n00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.370\nAnd go to Control Panel.\n\n37\n00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.270\nAnd then, go to Programs and of course,\nturn Windows features on or off.\n\n38\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.580\nAnd in a moment, hopefully,\nthis will populate and\n\n39\n00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.030\nverify that I have check marks beside\nboth of these features right here.\n\n40\n00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.440\nThe Hyper-V management tools as\nwell as the Hyper-V platform.\n\n41\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.690\nSo both of those are marked then\nI know that I am ready to go.\n\n42\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.090\nNow I didn't have to do that, but\n\n43\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.040\nit's a good way to verify that\neverything is also running and\n\n44\n00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.170\nthen of course the other way is if I'm\nlooking for the Hyper-V Manager itself.\n\n45\n00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.552\nNow I can always use\nthe search bar down here, but\n\n46\n00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:33.762\nnotice that if I click\non the windows button,\n\n47\n00:02:33.762 --> 00:02:37.334\nI can see next to the word all apps\nthere's actually a word that says new.\n\n48\n00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:42.290\nSo if I I select that one, then I can\nscroll, well maybe I can scroll down here\n\n49\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.246\nand I can look for the Windows features\nand notice that under administrative\n\n50\n00:02:47.246 --> 00:02:51.287\ntools there's something new\nthat's been added under here.\n\n51\n00:02:51.287 --> 00:02:54.800\nAnd so I'm just looking for\nthe word new as what I was doing, and\n\n52\n00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.670\nthen I can scroll down and\nlook oh there it is, Hyper-V Manager new.\n\n53\n00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.240\nAnd I can select that feature and\nnow it will actually get us up and\n\n54\n00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.690\nrunning into what we're gonna\nbe using to install and\n\n55\n00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.700\ndo a basic configuration of\nwhatever operating system.\n\n56\n00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.760\nWe're just going to choose Windows 10.\n\n57\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.210\nSince we're on Windows 10 we\nmight as well choose that one.\n\n58\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.470\nIt kind of helps out here for\nus to do what we need to.\n\n59\n00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.550\nSo let's just explore this\ninterface just for a moment.\n\n60\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.302\nRemember that you're gonna see this\ninterface if you're actually running\n\n61\n00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:22.424\nHyper-V on Server 2012.\n\n62\n00:03:22.424 --> 00:03:24.690\nIt's gonna look fairly similar.\n\n63\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.630\nOn those, you might actually\nsee a little bit more, but\n\n64\n00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.180\nright here is the basic management\nfeature set that you see.\n\n65\n00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.280\nMicrosoft has been doing this for\nseveral years now,\n\n66\n00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.140\nwhere everything that they do as far\nas a management console feature goes.\n\n67\n00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.620\nIt's in these three different\npanes that you see.\n\n68\n00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.600\nOver here on the left hand side\nis a simple navigation tree,\n\n69\n00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.220\nsometimes you hear people call it\nnavigation panel or navigation pane.\n\n70\n00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.230\nIn the center are all the details of\neverything that we actually need.\n\n71\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.985\nIf we need specific information on details\nof a virtual machine, check points,\n\n72\n00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:57.635\nyou name it,\nit actually gives us all that information,\n\n73\n00:03:57.635 --> 00:04:01.480\nand then over on the right hand side\nis what we also call the action pane.\n\n74\n00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.130\nSo making sure that you understand where\nyou can find things, and where you can\n\n75\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.660\nactually start installing things and\nactually be able to configure things.\n\n76\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.010\nThat's half the battle inside\nof actually understanding\n\n77\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.630\nwhat's going on inside of Windows 10.\n\n78\n00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.380\nBut as well as in Hyper-V its\njust knowing where things are.\n\n79\n00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.040\nAnd that's also going to be important on\nthe exam as well, so make sure you do\n\n80\n00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.640\npay attention to some of these as you\nkind of take a look through here.\n\n81\n00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.500\nSo inside of what we're seeing,\nright, over on the left hand side.\n\n82\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.220\nYou see where it's actually\njust a management feature.\n\n83\n00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.480\nAnd it gives you an introduction\nto what it's going to do.\n\n84\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.140\nAnd then of course,\nthe name of what they call the server.\n\n85\n00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.110\nNow even though I'm running Windows 10 and\nyou might say that's not a server.\n\n86\n00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.340\nWell it's acting like a server for\nHyper-V right now.\n\n87\n00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.137\nAnd so\nyou see that this one's named Nate x p s.\n\n88\n00:04:44.137 --> 00:04:47.510\nThat's cuz I took Nate's laptop\nright off his desk [LAUGH].\n\n89\n00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.210\nHe's probably missing it right about now.\n\n90\n00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.810\n>> Where's my computer?\n\n91\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.820\n>> Yeah, where is his computer?\n\n92\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.040\nWell, it's probably here on the show.\n\n93\n00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.360\nBut this is Nate's s p x machine,\n\n94\n00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.500\nx p s machine,\nis the one that I took right here.\n\n95\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.370\nAnd when I select it,\n\n96\n00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.240\nyou can see where it's changing the\ncontext a little bit here in the center.\n\n97\n00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.156\nSo at this point it allows\nus to be able to do that.\n\n98\n00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:11.446\nNow the other thing about this Hyper-V\nManager that's really nice is that if I\n\n99\n00:05:11.446 --> 00:05:15.671\nhave all of these server administration\ntools also added in part of the remote\n\n100\n00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:20.546\nserver and administration tools that are\navailable for Windows 10 that's out there,\n\n101\n00:05:20.546 --> 00:05:24.070\nwell it also gives me this ability\nto connect to another server.\n\n102\n00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.405\nSo if I also have another machine that's\nalso running Hyper-V I can actually\n\n103\n00:05:28.405 --> 00:05:30.005\nconnect to that one too, and\n\n104\n00:05:30.005 --> 00:05:34.490\nalso see the virtual machines that\nare running on that machine as well.\n\n105\n00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.540\nRight now, if I select Natexps, you can\nsee in the center here, under the virtual\n\n106\n00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.500\nmachines it says no virtual machines were\nfound on this server and so it doesn't\n\n107\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.330\nactually give me the ability to see any of\nthe other things cuz there's nothing here.\n\n108\n00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.470\nSo if I create virtual machines they\nshould show up here in this top pane.\n\n109\n00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.290\nWe can also talk about\ncheckpoints as well.\n\n110\n00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.020\nNow we haven't gone to the idea\nof checkpoints yet but\n\n111\n00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.060\ncheckpoints allow us to do\nsomething very special.\n\n112\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.340\nAnd we're gonna actually have a little\nsegment on creating checkpoints and\n\n113\n00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.950\nmanaging checkpoints as well.\n\n114\n00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.370\nSo we'll see that a little bit later on,\nbut this is an incredible feature.\n\n115\n00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.650\nDaniel uses it all the time.\n\n116\n00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.960\nI use it all the time.\n\n117\n00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.010\nIt really does help you to reset your\ncomputer to a previous point in time\n\n118\n00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.850\nvery quickly.\n\n119\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.040\nIf you go, man I really did mess\nthat thing up, ceating checkpoints\n\n120\n00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.930\nare really a part of something that you\njust need to make sure that you manage and\n\n121\n00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.640\nunderstand a little bit more.\n\n122\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.460\nThat's gonna be so\nhelpful once you do that.\n\n123\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.090\nBut we do.\nWe'll have another segment on the idea\n\n124\n00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.970\nof checkpoints and managing virtual\nmachines once we get everything up and\n\n125\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:33.540\nrunning here too.\n\n126\n00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.930\nAnd then of course there are details.\n\n127\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.980\nDetails are the operations that when you\ndo turn on a virtual machine you'll see\n\n128\n00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.870\nsome of the different details there about\nhow it's running and how it's performing.\n\n129\n00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.180\nAnd you'll see a lot of that information,\nokay?\n\n130\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.370\nSo we see all that.\n\n131\n00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.920\nAnd then that means it is now time\nthat we are ready to actually\n\n132\n00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.330\ncreate some virtual machines and\nsome actions.\n\n133\n00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.780\nNow that means that we can go over to the\nright-hand side on the actions pane and\n\n134\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.300\nyou see right here where it says New,\nand then you see Import Virtual Machine.\n\n135\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.550\nSo that means we can actually\ncreate a brand new one,\n\n136\n00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.350\nif we have everything ready to go.\n\n137\n00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.760\nOr, if there's another virtual machine\nrunning on another Hyper-V server\n\n138\n00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.350\nsomewhere, I should in theory be able to\n\n139\n00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.120\nimport that virtual machine into my\nmanagement console if I need to.\n\n140\n00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.040\nThat way I can run it from here\nin case something is happening to\n\n141\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.710\nthat other machine I can do that.\n\n142\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.200\nWe can also clone those machines as well.\n\n143\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.390\nThen there are some specific\nHyper-V settings that are also\n\n144\n00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.090\nin the background for us and\n\n145\n00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.420\nwe've gotta take a look at where we can\nmove some information but it's right here.\n\n146\n00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.880\nYou do need to pay attention to where\nsome of these things are gonna be stored.\n\n147\n00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.850\nSo, when we create a virtual machine,\n\n148\n00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.470\nwe're actually creating a file that's\ngonna represent the hard drive itself.\n\n149\n00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.279\nWe're also creating another file that's\ngonna represent all the hardware\n\n150\n00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:49.180\nof that machine.\n\n151\n00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.658\nSo even though we're not really\ngiving it physical hardware,\n\n152\n00:07:51.658 --> 00:07:54.474\nwe're creating files that says\nhere's what the hardware looks like.\n\n153\n00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:58.375\nSo together we have our hardware and\nwe have our hard drive too.\n\n154\n00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:03.245\nAnd there's also some other additional\nadvanced features here on the Numa And\n\n155\n00:08:03.245 --> 00:08:07.229\nthen even storage migrations and\nall of these other sessions and\n\n156\n00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:10.197\nthese different policy\nmodes that are here to.\n\n157\n00:08:10.197 --> 00:08:10.927\nThat's for\n\n158\n00:08:10.927 --> 00:08:15.620\nmore advanced features as you get into\nmanaging a lot of virtual machines.\n\n159\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.788\nThe one or two that we are gonna\ncreate here, not really so useful.\n\n160\n00:08:18.788 --> 00:08:21.547\nBut a lot of these other ones as you\ngo on you'll actually see some more\n\n161\n00:08:21.547 --> 00:08:23.860\nfeatures that are also available as well.\n\n162\n00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.870\nThen of course,\nthe idea of what happens to the keyboard.\n\n163\n00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:32.890\nThis is very important as you start to\nwork with these virtual machines as well.\n\n164\n00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.460\nNotice it says that when you click on it,\nthis user will actually when\n\n165\n00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.370\nthey're working with a virtual\nmachine it will not be working on\n\n166\n00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.140\nthe host machine at that point, it will be\nworking inside of that virtual machine.\n\n167\n00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.400\nAnd then how do we get access\nto that virtual machine?\n\n168\n00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.990\nInstead of Ctrl+Alt+Delete, notice this\none is Ctrl+Alt+F or the left arrow.\n\n169\n00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.710\nVery important,\nbecause if I do Ctrl+Alt+Delete,\n\n170\n00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.670\nthat's gonna shut down my machine or\nlock me out of that machine right then.\n\n171\n00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.850\nBut if I do it with the left arrow,\nit's only gonna do that for\n\n172\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.420\nthe virtual machine as well.\n\n173\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.970\nAnd then there's some other advanced modes\nhere too that we're probably not gonna\n\n174\n00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.800\nmess with right now as well.\n\n175\n00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.640\nSo there are some features\nthat are readily available\n\n176\n00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.380\nthat we can look through, but we do have\nsome other episodes which are coming up\n\n177\n00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.310\nthat will take a look at some of these\nother features that are listed down here.\n\n178\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.260\nSo at the very beginning we need\nto make sure that if we're ready\n\n179\n00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.400\nto create a virtual machine we're\ngonna have to make some decisions.\n\n180\n00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.480\nAnd of course, we are gonna need access\nto, well, the operating systems itself.\n\n181\n00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.840\nNow today it's not like\nwhat it used to be, right?\n\n182\n00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.197\nWhen I first bought an operating\nsystem it came in a box.\n\n183\n00:09:31.197 --> 00:09:34.377\nI had to go into a store,\npicked it up, pull the plastic off it,\n\n184\n00:09:34.377 --> 00:09:38.360\nit came in a nice little jewel case and\nit actually had a disk like this.\n\n185\n00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.353\nAnd today, though,\nyou can actually download them and\n\n186\n00:09:41.353 --> 00:09:45.441\nactually go ahead and run them in that\ndownloaded format that we call an ISO.\n\n187\n00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:50.319\nBut if you happen to have a machine\nthat still is running an optical drive,\n\n188\n00:09:50.319 --> 00:09:54.190\nyou can take that file format and\nburn it to a DVD like this.\n\n189\n00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.820\nAnd that's what we've also done here.\n\n190\n00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.140\nWe burned it and we actually wrote\nWindows 10 Pro and Home Edition on it\n\n191\n00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.960\nto help us out, to make sure that we\nactually knew what was going on here.\n\n192\n00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.085\nWe will need access to the physical\nhardware if we're going to be using this\n\n193\n00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:10.520\ndisk to be able to mount it and\nthen be able to access it so\n\n194\n00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.350\nthat we can build our virtual machine.\n\n195\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.442\nNow if you don't have this, like I said,\nsimply just having that file is gonna\n\n196\n00:10:16.442 --> 00:10:19.275\nbe enough and\nthat's what we're gonna use instead.\n\n197\n00:10:19.275 --> 00:10:23.590\nI went ahead and downloaded the evaluation\ncopy of Windows 10 from Microsoft,\n\n198\n00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.460\nas well as the Server 2012\nevaluation from Microsoft, and\n\n199\n00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:32.210\nI've stored them on a USB-3 key that\nI will now be able to access and\n\n200\n00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:37.660\ncreate virtual machines directly\non my Windows 10 machine as well.\n\n201\n00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.040\nSo let's walk through the process and\nhow this can be done.\n\n202\n00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.971\nSo inside of our Hyper-V Manager, again,\n\n203\n00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:46.993\nremember, more than one\nway to skin the cat.\n\n204\n00:10:46.993 --> 00:10:49.711\nI can right-click on NATE-XPS and\nselect New,\n\n205\n00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:55.010\nand notice I have these options over here,\nVirtual Machine, Hard Disk or Floppy Disk.\n\n206\n00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.950\nSo if you do happen to have for\none reason or\n\n207\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:01.470\nanother some application that's absolutely\nstill requiring a floppy disk drive,\n\n208\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.670\nyou can virtualize a floppy disk drive.\n\n209\n00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.435\nNow I hate to say it, I don't remember\nthe last time I even had to think about\n\n210\n00:11:07.435 --> 00:11:13.240\nvirtualizing a floppy disk, but if you do\nhappen to have one, it is possible here.\n\n211\n00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.990\nOf course, Microsoft, even though you\ncan right-click on everything and\n\n212\n00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.950\ndo what you need to, they want you to know\nwhat they actually have right before you,\n\n213\n00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.300\nwhich means that they'd love you\nto go to the Action pane, and\n\n214\n00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.450\nthen go ahead and click on the word New.\n\n215\n00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.960\nNow remember that just because it's right\nthere doesn't mean you can't go up to\n\n216\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.760\nAction up here at the top and\nalso select New.\n\n217\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.635\nSo I mean, if you wanna be confusing,\nMicrosoft they've named six ways\n\n218\n00:11:35.635 --> 00:11:39.070\nthat we can actually create a virtual\nmachine so far to be able to do this.\n\n219\n00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.060\nBut I'm gonna simply select\nNew under the action pane.\n\n220\n00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.840\nAnd then I'm gonna create\na virtual machine.\n\n221\n00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.400\nSo this is the entire package\nthat we have available to us.\n\n222\n00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.120\nSo of course, it brings us this\nnice Virtual Machine Wizard, and\n\n223\n00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.220\nit actually allows us to be\nable to create the machine so\n\n224\n00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.298\nthat we can actually use it just\nlike another machine that's running.\n\n225\n00:11:57.298 --> 00:12:00.300\nSo I'm gonna be running two different\noperating systems right here on\n\n226\n00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:00.990\nthe same hardware.\n\n227\n00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.340\nSo I'm gonna click Next.\n\n228\n00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.390\nAnd now it's gonna ask me for a name.\n\n229\n00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:11.500\nSo on this one I'm gonna go ahead and\njust say it's\n\n230\n00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.800\ngonna be my Windows 10 and\nthis is gonna be for 70697.\n\n231\n00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.710\nIn that way I mark it for\nwhat we're doing right now too.\n\n232\n00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:26.310\nBy default, it saves it in a storage\nlocation here underneath ProgramData.\n\n233\n00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.362\nNow ProgramData normally is a hidden\nfolder that we normally don't see inside\n\n234\n00:12:29.362 --> 00:12:30.500\nof Windows.\n\n235\n00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.780\nBut it stores it right here,\nProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Hyper-V.\n\n236\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.680\nBut we can change this location\nright now if we choose to.\n\n237\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.115\nAnd the way that we do that, of course,\nis we mark it where it says store\n\n238\n00:12:42.115 --> 00:12:46.180\nthe virtual machine in a different\nlocation, and you may choose to do that.\n\n239\n00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.342\nThe key here, especially if you need\nperformance on your virtual machines,\n\n240\n00:12:50.342 --> 00:12:54.129\nis you want to store on the fastest\navailable hard drive that you have.\n\n241\n00:12:54.129 --> 00:13:00.231\nIf you have access to, let's say you have\na second hard drive in this computer but\n\n242\n00:13:00.231 --> 00:13:01.951\nit's a 5200 RPM.\n\n243\n00:13:01.951 --> 00:13:06.670\nEven though it's a 500 gigabyte drive and\nthere's nothing on it, and I have a solid\n\n244\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.197\nstate drive on this machine, if you need\nthe performance the way that you're gonna\n\n245\n00:13:11.197 --> 00:13:15.970\ngo is you want to store it on that hard\ndrive that has a solid state performance.\n\n246\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.265\nDon't get me wrong,\nwill it run on that 5200 RPM?\n\n247\n00:13:18.265 --> 00:13:20.710\nYeah, it'll run perfectly fine.\n\n248\n00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.470\nAnd it may not be the best\nperformance that you'll get.\n\n249\n00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.570\nIt will run fine.\n\n250\n00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.160\nBut if you need the performance,\n\n251\n00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.990\nyou need to run on the fastest\nequipment that you have.\n\n252\n00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.340\nSo it's not about just space, but\nyou want it on fast equipment as well.\n\n253\n00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.580\nSo at this point I can leave\nit at its default location.\n\n254\n00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.180\nAnd then we can move it\nlater if we need to, and\n\n255\n00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.050\nwe'll see that that's one of the things\nthat we need to be able to do as well.\n\n256\n00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.680\nSo that's another thing that we can do.\n\n257\n00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.220\nSo I'm just gonna uncheck this right now.\n\n258\n00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.050\nI'll leave it in the default location.\n\n259\n00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.265\nI'm just gonna try and remember it though.\n\n260\n00:13:49.265 --> 00:13:53.410\nProgramData/Microsoft/Windows/Hyper-V\nthere, and\n\n261\n00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.790\nthen I'm gonna click Next as well.\n\n262\n00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:02.410\nNow this is where we do\nneed to make a choice.\n\n263\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:07.855\nSo there's Generation 1 types\nof Hyper-V virtual machines and\n\n264\n00:14:07.855 --> 00:14:13.210\nGeneration 2 types of the virtual\nmachines that we can create.\n\n265\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.270\nI'm gonna say that all day long.\n\n266\n00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.320\nNow what really is the difference?\n\n267\n00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.010\nIt really depends on the reach and\n\n268\n00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:24.770\nthe ability that you need\nto have on your network.\n\n269\n00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.400\nNow you might say,\nwhat is that really about?\n\n270\n00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.839\nSo here they describe why you\nmight choose it on this machine.\n\n271\n00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:34.484\nSo the general description of it says,\nsupports 32-bit and\n\n272\n00:14:34.484 --> 00:14:39.175\n64-bit guest OSs which were available\nin all previous editions of Hyper-V.\n\n273\n00:14:39.175 --> 00:14:42.408\nNow you might be wondering, why would\nI choose to do something like that?\n\n274\n00:14:42.408 --> 00:14:45.780\nWell, if you're in a production\nenvironment, it could be more than likely\n\n275\n00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.430\nof these machines that you're saying hey,\nthis is going to be a test\n\n276\n00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:53.200\nmachine right now, but maybe then after\nI test it, I'm going to build this.\n\n277\n00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.260\nAnd then I'm gonna build it right here,\nbecause I can, and\n\n278\n00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:01.090\nthen we're gonna import it into\na Hyper-V that's running somewhere else.\n\n279\n00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:05.050\nWell, if you're not sure about what\nthat virtual Hyper-V machine is doing,\n\n280\n00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:08.592\nin other words, is it doing Generation\n1 or Generation 2 machines,\n\n281\n00:15:08.592 --> 00:15:12.355\nthe recommendation, of course,\nis that you choose your Generation 1.\n\n282\n00:15:12.355 --> 00:15:16.711\n32-bit operating systems have\nto be on the Generation 1,\n\n283\n00:15:16.711 --> 00:15:20.020\nso if you are still running\nWindows XP on a virtual machine,\n\n284\n00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.310\nthat will also have to be\na Generation 1 machine as well.\n\n285\n00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:27.710\nSo you got a little bit of technical\ndifferentiation that you have to make, but\n\n286\n00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.360\nit is something that you\ndo need to be able to do.\n\n287\n00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.093\nSo remember if you are migrating\nthis to an older Hyper-V machine, so\n\n288\n00:15:35.093 --> 00:15:37.833\nwhen I say older, what do I really mean?\n\n289\n00:15:37.833 --> 00:15:42.747\nWell, like Server 2008 R2, even though\nthat does run Hyper-V and does for us,\n\n290\n00:15:42.747 --> 00:15:47.182\nif you're gonna actually be possibly\nexporting one of yours from here to that\n\n291\n00:15:47.182 --> 00:15:49.383\none, you may choose a Generation 1.\n\n292\n00:15:49.383 --> 00:15:55.024\nBut down here it says on Generation 2,\nvirtual machines provide support for\n\n293\n00:15:55.024 --> 00:15:59.539\nnewer virtualization of Features\nhas UEFI based firmware and\n\n294\n00:15:59.539 --> 00:16:04.500\nrequires supported 64-bit\nguest operating systems.\n\n295\n00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.540\nSo if you know that you are actually\ngoing to be running this\n\n296\n00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:13.190\non machines that will only run UEFI,\nthat's the recommendation too.\n\n297\n00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.240\nThe general rule of thumb is at\nleast really simple for most of us.\n\n298\n00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.830\nIf we're doing 64 bit,\nwe're probably gonna choose Generation 2.\n\n299\n00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.060\nIf we're doing 32 bit,\nwe're probably gonna choose Generation 1.\n\n300\n00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.720\nThat's not always a given fact because\nof the caveat that I mentioned.\n\n301\n00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.580\nIf you know that this machine's gonna be\ngoing to another Hyper-V machine, and\n\n302\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.692\nyou don't know what\nthe specifications are,\n\n303\n00:16:33.692 --> 00:16:37.350\nit's recommended that you choose\na Generation 1 if you're gonna do that.\n\n304\n00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.900\nBut overall though, most of us\nare probably just gonna leave it at\n\n305\n00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.640\nthe Generation 2 if we know\nwhat the hardware is gonna be.\n\n306\n00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.310\nOkay?\n\n307\n00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.860\nSo those are the choices that\nwe will actually make here.\n\n308\n00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.730\nSo on this one,\nthis is just a UEFI based one as well, so\n\n309\n00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.790\nI'm gonna choose this Generation 2.\n\n310\n00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.780\nAnd then it says that you gotta\nremember that once you create it,\n\n311\n00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.570\nyou cannot change that generation.\n\n312\n00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.420\nSo, the little warning is\nprobably a good warning for us,\n\n313\n00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.830\nespecially in preparing for the exam.\n\n314\n00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.770\nThat this is not something we can\ncome back a little bit later on and\n\n315\n00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:10.080\nsay, oh yeah, that's a mistake, oh yeah,\nI can switch that generation later on.\n\n316\n00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.615\nIt's during the creation of the machine\nitself that you have to choose\n\n317\n00:17:14.615 --> 00:17:16.425\nwhich generation it is going to be.\n\n318\n00:17:16.425 --> 00:17:20.705\nAll right, so from this point\nyou now actually go ahead and\n\n319\n00:17:20.705 --> 00:17:23.855\ndecide what the actual memory you're\ngoing to assign this computer.\n\n320\n00:17:23.855 --> 00:17:28.915\nRemember that this really is limited\nby how much RAM you have on your\n\n321\n00:17:28.915 --> 00:17:31.595\nsystem that is actually\nrunning at this point.\n\n322\n00:17:31.595 --> 00:17:33.980\nSo if you only have four gigs of RAM,\n\n323\n00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.600\nThe max amount of memory that you\ncan actually assign is about 4 gig.\n\n324\n00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.710\nCan you actually try and assign more?\n\n325\n00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:44.700\nYou can, but remember with the slat,\nthe second level address translation,\n\n326\n00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.930\nit's going to run on the ability to\nactually assign those addresses and\n\n327\n00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.250\nyou're going to be in trouble.\n\n328\n00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:53.290\nAlways make sure you verify how much\nphysical memory that you have and\n\n329\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:57.470\nhow you need to keep aside how much memory\nis going to run the host operating system\n\n330\n00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:58.600\nto help you out as well.\n\n331\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.520\nWhen you talk about start up memory,\n\n332\n00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.390\nit doesn't necessary mean the memory that\nis required to keep the machine running.\n\n333\n00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.220\nAnd it's really amazing cuz\nI've tried this before,\n\n334\n00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:13.660\nDaniel, is that I've actually gotten\na Windows 7 machine after boot up\n\n335\n00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.840\nin a virtual machine,\nwhich I started with 2 gigs of RAM.\n\n336\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.870\nI have gotten to run on 384\nmegs of RAM after that.\n\n337\n00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:21.790\n>> That's pretty impressive.\n\n338\n00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:22.690\nI'm not going to lie.\n\n339\n00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.220\nJust 384 megs of RAM?\n\n340\n00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.590\n>> Yeah, it didn't run great,\nbut it was actually running.\n\n341\n00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.760\nYeah, so you can actually do stuff like\nthat because the operational side of it\n\n342\n00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.720\nright, once it gets running it\ndoesn't really care how much ram.\n\n343\n00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.730\nUsually a lot of times it's at\nthe start up right when it had to load\n\n344\n00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.380\neverything into RAM.\n\n345\n00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.360\nBut then after it actually goes okay I\nthink I'm ready and it kinda goes down,\n\n346\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.300\nthen you can actually change some of these\nRAM specifications, it's kinda amazing.\n\n347\n00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.480\nRight at the beginning during\nthe installation you can do that and\n\n348\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.140\na lot of the times after that you\ncan change this amount of RAM.\n\n349\n00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.640\nIt's not recommended, but\nit can actually work, here.\n\n350\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.030\nSo normally what we do at the start\nup here is we actually say,\n\n351\n00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:59.260\nhow much RAM are we actually going\nto assign to allocate to this?\n\n352\n00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.340\nNow, remember that all that's\nreally required in your operating\n\n353\n00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.770\nsystem is whatever the minimal amount\nthat the operating system says.\n\n354\n00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.740\nSo In this sense,\nif I know I'm running Windows 10, I know\n\n355\n00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.240\nthat it's going to require at least a gig\nof RAM, if I am running 32 bit edition.\n\n356\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.060\nBut, the very fact is if you're\nactually running a 64 bit edition,\n\n357\n00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:22.150\nthe minimal amount that you have to have,\nof course, is going to be 2 gigs of RAM\n\n358\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:26.570\nto just get it started and install it, and\nthen you're fine and dandy after that.\n\n359\n00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.480\nSo that's what you actually want to do.\n\n360\n00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.960\nSo I'm just going to assign the 2\ngigs here right at the beginning.\n\n361\n00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:37.180\nNow they also talk about using dynamic\nmemory for this virtual machine.\n\n362\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.620\nNow this is where we actually have that\n\n363\n00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.910\nunusual thing where I talk\nabout 384 meg to RAM.\n\n364\n00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.150\nSometimes, in these virtual machine\nmanagers, you can actually see, from some\n\n365\n00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.200\nof the graphs that they show you, how much\nRAM the operating system's really using.\n\n366\n00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.440\nSo after the initial startup, you may\nsee where it actually is using almost\n\n367\n00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.030\nclose to the 2 gigs, and then almost\nimmediately it starts dropping, and\n\n368\n00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.360\nthen it starts hovering about how much\nRAM it's actually using in general.\n\n369\n00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.540\nAnd then you can come back in here and\n\n370\n00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.770\nchange that, and actually will end\nup working a lot of the times.\n\n371\n00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.740\nAnd that's what the dynamic RAM is for,\nis saying, look,\n\n372\n00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.630\nwe're not going to just statically\nassign 2 gigs, because if they do that,\n\n373\n00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.570\nthat means the rest of the machine,\nor virtual machines, or even the host\n\n374\n00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:18.350\noperating system underneath that is not\ngoing to be able to access that RAM.\n\n375\n00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:22.890\nSo by using the dynamic memory allocation\nthat they're talking about here,\n\n376\n00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.260\nwhat can happen is if the host,\nthe underlying machine that's running,\n\n377\n00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.480\nthe Windows 10 machine that's running\nright now, if it needs more RAM,\n\n378\n00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.690\nit can say all right, you're a virtual\nmachine, let me just take a little bit,\n\n379\n00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:37.220\nlet me grab a few extra\nmegabytes from you.\n\n380\n00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:42.200\nOh yeah, let me grab 100 megabytes\nfrom you right now so I can use it.\n\n381\n00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.050\nAnd then if it needs more, if the virtual\nmachine then begins to run a little\n\n382\n00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:49.230\nbit sluggish and says, I need that back,\nit can actually dynamically allocate and\n\n383\n00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.210\nassign that back as well.\n\n384\n00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.460\nInside of a testing environment,\nwe do recommend that you do that.\n\n385\n00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.060\nIn a production environment, never.\n\n386\n00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.440\nOkay?\nIf you were running this and\n\n387\n00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.930\nthis was your exchange server, Daniel.\n\n388\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.170\nIf this was your exchange server,\nyou don't want that.\n\n389\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.560\nYou want that exchange server\nto have access to everything.\n\n390\n00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.400\n>> Oh yeah, any kind of mission\ncritical type device that's gonna\n\n391\n00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.730\nneed its RAM whenever it needs it, that's\nthe kind you're gonna set as the static.\n\n392\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.170\nYou're gonna say,\nI'm always gonna allow you to have\n\n393\n00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:22.240\nthis much of whatever set aside so that\nyou can access it at a moment's notice.\n\n394\n00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.990\nAnd that's because you never know\nwhen that server's gonna be hit.\n\n395\n00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.630\nAnd when I say hit I mean\neverybody's loaded for email,\n\n396\n00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:34.080\noverloaded by a bunch of users trying\nto get input and output from it.\n\n397\n00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.520\nWith these test environments though,\nthat's not such a big deal.\n\n398\n00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.190\nYou're basically just trying to figure\nout some settings, make sure things work.\n\n399\n00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:44.210\nSo if it doesn't get the entirety\nof the RAM that's okay, right?\n\n400\n00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.740\nIt doesn't need 2 gigs\nof RAM all the time.\n\n401\n00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.520\nAnd really, to be honest with you,\nespecially if you're running on\n\n402\n00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.340\nsomething like a laptop, you don't want\nit to take those 2 gigs up all the time.\n\n403\n00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.840\nThose resources are at\na premium when it comes to\n\n404\n00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.220\nwhat you're trying to do with them.\n\n405\n00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:02.640\nSo, just depends on the application\non how wanna set versus that\n\n406\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.720\ndynamic versus that static type of set up.\n\n407\n00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.930\n>> There's no doubt.\n\n408\n00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.140\nNow the other configuration that we\nalso need to make of course is gonna\n\n409\n00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.720\nbe found after we click next here too,\nwhich is gonna ask about networking.\n\n410\n00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.730\nNow I haven't configured any networking\nhere because we do need to configure some\n\n411\n00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.430\nnetworking a little bit later on.\n\n412\n00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.070\nSo at this point notice it\nsays nothing is connected.\n\n413\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.600\nWe will be making those connections\na little bit later on, so\n\n414\n00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.960\nwe're not gonna configure\nanything from this point.\n\n415\n00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.520\nAnd then this almost next to\nfinal is what we have here.\n\n416\n00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.420\nIt's gonna ask me if I want to create a\nvirtual machine or use an existing one or\n\n417\n00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.380\nattach a virtual disk later on.\n\n418\n00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.790\nSo at this point it's really asking hey,\nwhat do we want to create?\n\n419\n00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.610\nNotice the file extension right here.\n\n420\n00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:49.280\nUse this option to create a VHDX,\ndynamically expanding virtual hard disk.\n\n421\n00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.820\nSo, it actually says 127 gigs right now.\n\n422\n00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:58.160\nWell I can do that, but I only have\nlike a 240 gig solid state drive.\n\n423\n00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.330\nAnd it says a maximum of,\nor the size of it.\n\n424\n00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.620\nNow If I go ahead and I assigned this.\n\n425\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.670\nIt's not going to take up all 127 gigs and\njust leave that.\n\n426\n00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.430\nNow remember in a production environment\nyou definitely will do that,\n\n427\n00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.070\nyou'll create a static file that\nwill represent the hard drive,\n\n428\n00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:20.300\nthat will be 127 gigs big and\nthat file will actually not change.\n\n429\n00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.960\nIn a testing environment though,\nyou wait it to be dynamic and\n\n430\n00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.840\nthat means that only really takes\nup as much space as it needs to.\n\n431\n00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.600\nAnd the maximum size is the size\nof this hard drive will end up\n\n432\n00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.310\ngrowing is what you tend up to see.\n\n433\n00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:36.540\nSo here by default that says 127,\nI'm gonna say 64 instead,\n\n434\n00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.890\nis what I'm going to choose\nto do as far as 64 gigs.\n\n435\n00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.650\nAnd notice the location here, too.\n\n436\n00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:46.144\nThis is actually going to be\nunderneath the user's public folder and\n\n437\n00:23:46.144 --> 00:23:49.097\ndocuments Hyper-V and hard disk, as well.\n\n438\n00:23:49.097 --> 00:23:50.031\nAnd I can browse and\n\n439\n00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:54.130\nactually change the location of that right\nhere during the installation process.\n\n440\n00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.661\nNow the other thing and I said this at the\nbeginning I forgot to mention it again,\n\n441\n00:23:57.661 --> 00:23:58.516\nis the extension.\n\n442\n00:23:58.516 --> 00:24:04.500\nVHDX is a generation two type\nof machine that we're creating.\n\n443\n00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:09.780\nIf you see a dot VHD without the X,\nthat's gonna be a generation one and\n\n444\n00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.940\nthat's an easy way that you can\ndifferentiate between the two.\n\n445\n00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.260\nNow remember that for most of us,\nwe're not gonna really care for the exam.\n\n446\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.820\nIt's something you do\nwant to pay attention to.\n\n447\n00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.730\nThey work the same, okay?\n\n448\n00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:21.750\nThey really do.\n\n449\n00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:25.170\nOne doesn't actually give you an insanely\nbetter performance than the other one,\n\n450\n00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.790\nbecause they're all visualized.\n\n451\n00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:29.740\nIt's about what needs to be\nrecognized in the underlying hardware\n\n452\n00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.810\nis what we're taking a look for right now.\n\n453\n00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:36.330\nSo since I don't have one, we're gonna go\nahead and leave it at its default right\n\n454\n00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:39.200\nhere, and I've just,\nthe only thing I changed was the size.\n\n455\n00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.360\nIf I had an existing one that I needed\nto attach, I could do it right here, and\n\n456\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.520\nif I wanted to attach to hard disk\nlater on, I could just create the.\n\n457\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.630\nThe machine side at this point and\nthen go ahead and\n\n458\n00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.390\ndecide later on that I want\nto create a hard drive.\n\n459\n00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:55.750\nWe're gonna do that in another episode\nhere in just a little bit later on.\n\n460\n00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.570\nNow we need to decide whether we're gonna\ninstall the operating system now or\n\n461\n00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.000\nwe're gonna install it later.\n\n462\n00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.510\nSo most of us, if we have the access and\nthe ability to do it, we'll do it now.\n\n463\n00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:07.530\nSo if you do have an optical drive,\nthis is when you'd take this disc and\n\n464\n00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.620\ninsert it in, and\nthe underlying host operating system,\n\n465\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.900\nwhich is the one that is running on\nthe hardware, will recognize that.\n\n466\n00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.390\nOn mine, I'm gonna select install\nan operating system from a bootable\n\n467\n00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:18.380\nimage file.\n\n468\n00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.360\nThese bootable image files are actually\nfairly generic and unique, or\n\n469\n00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.992\nnot unique, generic,\nwhich is the .ISOs that you see.\n\n470\n00:25:25.992 --> 00:25:29.600\nI'm gonna click on browse,\nat least I think I am.\n\n471\n00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.300\nAnd then on this PC,\nI'm gonna scroll down,\n\n472\n00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.830\nuntil I get to this untitled\n16 gig drive here, and\n\n473\n00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:42.440\nI'm gonna select this Windows 10\nenterprise DVD, and click Open.\n\n474\n00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.340\nAnd that will go ahead and sort of,\nthis is like me popping an actual\n\n475\n00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:50.160\nphysical disk into the drive of that\nvirtual machine, and then we click next,\n\n476\n00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.500\nand then it gives me\na nice little summary.\n\n477\n00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.820\nThis summary is actually\nfairly helpful at this point,\n\n478\n00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.250\nbefore you go any further it's saying is\nthere any changes that you want to make.\n\n479\n00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.900\nThey're really referring\nto that generation one, or\n\n480\n00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.700\ngeneration two, because, remember,\nyou can't change it after the fact.\n\n481\n00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.940\nSo it's right here that you want to\nmake those decisions if you need to.\n\n482\n00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.720\nAll the other things you can pretty much\nchange at some point a little bit later\n\n483\n00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.050\non, and then I'm gonna click finish, and\n\n484\n00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:14.860\nnow it's beginning to configure\nthe files that I need.\n\n485\n00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.070\nIt's creating the virtual hard drive,\n\n486\n00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:21.240\nit's creating that virtual machine\nfile that we have ready to go.\n\n487\n00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.510\nSo just doing something like that\nis now getting it ready, but\n\n488\n00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.590\nit's not turned on yet.\n\n489\n00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:30.180\nSo at this point,\nif I right-click on that machine,\n\n490\n00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:35.300\nI can now select Start, and\nthen the machine will start running.\n\n491\n00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.623\nNow you're like, how do you know?\n\n492\n00:26:36.623 --> 00:26:41.636\nWell, I can see down here in the detail\nsection, it is starting to actually\n\n493\n00:26:41.636 --> 00:26:46.026\nrun now, and let me see if I can\nactually go to the machine itself.\n\n494\n00:26:46.026 --> 00:26:47.990\nSo I just double clicked on it and\nthere it is.\n\n495\n00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:49.200\nIt is now running.\n\n496\n00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.530\nIt says the status is running, and\nnow it's in the Hyper-V manager.\n\n497\n00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.200\nIt says no operating system was loaded.\n\n498\n00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.940\nSo for one reason or another it\ndid not like what I put in there.\n\n499\n00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.980\nOh, wait, there we go.\n\n500\n00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.577\nI just had to press\nEnter a couple of times.\n\n501\n00:27:04.577 --> 00:27:05.160\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I was like, oh\n\n502\n00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.720\nwhy didn't it actually boot up there?\n\n503\n00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.840\nAnd you can see where it\nactually now is loading.\n\n504\n00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.650\nSo here is the emulated hardware\nthat's running in the background and\n\n505\n00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:14.720\nit just says Hyper-V.\n\n506\n00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.270\nAnd you can see it's actually\nbeginning to load up, and\n\n507\n00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.540\nit will actually start the install\nprocess here in just a moment.\n\n508\n00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.300\nWe should see the Windows logo pop up\nhere, and at that point it's a regular\n\n509\n00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.200\ninstallation like you and I are actually\ngonna be normally used to seeing.\n\n510\n00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.090\nAnd there it is, let me see if I can pull.\n\n511\n00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.120\nIt won't let me full screen it right now.\n\n512\n00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.790\nSo at this point, I simply go ahead and\nfollow through, and\n\n513\n00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:37.180\nI'm gonna select Install Now.\n\n514\n00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.680\nAnd the good thing is,\nWindows 10 install is fairly quick, and\n\n515\n00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.320\nactually makes a fairly easy work\nof what we're doing right now.\n\n516\n00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.290\nSo during the setup everything\nshould happen as normal.\n\n517\n00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.000\nWe simply follow through\nthe instructions and in the end once\n\n518\n00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.900\neverything is actually loaded up we\nshould just about be ready to go.\n\n519\n00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.400\nNow that's really\nthe beginning process here.\n\n520\n00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.750\nIt's gonna take several minutes before\nit's actually completely installed here,\n\n521\n00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:03.260\nbut overall though, regardless of\nwhat operating system we're on.\n\n522\n00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.390\nThat's kind of the same process\nthat we normally would need to use\n\n523\n00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.410\nto get it started, but\nthere's still a lot of configuration for\n\n524\n00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:11.310\nus to go through as well.\n\n525\n00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:15.480\nSo it's at this point here inside of each\noperating system we may go ahead and\n\n526\n00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.630\nhave to ask these questions.\n\n527\n00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:19.990\nAnd I'm simply choosing\nsome of the defaults, so\n\n528\n00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:23.460\nthat we can get the process started and\nmoving on through.\n\n529\n00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.240\nSo, the speed of this of course, depends\non the hardware that it's running on,\n\n530\n00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.670\nhow much RAM you have available, the speed\nof the hard drives, and everything, but\n\n531\n00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:33.640\nonce everything loads up,\nit's fairly easy to go.\n\n532\n00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.066\nNow Daniel remembered in\nthe days of Windows XP,\n\n533\n00:28:36.066 --> 00:28:39.038\nwhen it used to take like hours\nto actually install and run.\n\n534\n00:28:39.038 --> 00:28:42.439\nToday most of them take 15-20 minutes max,\nmax!\n\n535\n00:28:42.439 --> 00:28:47.273\n>> Yeah, it's super fast nowadays,\nit's nowhere near like it was back when\n\n536\n00:28:47.273 --> 00:28:50.110\nRonnie and\nI were crawling out of the cave and\n\n537\n00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.886\nchiseling on our tablets to\nget Windows XP up and running.\n\n538\n00:28:53.886 --> 00:28:55.015\nEven though those were great operating\n\n539\n00:28:55.015 --> 00:28:55.824\nsystems-\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n540\n00:28:55.824 --> 00:29:00.446\n>> the speed in which they've got this\ndown to a science, it is so much easier.\n\n541\n00:29:00.446 --> 00:29:03.050\nWe can install it, like Ronnie said,\nI've actually done,\n\n542\n00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.588\nI think a Windows 7 install, but a Windows\n10, would probably be just as fast.\n\n543\n00:29:06.588 --> 00:29:09.956\nI've done it from start to finish,\nvirtual machine, Windows 7 install,\n\n544\n00:29:09.956 --> 00:29:10.964\nin under ten minutes.\n\n545\n00:29:10.964 --> 00:29:12.706\n>> Wow.\n>> Super, super fast.\n\n546\n00:29:12.706 --> 00:29:14.747\nSo, this stuff can be very, very helpful.\n\n547\n00:29:14.747 --> 00:29:18.238\nIt's great to have that kind of speed,\nespecially when it comes to,\n\n548\n00:29:18.238 --> 00:29:20.239\nyou're trying to test something out.\n\n549\n00:29:20.239 --> 00:29:21.262\nYou've got somebody on a phone.\n\n550\n00:29:21.262 --> 00:29:24.226\nYou've got somebody hovering over\nyour desk, and you're like okay well,\n\n551\n00:29:24.226 --> 00:29:25.441\nlet me get this up and running.\n\n552\n00:29:25.441 --> 00:29:26.695\nHaving that kind of speed is very,\n\n553\n00:29:26.695 --> 00:29:29.087\nvery helpful because they're not\njust sitting around waiting.\n\n554\n00:29:29.087 --> 00:29:30.874\nThings are happening,\nthings are moving and\n\n555\n00:29:30.874 --> 00:29:32.906\nit doesn't feel like\nyou're just sitting there.\n\n556\n00:29:32.906 --> 00:29:35.100\nSo it's nice that it's this fast.\n\n557\n00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.770\n>> It really is nice that it's this fast,\nas well as,\n\n558\n00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.810\nremember that what can happen here right.\n\n559\n00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.300\nEven though you might use\nthis as a testing bed for\n\n560\n00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.316\nwhat you're actually trying to test.\n\n561\n00:29:44.316 --> 00:29:48.320\nIt could be that you go look, I do need\nto get a server up and running soon, but\n\n562\n00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.777\nright now you can't get\naccess to the server.\n\n563\n00:29:50.777 --> 00:29:54.473\nYou can go ahead and begin creating\nthat virtual machine right here\n\n564\n00:29:54.473 --> 00:29:58.235\ninside of your Windows 10 build,\nand then have it imported over,\n\n565\n00:29:58.235 --> 00:30:01.970\nor exported out of yours and\nimported into that other one.\n\n566\n00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.000\nAnd it shouldn't actually\nlose any of the properties,\n\n567\n00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.960\nor qualities that it should find\non the production one as well.\n\n568\n00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.090\nAs long as you set those settings\nthe way that you need to.\n\n569\n00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.070\nRemember, if you're doing it for\na production environment,\n\n570\n00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:16.310\nyou're gonna set everything to static,\nin the testing environment only testing,\n\n571\n00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:19.700\ndynamic is probably gonna be\na lot more easy on your hardware,\n\n572\n00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:23.870\nas well as actually be a lot\nmore easy on your sanity.\n\n573\n00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.900\nAs all of a sudden, you start trying to\nlaunch a couple of virtual machines and\n\n574\n00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.920\nnotice you don't have enough resources\navailable to do what you want to do.\n\n575\n00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.549\nSo that's all the rest of\nthis process is gonna do.\n\n576\n00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:35.500\nIt's gonna finish its installation,\nand then when it boots up,\n\n577\n00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.677\nthat's when we also have to configure\nsome other additional things.\n\n578\n00:30:38.677 --> 00:30:43.030\nSuch as the networking and\nalso some of the video stuff.\n\n579\n00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.870\nThere's a little bit more that we\nhave to do to get it operational but\n\n580\n00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:51.470\nDaniel, as of that, that's what\nthe overall installation is about.\n\n581\n00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:55.910\nGetting everything in place, and getting\nit ready to go, making those decisions is\n\n582\n00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:59.830\nkey, but it looks like we actually are\ngonna have to go to a part three Daniel.\n\n583\n00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.290\n>> Oh yeah, yeah this is definitely part\nthree land, not a big deal though because\n\n584\n00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.720\nwe are actually going to have some\ngreat details to cover in there\n\n585\n00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.930\n>> Like Ronnie already mentioned,\n\n586\n00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:10.320\ngetting the networking running,\nmaking sure video is displaying properly.\n\n587\n00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.100\nCouple little more tweaks, other bells and\nwhistles that are available.\n\n588\n00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.720\nAnd then you've got a fully functional\nvirtual machine using a Hyper-V\n\n589\n00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.970\nmanagement system.\n\n590\n00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.110\nVery, very nice.\n\n591\n00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.270\nAs for this episode, though,\nwe're gonna go ahead and call it quits.\n\n592\n00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:26.010\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it and\nyou got something out of it.\n\n593\n00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:27.010\nThanks for watching.\n\n594\n00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.470\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n595\n00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.420\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n596\n00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:30.961\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n597\n00:31:30.961 --> 00:31:32.156\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n598\n00:31:32.156 -->

great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.870\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.130\nJoining me today is none other than\nmy good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.950\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.940\n>> It's going great today.\n\n8\n00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.210\nIt's another great day to be right here in\nthe studio as we continue to prepare for\n\n9\n00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.220\nthe 70697 exam,\nconfiguring Windows devices.\n\n10\n00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.565\nAnd we're actually taking a look at is\nactually our third part in a little\n\n11\n00:00:34.565 --> 00:00:35.140\nmini-series.\n\n12\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.794\nI mean with us who would've guessed-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:36.794 --> 00:00:38.600\n>> It would have been three parts by now.\n\n14\n00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.550\nBut that seems to be a trend actually,\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n15\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.570\nSo this is our third part here\nas we configure Hyper-V is\n\n16\n00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.610\nwhat we're taking a look at.\n\n17\n00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.750\nSo we've already previously showed you\nhow to install the Hyper-V client role\n\n18\n00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.170\non the client side,\nin other words in Windows 10.\n\n19\n00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.800\nWe also showed you how to build a virtual\nmachine inside of the client Hyper-V.\n\n20\n00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.510\nAnd this time we have\na few things left for\n\n21\n00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.620\nus to do to make sure that it can\nconnect to, well, either each other or\n\n22\n00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.460\neven out into the world if we\nwant that to happen as well.\n\n23\n00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.215\nSo in the previous episodes, we went ahead\nand we created a Windows Server 2012\n\n24\n00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:20.190\nHyper-V machine, or a virtual machine,\nas well as a Windows 10 virtual\n\n25\n00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.390\nmachine just so that we could see that we\ncould run both of those operating systems.\n\n26\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.020\nBut when we did so, there was\nstill a few things left to do and\n\n27\n00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.120\nthat is because it's not fully integrated\nyet to work with our machines.\n\n28\n00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.530\nLet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n29\n00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.240\nSo a lot of times inside\nof the Windows machine,\n\n30\n00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.840\nwhat we'll actually end up seeing, and\nthis is the 2012 Server is what we'll see.\n\n31\n00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.980\nAnd what normally happens is you\nmight not be able to fullscreen it,\n\n32\n00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.720\nyou might not be able to\nget the audio through it.\n\n33\n00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.050\nYou might not be able to get\na lot of things through here.\n\n34\n00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.860\nAnd the reason why is that there is\nsomething that we call the integration\n\n35\n00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.420\nservices in Hyper-V that\nneeds to be installed.\n\n36\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.700\nIntegration services are what we call\nsynthetic drivers that allow for\n\n37\n00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.815\nthat virtual machine to\nbe able to recognize and\n\n38\n00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:05.525\nfeel like it's actually\npart of a real machine.\n\n39\n00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.785\nSo it's not actually kind\nof just trying to emulate,\n\n40\n00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:10.515\nit's actually saying hey, is this what\nyou're really telling me you are?\n\n41\n00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:14.235\nAnd that's what these integration\nservices do for us, and that allows for\n\n42\n00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:15.930\nthis machine to be fullscreen.\n\n43\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.770\nIt allows for us to be able to have some\nof the different things like file copy,\n\n44\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.300\ndisplay drivers, everything else that we\nneed to make this feel like a real machine\n\n45\n00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.298\nas we connect to it and\ndo everything that we need to.\n\n46\n00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:28.700\nBut it's not working, you'll see,\n\n47\n00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.280\nyou won't be able to get the proper\ndisplay size to fit your screen.\n\n48\n00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.500\nYou'll even see that sometimes what will\nend up happening is the mouse will lock\n\n49\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.560\ninside to the virtual window.\n\n50\n00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.008\nAnd you won't be able to get your mouse\nout of that window without actually\n\n51\n00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:42.630\ngetting these things installed.\n\n52\n00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.504\nSo, in previous editions of the Hyper-V,\n\n53\n00:02:45.504 --> 00:02:48.546\nthe good thing was that\nyou had a way to do that.\n\n54\n00:02:48.546 --> 00:02:52.465\nAnd so, Daniel, what you used to do,\nis you would go up here to where it said\n\n55\n00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:55.795\nmedia, and it was right here that\nyou would find another link.\n\n56\n00:02:55.795 --> 00:02:59.604\nAnd that link used say, the integration\nservices, is what it used to say or\n\n57\n00:02:59.604 --> 00:03:01.000\nsomething like that.\n\n58\n00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.960\nIntegration tools,\nsomething in that vein, and Daniel,\n\n59\n00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.250\nyou've actually even worked with other\nvirtual machine technologies and\n\n60\n00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.770\nyou've seen something like this too,\nright?\n\n61\n00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.070\n>> Yeah, they all tend to have\nsomething very, very similar,\n\n62\n00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.590\nbecause you gotta remember, when you\ninstall Windows into a virtual machine,\n\n63\n00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.430\nit says okay I'm running as normal.\n\n64\n00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.520\nBut once the operating system actually\ngets installed, what's it gonna do?\n\n65\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.820\nIt's gonna start looking for hardware.\n\n66\n00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.500\nWe gotta remember, all the hardware's\nvirtualized at this point, so\n\n67\n00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.720\nmost of virtualization companies,\n\n68\n00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.590\nvirtualization software, has a set of\nbasic drivers so the things like mouse,\n\n69\n00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.220\nand the keyboard, and monitor, and\neverything work as you expect them to.\n\n70\n00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.270\nI've worked with VirtualBox, I've worked\nwith VMware, and a little but of Citrix.\n\n71\n00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.335\nThey all have this.\n\n72\n00:03:43.335 --> 00:03:45.950\nHyper-V, no different.\n\n73\n00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.840\nThey need to say what hardware am I\nemulating, so I can emulate it correctly?\n\n74\n00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.225\nAnd that's where this extensions come in,\nthese drivers that we need to install.\n\n75\n00:03:55.225 --> 00:03:57.575\nBut like Ronnie said,\nthey're no longer where they used to be.\n\n76\n00:03:57.575 --> 00:04:00.865\nThey've kind of migrated\ninto a different area.\n\n77\n00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:04.025\n>> They have migrated into\na different area due to the wisdom,\n\n78\n00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:06.465\nthe wizards at Microsoft--\n>> The powers that be.\n\n79\n00:04:06.465 --> 00:04:07.885\n>> The powers that be, right,\n\n80\n00:04:07.885 --> 00:04:11.555\nsaid that the way that everybody else\ndoes it apparently is not sufficient.\n\n81\n00:04:11.555 --> 00:04:12.875\n>> It's stupid.\n\n82\n00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:14.534\n>> It may be so.\n\n83\n00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:17.955\nWhatever their decision was,\nthey decided to offload that.\n\n84\n00:04:17.955 --> 00:04:19.629\nIt used to be a simple ISO, right?\n\n85\n00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:25.629\nJust a file you could actually\nmount as a DVD or a CD.\n\n86\n00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:28.130\nSo it would actually mount\nas an optical drive.\n\n87\n00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.100\nAnd when you had something like that,\nright?\n\n88\n00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.160\nThe file to be able to\ndo something like that.\n\n89\n00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.980\nIt was fairly simple.\n\n90\n00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.550\nYou would just select where it said media,\nand you would just connect to it, and\n\n91\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.100\nthat would be it.\n\n92\n00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.462\nBut now, we don't have anything there.\n\n93\n00:04:39.462 --> 00:04:42.695\nAnd so, this is one of the buzzes\nthat people were not liking\n\n94\n00:04:42.695 --> 00:04:44.837\nduring the development time, right?\n\n95\n00:04:44.837 --> 00:04:47.617\nWhen you install,\nthe technical previews are like,\n\n96\n00:04:47.617 --> 00:04:50.470\nwhere in the world did these\nintegration services go?\n\n97\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.520\nAnd what would start happening, and\nwhat they actually realized after a while,\n\n98\n00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.430\nis that during that time when\nthey were trying to do that,\n\n99\n00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.370\nthey couldn't get anything\nlike that to install.\n\n100\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.260\nSo people were very disappointed.\n\n101\n00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.310\nBut toward the end of that\ndevelopment period and\n\n102\n00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.000\ntechnical previews, they started\nactually letting everybody in on it.\n\n103\n00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.120\nAnd the way that this is done now is,\nRonnie,\n\n104\n00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.190\nyou just have to be patient, and\nautomatically what will happen is\n\n105\n00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.560\nthese integration tools will actually just\nbe magically installed onto the VM itself.\n\n106\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.450\nAnd then you're like, wow, look, it works.\n\n107\n00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.890\nNow, it didn't work yesterday,\nwhat in the world happened?\n\n108\n00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.880\nDaniel, what tends to happen almost daily\nwith Windows machines that we tend to do?\n\n109\n00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.070\nWhat could that be?\n\n110\n00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.850\n>> What could that be?\n\n111\n00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.950\nWell it's probably Windows updates.\n\n112\n00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.480\nOur favorite little step-child\nof the Windows system.\n\n113\n00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.380\nThat's right, if you have your updates\nturned off, which you can't really do in\n\n114\n00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.130\nWindows 10, which is probably why they've\nshoveled it into the Windows update area.\n\n115\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.740\nIt says, hey you're gonna be looking for\nstuff off the internet to download and\n\n116\n00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.380\ninstall into your system anyway,\nmight as well go ahead and roll that up.\n\n117\n00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.960\nTheir philosophy really seems to be\nthat what they're trying to do is take\n\n118\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.170\nanother step away from you\nthat you have to accomplish\n\n119\n00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.520\nto get these virtual\nmachines to work correctly.\n\n120\n00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.340\nUnfortunately, Ronnie is absolutely\ncorrect when it comes to, there's one\n\n121\n00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.880\nthing, I've noticed as tech guys, we don't\nreally have a lot of, and that's patience.\n\n122\n00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.670\nWe want it done yesterday,\nnot tomorrow and, so\n\n123\n00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.910\nthe trade off is instead of you having\nto go out, find the ISO, download it, or\n\n124\n00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.460\nget it from right there within\nthe VM console, you have to wait for\n\n125\n00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.550\nin actual update systems to do it for you.\n\n126\n00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.810\nIf you can still have the patient stuff,\nyou've got that.\n\n127\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.700\nYou could just sit back and relax and\n\n128\n00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.370\nrealize that as soon as you get all\nthe updates done on your system, and\n\n129\n00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.390\nobviously, you can take\nthose off manually.\n\n130\n00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.950\nJust go into the update section,\nfire off a Windows check for updates.\n\n131\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.870\nIt will find it and\nthen install it for your VMs.\n\n132\n00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.260\nAfter that's done, plus still have\nthe added benefit of knowing that\n\n133\n00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.270\nnot only do you have the integration\ntools installed and ready to go for\n\n134\n00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.670\nyour VMs, but your system is up to\ndate as well, staving off all bad,\n\n135\n00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.599\nunfortunates that might come across.\n\n136\n00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:55.550\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n137\n00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.590\nso the way that Daniel's describing it is,\n\n138\n00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.710\nthis is what happened to me the first\ntime that I did this, right?\n\n139\n00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.290\nSo on this machine, on my computer,\nI went ahead and I said,\n\n140\n00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.500\nall right, we'll just let\nthe updates kind of build up.\n\n141\n00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.740\nJust do everything after a fresh,\nclean install.\n\n142\n00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.450\nAnd immediately after that I was like,\nall right.\n\n143\n00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.270\nSo, as it did that all the sudden\nI realized something, Daniel,\n\n144\n00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.790\nthat at least at some point in time in the\nlast few hours or so, 40 updates up here.\n\n145\n00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.555\nYeah so 40 updates.\n\n146\n00:07:25.555 --> 00:07:29.025\nOne of those updates is gonna be\nsome of those integration tools\n\n147\n00:07:29.025 --> 00:07:31.915\nthat are actually right here\non this particular pack.\n\n148\n00:07:31.915 --> 00:07:34.815\nThe problem that we have though is,\nit has 40 updates.\n\n149\n00:07:34.815 --> 00:07:35.545\nIt could take a while.\n\n150\n00:07:35.545 --> 00:07:38.702\nThey could really take a while to\nactually install, and do all that stuff,\n\n151\n00:07:38.702 --> 00:07:42.994\nand boot up, and all of a sudden\nthis show turns out to be part 96.\n\n152\n00:07:42.994 --> 00:07:44.912\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As we're going, oh look,\n\n153\n00:07:44.912 --> 00:07:46.232\nanother update just installed.\n\n154\n00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:47.732\nWe don't wanna do that of course.\n\n155\n00:07:47.732 --> 00:07:51.532\nSo one of these updates is that\nupdate that we're talking about.\n\n156\n00:07:51.532 --> 00:07:54.767\nSo you normally actually end up finding\nit also under optional updates.\n\n157\n00:07:54.767 --> 00:07:59.271\nAnd that's true now on the inside\nof the technical preview side.\n\n158\n00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:02.115\nIt might have been an important\nupdate at the very beginning.\n\n159\n00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:03.657\nNow, they consider it optional,\n\n160\n00:08:03.657 --> 00:08:07.234\nand that's because it will check if\nyou're running inside of Hyper-V or not.\n\n161\n00:08:07.234 --> 00:08:08.940\nIf you're not running inside of Hyper-V,\n\n162\n00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.240\nthey're not gonna install\nthose integration services.\n\n163\n00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.370\nIf you are, they definitely\nare gonna install on there.\n\n164\n00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.950\nSo, that's why it's considered optional.\n\n165\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.900\nNow, you can't see it right now, and\nthat's because inside of this little VM,\n\n166\n00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.900\nright, without those tools installed,\nI can't really adjust all the settings and\n\n167\n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.840\ndo all the stuff that I need to.\n\n168\n00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.970\nSo, I'm not actually able to do that.\n\n169\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.510\nBut, I will show you the link here, and\n\n170\n00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.980\nwe'll make sure that we include\nit also in the show notes.\n\n171\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.440\nLet me see, let me make that larger.\n\n172\n00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.700\nIt looks big to me but that doesn't\nnecessarily mean it looks large to you.\n\n173\n00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.885\nSo, it is right here let's\nchange that up to a 24 point,\n\n174\n00:08:42.885 --> 00:08:46.845\nthat will actually make it easier for\nus to see.\n\n175\n00:08:46.845 --> 00:08:47.345\nWell, maybe.\n\n176\n00:08:48.385 --> 00:08:50.055\nClick Okay, there we go.\n\n177\n00:08:50.055 --> 00:08:51.835\nNope, stretch that out.\n\n178\n00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:55.600\nSo, here's the link that you\nwant to actually be able to see.\n\n179\n00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.090\nIf this is what's happening.\n\n180\n00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.450\nNow normally, like I said,\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n181\n00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.850\nIt should update automatically.\n\n182\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:05.740\nBut, if for one reason or another it\ndoes not, you can follow this link,\n\n183\n00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.470\nwhich I've went ahead of course,\nand previously pulled up.\n\n184\n00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.660\nAnd it tells you right here,\nHyper-V integration components update for\n\n185\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.600\nWindows virtual machines that\nare running on a Windows 10 based host.\n\n186\n00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.620\nWell, that's exactly what we're doing.\n\n187\n00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.134\nAnd if I scroll down, the nice thing\nis this thing is constantly updated.\n\n188\n00:09:22.134 --> 00:09:23.227\nSo, you can follow this or\n\n189\n00:09:23.227 --> 00:09:26.085\nyou can use the Windows Updates\nto do whatever you need to.\n\n190\n00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:31.615\nBut, notice it actually is for\nversions of Windows 7, Windows 8,\n\n191\n00:09:31.615 --> 00:09:36.825\nand 8.1 So even if my machine tried\nto update, that Server 2012 machine.\n\n192\n00:09:36.825 --> 00:09:38.695\nIt's saying it's not really designed for\nit,\n\n193\n00:09:38.695 --> 00:09:43.190\nso it may still be a little bit glitchy\nif we were to do something like this.\n\n194\n00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.440\nAnd what about Windows 10 machine?\n\n195\n00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.990\nWell that's included in their\nown little update as well.\n\n196\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.450\nBut, this is where you do see that.\n\n197\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.080\nSo, that's the update that\nyou're normally looking for.\n\n198\n00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.410\nAnd you do want to remember,\nespecially when you're getting ready for\n\n199\n00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.280\nthe exam, if you need to install\nWindows integration tools,\n\n200\n00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.750\nyou just have to update\nthe machine in Windows 10.\n\n201\n00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.760\nYou should be perfectly fine,\nand ready to go.\n\n202\n00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.512\nSo, the good thing is,\nI've already done this.\n\n203\n00:10:03.512 --> 00:10:05.114\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, that's what I want us to actually\n\n204\n00:10:05.114 --> 00:10:05.942\ntake a look at here.\n\n205\n00:10:05.942 --> 00:10:06.905\nSo.\n>> Through the magic of television.\n\n206\n00:10:06.905 --> 00:10:07.868\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n207\n00:10:07.868 --> 00:10:09.262\nThrough the magic of preparation here.\n\n208\n00:10:09.262 --> 00:10:10.561\n[CROSSTALK] Television.\n\n209\n00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:11.980\n>> Only six hours of work.\n\n210\n00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.990\n>> Yeah.\nYeah.\n\n211\n00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.860\nFor two minutes.\n\n212\n00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.800\nBut, that's fine.\n\n213\n00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.290\nWe do it for our members,\nand we love them.\n\n214\n00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.590\n>> That's right.\n>> So, here it is.\n\n215\n00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.370\nSo, if I take this,\nlet me pull this back here for a moment.\n\n216\n00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.970\nSo, now you can actually see\nI can full screen this thing.\n\n217\n00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.660\nSo, when it actually all comes in and\nall those updates are actually applied and\n\n218\n00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.720\nwhat they do.\n\n219\n00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.440\nI now can full screen it and\nit now looks well, beautiful.\n\n220\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.780\nIt's just so majestic.\n\n221\n00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.670\nNow, it at least looks like\nit's something I can work with.\n\n222\n00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.740\nEspecially, on a 12 inch monitor.\n\n223\n00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.110\nNow, if you're ever unsure of whether or\nnot the updates have taken place or\n\n224\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.280\nnot, let me show you where\nyou can verify that.\n\n225\n00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.486\nSo, usually a lot of times,\nif you can do this and also,\n\n226\n00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:53.600\nlet me if I kind of resize this down,\nif you can move your mouse in and out of\n\n227\n00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.460\nthat window freely, it normally means that\nthose tools have actually been installed.\n\n228\n00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.739\nBut, that's not the technical\nway to delve, okay?\n\n229\n00:10:59.739 --> 00:11:02.344\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's the Ronnie Wong tried and\n\n230\n00:11:02.344 --> 00:11:05.760\ntrue way, but that doesn't necessarily\nmean it's just the technical way.\n\n231\n00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.710\nBut, there is a more verifiable\nway that you can do this.\n\n232\n00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.700\nI'm just gonna minimize that,\nI'm gonna select that Windows 10\n\n233\n00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.970\nmachine that's running right there,\nand then if I go to settings, maybe.\n\n234\n00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.100\nIt's coming, it's pulling up here.\n\n235\n00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.610\nWhat we're looking for is over here on\nthe left hand side under management and\n\n236\n00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.540\nit is right here where it\nsays integration services.\n\n237\n00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:33.170\nIf you do not have any of these things\nchecked or they are grayed out it probably\n\n238\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:37.185\nmeans that your operating system does\nnot have those integration tools\n\n239\n00:11:37.185 --> 00:11:40.925\ninstalled in them, and so you can see\nwhat else it actually allows you to do.\n\n240\n00:11:40.925 --> 00:11:46.387\nIt allows you to shut the operating system\ndown, from actually, just click on it.\n\n241\n00:11:46.387 --> 00:11:47.887\nTime synchronization,\n\n242\n00:11:47.887 --> 00:11:53.507\ndata exchange between the host as\nwell as the guest VM inside of it.\n\n243\n00:11:53.507 --> 00:11:54.857\nOf course, even Heartbeat,\n\n244\n00:11:54.857 --> 00:11:59.547\nif you are running clustering services,\nit allows you to do the Heartbeat stuff.\n\n245\n00:11:59.547 --> 00:12:01.597\nBackups of course, volume shadow copy, and\n\n246\n00:12:01.597 --> 00:12:04.107\neven the additional guest\nservices that may be available.\n\n247\n00:12:04.107 --> 00:12:08.110\nMore about the mouse and the display and\neverything that we normally would need,\n\n248\n00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.850\nto make sure that machine is\nworking the way that we want.\n\n249\n00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:14.500\nSo, we do have those\noptions available to us.\n\n250\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.860\nAnd we do want to make\nsure that we install them.\n\n251\n00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.930\nI don't know of a time,\nand I really mean this.\n\n252\n00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:23.860\nI don't know of a time that I said, look,\nwe shouldn't just install these things.\n\n253\n00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.700\nIf you're gonna build a virtual machine\ninside of the Windows 10 client Hyper-V,\n\n254\n00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.900\nyou should install these guest editions.\n\n255\n00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.440\nAnd the nice thing is they're not\ngonna actually let you not do it,\n\n256\n00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.680\nthrough those updates.\n\n257\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.510\nYou can probably go in there, and just on\nthe optional updates, if you see them, and\n\n258\n00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.390\nyou haven't installed it the first time,\nyou can probably go in there and\n\n259\n00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.040\ngo, okay,\nI can hide this update if you want to.\n\n260\n00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.980\nBut, that's just gonna\ncause more trouble on you.\n\n261\n00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.950\nI don't know of any situation that I\nwould say in a virtual environment,\n\n262\n00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.150\nyeah let's just forget about those tools.\n\n263\n00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.990\nI've never seen it.\n\n264\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.740\nAnd the other thing that\nyou also want to do,\n\n265\n00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.330\nright, is if client Hyper-V does update.\n\n266\n00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:03.606\nSo, sometime in the life\ncycle of Windows 10,\n\n267\n00:13:03.606 --> 00:13:09.740\nif they come out with\na Hyper-V beta addition.\n\n268\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.004\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n269\n00:13:12.004 --> 00:13:14.127\n>> If they go about every 2.1 edition one\n\n270\n00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:17.550\ndays there's an update\n>> Well even if they do that right,\n\n271\n00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:22.070\nit's always recommended that you also\ngo ahead and update there to right?\n\n272\n00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.390\nSo, that the new virtual machine editions\nare doing that, I have seen it in older\n\n273\n00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:32.490\neditions, not of Hyper-V but even in\nother software like Zenserver and stuff.\n\n274\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:38.510\nWhere we updated from like 2.1 to 2.2 and\nthe 2.1 editions made the machine go nuts.\n\n275\n00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.380\nSo, you had to go in there in this very\nlimped mode and uninstall those and\n\n276\n00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.520\nthen install the new tools and then\neverything was back and perfect again.\n\n277\n00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.750\nSo, it's always recommended that you\ndo keep those versions lined up.\n\n278\n00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.200\nDon't just assume that\nthey're going to work.\n\n279\n00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.000\nAlways uninstall the old ones and\nput the new ones on there too.\n\n280\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.158\nSo that's the heart of the services that\nwe have to think about when we're also\n\n281\n00:13:57.158 --> 00:13:58.673\nrunning virtual machines.\n\n282\n00:13:58.673 --> 00:13:59.923\nBut, that's not all, right?\n\n283\n00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:01.130\n>> No, that's definitely, not all.\n\n284\n00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.700\nNow, we've got these machines\nwhere they look normal,\n\n285\n00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.100\nthey're acting little normally,\nwell I know the first thing I want to\n\n286\n00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.730\ndo when I get on the computer is\nusually access some sort of network.\n\n287\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.170\nSo, we have to make that happen.\n\n288\n00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.740\nIt doesn't just magically appear and\ngo \"oh yes, there's a network,\n\n289\n00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.990\nyou don't have to worry about that, user,\nI've got that covered for you.\" no,\n\n290\n00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:23.160\ninside of the Hyper-V system you do have\ndo a little bit of configuration when\n\n291\n00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.890\nit comes to the networking stuff.\n\n292\n00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.330\nAnd if you don't know the terminology,\nmight be a little setback and,\n\n293\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.600\nI'm not exactly sure\nwhich option to chose.\n\n294\n00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.130\nSo Ronnie,\nthat's where you come into play.\n\n295\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.620\nYou're gonna help us out with that and\nkind of demystify what's right?\n\n296\n00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.210\n>> Right.\nIf you think about it inside of\n\n297\n00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.850\nthe Hyper-V environment and so totally\nvirtual environment so it's not like I\n\n298\n00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.720\nliterally took hardware and built\na new PC and put a network adapter in.\n\n299\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.100\nSo, how do I connect a virtual\nmachine that has no physical cable\n\n300\n00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.010\ninto a network somewhere else?\n\n301\n00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.410\nWell, the way that we do that is by\nconnecting it to what we call a virtual\n\n302\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.360\nswitch.\n\n303\n00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.800\nA virtual switch is a representation,\nof course, of a network.\n\n304\n00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.490\nSo, just like a regular physical switch,\nall the devices that we plug into a single\n\n305\n00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:09.060\nphysical switch, normally are going to\nbe what devices within the same subnet\n\n306\n00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.980\ninside of the Hyper-V console,\nin the management console that we have,\n\n307\n00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.210\nwe have the ability to create and\nbuild our own virtual switches.\n\n308\n00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.130\nAnd it can give us the needs that we want,\nso that we can configure them in kind\n\n309\n00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:25.970\nof a neat way, either to limit it to\njust a virtual machine itself, or\n\n310\n00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.230\nwe can actually say look,\nno we need this to connect externally.\n\n311\n00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.200\nOutside to this machine and want to.\n\n312\n00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.800\nWe can even limit it to actually only\nconnect to our host machine if we\n\n313\n00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.850\nwanted to as well.\n\n314\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.440\nLet's show you how to do that.\n\n315\n00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.460\nSo, here it is.\n\n316\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.890\nI've just selected,\nlet's say, this one machine.\n\n317\n00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.390\nNow, I've already connected one, but\n\n318\n00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.240\nI do want to show you how you\ncan actually make one yourself.\n\n319\n00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.410\nSo, if I go to settings right now,\n\n320\n00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.730\nlet me show you,\nI am connected to a virtual network.\n\n321\n00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:54.477\nIf I go to settings, and now inside\nof settings, what I'm looking for\n\n322\n00:15:54.477 --> 00:15:55.933\nis network adapter.\n\n323\n00:15:55.933 --> 00:15:59.355\nSo, network adapter is right here,\nand inside of network adapter,\n\n324\n00:15:59.355 --> 00:16:01.540\nyou see where it actually\nsays test switch.\n\n325\n00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.050\nWell, this is a network\nthat I created just so\n\n326\n00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.430\nthat we could make some\ntype of connection in here.\n\n327\n00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.650\nNow, if I wanted to disconnect it,\njust like pulling the cable out from that\n\n328\n00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:15.020\nmachine, I could simply select Not\nConnected and that would work as 1well.\n\n329\n00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.800\nSo, if I wanted to test something and\n\n330\n00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.120\nverify that this machine was not\ncausing issues, I could do that.\n\n331\n00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.260\nBut, what if I didn't want to stay\nconnected to a network that was ready in\n\n332\n00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.170\nexistence, and I wanted to move this\nmachine off to a different network?\n\n333\n00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:34.370\nAll I have to do is that over here on the\nleft-hand side, where it says NATE XPS.\n\n334\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.440\nSo, that's actually saying\nthe entire Hyper VM machine I'm\n\n335\n00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.060\ngonna select Virtual Switch Manager.\n\n336\n00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.620\nAnd it is here that I can\nadd in a new virtual switch.\n\n337\n00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.800\nExternal means it's gonna connect off\nof this machine out into the network\n\n338\n00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.900\nworld somewhere.\n\n339\n00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.460\nInternal really means, well,\n\n340\n00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.649\njust between those machines that\nare inside my client Hyper-V.\n\n341\n00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:55.586\nAnd then we have this private one.\n\n342\n00:16:55.586 --> 00:16:59.393\nAnd the private one really says, it says\ncreates a virtual switch that can be\n\n343\n00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:03.400\nonly used, the virtual machines\nthat run on this physical computer.\n\n344\n00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.950\nSo, really isolates down those\nvirtual machines to each other and\n\n345\n00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.920\nto that one computer as well.\n\n346\n00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.520\nSo, if I wanted to,\nlet's say I'm gonna select internal.\n\n347\n00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.800\nI don't want these machines to\nconnect outside of each other.\n\n348\n00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.190\nI can create a virtual switch,\nand it's in here.\n\n349\n00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:20.380\nI can now name it.\n\n350\n00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:25.327\nSo, let's say that I want this to\n\n351\n00:17:25.327 --> 00:17:30.950\nbe rav.itpro.tv.\n\n352\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.020\nAnd then I select Internal Network to\nkeep them all on the same network.\n\n353\n00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.420\nAnd then I can click OK or\nI can click Apply.\n\n354\n00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.860\nVerify that it shows up here.\n\n355\n00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.840\nNow, once the changes actually do show up,\nand it says internal only,\n\n356\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.850\nnotice that this one's actually\nconnected to my network adapter.\n\n357\n00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:51.655\nThe test switch is, but\nthis one's contained internal only.\n\n358\n00:17:51.655 --> 00:17:57.630\nThen all I have to do is go into\nthe settings of my virtual machine and\n\n359\n00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:04.692\nsimply plug them into a new network\nadapter, which is gonna be labitpro.tv.\n\n360\n00:18:04.692 --> 00:18:06.760\nClick OK there.\n\n361\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.835\nAnd then I'll select this Windows Server\n2012 machine and do the same thing here.\n\n362\n00:18:14.654 --> 00:18:16.918\nAnd select that one.\n\n363\n00:18:16.918 --> 00:18:19.402\nAnd put them all on the same network.\n\n364\n00:18:19.402 --> 00:18:23.454\nFrom there you can now actually\nisolate your own machines to do so.\n\n365\n00:18:23.454 --> 00:18:25.362\nMost of the time once\nyou actually do that,\n\n366\n00:18:25.362 --> 00:18:28.990\nyou can now have that Windows Server\n2012 machine turn on DHCP.\n\n367\n00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.120\nAnd have all of those machines\nactually get the HTTP if you want to.\n\n368\n00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.322\nSo, it's just kind of in a little amazing\nlittle test network if you want to.\n\n369\n00:18:35.322 --> 00:18:38.640\nNow, if you do need a test, you'd be\nserving other clients that are out there.\n\n370\n00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.650\nYou can also create that external one that\nwill allow it to connect outside and will\n\n371\n00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.970\nuse your network adapter essentially as\na gateway as what we'll end up happening.\n\n372\n00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.710\nAnd so you'll see that too.\n\n373\n00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.980\nSo, that's one of the basic things\nthat we can actually be able to do.\n\n374\n00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:54.570\nThat is really helpful, especially if\nwe need to do testing as a network.\n\n375\n00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.960\nBut, we don't want it to affect our entire\nnetwork that we're plugged into cause\n\n376\n00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.850\nthat could be bad.\n\n377\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:04.339\n>> Yeah, I love the flexibility of virtual\nmachines to be able to isolate networks or\n\n378\n00:19:04.339 --> 00:19:08.110\nadd to the network as I need\nto within my own system.\n\n379\n00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:11.200\nCreating those test\nenvironments are invaluable\n\n380\n00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.820\nreasons to use a virtual environment.\n\n381\n00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:18.250\nIt's one of the definitely my\ntop five when it comes to VMs.\n\n382\n00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.610\nAnother one of my top five though\nis definitely going to be,\n\n383\n00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.440\nwhile working with the actual\ndisk space itself.\n\n384\n00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.741\nNot just because, your using a virtual\nenvironment doesn't mean you can't mess\n\n385\n00:19:28.741 --> 00:19:32.665\naround with the actual storage and\nthat's what we want to take a look at next\n\n386\n00:19:32.665 --> 00:19:36.215\nRonnie, help us out with this we can\ncreate storage and attach it and\n\n387\n00:19:36.215 --> 00:19:37.989\nall sorts of cool stuff, right?\n\n388\n00:19:37.989 --> 00:19:42.187\n>> We really can and the nice thing about\nit is that they actually made it better as\n\n389\n00:19:42.187 --> 00:19:46.910\nvirtual machine technology has gotten\nbetter, they've made it even better now.\n\n390\n00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.835\nThe way that we used to\ndo this is fairly simple.\n\n391\n00:19:48.835 --> 00:19:53.280\nWe'll just create another VHD and we would\njust attach it to the machine just by\n\n392\n00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.340\nusing the settings that\nwe would normally do.\n\n393\n00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.390\nBut, the problem is it still followed the\nsame rules as regular virtual machines.\n\n394\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.200\nRegular physical machines did.\n\n395\n00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.360\nAnd which, what I would normally do\noff course if I needed to add a second\n\n396\n00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.820\nhard drive into a machine.\n\n397\n00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.830\nPower down, take the cover off,\nadd it in, turn the power back on.\n\n398\n00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.420\nSo, that's the way that you and\nI would normally add another hard drive.\n\n399\n00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.768\nBut, what they've done in\nthese virtual machines,\n\n400\n00:20:16.768 --> 00:20:19.491\nlet me show you the settings here\nis what we're taking a look.\n\n401\n00:20:19.491 --> 00:20:22.462\nSo, let me select that Windows 10,\nand then I just right-click on it and\n\n402\n00:20:22.462 --> 00:20:23.650\nselect Settings.\n\n403\n00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.890\nAnd in a moment,\nwe should pull up the settings right here.\n\n404\n00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.228\nAnd then, on the controller, right?\n\n405\n00:20:30.228 --> 00:20:34.371\nSo, remember that we, that the way that\nI grew up with these virtual machines\n\n406\n00:20:34.371 --> 00:20:37.990\nenvironment, the only control\nthat we had for hard drives, IDE.\n\n407\n00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.400\nIDE means power the thing down.\n\n408\n00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.860\nMake sure everything's off.\n\n409\n00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.328\nAnd then you can attach something.\n\n410\n00:20:43.328 --> 00:20:48.060\nAnd inside of Hyper-V it used to actually\ngive you both, SCSI as well as IDE.\n\n411\n00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.740\nThe weird thing about SCSI is you don't\nhave to power the machine down anymore.\n\n412\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.460\nSo, this thing is running right now, and\n\n413\n00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.290\nall I have to do at this point\nis select what I want to add in.\n\n414\n00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.922\nSo, I'm just gonna add in a new hard\ndrive, so I'm gonna select Hard Drive,\n\n415\n00:21:02.922 --> 00:21:03.504\nand Add.\n\n416\n00:21:03.504 --> 00:21:07.453\nAnd now, notice this is actually SCSI\ncontroller, and now it says, hey,\n\n417\n00:21:07.453 --> 00:21:08.843\nchoose and use right now?\n\n418\n00:21:08.843 --> 00:21:13.415\nSo, all I actually have to do\nnow is create a new virtual hard\n\n419\n00:21:13.415 --> 00:21:18.085\ndrive let me say new and\nthen I walk through this menu system.\n\n420\n00:21:18.085 --> 00:21:19.518\nMaybe click on it, and so\n\n421\n00:21:19.518 --> 00:21:24.110\nhere is where we choose the same things we\ndid during the install of one of these.\n\n422\n00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:27.267\nPick size dynamically expanding,\nremember the difference between that?\n\n423\n00:21:27.267 --> 00:21:30.112\nThis is actually going to take up\nthat space right then and there.\n\n424\n00:21:30.112 --> 00:21:33.212\nDynamically expanded says I'll\nonly take up the space that I use.\n\n425\n00:21:33.212 --> 00:21:37.464\nSo, I'm just gonna leave it right there\nat the dynamically expanding, and\n\n426\n00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:41.310\nthen the name, and\nwe'll call this one testHD for right now.\n\n427\n00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:45.580\nAnd notice the location there, so\nit said the default location is set up.\n\n428\n00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.010\nClick next here, and then I'm just\ngoing to make a very small drive here.\n\n429\n00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.970\nLet's just say 10 gigs max,\nis what I'm going to do.\n\n430\n00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.780\nAnd I only have a limited amount\nof space on this machine,\n\n431\n00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.570\nthat's why I'm not making\nit gigantic at this point.\n\n432\n00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.389\nSo, just select that.\n\n433\n00:22:00.389 --> 00:22:02.525\nAnd then click Next here.\n\n434\n00:22:02.525 --> 00:22:04.708\nAnd Finish.\n\n435\n00:22:04.708 --> 00:22:09.026\nAnd when I do,\nit attached it without any fuss and note.\n\n436\n00:22:09.026 --> 00:22:13.828\nNow, when I mentioned that actually really\nnice because it means I don't really have\n\n437\n00:22:13.828 --> 00:22:17.040\nto take a virtual machine\noffline to do something.\n\n438\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.990\nFrom that point let me see if I can\nfind the right virtual machine here.\n\n439\n00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.330\nThere it is, the Windows 10 machine.\n\n440\n00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.800\nAnd now I can full screen that.\n\n441\n00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.260\nAnd then it's the same process that we\nwould normally do with everything else.\n\n442\n00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.490\nI would need to go in\nto my Disk Management.\n\n443\n00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.450\nSo, I've added in a second hard drive\nthat's not formatted, not anything else.\n\n444\n00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:40.280\nSo, now it should be recognized\nin Disk Management here.\n\n445\n00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.320\nSo, in a moment, once everything kind\nof loads and does what it needs to,\n\n446\n00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.740\nlet's see, it should be showing up soon.\n\n447\n00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.010\nWhat I need to do is I need to check\nwhy that did not work the way that\n\n448\n00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.050\nI wanted to.\n\n449\n00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.910\nSo, if I just right click\nback on my settings, and so\n\n450\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.560\njust verifying what I might have done and\nwhat I might now have done here, and\n\n451\n00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.140\nif I take a look, I can see it right here.\n\n452\n00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.859\nUnder the SCSI controller,\nI forgot to do something, I was so\n\n453\n00:23:03.859 --> 00:23:05.179\nexcited I just x'd out of it.\n\n454\n00:23:05.179 --> 00:23:06.642\nI forgot to hit apply.\n\n455\n00:23:06.642 --> 00:23:07.478\n>> Jiminy Clickit.\n\n456\n00:23:07.478 --> 00:23:09.277\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that is me.\n\n457\n00:23:09.277 --> 00:23:10.937\nSo, let me select that again.\n\n458\n00:23:10.937 --> 00:23:15.801\nHard Drive > Add and then new.\n\n459\n00:23:15.801 --> 00:23:19.280\nAnd then I walk though this step here.\n\n460\n00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.863\nAnd again we're gonna call it testHD,\nfor hard drive.\n\n461\n00:23:24.863 --> 00:23:25.885\nClick Next.\n\n462\n00:23:25.885 --> 00:23:29.400\nAnd I'm just gonna make it\nthat 10 gigabyte file again or\n\n463\n00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.351\nI might have said 5 before,\nI can't remember.\n\n464\n00:23:32.351 --> 00:23:33.989\nAnd then click Finish.\n\n465\n00:23:33.989 --> 00:23:37.309\nSo, with us being able to do that,\noh it actually says an error now.\n\n466\n00:23:37.309 --> 00:23:39.283\nOh, I know why it's actually an error.\n\n467\n00:23:39.283 --> 00:23:44.193\nBecause it probably tried to see that\nthere's a file hidden there somewhere.\n\n468\n00:23:44.193 --> 00:23:50.126\nLet's see, if it actually blocked when\nI change this to a one or something.\n\n469\n00:23:50.126 --> 00:23:53.399\nMaybe it just doesn't remind me using\na name that it just used again.\n\n470\n00:23:53.399 --> 00:23:55.559\nAnd we'll see right here\nif it does it this time.\n\n471\n00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:56.368\nThere we go.\n\n472\n00:23:56.368 --> 00:23:59.262\nYeah, so by using that name previously.\n\n473\n00:23:59.262 --> 00:24:01.712\nIt's still probably caching\nit somewhere in the machine.\n\n474\n00:24:01.712 --> 00:24:03.871\nSo just by changing the name\nthat's what happened.\n\n475\n00:24:03.871 --> 00:24:07.525\nThis time, the smarter thing,\nI'm going to try to hit apply [LAUGH].\n\n476\n00:24:07.525 --> 00:24:09.823\nThat's me, I am Mr. Jiminy Clickit.\n\n477\n00:24:09.823 --> 00:24:12.889\nAnd I verify that the hard\ndrive did show up this point.\n\n478\n00:24:12.889 --> 00:24:18.206\nAnd now if I go back and\nthen I find my Windows 10 machine.\n\n479\n00:24:18.206 --> 00:24:21.723\nThis time let me right-click and\ngo to Disk Management.\n\n480\n00:24:21.723 --> 00:24:25.044\nSo it was just an error on my part and\nit does happen right.\n\n481\n00:24:25.044 --> 00:24:27.882\nSo always make sure you do apply, and\n\n482\n00:24:27.882 --> 00:24:31.464\nverify that everything\nis coming up here too.\n\n483\n00:24:31.464 --> 00:24:34.951\nSo in just a moment, what should happen\nif I go back through those steps and\n\n484\n00:24:34.951 --> 00:24:38.910\nI click on disk management, that's what\nI'm actually supposed to expect to see.\n\n485\n00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:39.595\nUnlike the.\n\n486\n00:24:39.595 --> 00:24:41.647\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The clear blank face that I had\n\n487\n00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:42.450\nbefore like.\n\n488\n00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.170\nWho am I?\n\n489\n00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.238\nYeah, but.\n\n490\n00:24:44.238 --> 00:24:45.015\n>> It's a lovely hard drive you got there.\n\n491\n00:24:45.015 --> 00:24:46.433\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n492\n00:24:46.433 --> 00:24:48.952\n[LAUGH] One that's really not there,\nand I mean it.\n\n493\n00:24:48.952 --> 00:24:52.279\nSo you can see right here where\nit automatically selects it, and\n\n494\n00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:56.070\nthen I click OK without turning\nthat virtual machine off.\n\n495\n00:24:56.070 --> 00:25:00.650\nNow I have this unknown disk that I can\ngo ahead and format and get ready to use.\n\n496\n00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.550\nThe advantage of this thing right,\nis not that it has to be on this machine.\n\n497\n00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.590\nIf I had a storage area appliance,\n\n498\n00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:10.770\nright a storage area network,\nwe could create hard drives up there.\n\n499\n00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:14.450\nAnd have that second hard drive\nattach up there if we need it to.\n\n500\n00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:18.460\nAnd that's also another advantage too,\nit doesn't matter where it's located.\n\n501\n00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:22.060\nSo, we can continue to expand that drive,\nwherever it actually is.\n\n502\n00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.025\nAnd it makes a world of difference,\nright, if I do need that.\n\n503\n00:25:25.025 --> 00:25:27.455\nSo we're not limited by\njust the drive space here.\n\n504\n00:25:27.455 --> 00:25:30.415\nBut even if we are,\nwe also have another thing that we can do,\n\n505\n00:25:30.415 --> 00:25:33.801\nwhich is to move this machine even\nto another machine if we wanted to.\n\n506\n00:25:33.801 --> 00:25:38.074\n>> That's right, because what's cool about\nthese virtual machines is it kind of\n\n507\n00:25:38.074 --> 00:25:42.810\ncreates these virtual hard drives, and\ntreats them just as any other file really.\n\n508\n00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.930\nIt's just a file, and you're just,\njust like any other file,\n\n509\n00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.200\nI can move it from one\ndirectory to another.\n\n510\n00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.680\nI can even copy it down to another drive,\n\n511\n00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.150\nmoves that over to another computer,\nif I want.\n\n512\n00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.760\nAs long as it's running\nthe Hyper-V software?\n\n513\n00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.885\nWell, guess what?\n\n514\n00:25:56.885 --> 00:26:00.252\nI can import that drive and launch it\nup just like if it was native to that\n\n515\n00:26:00.252 --> 00:26:03.810\nmachine, like I built it there even\nthough I built it on another machine.\n\n516\n00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:08.590\nThat's the advantage of using this type\nof hard drive system with the VMs,\n\n517\n00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.800\nis it just sees it as another file.\n\n518\n00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.320\nGiving us tons of flexibility.\n\n519\n00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.340\nNow Ronnie, we say we can do this.\n\n520\n00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.176\nNow we gotta say how do we do this.\n\n521\n00:26:17.176 --> 00:26:18.270\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n522\n00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:21.920\nSo when we take a look at doing this,\nthe good thing is, this has become easier.\n\n523\n00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.040\nIt used to be a command line way that you\nhad to do this, or you had to kind of hold\n\n524\n00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.560\nyour tongue in this right position and\ncock your head a little bit to this side,\n\n525\n00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.350\njust hopefully that the result\nwould end up happening here.\n\n526\n00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:35.760\nBut, the way that you do this today and\nit's always better to shut something off.\n\n527\n00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.850\nSo, I'm just gonna select this Windows\n10 machine that's already off here.\n\n528\n00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.240\nOver on the right hand side,\n\n529\n00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.110\nverified actually says the machine that\nI want to be off and then, let's see we\n\n530\n00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:49.990\nmay actually have the kind of see this\na little bit more behind my head here.\n\n531\n00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:52.160\nSo let's see we can full screen that.\n\n532\n00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.320\nAnd when we do that, down underneath\nthat is underneath the word Revert,\n\n533\n00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:56.920\nit says Move.\n\n534\n00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.620\nAnd my select move is here\nthat it gives me that ability\n\n535\n00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.580\nto be able to move that\nmachine somewhere else.\n\n536\n00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:09.072\nSo if I now click next,\nsays hey move the virtual machine storage.\n\n537\n00:27:09.072 --> 00:27:11.994\nThat's the hard drive file that\nwe're talking about first.\n\n538\n00:27:11.994 --> 00:27:14.154\nAnd then I click Next again.\n\n539\n00:27:14.154 --> 00:27:16.720\nAnd now I have to actually\nchoose what I'm doing, right?\n\n540\n00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.852\nI can move all the virtual machine's\ndata to a single location,\n\n541\n00:27:19.852 --> 00:27:23.740\nmove the virtual machine's data to\ndifferent locations if I wanted to.\n\n542\n00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.580\nIf I was trying to move it off to another\nmachine that's what we would also end up\n\n543\n00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.740\ndoing a lot of times.\n\n544\n00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.491\nOr only move the hard disk.\n\n545\n00:27:29.491 --> 00:27:31.604\nSo it actually depends\non what you want to do.\n\n546\n00:27:31.604 --> 00:27:34.727\nIf I actually know I am moving it\nsomewhere else completely this machine and\n\n547\n00:27:34.727 --> 00:27:37.652\nI'm not going to manage it from here\nI might select that first option,\n\n548\n00:27:37.652 --> 00:27:39.603\nI''m just going to pick\nthat one by default.\n\n549\n00:27:39.603 --> 00:27:41.460\nJust to help us along.\n\n550\n00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.620\nAnd then I can select my location.\n\n551\n00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.959\nIf I was on a network I could go ahead and\nuse my network path and\n\n552\n00:27:46.959 --> 00:27:50.968\nactually move that to whatever location\nmy other VM's are running for.\n\n553\n00:27:50.968 --> 00:27:55.072\nFrom here, I'm just gonna browse for\na moment, and then I'm just gonna\n\n554\n00:27:55.072 --> 00:27:59.803\nselect another location like the downloads\nhere instead and click select Folder.\n\n555\n00:27:59.803 --> 00:28:01.564\nSo I'm just gonna move it\nto the downloads folder.\n\n556\n00:28:01.564 --> 00:28:05.291\nIts current size is about 9.41 gigs.\n\n557\n00:28:05.291 --> 00:28:07.280\nClick Next, and there it goes.\n\n558\n00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.420\nIt actually is gonna say, hey,\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n559\n00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.077\nYou wanna move everything over there?\n\n560\n00:28:11.077 --> 00:28:15.337\nSure thing, I go ahead and click Finish,\nand now it's gonna take the sweet time\n\n561\n00:28:15.337 --> 00:28:18.532\nit's gonna take to perform that\nmove over to that machine.\n\n562\n00:28:18.532 --> 00:28:20.456\nAnd as long as your machine, or\n\n563\n00:28:20.456 --> 00:28:23.712\nyour Hyper-V console manager\ncan find that again,\n\n564\n00:28:23.712 --> 00:28:29.230\nit should now be ready to go and ready to\noperate and do everything that we need to.\n\n565\n00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:33.190\nSo it really is very nice,\nbecause if not, you do have to go in and\n\n566\n00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:34.800\nfind all those little pieces.\n\n567\n00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.230\nLook, let's just make a wizard,\nwe'll make it easier for\n\n568\n00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.230\nmost people that are using client Hyper-V.\n\n569\n00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:40.305\nThe reason that they do that, right?\n\n570\n00:28:40.305 --> 00:28:42.850\nCuz you're probably saying,\nwhy would I ever do that?\n\n571\n00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.900\nWell, what if you are making a test server\nand now that test server, you're saying,\n\n572\n00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.460\nlook, this is what we really want to use.\n\n573\n00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.460\nWell, you have two choices right?\n\n574\n00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:55.430\nYou can say, now I can go to my actual\nHyper-V server on my network and\n\n575\n00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.290\nrebuild the whole thing again.\n\n576\n00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:59.560\nPut all the configurations in,\ndo everything.\n\n577\n00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.660\nBut if your machine's already operating,\n\n578\n00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:07.070\nwhy not simply move this machine over\nto the production network instead.\n\n579\n00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.359\nVerify it's working.\n\n580\n00:29:08.359 --> 00:29:11.609\nThat's also why we might\nuse client Hyper-V as well.\n\n581\n00:29:11.609 --> 00:29:15.750\nTo get things ready without really\nimpacting our server's performance even on\n\n582\n00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.520\nthe network at this point.\n\n583\n00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.023\nSo it's a good test machine.\n\n584\n00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:22.030\nIt can help you in preparation for\nproduction machines as well.\n\n585\n00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.160\n>> It sure can.\n\n586\n00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.457\nNow Hyper-V we've obviously talked\na lot about Hyper-V but guess what?\n\n587\n00:29:26.457 --> 00:29:29.685\nWe finally have come to the end\nof what Hyper-V can do, or\n\n588\n00:29:29.685 --> 00:29:33.470\nat least what you need to know for\nthe exam to understand Hyper-V.\n\n589\n00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:35.698\nRonnie, anything else\nthat we need to go over?\n\n590\n00:29:35.698 --> 00:29:38.024\nI'm looking at the notes,\nI think we've covered it all, but\n\n591\n00:29:38.024 --> 00:29:40.679\nis there any tidbits of wisdom you\nwanna leave these good people with?\n\n592\n00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:42.959\n>> Try it, is pretty much the key here.\n\n593\n00:29:42.959 --> 00:29:45.535\nThere is no harm in you\nbuilding virtual machines, and\n\n594\n00:29:45.535 --> 00:29:47.220\nthe nice thing about them, right.\n\n595\n00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.901\nIs if you use them and you tear them up.\n\n596\n00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:50.598\nIt's simple.\n\n597\n00:29:50.598 --> 00:29:54.585\nDelete the file, try it again, you don't\nhave to worry about a lot of extra\n\n598\n00:29:54.585 --> 00:29:57.900\nhardware being taken up,\njust make sure you keep an eye on it.\n\n599\n00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.640\nSo follow good sets, right?\n\n600\n00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.829\nDon't put so many virtual machines on your\nmachine at one time, if you only have like\n\n601\n00:30:04.829 --> 00:30:07.846\nlet say four or eight gigs of RAM and\ntry and start them all up.\n\n602\n00:30:07.846 --> 00:30:10.563\nThe good thing is it will tell you,\nyou don't have enough resources to do so.\n\n603\n00:30:10.563 --> 00:30:15.369\nBut at the same time try, to remember\nthat you can overload that one machine.\n\n604\n00:30:15.369 --> 00:30:18.171\nAnd even though we don't tend\nto use it up a lot of the times,\n\n605\n00:30:18.171 --> 00:30:21.661\nthose virtual machines, they will\neat up your processors after awhile.\n\n606\n00:30:21.661 --> 00:30:24.796\nSo make sure you also keep an eye\non the performance of your machine,\n\n607\n00:30:24.796 --> 00:30:25.898\nyou'll be ready to go.\n\n608\n00:30:25.898 --> 00:30:26.665\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n609\n00:30:26.665 --> 00:30:29.265\nAll right everyone that comes to\nthe end of another great episode.\n\n610\n00:30:29.265 --> 00:30:30.379\nHopefully you've enjoyed it.\n\n611\n00:30:30.379 --> 00:30:32.644\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n612\n00:30:32.644 --> 00:30:33.978\nI've been your host, Daniel

to\nanother great episode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.180\nI'm your host Daniel Lawrie, here with me\ntoday, none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.970\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.180\n>> It is going well today.\n\n7\n00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.840\nAs we continue on taking a look at\nconfiguring Windows 10 devices,\n\n8\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.590\nwe want to make sure that we understand\nthat there are actually a lot of different\n\n9\n00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.790\ndevices that are out there that\nWindows 10 are designed to work with.\n\n10\n00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.220\nNot only things like laptops, but\n\n11\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.840\nof course there are tablets that are out\nthere, and then the, hopefully in\n\n12\n00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.390\nthe future the upcoming Windows phones\nthat should also support Windows 10.\n\n13\n00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.610\nBut there’s a lot of these devices and\nbecause of that,\n\n14\n00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.330\nit also means that we have to be\nused to configuring some of the of\n\n15\n00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.795\nthe mobility options that we tend to find\nbeing able to work inside of Windows 10.\n\n16\n00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:56.005\nNow for us to do that, of course it means\na combination of several things and\n\n17\n00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.255\ngetting access into the operating system,\nand\n\n18\n00:00:58.255 --> 00:01:01.505\nunderstanding what we find there is\nactually going to be very important,\n\n19\n00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:05.295\nbecause the goal is fairly simple for\nwhat Windows really wants you to do.\n\n20\n00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:08.565\nThey want you to be united behind\na single operating system,\n\n21\n00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:10.215\nregardless of the device that you're on.\n\n22\n00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:13.710\nAnd so if Windows 10 is going to be that,\nyou also have to be able to work\n\n23\n00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.910\nwith some of the ways that we\nused to deal with desktop files,\n\n24\n00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.090\nas well as some of the other options\nthat you have available to you.\n\n25\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.860\nYou might even find out that you're trying\nto run on Windows 10, but you might end up\n\n26\n00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.540\nat a company or someplace else in which\nyou don't have access to Windows 10.\n\n27\n00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.220\nIs there a way that you can\nstill take Windows 10 with you?\n\n28\n00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.310\nYes there is, and\n\n29\n00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.610\nwe'll also show you the idea that\nwe'll call Windows to Go as well.\n\n30\n00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.130\nAnd then we also want to be able to\nconfigure some security settings\n\n31\n00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.070\non our mobile devices As well, and\n\n32\n00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.660\nwe are specifically referring\nto BitLocker at this point.\n\n33\n00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.270\nThere's a lot for us to cover when we take\na look at the different mobility options\n\n34\n00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.580\nthat we have available to us.\n\n35\n00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.900\nWhen it comes down to dealing with files,\none of the hardest things that we\n\n36\n00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.350\nhave to kind of deal with is the very fact\nthat most of us inside of an enterprise.\n\n37\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.560\nWhat's going to happen is we are privately\naccessing some type of network file share,\n\n38\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.530\nand when that ends up happening,\na lot of times what we end up with,\n\n39\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.380\nof course, is that we connect\nto a map network drive, or\n\n40\n00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.330\nwe just go ahead and\nwe do our regular type of\n\n41\n00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.980\nconnection where it's just a temporary\nconnection by using our backslash,\n\n42\n00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.070\nbackslash, the name of the server, and\nthen the name of that shared folder.\n\n43\n00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.140\nAnd we gain access to it, or we might map\nit to our computers as a drive letter, and\n\n44\n00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.870\nthat's perfectly fine\nthat we do something.\n\n45\n00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.870\nBut the problem happens to be,\nespecially if you are on a laptop,\n\n46\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.610\nright, is when you take that laptop home,\nand all of a sudden,\n\n47\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.860\nyou don't have access to those network\nfiles anymore, and so now you're kind of\n\n48\n00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.365\nstuck, even though you were actually\nable to get access to them at one point.\n\n49\n00:02:40.365 --> 00:02:43.335\nNow you're at home, or you're\nactually away on a business trip, and\n\n50\n00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:46.225\nthose files just don't seem\nto be available to you.\n\n51\n00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:48.565\nWell, when something like that happens,\nwhat can you do?\n\n52\n00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:53.083\nWell in today's world, there's really\na lot that you can do because of\n\n53\n00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:57.980\nthe overwhelming popularity and the\nubiquity of things like VPN access, and\n\n54\n00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.724\nbecause we're really no longer having\nto depend on dial up connections and\n\n55\n00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.860\nthe cost of dial up connections.\n\n56\n00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.454\nCreating a VPN connection back to our\nservers when we need to is probably\n\n57\n00:03:09.454 --> 00:03:10.457\nnot a bad idea.\n\n58\n00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:14.516\nIt's probably something that we can\nactually do and all that can be configured\n\n59\n00:03:14.516 --> 00:03:18.880\nin the background, but there's other\ntimes that you may not have any access.\n\n60\n00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.950\nWhat if you don't have access\nto a network connection or\n\n61\n00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.650\nwhat if you're actually out there and\nthere is no internet connection at all?\n\n62\n00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.270\nBut what can you do instead?\n\n63\n00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.130\nMicrosoft still likes the idea\nof what we call off-line files.\n\n64\n00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.320\nSo when we talk about actually\nusing off-line files,\n\n65\n00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.370\nwhat we're actually saying is that\nwe're going to kind of lie to you.\n\n66\n00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.540\nThat's the easiest way I\nknow how to think about it.\n\n67\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.960\nIs that it's really lying to you.\n\n68\n00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.454\nYou're going to make the same network\nconnection as you would if you were logged\n\n69\n00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:49.054\ninto a computer, and once you do something\nlike that, what can also happen is once\n\n70\n00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:52.287\nyou've got them configured the way\nthat you want to, well even if you're\n\n71\n00:03:52.287 --> 00:03:56.200\ndisconnected from the network,\nit still looks like you're connected here.\n\n72\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.400\nSo let me go ahead and do that here.\n\n73\n00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.390\nI just kind of realized something,\nI had launched up my wrong machine here.\n\n74\n00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.670\nLet me change that configuration for\njust a moment as we get started.\n\n75\n00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.450\nAnd we'll show you kind of the basic\nconfigurations that we need to go through\n\n76\n00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.700\nto make sure that everything is actually\ngoing to work out the way we want.\n\n77\n00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.060\nIf I can actually get my virtual\nmachine running the way that I need to.\n\n78\n00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.180\nLet me launch up the bird one here.\n\n79\n00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.980\nThis is the one that's actually\nconnected to the network.\n\n80\n00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.220\nAnd then we'll bring that one up and\nwe'll be ready to go here.\n\n81\n00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.820\nSo what we're going to do is we're going\nto show you how we would normally connect\n\n82\n00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.590\nto a network file share, and then we're\ngoing to show you how to take it offline,\n\n83\n00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.540\nand that way you can actually see where\nthose files are going to be available, and\n\n84\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.160\nthat way,\n\n85\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.960\nregardless of whatever connection you're\none, that's what's going to happen.\n\n86\n00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.260\nNow, you might be wondering like,\nwhy do we need to do something like that?.\n\n87\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.110\nWell, couple of ways we can handle it,\nright?\n\n88\n00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.660\nDaniel, would you recommend\nsomebody working in your network?\n\n89\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.810\nRight, you have the copy of whatever your\nfiles are and what they do is say, look,\n\n90\n00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.050\nI need to take this with me.\n\n91\n00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.810\nThey could copy it down to their desktop,\nright?\n\n92\n00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.920\nThey could just copy it down,\nthey're fine, they're ready to go.\n\n93\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.300\nBut then when the come back,\nall of a sudden they go,\n\n94\n00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.910\nwait a minute, that document\nthat was up on the file share\n\n95\n00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.960\nis no longer the same as\nthe document I've been working with,\n\n96\n00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.370\nand now they've copied it up there and\nall of a sudden they override changes, and\n\n97\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.110\nDaniel, in a situation like that,\nthat could be critical, right?\n\n98\n00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.770\n>> Yeah, that could be disastrous,\n\n99\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.710\nbecause if you have more than\none person working on that file.\n\n100\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.848\nWell, Ronnie copies that\nfile down to his computer,\n\n101\n00:05:24.848 --> 00:05:27.020\nI copy that file down to my computer.\n\n102\n00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.223\nWe go our separate ways, we both make\nchanges, I come to into work before Ronnie\n\n103\n00:05:31.223 --> 00:05:34.000\ndoes, I go man I'm going\nto upload my changes here.\n\n104\n00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.952\nAnd I put that in and\nI replace that file that we both copied,\n\n105\n00:05:36.952 --> 00:05:38.380\nwell it's good to go right?\n\n106\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.680\nAll my changes are there,\neverything should be fine.\n\n107\n00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.940\nThen Ronnie comes into work,\nhe uploads his file, what does it do?\n\n108\n00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.340\nIt overwrites my file.\n\n109\n00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.210\nAll the changes that I\nhave made are now gone and\n\n110\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.920\nonly the changes that\nRonnie has made remain.\n\n111\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.760\nAnd that's not a good thing,\nright, it's not what we want.\n\n112\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.190\nWe're kind of being\ncounterproductive at that point.\n\n113\n00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.860\nWe're both making changes to\nthe same file in an offline status,\n\n114\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.180\nthen there comes the problem right?\n\n115\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.690\nWe can't get those files to synchronize.\n\n116\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.510\nThis is where this offline\nfile idea comes in handy\n\n117\n00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.330\nthat's built in to the actual\noperating system that Microsoft has so\n\n118\n00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.840\ngraciously given us to,\nto deal with here in, in our show.\n\n119\n00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.490\nIt is a wonderful thing,\nI've got to be honest with you,\n\n120\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.950\nit is definitely one\nof their better ideas.\n\n121\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.730\nTo be able for us both to work on the same\nfile offline, different computers, not\n\n122\n00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.720\nconnected to the network, and then come\ntogether and those files synchronized.\n\n123\n00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.300\nAll his changes get applied,\nall my changes get applied and\n\n124\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.470\nnothing gets overwritten.\n\n125\n00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.680\nThis is awesome.\n\n126\n00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.470\n>> There definitely is and there\nsometimes what ends up happening though.\n\n127\n00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.890\nIs that if those changes are too\ndifferent, right, instead of actually\n\n128\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.820\ntrying to say which change applies last,\nbecause that's the one that actually\n\n129\n00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.020\nkills you, is saying well, why don't you\njust go ahead and keep both copies, and\n\n130\n00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.150\nin a real productive environment,\nthat's exactly what you would want to do.\n\n131\n00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.650\nUntil you can actually merge\nthose changes together.\n\n132\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.490\nThere are ways, there are different types\nof policies out there that will allow you\n\n133\n00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.560\nto only merge the changes into\nwhatever that base file is, but\n\n134\n00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.680\nthat's a little bit beyond what\nwe're talking about right here.\n\n135\n00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.295\nBut at least for the offline files,\n\n136\n00:07:10.295 --> 00:07:13.975\nwhat we can do now is actually set up our\ncomputer just like we are at work, and\n\n137\n00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:18.095\nthe nice thing is to whatever individual\nis taking that laptop out on the road,\n\n138\n00:07:18.095 --> 00:07:20.385\nit really doesn't actually\nact any differently.\n\n139\n00:07:20.385 --> 00:07:23.045\nThey're not going to move\nthe location of anything,\n\n140\n00:07:23.045 --> 00:07:25.455\nit actually looks like they're connected\nin network even though they're not.\n\n141\n00:07:25.455 --> 00:07:27.935\nNow the way that works\nis that they hide it.\n\n142\n00:07:27.935 --> 00:07:30.790\nSo they actually take inside of\nthe Windows folder somewhere,\n\n143\n00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.650\nthey make a special cache copy, and\nthat redirects it to right there so\n\n144\n00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.130\nwhen you're actually not connected, it\ndoesn't connect up to the network share.\n\n145\n00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.348\nIt connects you to that hidden location,\nand that way all the time when you're\n\n146\n00:07:42.348 --> 00:07:45.178\nactually working with that individual\nfile and you are changing it,\n\n147\n00:07:45.178 --> 00:07:48.583\nit's perfectly fine you can do that, but\nyou're not really writing it up there.\n\n148\n00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:52.347\nAnd so what ends up happening then is\nnext time you come in from the field,\n\n149\n00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:56.666\nyou plugged your laptop into the network,\nthen it begins to try to communicate with\n\n150\n00:07:56.666 --> 00:08:00.763\nthe original file, and then that's\nwhen synchronization begins to happen.\n\n151\n00:08:00.763 --> 00:08:05.045\nAnd it really is up to whoever\nthe administrator is How those changes\n\n152\n00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:07.161\nare going to be managed and kept.\n\n153\n00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:11.510\nWhether, when you come back in, if there's\na disparity, or whether actually both\n\n154\n00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.306\ncopies are going to be saved until they\nfigure out how that merge is going to\n\n155\n00:08:15.306 --> 00:08:19.350\nend up happening, all that is really\nup to the network administrator.\n\n156\n00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.098\nBut at the beginning here, let me show\nyou what the result should normally be.\n\n157\n00:08:23.098 --> 00:08:27.060\nSo here it is, I got my Windows machine\nthat is now joined to the domain.\n\n158\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.550\nAnd so, if I take a look then,\nat what I'm connected to.\n\n159\n00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.960\nI just went ahead and launched up\nthe Windows, or the File Explorer here.\n\n160\n00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.970\nAnd in the File Explorer, if I select this\nPC, I can see I already have a shared\n\n161\n00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.110\nfolder, but that's not the shared\nfolder I need to connect to.\n\n162\n00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.640\nSo in this particular machine,\nI'm going to right click,\n\n163\n00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.410\nI'm going to map a new network drive.\n\n164\n00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.730\nAnd now when I do this I'm going to\nmap it to, let's say the x drive here.\n\n165\n00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.140\nIt's just cause I like the letter x.\n\n166\n00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.150\nDc01.\n\n167\n00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.470\nAnd then I have a shared folder\nthat's actually the data folder,\n\n168\n00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.280\nis what I want to do.\n\n169\n00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.240\nSo I'm gonna click finish,\nand there it is.\n\n170\n00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.080\nNotice that I am now a mapped, and\n\n171\n00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.760\nI already have some different\ndocuments up there for IT Pro TV.\n\n172\n00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.710\nSo we have our ITproTV company\nvalues that we have up there, and so\n\n173\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.670\nwe also have our employee directory,\nthat we have up there and\n\n174\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.510\navailable to us, on boarding and\nsafety handbook, you name it.\n\n175\n00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.260\nThese are just documents\nthat we created to try and\n\n176\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:26.780\nrepresent some of the files that you may\nbe accessing online, over that file share.\n\n177\n00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.450\nSo now when we are using it, and\neverything is actually fine and dandy,\n\n178\n00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:36.000\nwhat normally happens at this point\nis if I disconnect from the network,\n\n179\n00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.110\nso I'm going to simulate, let's say\ntaking my computer off the network here.\n\n180\n00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.210\nLet's see if I can do that very quickly.\n\n181\n00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.550\nSo I'm just disconnecting\nthe network adapter.\n\n182\n00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.050\nYou should see, in the lower right hand\ncorner over here, where your notification\n\n183\n00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.010\narea is gonna be, is gonna tell you\nyou're disconnected from the network.\n\n184\n00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.820\nAnd then, if I try and\naccess to that file share, so here it is,\n\n185\n00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.350\nI'm out on the road,\nI'm now trying to access that file share.\n\n186\n00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:59.220\nI go to this PC.\n\n187\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.440\nAnd there it is, oh it looks like\nI'm gonna be able to access it, and\n\n188\n00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.370\nso when I click on it, and\nit's just sitting there.\n\n189\n00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.630\nIt's just sitting there.\n\n190\n00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.582\nWell it should, because I'm not really\nconnected to that file share anymore, and\n\n191\n00:10:10.582 --> 00:10:13.600\neven though the icon is there,\nit's trying to look for it.\n\n192\n00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.050\nSo now it's looking across\nthe entire internet,\n\n193\n00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.660\nand it tells me an error has occurred.\n\n194\n00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.510\nIt says the connection\nhas not been restored.\n\n195\n00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:26.950\nSo only if I am connected To that file\nshare, am I now able to actually use it.\n\n196\n00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.930\nSo that's actually kind of\na hindrance at that point, right,\n\n197\n00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:34.740\nbecause the only remedy to this, right,\nis what we talked about at the beginning.\n\n198\n00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.860\nI just simply bypass Daniel's directive\nof don't copy these files locally and\n\n199\n00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.140\nmake changes to them,\nbecause I don't want you doing that.\n\n200\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.020\nI want you working off the file share.\n\n201\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.830\nWell if that happens, now I copied them\nlocally and then when I connect back in at\n\n202\n00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.470\nsome point later on, if I am the last\nperson to drag my files back up there,\n\n203\n00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.420\nthey could actually overwrite everything\nelse that's been in that folder.\n\n204\n00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.534\nAnd that would be bad.\n\n205\n00:10:56.534 --> 00:11:00.213\nSo instead, what we can do is,\nonce we connect back in.\n\n206\n00:11:00.213 --> 00:11:02.570\nLet me go ahead and\nplug the cable back in here.\n\n207\n00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.370\nAnd I will connect my network adapter.\n\n208\n00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.010\nAnd verify, and there it is.\n\n209\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.790\nLooks like I do have\na network connection again.\n\n210\n00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.380\nAnd let's verify,\nsee if I can connect back to that folder.\n\n211\n00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.610\nAnd so now, if I'm good,\nnotice I'm connected back in.\n\n212\n00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.880\nWorks great.\n\n213\n00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.265\nExactly like it should.\n\n214\n00:11:21.265 --> 00:11:22.350\nOkay?\n\n215\n00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.450\nNow, when we talk about then\ncreating offline files.\n\n216\n00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.520\nLet me just back out\ninstead of closing down.\n\n217\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.840\nI like closing everything down and\nopening back up.\n\n218\n00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.820\nI don't know why, it's just who I am.\n\n219\n00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.300\nBut it's fairly easy.\n\n220\n00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.860\nSo, once the file share is established,\nand they have group policy set up,\n\n221\n00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.390\nusually you don't really have to\ndo very much on your end at all.\n\n222\n00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.820\nThe only thing that you really have to do,\nor an administrator can do this from you\n\n223\n00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.780\nand usually from policy is what they'll do\nit from, and we'll show you where those\n\n224\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.360\npolicies are, but if you are in a hurry,\nlet's say that Daniel said Ronnie here's\n\n225\n00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.640\nyour laptop, you're leaving this afternoon\nand you've got to get this stuff set up.\n\n226\n00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.070\nThe only thing I have to do now,\nif I needed access to that share,\n\n227\n00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:05.860\nis that I right click on Data, and\nthen I select this option here.\n\n228\n00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.130\nAnd I know it's difficult to see, but\nit says Always Available Offline.\n\n229\n00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.400\nThat is the key phrase right there.\n\n230\n00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.600\nAnd once I've checked that, notice it\nsays it's starting to do this, and so\n\n231\n00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.830\nit says completing or completed, so\n\n232\n00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.300\nnow it's preparing it and\nit's doing everything else.\n\n233\n00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.280\nWell what's happening is that now it's\nactually creating that cache copy that we\n\n234\n00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.820\nwere talking about, the location on\nthe hard drive that's hidden away,\n\n235\n00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.750\nso that Ronnie doesn't get too curious and\ngo and try to find it and\n\n236\n00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.275\nmanipulate the files in there.\n\n237\n00:12:32.275 --> 00:12:35.000\nIt's hiding away to some\nplace where I can't see.\n\n238\n00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.840\nSo now we actually have\na copy of that on my laptop.\n\n239\n00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.760\nAnd if we take a look at the notification\narea again in the lower right hand corner,\n\n240\n00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.150\nit actually started a synchronization.\n\n241\n00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.470\nSo right behind where my figure,\nwhere I'm actually appearing to you,\n\n242\n00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:53.270\nyou actually see a little green icon\nright there and it says sync center.\n\n243\n00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.280\nAnd it's actually the synchronization\nthat's happening in the background.\n\n244\n00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.490\nAnd so, right then,\n\n245\n00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.780\nas long as we are connected here,\nwe'll actually have that action going on.\n\n246\n00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:06.230\nSo now with these files available,\nas long as I'm working on the network,\n\n247\n00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.880\nI can access all these files and\nwe are ready to go.\n\n248\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.260\nSo now Daniel sent me out\ninto the sales field.\n\n249\n00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.020\nAnd there it is.\n\n250\n00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.690\nI am now disconnected from the network.\n\n251\n00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.250\nSo then I travel, and\nwhat ends up happening Daniel,\n\n252\n00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.340\nis I get to the hotel room and\nI now have emails.\n\n253\n00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.350\nAnd I'll get my email and\nit says, you need to go ahead and\n\n254\n00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.700\nstart updating all the stuff that\nyou actually learned about today.\n\n255\n00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.560\nSo then I have my laptop up and\nready to go.\n\n256\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.460\nAnd now I can open up my File Explorer,\nand I can go to this PC.\n\n257\n00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.880\nAnd now the Data folder right here,\nif I select it.\n\n258\n00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.390\nAnd hopefully in just a moment, unless\nI didn't give it enough time to sync\n\n259\n00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.810\nup here, we should see that we\ncan access all of those files.\n\n260\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.970\nIf I didn't give it enough time to\nsync up, it may fail, but if I did,\n\n261\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.530\neverything should be fine.\n\n262\n00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:56.600\nNow this can also fail if I didn't do\none other thing which I actually did.\n\n263\n00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.569\nSometimes the way that it's set up is\nthat you have to open the file first, so\n\n264\n00:14:00.569 --> 00:14:02.129\nthat's what I was afraid of.\n\n265\n00:14:02.129 --> 00:14:05.733\nSo in other words, even though you see the\nfiles, and if you didn't open it up one\n\n266\n00:14:05.733 --> 00:14:09.496\ntime, then it says, yeah you didn't open\nup, you have a copy, but I'm not going to\n\n267\n00:14:09.496 --> 00:14:13.018\nlet you get access to it because, you\ndidn't really cache over at that point.\n\n268\n00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:15.254\nSo you might see where some of\nthis stuff gets grayed out,\n\n269\n00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:17.676\nyou might see where it says,\nyeah, there are files here, but\n\n270\n00:14:17.676 --> 00:14:19.950\nyou're not gonna be able\nto get access to it.\n\n271\n00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.890\nIf that doesn't happen, that's probably\nbecause of a setting that says, yeah,\n\n272\n00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.130\nit has to actually be opened,\nbefore it's actually shared out and\n\n273\n00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.330\nit can be available to offline files.\n\n274\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.700\nSo now,\nI am still not connected to the network.\n\n275\n00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.210\nI can see that in the lower\nright hand corner of the screen,\n\n276\n00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.860\nthat I'm not connected and\nnow on this file, though.\n\n277\n00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.330\nSo before I couldn't even see this,\nI couldn't access it, but\n\n278\n00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.280\nnow I can go to this employee\ndirectory here, and there it is.\n\n279\n00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.750\nSo let's say that I wanted to change my\nemployee directory to my proper name,\n\n280\n00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.770\nRonald Wong, instead.\n\n281\n00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.280\nAnd then I save it.\n\n282\n00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.670\nAnd notice it didn't balk at me.\n\n283\n00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:57.110\nTo a user, right, that's out in the field,\nit really looks like that they're what?\n\n284\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.200\nThat they're still connected network, and\n\n285\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.285\nif you don't tell them, if I'm\nsetting this up as an administrator.\n\n286\n00:15:02.285 --> 00:15:05.825\nI don't even tell them this, they probably\nwon't ever know the difference, okay?\n\n287\n00:15:05.825 --> 00:15:09.075\nThe time that they'll know the difference\nis when they connect back to the network,\n\n288\n00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.995\nand all of a sudden they start seeing\nlittle icons start turning that\n\n289\n00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:15.110\nsays syncing files up, and then\nthey'll actually notice at that point.\n\n290\n00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.660\nBut overall this is something\nfairly easy for us to do.\n\n291\n00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.450\nNow, a lot of times there's other things\nthat are also going on in the background.\n\n292\n00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:27.030\nAnd this again is probably gonna be set\nup more from your administrator instead.\n\n293\n00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:32.370\nWhere you see certain unusual things\nthat I don't think about too often.\n\n294\n00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.815\nWhen it says restore previous versions to.\n\n295\n00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.557\nSo, this is actually one of those\nfeatures that we had available to us for\n\n296\n00:15:39.557 --> 00:15:41.782\na long time,\nif we were using system restore.\n\n297\n00:15:41.782 --> 00:15:44.047\nIf we had system restore turned on,\n\n298\n00:15:44.047 --> 00:15:47.898\nwhat it did is it actually made\na shadow copy of your files, so\n\n299\n00:15:47.898 --> 00:15:52.979\nif you made changes, it actually still\nkept a copy of the original file for you.\n\n300\n00:15:52.979 --> 00:15:57.572\nAnd then when your computer did a system\ncheckpoint, it would save that checkpoint.\n\n301\n00:15:57.572 --> 00:16:03.200\nAnd what would end up happening if I\ngo to properties, and then offline.\n\n302\n00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.550\nOh no, excuse me, previous versions.\n\n303\n00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:09.090\nIt would show up here in\nthis setting right here.\n\n304\n00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.060\nNow you'll actually notice\nthat this one says hey,\n\n305\n00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.470\nthere's no previous file\nversions available.\n\n306\n00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:18.160\nAnd up here on the top it says previous\nversions come from file history, or\n\n307\n00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.880\nfrom restore points.\n\n308\n00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.180\nNow you're probably wondering,\nWhat's the difference between them?\n\n309\n00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.520\nWell in, I think I'm right here,\n\n310\n00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:31.140\nin Windows 7 and earlier, all this was\ndone under the restore points, okay.\n\n311\n00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.870\nSo if you were using system restore, and\n\n312\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.360\nyou probably were,\nyou probably had this turned on.\n\n313\n00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.890\nAnd if you actually did do a modification\nlike I just did, it would save it and\n\n314\n00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.730\nit'd be no big deal.\n\n315\n00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.960\nBut beginning with Windows 8 I think, yeah\nbeginning with Windows 8 and of course,\n\n316\n00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.220\nnow in Windows 10.\n\n317\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.830\nThey instead use something called File\nhistory and you have to turn that on.\n\n318\n00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:55.930\nAnd you also have to set up a secondary\nlocation to keep a copy of those files.\n\n319\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.341\nSo this one's a little bit more and\n\n320\n00:16:57.341 --> 00:16:59.539\nmore than likely we're not\ngonna make the decision.\n\n321\n00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:01.460\nIn other words,\nour network administrator or\n\n322\n00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.778\nthe Windows 10 administrator is\nprobably gonna be the one that says.\n\n323\n00:17:04.778 --> 00:17:05.800\nYes, we wanna do that and\n\n324\n00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.810\nthen you'll actually have to save\nthat copy offline somewhere.\n\n325\n00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.210\nSo if you don't see that turned on,\nthat's another thing.\n\n326\n00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.700\nBut usually those two go hand and\n\n327\n00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.660\nhand with the offline files, and\nyou can imagine the reason why.\n\n328\n00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.110\nIt's just like the scenario that we\nput out before then earlier, Daniel.\n\n329\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.760\nIs that, look, I could overwrite something\nthat Daniel didn't want me to, and\n\n330\n00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.570\nthen Daniel says,\nRon you gotta go back and change that.\n\n331\n00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:30.520\nAnd I'm like, that was three weeks ago,\nI have no clue what happens.\n\n332\n00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.720\nBut if we have this thing turned\non right here, that offline files,\n\n333\n00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.590\nthe good thing is Daniel.\n\n334\n00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.800\nI can simply right-click and\n\n335\n00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.500\nselect Restore that previous version,\nready to go.\n\n336\n00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.350\n>> Oh man, that's a life saver.\n\n337\n00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:47.765\nI've had people call my office and say,\nI have done something very, very wrong.\n\n338\n00:17:47.765 --> 00:17:49.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'm like, okay, well,\n\n339\n00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.120\nlet's settle down,\nwhat is it that you've done?\n\n340\n00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.240\nI've accidentally deleted this file,\nit has the spreadsheet for\n\n341\n00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.130\naccounting, all the accounting\nfiles that are inside of it.\n\n342\n00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.190\nI'm like, okay, yeah, that's bad,\nyou shouldn't have done that.\n\n343\n00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:00.890\nBut don't fret,\n\n344\n00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.540\nwe probably have a previous version\nof that file roaming around.\n\n345\n00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.360\nLet's go ahead and see what we\ngot from today or yesterday, and\n\n346\n00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.170\njust restore it back out of there.\n\n347\n00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.905\nAnd then you just see the heavens\nopen up and angels descend.\n\n348\n00:18:11.905 --> 00:18:13.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Holding one long note and\n\n349\n00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.190\nthey're happy, and they think you're\nthe greatest thing since sliced bread.\n\n350\n00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:19.690\nSo, understanding how to do this will\ndefinitely make you look like a hero\n\n351\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:20.750\nin somebody's eyes.\n\n352\n00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.780\n>> Sure will.\n\n353\n00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.100\nSo, one last thing I want to talk about,\nand\n\n354\n00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.950\nthen we'll talk about some of\nthe different settings right here too.\n\n355\n00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:29.600\nIs that on this particular file,\nthe one that I made changes to.\n\n356\n00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.090\nIt lets you know right, so\nif I right-clicked on it and\n\n357\n00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.950\nwent to the Properties.\n\n358\n00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.490\nI want it also to\nthe Offline Files tab and\n\n359\n00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.720\nnotice it tells me that changes were made.\n\n360\n00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.860\nThis file is offline\nwith unsynched changes.\n\n361\n00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.320\nSo I know that somewhere along the line,\nI have made changes to this file.\n\n362\n00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.040\nAnd of course,\n\n363\n00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.520\nyou have the date modified if you go to\nthe Detail view to be able to see this.\n\n364\n00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.850\nA lot of times if you're unsure,\nthat's where you can also tell that.\n\n365\n00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.160\nSo now, let's go ahead and do this.\n\n366\n00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:59.140\nLet's say that I came back in after\nmy six week stint out in the field\n\n367\n00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.580\nof doing all the things that I needed\nto do for Daniel and our company.\n\n368\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.220\nAnd once everything is\nactually back online, and\n\n369\n00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.270\nI am now connected back into\nmy network with my laptop.\n\n370\n00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.610\nIt's at this point that I have\na couple of options that we can do,\n\n371\n00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:18.505\nI can go back into the File Explorer,\nand then I select this PC.\n\n372\n00:19:18.505 --> 00:19:21.715\nNotice right now,\nI actually do have a little icon.\n\n373\n00:19:21.715 --> 00:19:25.980\nIt's a little green badge, I don't know\nhow to describe it, round green circle.\n\n374\n00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.626\nThat has two yellow arrows that\nare pointing towards each other,\n\n375\n00:19:29.626 --> 00:19:33.610\nsaying that these things are actually\ngoing to be synching up.\n\n376\n00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.210\nNow, this synchronization\ncan happen at any time.\n\n377\n00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.770\nIt can be done in the background or\n\n378\n00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:42.080\nwe can control when it\nactually does happen for us.\n\n379\n00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.720\nSo I can also right-click on it and\ntell it to sync up.\n\n380\n00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:51.160\nSo at this point in my right-click, I can\ngo to about the middle of this Shortcut\n\n381\n00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.870\nmenu, select Sync and\nthen Sync selected offline files.\n\n382\n00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.970\nNow, if I go ahead and do that,\nwhat should begin to happen of course,\n\n383\n00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.650\nis the synchronization of those files.\n\n384\n00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.990\nAnd that should now actually go ahead and\nsync up.\n\n385\n00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.420\nIf that doesn't happen,\nthen I can actually go to other places.\n\n386\n00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.350\nBut it tells me inside of the Notification\narea that the synchronization\n\n387\n00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.750\nhas been completed.\n\n388\n00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:14.120\nSo I'm perfectly fine with that to go on,\nso that's what happens.\n\n389\n00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.410\nNow remember that there is a little bit\nmore management that goes on when Daniel\n\n390\n00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:21.790\nsends out 50 people that are accessing\nthose same files at the same time.\n\n391\n00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.040\nAnd that's why it's very important\nthat this stuff is managed well.\n\n392\n00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.202\nAt least with the offline files,\nit brings you better productivity, and\n\n393\n00:20:28.202 --> 00:20:31.109\nthat way you actually know that\neverything can happen and work too.\n\n394\n00:20:31.109 --> 00:20:34.006\nThe other thing is,\neven if you're connected online,\n\n395\n00:20:34.006 --> 00:20:38.030\nright, establishing the offline\nfiles doesn't hurt anything.\n\n396\n00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:42.180\nIt actually may improve some\nperformance in this way, right?\n\n397\n00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.540\nIf there are network connectivity issues\nat times and you experience them.\n\n398\n00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.400\nOr you're actually on WiFi,\nand it drops you and\n\n399\n00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.090\nyou're in the middle of doing something.\n\n400\n00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:51.740\nWell, again,\n\n401\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.520\nby working with the offline files, even\nthough you have a good network connection.\n\n402\n00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.660\nIt may be a way that you can\nactually still have that and\n\n403\n00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.780\nthen have all the other things managed.\n\n404\n00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.110\nNow, so\nit's a combination of things, right?\n\n405\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.840\nIt's understanding that we have to have\naccess to a shared folder, which is key.\n\n406\n00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.895\nAnd then we have to able to go ahead and\nturn on the available offline.\n\n407\n00:21:09.895 --> 00:21:13.310\nEespecially, if it's a shared folder\nthat we're normally accessing, and so\n\n408\n00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.550\nonce we have that done,\neverything normally is good.\n\n409\n00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:21.180\nBut there are some settings that of\ncourse, Microsoft would love for you do at\n\n410\n00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.540\nleast know about, because it actually\ndoes help out with everything else.\n\n411\n00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.020\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at these settings here.\n\n412\n00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.750\nAnd the way that we're gonna do\nit is we're going to us gpedit,\n\n413\n00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:35.220\nthat brings us to our Local Group Policy\nEditor, .msc for Microsoft console.\n\n414\n00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.620\nAnd once I launch that thing up here,\n\n415\n00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.886\nthere are some settings that we\nneed to know how to get to them.\n\n416\n00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:46.610\nAnd we need to know some specific\nsettings that are also available for us.\n\n417\n00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.730\nNow just about all the settings that we're\ntaking a look at today will be underneath\n\n418\n00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.740\nAdministrative Templates.\n\n419\n00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:57.200\nIf I select Administrative Templates,\nand then under Network here,\n\n420\n00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.320\nthere is a folder called Offline Files for\n\n421\n00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.800\nall of the settings that are available for\nthe offline files.\n\n422\n00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.360\nNow, whatever order that they're in,\nthey're not in alphabetical order, so\n\n423\n00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.610\nit makes it a little bit\ndifficult to actually find.\n\n424\n00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.365\nBut I'm simply gonna click on the Settings\nbar up here, so I can go ahead and\n\n425\n00:22:14.365 --> 00:22:18.320\nkind of sort them in\nthe alphabetical order that we need.\n\n426\n00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.630\nAnd it's not that we need it, but\n\n427\n00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.610\nthere are some important\nsettings that are in there.\n\n428\n00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:25.250\nNow there are a lot, you can see that\nthere's a ton of settings here, but\n\n429\n00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.550\nthere are a few that\nwe do wanna point out.\n\n430\n00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.970\nSo when it comes down to it,\n\n431\n00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.320\nsome of the heavy things\nespecially with offline files.\n\n432\n00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.720\nReally deal with the idea\nof synchronizing and\n\n433\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.400\nwhen they synchronize,\ncuz this is important.\n\n434\n00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.210\nYou can have them synchronize in\nthe background at any random time.\n\n435\n00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.530\nBut remember, if you are Daniel and\n\n436\n00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:46.690\nhe's a network administrator, he says\nmy changes should be the final changes.\n\n437\n00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.260\nWell, it's really whoever last syncs up.\n\n438\n00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.260\nSo what Daniel can do is he\ncan actually go ahead and\n\n439\n00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:55.260\nset aside the Active Directory group\npolicy some of these same settings here.\n\n440\n00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.080\nSynchronize all offline files when people\nlog on or synchronize all offline files\n\n441\n00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.820\nbefore logging off.\n\n442\n00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.920\nSo when you take a look at\nsomething like this right,\n\n443\n00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.670\nyou're controlling when\nthe synchronization happens.\n\n444\n00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.530\nIt's not just ooh, I went ahead and\nI pressed save, and\n\n445\n00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.440\nDaniel just save two minutes before I did.\n\n446\n00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.560\nAnd now I've actually\noverwritten his saves, so\n\n447\n00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.145\ninstead what we can actually do is it\nactually takes until they log off.\n\n448\n00:23:19.145 --> 00:23:22.610\nAnd then Daniel might just make sure that\nhe,y I'm not gonna log off of my machine\n\n449\n00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:23.820\nuntil 7 o'clock tonight.\n\n450\n00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.010\nAnd that way he's the last one that\nlogs off and whatever changes or\n\n451\n00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.130\nwhatever else that needs to sync up,\nit will also happen too.\n\n452\n00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.520\nSo realize that we can also\nchange those settings too.\n\n453\n00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.740\nNow the other thing that you\nmay choose to do, which is,\n\n454\n00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.160\nif you don't want the use\nof offline files.\n\n455\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.780\nNotice you can prevent the use of\nthe offline files folder as well, so\n\n456\n00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:47.080\nthis one will actually disable that.\n\n457\n00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.123\nSo if there is a reason that you\ndon't want somebody doing it, well,\n\n458\n00:23:50.123 --> 00:23:52.496\nhere's a good way to make\nsure that on that computer.\n\n459\n00:23:52.496 --> 00:23:54.610\nAnd especially if you do it under\nthe computer configurations,\n\n460\n00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:55.678\nit doesn't matter who you are.\n\n461\n00:23:55.678 --> 00:23:58.346\nIt's not gonna save and\nespecially for that one machine And\n\n462\n00:23:58.346 --> 00:24:00.648\nwe're doing it on the local\npolicy editor as well.\n\n463\n00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:05.928\nThe other ones that we also might see,\nis that you might also point out this good\n\n464\n00:24:05.928 --> 00:24:11.560\ninside of an enterprise setting,\nis to enable the transparent caching.\n\n465\n00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.070\nNow the reason why this is good, is what\nwe had talked about a little bit earlier.\n\n466\n00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:17.693\nSometimes what can happen\nis that it will go ahead,\n\n467\n00:24:17.693 --> 00:24:21.601\ninstead of you just accessing all of\na sudden you are on the network, right?\n\n468\n00:24:21.601 --> 00:24:26.291\nAnd you go, I have 16 files that I\nnormally access, but it's normally in\n\n469\n00:24:26.291 --> 00:24:31.223\na batch of let's say 42 or 50 files,\nand you're use to seeing it that way.\n\n470\n00:24:31.223 --> 00:24:34.350\nWell now you go home, and\nyou're on the offline files and\n\n471\n00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:38.325\nyou only see those 16, and you're\nlike did I just delete something and\n\n472\n00:24:38.325 --> 00:24:42.260\nnow Daniel get's the panic call like\nI think I just deleted 32 files.\n\n473\n00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.420\nI don't know how, but I did it.\n\n474\n00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.856\nWell it's because those\nfiles are now missing.\n\n475\n00:24:45.856 --> 00:24:47.923\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Done it.\n\n476\n00:24:47.923 --> 00:24:48.675\n>> Been there.\n\n477\n00:24:48.675 --> 00:24:51.720\n[LAUGH]\n>> So when that stuff happens, right?\n\n478\n00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.150\nWell that kind of gets somebody into a\npanic, and Daniel might just be laughing.\n\n479\n00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.370\nHe's like, oh I'm can't believe\nRon did that again, but\n\n480\n00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.360\nwhen that stuff happens right,\nit can be a little bit panicky.\n\n481\n00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.632\nWhat this does instead says look,\n\n482\n00:25:01.632 --> 00:25:04.950\nwe're gonna allow that cache to happen\nthough it is really a cache of the names.\n\n483\n00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.650\nSo in other words if I only\naccess those 16 files.\n\n484\n00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.320\nI will see those but those will be kind\nof in bold or you know brighter, and\n\n485\n00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.760\nthe other ones will kind\nof be it'd be grayed out,\n\n486\n00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.450\nand that might be\nsomething you want to do.\n\n487\n00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:19.170\nBecause it does preserve some continuity\nfor the user, like that feels natural.\n\n488\n00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.987\nI know I'm not supposed to\naccess those other files.\n\n489\n00:25:20.987 --> 00:25:24.710\n>> Yeah, even Ronnie and I,\nas administrators, doing this for\n\n490\n00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.730\na long time,\nyou tend to look at things visually.\n\n491\n00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:32.163\nSo, this is really probably one of\nthe more helpful options that you have for\n\n492\n00:25:32.163 --> 00:25:35.630\nthese offline files because\nit's exactly what happens.\n\n493\n00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:36.848\nI've done it, Ronnie's done it.\n\n494\n00:25:36.848 --> 00:25:38.220\n>> Yes.\n>> We're like oh my goodness,\n\n495\n00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.310\nI think I've accidentally\ndeleted some files.\n\n496\n00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.140\nWhy is this not looking the way\nI think it should look.\n\n497\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.640\nSo it helps relieve some\nof that panic mode,\n\n498\n00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.730\nespecially for our users that are just,\nthey're just standard users, right.\n\n499\n00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.670\nThey work with the files they work with,\nthey go home,\n\n500\n00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.070\nthey wanna do a little bit of work at the\nhouse, not a big deal, they just jump in,\n\n501\n00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.000\nyou know they're at bed or\nthe coffee table, whatever the case is.\n\n502\n00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.530\nIf they don't see those files, they can\nreally hit the panic mode really quickly,\n\n503\n00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.960\nespecially since again they\ndon't know about computers,\n\n504\n00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.870\nhow their supposed to work\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n505\n00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.145\n>> They just know how it's supposed to\n\n506\n00:26:07.145 --> 00:26:07.916\nlook\n>> Right.\n\n507\n00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:09.960\n>> And then your phone starts ringing,\n\n508\n00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.340\nbecause they believe that they've\ndone some horrible thing.\n\n509\n00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.245\nAnd then you have to show them\nthat angels will descend.\n\n510\n00:26:14.245 --> 00:26:15.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you can fix it.\n\n511\n00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.480\n>> That's right.\n\n512\n00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.600\nThe other two options are really about\nslow links, and so let me go ahead and\n\n513\n00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.990\nshow you this as well.\n\n514\n00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.270\nSo inside of the same policy settings,\n\n515\n00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:30.200\nnotice it has configure slow link speed\nas well as configure slow link mode.\n\n516\n00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.360\nNow this is really important when\nyou do send people outside and\n\n517\n00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.870\nthey are not connecting into your network\nat the 100 megabits, or ten megabits, and\n\n518\n00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.300\nyou now only have, say a 256k connection.\n\n519\n00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.610\nEven at that point right, when you\nare trying to synchronize those files,\n\n520\n00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.960\nyou may actually have to go ahead and\ndo that, where you configure pure luck.\n\n521\n00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.970\nWhen it's this slow,\ndon't do the synchronization at all.\n\n522\n00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.480\nJust wait until you actually\nget a better speed, and so\n\n523\n00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.350\nthose are also a couple of different\nthings that can help you out.\n\n524\n00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.610\nWhen you configure link speed,\n\n525\n00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.770\nyou tell what link you're actually\nwilling to accept that connection, and\n\n526\n00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:04.740\nwhen you're not, and then, of course,\nyou actually are identifying it.\n\n527\n00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.750\nSo that's what those two are doing.\n\n528\n00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.420\nThey're saying use this, but\nonly here at this point,\n\n529\n00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.820\nyes you need to not do some things.\n\n530\n00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.410\nNow, is that all there is?\n\n531\n00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:17.700\nHeck no, look, you can see that there's\ntons of them right available there, but\n\n532\n00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.140\nthese are the ones that you will more\nlikely see in an enterprise setting, or\n\n533\n00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.090\nin a production environment setting.\n\n534\n00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.820\nAnd these are the ones that I would\nsay you need to be familiar with it.\n\n535\n00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.300\nIf you were preparing for\nthat Windows 10 exam, so\n\n536\n00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.550\nmake sure you also take a look\nat these settings as well.\n\n537\n00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.600\nSo there's a ton of mobility options and\n\n538\n00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.840\nyou can see why this is one of\nthe most effective ones, Daniel.\n\n539\n00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.705\n>> Oh yeah, definitely good stuff.\n\n540\n00:27:37.705 --> 00:27:41.644\nYou wanna get this down cuz well, hey\nyou're studying for an exam, most likely.\n\n541\n00:27:41.644 --> 00:27:43.305\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And other than that,\n\n542\n00:27:43.305 --> 00:27:45.465\nif you're supporting\na Windows 10 environment,\n\n543\n00:27:45.465 --> 00:27:48.285\na Windows environment,\nthis is the good stuff.\n\n544\n00:27:48.285 --> 00:27:50.245\nThis is the stuff that makes\nyou look like the hero.\n\n545\n00:27:50.245 --> 00:27:50.860\n>> Yes.\n>> Cuz,\n\n546\n00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.907\nyou're gonna save someone's bacon,\nmaybe even your own, right.\n\n547\n00:27:53.907 --> 00:27:55.857\nThe life you save may be your own.\n\n548\n00:27:55.857 --> 00:27:57.467\n>> True.\n>> So check that out,\n\n549\n00:27:57.467 --> 00:27:59.307\nmake sure you understand these concepts,\n\n550\n00:27:59.307 --> 00:28:01.767\nfigure out how this\noffline business works.\n\n551\n00:28:01.767 --> 00:28:03.583\nGreat demonstrations for us today, Ronnie.\n\n552\n00:28:03.583 --> 00:28:05.433\nHopefully you guys have\nenjoyed him as well.\n\n553\n00:28:05.433 --> 00:28:07.503\nHave we missed anything for this episode?\n\n554\n00:28:07.503 --> 00:28:08.963\n>> Not really, we didn't miss anything,\n\n555\n00:28:08.963 --> 00:28:12.143\nexcept for the rest of all\nthe mobility options that we have.\n\n556\n00:28:12.143 --> 00:28:13.773\nSo that means part two.\n\n557\n00:28:13.773 --> 00:28:16.560\n>> That's right you know how much me and\nRonnie love our parts.\n\n558\n00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.830\nParts two, three, four and beyond.\n\n559\n00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.590\nSo hopefully we'll see you in those parts.\n\n560\n00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.370\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up this show, though.\n\n561\n00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.280\nThanks for watching.\n\n562\n00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.630\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrey.\n\n563\n00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:27.187\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n564\n00:28:27.187 --> 00:28:28.219\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n565\n00:28:28.219 --> 00:28:35.280\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.470\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry, here with\nme today, well, it's Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.240\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.260\n>> It is going great.\n\n6\n00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.020\nIt's another great day to be right here\nwith you as we take a look at more\n\n7\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.590\nconfiguring Windows 10 devices.\n\n8\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.640\nAnd what we're doing is we are continuing\non our trek, especially on mobility\n\n9\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.770\noptions that we have to be all set,\nand Windows 10 has plenty of them.\n\n10\n00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.739\nBecause it is designed to actually be more\nthan just as desktop operating system and\n\n11\n00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.166\nalso one that runs on laptop.\n\n12\n00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.159\nBut also for things like you tablets,\n\n13\n00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.030\nas well as the future coming Windows\n10 phones that are out there.\n\n14\n00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.930\nThey want this to be an operating\nsystem that encompasses all those\n\n15\n00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.970\ndifferent devices.\n\n16\n00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.900\nBut within that operating system then,\nit means we actually have to have some\n\n17\n00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.110\npower management features, a lot of times,\nespecially with mobile devices.\n\n18\n00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.610\nWhy?\n\n19\n00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.810\nWell, it's because the one thing\nthat powers them all is the battery.\n\n20\n00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.860\nIt's sort of like the Lord of the Rings,\none ring, but on mobile devices,\n\n21\n00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.290\nright, the thing that powers\nit all is really battery.\n\n22\n00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.280\nRight?\nAnd if there's\n\n23\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.970\nany complaint about mobility devices, it\nreally is battery life and the longevity\n\n24\n00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.790\nof that while you're working on it is kind\nof the things that we have to worry about.\n\n25\n00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.340\nSo operating systems in the past\nas well as the hardware,\n\n26\n00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.020\nremember that performance on these laptops\nand things are getting higher and higher.\n\n27\n00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.890\nSo for example on my laptop\nthere's a i5 processor in there.\n\n28\n00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.370\nIt's got 16 gigs RAM,\nit's got the solid state drive.\n\n29\n00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.470\nThat's gotta eat up a battery.\n\n30\n00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.190\nAnd it's also got of, course,\nan LCD screen, so I mean,\n\n31\n00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.860\nthere's a ton of things that\nare drawing life out of that battery.\n\n32\n00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.320\nWell the operating system\ntries to help us out\n\n33\n00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.280\nby giving us multiple options\nthat we can actually configure.\n\n34\n00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.860\nNow that may be the reason\nwhy you choose to do that,\n\n35\n00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.972\nis because the battery life\nis not lasting long enough.\n\n36\n00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:57.701\nBut Daniel, there's actually\ndifferent scenarios that we can\n\n37\n00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:00.440\nthink about that we might actually\nneed to do that with, right?\n\n38\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.348\n>> Oh, yeah, there's definitely plenty of\nscenarios in which we might wanna tweak or\n\n39\n00:02:04.348 --> 00:02:06.769\njust make the power options\na little bit different,\n\n40\n00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:08.652\ndepending on what we're trying to do.\n\n41\n00:02:08.652 --> 00:02:11.932\nOne of them would be, well,\nwhat Ronnie and I are doing right now.\n\n42\n00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:15.192\nIt would probably be a bad thing\nif my computer went to sleep\n\n43\n00:02:15.192 --> 00:02:16.702\nduring the middle of a presentation.\n\n44\n00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:18.542\nI wouldn't like,\nyou probably wouldn't like it.\n\n45\n00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:21.831\nYou'd be like, all right this is really\ngood stuff, oh, where'd the screen go?\n\n46\n00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:24.556\nSo we don't want the screen to shut off,\nwe don't want the hard drive to shut off.\n\n47\n00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:28.596\nWe don't want the computer to go to sleep\nduring times when, well, we want it up and\n\n48\n00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:29.884\nactive and doing things.\n\n49\n00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:33.507\nA lot of times sleep situations or\nmonitor situations of them powering down,\n\n50\n00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:37.396\nwill happen just because I haven't touched\nanything on the computer for a while.\n\n51\n00:02:37.396 --> 00:02:40.321\nIt'll think hey,\nit's not being used, and I'm like,\n\n52\n00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:42.831\nI'm using you quite a bit\nactually right now, I need you\n\n53\n00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:46.920\nto continue to display these certain\nitems up so that everybody can see them.\n\n54\n00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.640\nIt doesn't know what's going on.\n\n55\n00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.468\nSo having the ability to go\ninto those power settings,\n\n56\n00:02:51.468 --> 00:02:53.927\nchanging a few of the options\nto be optimized for\n\n57\n00:02:53.927 --> 00:02:57.448\nwhat it is we're applying it to,\nthat is key for this type of thing.\n\n58\n00:02:57.448 --> 00:02:58.250\n>> There's no doubt.\n\n59\n00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.490\nAnother option there might also be\nis the other side of that coin.\n\n60\n00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.749\nSo even though during a show we really\nneed to make sure that our power settings,\n\n61\n00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:10.500\nor power options I should say,\nthe ones that manage our battery life,\n\n62\n00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.792\nare really turned off.\n\n63\n00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:12.983\nBecause we need it to be on and\n\n64\n00:03:12.983 --> 00:03:15.780\nready to go at any moment's notice\nwhen we start talking about it.\n\n65\n00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.031\nIf we wanna show a configuration,\nwe wanna be able to do that.\n\n66\n00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:22.587\nBut there are times though,\nthere are different scenarios in which you\n\n67\n00:03:22.587 --> 00:03:27.380\nmight say, I need, actually, it to manage\nit for me, cuz I'm not paying attention.\n\n68\n00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.760\nAnd if you've ever had that happen where\nall the sudden you were ready to go and\n\n69\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.560\nnow you're just sitting there like,\nokay let me wait for\n\n70\n00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.990\nthe battery to kind of come back on and\nnow everything's going.\n\n71\n00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.592\nAnd so you might end up in something\nlike a meeting, and of all the things,\n\n72\n00:03:40.592 --> 00:03:44.142\nmeetings are kind of the ones where\nsomebody's gonna be long-winded,\n\n73\n00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:48.004\nno not me, somebody's gonna be a little\nbit more long-winded than we think.\n\n74\n00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:50.393\nAnd what happens, of course,\nis that you're just sitting there and\n\n75\n00:03:50.393 --> 00:03:52.480\nafter awhile you're just\nsupposed to listen.\n\n76\n00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.430\nSo of course your laptop is still on,\nit's still drawing power and\n\n77\n00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.020\nit's still doing all that stuff.\n\n78\n00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.640\nWhat might actually be a better feature,\n\n79\n00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.900\nthough, is that we can tell the laptop\nto conserve the battery life too.\n\n80\n00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.020\nSo the good thing is,\n\n81\n00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.910\nthose are some of the ones that\nyou might wanna pay attention to.\n\n82\n00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.910\nSometimes it's just because, if you're\nlike me, and you live a little bit of\n\n83\n00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.620\ndistance away from the office, the times\nwhen you forget you're power supply.\n\n84\n00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.968\nAnd there it is,throughout\nthe day you're like,\n\n85\n00:04:17.968 --> 00:04:20.978\noh my gosh I need to manage this battery,\nor this battery better.\n\n86\n00:04:20.978 --> 00:04:23.779\nAnd so there's not all the time where\nyou might be on that laptop, but\n\n87\n00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:25.750\nyou need it to work,\nwhen you need it to work.\n\n88\n00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.000\nBut at other times, you really want to\nconserve as much power as possible.\n\n89\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.690\nSometimes those options\nare available to us,\n\n90\n00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.570\nwhere we actually are in a low power\nstate versus a power off state, and\n\n91\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.040\nwe just need to know what those\nfunctions are going to be.\n\n92\n00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.970\nSo the great thing is, it just really\ndepends on the scenario that you're in,\n\n93\n00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.440\nwhat features you might choose to turn on,\n\n94\n00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.550\nwhat features you might choose to\nactually allow Windows to manage for you.\n\n95\n00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.640\nAnd that's what we wanna show\nyou in this episode, too.\n\n96\n00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.050\nIs those power option features\nthat are also available.\n\n97\n00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.315\nBut then we're also gonna talk something\nelse, which is a little bit more of a fun\n\n98\n00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:01.875\ntopic ,where we'll also end up\ntaking a look at Windows 10.\n\n99\n00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:05.420\nSo we'll see Windows 10,\nTo Go, Windows To Go.\n\n100\n00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.420\nSee, I'm gonna mess it up at some point,\nmight as well do it now.\n\n101\n00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.130\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n102\n00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.610\ntake a look at the power options that are\navailable to us through the control panel.\n\n103\n00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.704\nAnd then we'll also take a look at it\nthrough the local group policy and\n\n104\n00:05:15.704 --> 00:05:17.499\nsee some of the settings that are there.\n\n105\n00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:20.650\nSo a lot of times as an individual,\nif I am not joined to domain,\n\n106\n00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.909\nif I just need to manage\nthose power options,\n\n107\n00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.130\nwe simply can go into our control\npanel to be able to manage that.\n\n108\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.067\nNow, in Windows 10 you can actually\njust right-click on, of course,\n\n109\n00:05:30.067 --> 00:05:31.281\nyour Windows button.\n\n110\n00:05:31.281 --> 00:05:32.097\nAnd when you do so,\n\n111\n00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:35.528\nyes, you do see the power options that\nare also available to you right here too.\n\n112\n00:05:35.528 --> 00:05:39.550\nNow I'm gonna go through control\npanel as well, to give us access,\n\n113\n00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.718\nbecause traditionally, that's the way they\nreally expect you get access to it here.\n\n114\n00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:47.626\nSo a lot of times once you actually\ngo here, you want to go to,\n\n115\n00:05:47.626 --> 00:05:49.176\nlet's say Hardware and Sound.\n\n116\n00:05:49.176 --> 00:05:52.980\nAnd now notice Power Options\nare also available as well.\n\n117\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.060\nNow you might be going like,\nhow did I know that?\n\n118\n00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.640\nWell I've spent a lot of time in Windows\n10, but it's also because that's where\n\n119\n00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.580\nit's actually been, well, at least since\nWindows Vista, if I remember right,\n\n120\n00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.370\nin this format, it's been in this option,\nin this place here.\n\n121\n00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.870\nSo when you actually are on a laptop,\n\n122\n00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.930\nthis is gonna be more essential than\nwhen you are on a desktop computer.\n\n123\n00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.150\nAnd so some of the power management\noptions that you have available to you,\n\n124\n00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.080\nof course, is when you choose to\nset up what we call a power plan.\n\n125\n00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.600\nBy default there are three plans.\n\n126\n00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.660\nAnd you might wanna, Ronnie,\nI count one, two I count, balanced,\n\n127\n00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.040\nwhich is recommended, and power saver.\n\n128\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.280\nBut there is actually additional\npower plan, it's just kind of\n\n129\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.140\nhidden in this little drop down right here\nwhere it says, Show additional plans.\n\n130\n00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.350\nSo there's actually three different\npower plans that are available to us,\n\n131\n00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.940\nbalanced, power saver,\nand high performance.\n\n132\n00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.710\nWell, what is the difference\nbetween these three?\n\n133\n00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.467\nWell, if you were to make, let's say, a\nchart, and the chart on a vertical scale,\n\n134\n00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:51.482\nthis way,\nwas about the idea of battery life, okay,\n\n135\n00:06:51.482 --> 00:06:53.569\nactually I should say performance.\n\n136\n00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:58.022\nAnd then the idea, of course,\nof battery life, well, when you go for\n\n137\n00:06:58.022 --> 00:07:04.000\nthe high performance, what you're actually\nsaying is, hey, I need performance.\n\n138\n00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.160\nBut what happens then is that the battery\nlife is not gonna be as long, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.580\nSo the higher performance that you have,\nthe more power you're gonna drain,\n\n140\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.930\nthe more electricity you're gonna\ndrain out from those batteries.\n\n141\n00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.525\nThen, when you do the idea of balance,\nyou're saying, I want okay performance,\n\n142\n00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:21.690\nbut I also want decent\nbattery life as well.\n\n143\n00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.700\nWell, you're willing to trade off\nsome of your performance features so\n\n144\n00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.670\nthat you can extend the battery life.\n\n145\n00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.800\nAnd then, of course,\nthere is power saver by default.\n\n146\n00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.840\nPower saver says, extend out\nthe battery life, but in doing so\n\n147\n00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.570\nyou trade off heavy performance options.\n\n148\n00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.130\nSo it might be that it really\ndoes throttle your PC down.\n\n149\n00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.930\nIt really tries to take advantage of that.\n\n150\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:47.542\nIt actually powers down your hard drive as\noften as it can to conserve battery life.\n\n151\n00:07:47.542 --> 00:07:52.507\nSo these are kind of the three that\nare actually available to us inside\n\n152\n00:07:52.507 --> 00:07:56.886\nof Microsoft Windows 10,\nis what we have available to us.\n\n153\n00:07:56.886 --> 00:08:00.650\nNow all these plans, it doesn't mean you\nhave to leave them at their defaults here.\n\n154\n00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.418\nBut you can't.\n\n155\n00:08:01.418 --> 00:08:03.913\nIf you need to change\nsome of those settings,\n\n156\n00:08:03.913 --> 00:08:06.760\ninside each one you can actually do that.\n\n157\n00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.720\nNow here's my recommendation though,\n\n158\n00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.670\nyou can also create a customized\npower plan if you need to.\n\n159\n00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.960\nOver on the left hand side,\nnotice it says Create a Power Plan.\n\n160\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.790\nNow if I select that,\n\n161\n00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.680\nI can base if off of any of these\nthree power plans that I want to.\n\n162\n00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.960\nBut I could actually go into any one of\nthese that are actually preconfigured and\n\n163\n00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.840\njust change a couple of options.\n\n164\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.465\nSo when you choose to say, hey,\nI just need to tweak the ballast\n\n165\n00:08:30.465 --> 00:08:34.937\na little bit versus creating\na whole new power plan setting.\n\n166\n00:08:34.937 --> 00:08:39.427\nWell, kind of a, I don't want to say it's\na rule of thumb, but if you find yourself\n\n167\n00:08:39.427 --> 00:08:43.530\nclicking on every single option and\ngoing, man I need to change this.\n\n168\n00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.570\nWell, instead of actually changing\nwhat the default plan is,\n\n169\n00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.160\nit's probably better then,\nat that point, when you actually say,\n\n170\n00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.990\nlet me just create a power plan of my own.\n\n171\n00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.510\nAnd that way if you need to go back to\none of those original ones you can.\n\n172\n00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.330\nBecause if you start modifying\nthese kind of default or\n\n173\n00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.750\nthese template power plans here, after\na while, you want to get them set back.\n\n174\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.430\nYou're not gonna remember\nall those settings.\n\n175\n00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.120\nSo if you go through all those options and\ngo man, I need to change all of these.\n\n176\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.710\nWell, then you kinda know\nit's probably time for\n\n177\n00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.750\nyou to create your own power\nplan setting at that point.\n\n178\n00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.340\nSo the good thing is, if we go ahead and\n\n179\n00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.060\njust take a look at some\nof these options here.\n\n180\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.540\nLet me go in and select the balanced\nplan that's recommended.\n\n181\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.360\nAnd then I can select\nChange plan settings, and\n\n182\n00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.190\ninside it kind of gives us the basics\nof what we see right here, right?\n\n183\n00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.670\nSo at the very beginning it's\nactually even giving us the option.\n\n184\n00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.590\nAre we talking about battery life\nversus how we're plugged in, and\n\n185\n00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.910\nnotice it actually tells us the biggest\nconsumers of power right now.\n\n186\n00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.170\nFirst of all it's the display and\nthe ability to put the computer to\n\n187\n00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.730\nsleep is really about the hard drive and\nwhen we take a look at\n\n188\n00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.670\nthe electricity that is normally drawn\nfrom the hard drive and from the display,\n\n189\n00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.920\nthese are our two biggest power\nconsumers that we have available.\n\n190\n00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.980\nSo on my particular balance plan here,\n\n191\n00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.380\nit says on the battery at this point\nIf I am actually just on battery,\n\n192\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.190\nit's gonna turn off display in five\nminutes if everything is idle.\n\n193\n00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.650\nSo if it doesn't sense that I'm moving\nsomething around on the screen,\n\n194\n00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.700\nin five minutes it will actually\ngo ahead and put it to sleep.\n\n195\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.560\nBut notice my default,\nit says ten minutes here.\n\n196\n00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.990\nWell if I'm plugged in notice I can\nchange that to Never if I wanted to.\n\n197\n00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.150\nThat's probably a better option for\nme right now if I do that.\n\n198\n00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.170\nSo let me go ahead and do that.\n\n199\n00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.650\nLet me just change it\nto Never at this point.\n\n200\n00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.730\nAlso to put the computer to sleep.\n\n201\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.770\nNow, when we talk about the term sleep,\n\n202\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.970\nthis is something that\nyou have to be aware of.\n\n203\n00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.860\nThere's really two terms that\nyou have to be available for.\n\n204\n00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.340\nOne is called hibernate, and\nthe other one is called sleep.\n\n205\n00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.110\nSo, what the heck is the difference\nbetween hibernate and sleep?\n\n206\n00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.002\nThat's a good question cuz both of them\njust seem like they're just sleeping\n\n207\n00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:35.980\nat some point.\n\n208\n00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.880\nBut the difference is that\none is a low power state, and\n\n209\n00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.270\nthe other one is a power off state.\n\n210\n00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.580\nThe term hibernate indicates\na power off state.\n\n211\n00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.710\nWhere as the term sleep indicates a low,\nlow power state instead.\n\n212\n00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.620\nSo when I talked about putting computer to\nsleep it's not gonna completely turn it\n\n213\n00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.570\noff and the reason why is because when you\nactually say hey I'm on power and you hit\n\n214\n00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.740\nyour space bar, you tap your little track\npad, your monitor should come back up.\n\n215\n00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.504\nEverything should be ready.\n\n216\n00:11:03.504 --> 00:11:05.429\nAnd that means there has to be\nalready electricity in there.\n\n217\n00:11:05.429 --> 00:11:08.387\nSo the only thing that is actually\npowering up at that point or\n\n218\n00:11:08.387 --> 00:11:11.885\nstaying powered is what's going\nto the RAM on your computer.\n\n219\n00:11:11.885 --> 00:11:15.075\nSo those are kind of the two\nbasic options when you see that.\n\n220\n00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:18.850\nSo you can again change all\nthese settings and here it is.\n\n221\n00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.090\nNow notice that I've went ahead and\n\n222\n00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.320\nI've changed a couple of\nsettings at this point.\n\n223\n00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.140\nSo there is on this balanced power plan\nI've went ahead and changed two but\n\n224\n00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.480\nnotice if I select Change advanced power\nand this is where you can go in and\n\n225\n00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.050\nnotice that there's\na ton of these options.\n\n226\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.560\nI can go in for the plugged in or\nthe hard disk itself.\n\n227\n00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.660\nI can tell them when to turn\nthe hard disk off if I need to and\n\n228\n00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.920\neven Internet Explorer.\n\n229\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.270\nYou name it there are some many options.\n\n230\n00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.220\nThese are options you may need to explore.\n\n231\n00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.870\nBut remember, if you start to go through\nall these and go, I need to change this.\n\n232\n00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.950\nI need to change this,\nthis is not aggressive enough.\n\n233\n00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.210\nYou may wanna go ahead and go look,\nlet me not modify that instead.\n\n234\n00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.470\nLet me go ahead and\ncancel out of these things.\n\n235\n00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.770\nAnd then you can create\nyour own power plan.\n\n236\n00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.200\nAnd base it off of one of those instead.\n\n237\n00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.410\nSo you can say hey, here's my basis.\n\n238\n00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.440\nAnd then from this point, create your own.\n\n239\n00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.340\nYeah.\nSo it's kind of an amazing feature here.\n\n240\n00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:15.670\nWhere you can go through now and really\ntweak all those settings that you need to.\n\n241\n00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.730\nBut the problem that also ends\nup happening with that, right,\n\n242\n00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.130\nis that sometimes you're not expecting\nthe outcome of all those changes.\n\n243\n00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.040\nSo, in other words,\n\n244\n00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.470\nthe computer may not react the same\nway that you think it's going to.\n\n245\n00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.700\nOne of the other biggest components that\neats the battery life is the Wi-Fi, right?\n\n246\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.620\nWhen you turn your wireless access or\n\n247\n00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:39.550\nyour wireless adapter on, it's\nconstantly seeking that connection and\n\n248\n00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:44.430\nso if it actually is on, lets say\nthe edge of an access point signal.\n\n249\n00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.980\nIt's gonna boost this power to try and\nstay connected.\n\n250\n00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.240\nSo its gonna eat up more\npower when you do that.\n\n251\n00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.120\nSo you do have to be careful\nabout those types of settings.\n\n252\n00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.610\nWhen you are making these power plans.\n\n253\n00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:58.000\nNow the other things that also happens\nthat we don't see a lot of these options\n\n254\n00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.670\ninside of this right here is over here\non the left hand side where it says\n\n255\n00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.860\nChoose when to turn the display off, and\n\n256\n00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:08.440\nchoose when the computer sleeps, but\nalso this about the power buttons too.\n\n257\n00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.260\nSo notice that I can actually say what\nhappens when I press the power buttons.\n\n258\n00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.320\nSo normally, a lot of the times when you\npress the power button on a laptop, or\n\n259\n00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.190\nwhatever it might be, you hold it for\nfive seconds, the whole thing powers off.\n\n260\n00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.330\nWell you can actually tell it to\ndo nothing if you want to, Okay?\n\n261\n00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.840\nIn other words, don't actually allow\nthe device to turn off itself.\n\n262\n00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.030\nOr you can tell it to turn just\nthe display off, or shut down,\n\n263\n00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.350\nwhatever it might be.\n\n264\n00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.410\nYou can actually do all of that stuff\nfairly easily if you choose to.\n\n265\n00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.730\nAnd then of course you can\nactually create passwords and\n\n266\n00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.430\ndo all those different settings.\n\n267\n00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.980\nSo there's a lot of changes in here.\n\n268\n00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.110\nAnd the only way for you to learn it is\nnot just by sitting here watching it.\n\n269\n00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.540\nIt's by you going in and configuring it,\nand seeing what happens as well.\n\n270\n00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.570\nSo do take the opportunity and time to\ntake a look at these settings, cause they\n\n271\n00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:58.695\nare important in your organization if\nyou're managing hundreds of laptops.\n\n272\n00:13:58.695 --> 00:14:01.340\nOr and you actually have to say look,\nwe're trying to make sure that\n\n273\n00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.670\nthose batteries are actually\ngonna last all year.\n\n274\n00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.570\nAnd you may come up with\na default power plan instead.\n\n275\n00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.930\nthat you want to push out\nto all the laptops, too.\n\n276\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.120\nAnd once we do that, Daniel,\n\n277\n00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.820\nwhen we start talking about configuring\nhundreds of laptops, where are we going?\n\n278\n00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.020\n>> Yeah, we're probably going to\ngroup policy at that point in your\n\n279\n00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.640\nActive Directory domain.\n\n280\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.740\nAnd that's because it's just\nthe easiest way to do this.\n\n281\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.250\nI can push out all the different\nchanges I need to make in one spot, and\n\n282\n00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.570\nI can say it just applies to these\ndifferent computers, very, very simple.\n\n283\n00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.750\nThat's definitely the way to go.\n\n284\n00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.990\nIf you are in an Active Directory domain,\nthat's exactly what you're gonna do.\n\n285\n00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.610\nAnd it's really nice, so when we're\ntalking about these power plans,\n\n286\n00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.860\nand all the different ones,\nI can create different groups of computers\n\n287\n00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.880\nthat are gonna have this type of power\nplans that are gonna get applied to them.\n\n288\n00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.630\nAnd this group is gonna have\na different type of power plan\n\n289\n00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.720\nthat are gonna get applied to them.\n\n290\n00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.590\nBecause, you know what?\n\n291\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.170\nTheir job roles may be different.\n\n292\n00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.770\nThe requirements behind what\nthe power settings are doing might be\n\n293\n00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.610\ncompletely different,\nto be honest with you.\n\n294\n00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.920\nYou never know, so it's all about do\na little bit of research about how people\n\n295\n00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.170\nuse their computers via the groups and\nwho's in those groups and\n\n296\n00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.590\nmaking sure everybody gets\nthe exact right power plan.\n\n297\n00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.660\nThat works for them.\n\n298\n00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.070\n>> And Daniel,\nI think that's a great point,\n\n299\n00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.870\nespecially inside of the group\npolicy cuz you never know.\n\n300\n00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.180\nYou might think that in your organization,\nyou're only gonna buy,\n\n301\n00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.640\nlet's say the SXP12s, and\n\n302\n00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.500\nall of a sudden you realize\nthe battery life is not that great.\n\n303\n00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.970\nSo the next batch that you buy, instead,\nis from a different company, and\n\n304\n00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.860\nthe next batch you buy may even\nbe a different company as well.\n\n305\n00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.150\nUsing those group policies really\ncan help us to differentiate\n\n306\n00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.430\nthe power plan settings that we need,\neven for those specific computers.\n\n307\n00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.994\nEspecially we join them to the domain and\nwe create a group for them, then we can\n\n308\n00:15:34.994 --> 00:15:39.270\napply those policies the way we need to to\nthe individual groups of those computers.\n\n309\n00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.012\nInstead of just saying this one power plan\nis gonna run for everyone and it may,\n\n310\n00:15:43.012 --> 00:15:46.088\nbut you may choose after you optimize and\ntest a little bit more.\n\n311\n00:15:46.088 --> 00:15:49.660\nAnd go no, here's a power settings we\nwanna make sure that apply to these\n\n312\n00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.650\nparticular computers instead.\n\n313\n00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.815\nJust a great option for us to think about.\n\n314\n00:15:53.815 --> 00:15:57.243\nSo of course that means that we do need\nto take a look at the actual group policy\n\n315\n00:15:57.243 --> 00:15:58.538\nsettings just a little bit.\n\n316\n00:15:58.538 --> 00:16:01.041\nWhat we're gonna do, of course,\nis inside of Windows 10,\n\n317\n00:16:01.041 --> 00:16:04.600\nis we're gonna take a look at it through\nour local group policy editor instead.\n\n318\n00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.110\nYou'll still see pretty much the majority\nof the same settings here, that you would\n\n319\n00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:12.000\nsee inside of the active directory, so\nlet's go ahead and show you those too.\n\n320\n00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.550\nSo, of course, to be able to get access\nto it, I simply type in the search bar.\n\n321\n00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.910\nI call it the Cortona search bar,\nI know that's, technically,\n\n322\n00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:18.990\nnot what it's called there.\n\n323\n00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.010\nBut I went ahead and just typed it in,\nand I typed in gp edit, for\n\n324\n00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:28.090\ngroup policy editor.msc, Microsoft\nconsole, and I'm simply going to run that.\n\n325\n00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:33.950\nAnd from there, we wanna make sure\nthat we set up a policy here for\n\n326\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.020\nthe power management settings.\n\n327\n00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:39.070\nAnd that's going to apply to the entire\ncomputer, regardless, of who logs in.\n\n328\n00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.872\nSo that means what we're gonna do is,\nunderneath computer configuration,\n\n329\n00:16:41.872 --> 00:16:44.700\nwe're gonna select advanced templates.\n\n330\n00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.640\nAnd advanced templates,\n\n331\n00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.410\nsince we're affecting the overall computer\nsystem, we're going to select system.\n\n332\n00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.450\nAnd it is inside of system,\nin alphabetical order,\n\n333\n00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.710\nat least I think it is, yep, we're gonna\ngo to the power management settings here.\n\n334\n00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:02.040\nAnd in the power management settings, all\nthe things that I just showed you really\n\n335\n00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.920\ninside of the control panel, these\nare settings that we can apply right here.\n\n336\n00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.091\nAnd that way, we can actually have it\npushed out without the user actually going\n\n337\n00:17:11.091 --> 00:17:13.218\ninto the control panel to change these.\n\n338\n00:17:13.218 --> 00:17:15.150\nAnd you might say,\ndo I really need to do it there,\n\n339\n00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.677\nif I can change it in the control panel?\n\n340\n00:17:16.677 --> 00:17:19.912\nIf you don't want Ronnie Wong going in\nthere and messing around with your power\n\n341\n00:17:19.912 --> 00:17:23.608\nsettings, here's where you're gonna do it,\nor in the active directory group policy.\n\n342\n00:17:23.608 --> 00:17:27.050\nThe nice thing is, once you actually go\nback to control panel, you'll get a nice,\n\n343\n00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.753\nlittle yellow bar, a lot of times\nit says some of these settings or\n\n344\n00:17:29.753 --> 00:17:32.898\nall of these settings are not gonna be\navailable to you, or they're gonna be\n\n345\n00:17:32.898 --> 00:17:35.832\nmanaged by an administrator, and\nthey won't be able to gain access.\n\n346\n00:17:35.832 --> 00:17:40.700\nSo here's another way that really can help\nyou to make sure that this is going on.\n\n347\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.600\nSo, of course,\nthere are multiple settings here.\n\n348\n00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.560\nRight at the top are button settings.\n\n349\n00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.740\nWhat actually happens with a button?\n\n350\n00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.810\nAnd all of these are actually done in\npairs, whether they're in battery or\n\n351\n00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:52.040\nwhen they're plugged in, as well.\n\n352\n00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.160\nSame thing with the hard disk settings and\nnotifications.\n\n353\n00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.330\nAnd this is actually what shows up in\nthe lower right hand corner of the screen.\n\n354\n00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:03.013\nWhere it gives you a battery notice or\nnot, and a critical notice, and\n\n355\n00:18:03.013 --> 00:18:06.570\nhow you actually want them or\nto actually be displayed.\n\n356\n00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.560\nAnd then, of course,\nmultiple sleep settings too.\n\n357\n00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.880\nNow this is a fairly important option\nbecause it really does depend on\n\n358\n00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.620\nthe scenario that you're in, whether\nyou're gonna use hibernate or sleep.\n\n359\n00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.760\nRemember that sleep is\na a lower powered state, so\n\n360\n00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.140\nthat when you need to you just\nturn the computer back on, and\n\n361\n00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.822\neverything is up and operating,\nas quickly as you can.\n\n362\n00:18:26.822 --> 00:18:29.380\nHibernate, it's the same thing, but\n\n363\n00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.488\nit really does power\nyour complete laptop off.\n\n364\n00:18:32.488 --> 00:18:36.244\nIf you select a hibernate type of setting,\nwhat is going to happen is,\n\n365\n00:18:36.244 --> 00:18:37.911\nit's gonna take everything.\n\n366\n00:18:37.911 --> 00:18:42.811\nIf I were to hibernate my laptop right\nnow, everything that's in RAM would end up\n\n367\n00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:47.495\nbeing written to a file, that's normally\ngonna be inside of your swap file,\n\n368\n00:18:47.495 --> 00:18:50.220\nas well, and then that will be safe.\n\n369\n00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.570\nAs soon as you actually turn the computer\nback on by pressing the power button,\n\n370\n00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.325\ninstead of going through the boot process,\nit's gonna look for that file called\n\n371\n00:18:57.325 --> 00:19:02.320\nhiberfill.sys, and then load that back\ninto RAM, and then you're up and going.\n\n372\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.200\nSo the only thing you're really skipping\nout when you do hibernate is actually\n\n373\n00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.740\nthe boot process itself, but\nyou're actually back up, and ready to go.\n\n374\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.340\nYou might again wonder why in\nthe world would I do that?\n\n375\n00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.360\nWell, what if I'm in the middle\nof working on a process, but\n\n376\n00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.910\nI need to get on a plane.\n\n377\n00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.940\nSo all of a sudden,\nI actually need to get on a plane.\n\n378\n00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.470\nI don't have time to close it out.\n\n379\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:20.870\nBut I need to preserve the battery life,\n\n380\n00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.860\nbecause I'm gonna be working on it,\nin not too long in the future.\n\n381\n00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.120\nHibernating it,\nwill take everything in the RAM,\n\n382\n00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.690\nwrite it to the hard drive,\npower the whole device off,\n\n383\n00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:31.770\nwhich means you're not gonna be\nexpending any more battery power.\n\n384\n00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.436\nSo that's when you might choose that.\n\n385\n00:19:33.436 --> 00:19:36.019\nIf you're in the middle of a meeting,\nright, and\n\n386\n00:19:36.019 --> 00:19:39.158\nyou start realizing your battery\nlife is starting to drain,\n\n387\n00:19:39.158 --> 00:19:41.818\nyou didn't think the meeting\nwould go on that far.\n\n388\n00:19:41.818 --> 00:19:44.908\nWell, instead, using a sleep\noption's gonna to power it down, but\n\n389\n00:19:44.908 --> 00:19:47.889\nthen allow you to wake that computer up,\nas quickly as you need to,\n\n390\n00:19:47.889 --> 00:19:50.625\nto do what you need to during the meeting,\nas well.\n\n391\n00:19:50.625 --> 00:19:53.545\nSo do take a look at these\ndifferent states here, and\n\n392\n00:19:53.545 --> 00:19:56.845\nmake sure you examine them, especially,\non those button configurations,\n\n393\n00:19:56.845 --> 00:20:01.000\nif you want to control what happens\non the power button itself.\n\n394\n00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.730\nSo remember you can set it here, and\nyou can set it in control panel.\n\n395\n00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.640\nThese are good power management features,\nespecially,\n\n396\n00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.080\non mobility devices that we need to take\ncare of, because battery life is the key,\n\n397\n00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.850\nespecially, in this world where\neverything is going mobile.\n\n398\n00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.260\n>> Yeah, one of my favorites is,\n\n399\n00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.230\nwhat happens when I shut\nthe lid of my laptop, right?\n\n400\n00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.500\nThat is one that used to drive me insane.\n\n401\n00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.070\nI'd shut the lid, I'd probably be\ndisplaying whatever's on the screen\n\n402\n00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.160\nout to some external monitor,\nmaybe even my TV.\n\n403\n00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:31.245\nSometimes, I use my laptop as a media\nstreaming device, from time to time.\n\n404\n00:20:31.245 --> 00:20:34.835\nI plug it into my TV, and shut the lid,\nit shuts the whole thing off.\n\n405\n00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:35.917\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [SOUND] Okay.\n\n406\n00:20:35.917 --> 00:20:39.259\nI just make a nice power profile that\nsays when I shut that lid off, hey,\n\n407\n00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:41.879\nyou know what,\nit doesn't mean turn the computer off,\n\n408\n00:20:41.879 --> 00:20:44.636\nit means just have the lid shut,\ndon't do anything else.\n\n409\n00:20:44.636 --> 00:20:47.918\nSo that can be very helpful, especially,\nif you're doing something like\n\n410\n00:20:47.918 --> 00:20:51.712\na presentation, using an extra monitor\noverhead, something to that effect.\n\n411\n00:20:51.712 --> 00:20:53.922\n>> It really is one of the best features,\n\n412\n00:20:53.922 --> 00:20:57.552\nthat we can really help somebody\ncontrol their battery life settings,\n\n413\n00:20:57.552 --> 00:21:01.362\ncuz that is the most disappointing\naspect of working on laptops.\n\n414\n00:21:01.362 --> 00:21:05.470\nIf you don't have your power supply ready\nto go, and you only have battery, well,\n\n415\n00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.934\nit gets annoying when you keep\ngetting that like 18 % battery life,\n\n416\n00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:11.067\n7% battery life, plug in immediately.\n\n417\n00:21:11.067 --> 00:21:13.485\nAnd I can't plug in,\nI just gotta keep working, well,\n\n418\n00:21:13.485 --> 00:21:16.674\nyou can only work up to a certain point,\nand the problem is, especially,\n\n419\n00:21:16.674 --> 00:21:20.174\non laptops, when they decide that they're\nout of power, they don't tell you,\n\n420\n00:21:20.174 --> 00:21:22.305\nthey just sit there,\nand go, okay, I'm done.\n\n421\n00:21:22.305 --> 00:21:27.530\nAnd that's it so they don't really\nannounce to you that I'm on my last straw.\n\n422\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.330\nThey do to a point, right,\nwhen they say 7%, you know.\n\n423\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.000\nBut you still go, well, that's still 7%,\nI should be able to work down to 1.\n\n424\n00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.492\nSometimes they will let you, but most of\nthe time it's probably not gonna do that.\n\n425\n00:21:38.492 --> 00:21:41.460\nSo just realize that, that's why\nwe actually need to do this too.\n\n426\n00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:44.390\nAll right, so\n\n427\n00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:49.580\nthere's also another neat feature when we\nstart considering the idea of mobility.\n\n428\n00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.880\nWhich is,\nwhat if I don't have a laptop to take\n\n429\n00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.730\nwith me wherever I need to go,\nbut I still need all of my stuff.\n\n430\n00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:03.090\nI still need all of\nthe applications that I need.\n\n431\n00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:08.100\nI still need Windows 10 to run, but\nI don't have a laptop to take with me.\n\n432\n00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.210\nWell, what we can do is, we can configure\nsomething that we call Windows To Go.\n\n433\n00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.340\nNow what is Windows To Go?\n\n434\n00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:20.620\nWindows To Go, in theory, can allow me to\nput Windows 10 on something like that,\n\n435\n00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.300\nbelieve it or not, an actual USB key.\n\n436\n00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.750\nThat we can actually go ahead and\nput the entirety of the operating system\n\n437\n00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:33.240\nright back on here, and you might be\nwondering like, why would I ever do that?\n\n438\n00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:39.030\nBecause now, as I go through\nthe airport as an Asian male,\n\n439\n00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.380\nthe search,\nthey're saying what's in your pocket?\n\n440\n00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.030\nI just pull that out.\n\n441\n00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.660\nThat way when they go, well, what is that,\nI can say, that's my computer right there.\n\n442\n00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.310\nAnd they might actually plug it in,\nbut I doubt it.\n\n443\n00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:49.930\nThey'll just try to see\nif it actually does work.\n\n444\n00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:54.160\nBut, overall, though,\nI'm not having to empty out my laptop bag,\n\n445\n00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.180\nI'm not having to do this,\nI can just take this wherever I go,\n\n446\n00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.170\nall my stuff is on here,\nand I am now ready to go.\n\n447\n00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.340\nThe only thing I need to make sure of,\nright, is that when I\n\n448\n00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.140\nplug this into that computer, that it can\nactually boot up, and that we are ready.\n\n449\n00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.420\nNow, of course, just like anything\nelse in the world of Windows,\n\n450\n00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.980\nthere are some minimal\nrequirements that we have to have.\n\n451\n00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.960\nSo let's go ahead and show you those too.\n\n452\n00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.690\nOn my notes here, which we'll end up\nposting, as well, with these episodes.\n\n453\n00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:25.350\nUnderneath the basic requirements here,\nhere's what needs to be done.\n\n454\n00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.930\nOn the machine that you're gonna be\nrunning Windows to go in, right?\n\n455\n00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:32.610\nYou have to, of course, have that\nmachine be able to boot up to a USB.\n\n456\n00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.310\nSo the machine is so\nold that it can't boot up to a USB.\n\n457\n00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.130\nYou can't select boot options\nto say boot to the USB.\n\n458\n00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:40.050\nYeah it's not gonna work.\n\n459\n00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.010\nSo you might not be able to do that.\n\n460\n00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.590\nSo the firmware has to be able to do that.\n\n461\n00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.550\nAnd, of course, the process\narchitecture says it must be able to\n\n462\n00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.480\nsupport the Windows To Go drive,\nmost of them can't.\n\n463\n00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.930\nSo in other words there's a 32 bit\nmachine, there's a 64 bit machine.\n\n464\n00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.381\nIf the processor can support both\nof those, you're probably fine.\n\n465\n00:23:56.381 --> 00:23:58.585\nNow the only thing it's\nnot supported on is,\n\n466\n00:23:58.585 --> 00:24:01.488\nif you have an external USB\nhub that you're plugging into.\n\n467\n00:24:01.488 --> 00:24:04.842\nYou absolutely need to plug\ndirectly into one of the ports on\n\n468\n00:24:04.842 --> 00:24:09.520\nthe machine that you're running, so\nit can't go through a powered USB hub.\n\n469\n00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.870\nIt does not want to share that connection.\n\n470\n00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.900\nI know that sounds strange, but\nthat is one of those requirements.\n\n471\n00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.760\nOn the processor end,\n\n472\n00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.150\nat least a GHz processor,\nyou need a minimum of two gigs of RAM.\n\n473\n00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.580\nAnd then of course the graphics,\nand then, ideally,\n\n474\n00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.550\nyou would be on a USB-3 port instead.\n\n475\n00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.860\nYou can run it on a USB-2 port.\n\n476\n00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.750\nIt will work, but it's sluggish.\n\n477\n00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.850\nIt will be very slow for you.\n\n478\n00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.940\nNow, we didn't actually just\nstart this in Windows 10.\n\n479\n00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.178\nThis has actually been\naround since Windows 8.\n\n480\n00:24:38.178 --> 00:24:43.470\nBut overall though, it really is kind of\nneat because you can eliminate essentially\n\n481\n00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:48.470\na laptop If you actually do have\nthe licensing that you need of course,\n\n482\n00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.050\nthat you can actually put it on there.\n\n483\n00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:54.350\nAnd then there's a lot of other things\nthat you also have to consider, as well.\n\n484\n00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.330\nSo you need not only the ISO,\n\n485\n00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.260\nactually, you need to create\na win-file is what you need.\n\n486\n00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:03.220\nSo in deployment terms,\nyou need to set up the machine,\n\n487\n00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.040\nlike what Daniel's gonna need\nif he's going out on the road.\n\n488\n00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.750\nWe need to actually say here's all\nthe applications that Daniel needs.\n\n489\n00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:14.860\nHere's all the different files\nthat he needs, everything.\n\n490\n00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:15.650\nAnd we'll load that in.\n\n491\n00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:19.210\nSo once we actually configure that image,\nwe go and assist prep it.\n\n492\n00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.480\nWe save it and that's what we're going\nto need to make sure that everything\n\n493\n00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.140\nis actually the way that we want it.\n\n494\n00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.840\nNow once that's done we can then deploy\nit into, well something like this.\n\n495\n00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.820\nAnd once we do that we're fine and\nwe are dandy to go at that point.\n\n496\n00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.550\nSo we wanna at least show you the\nbeginning process of how to get something\n\n497\n00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:40.470\nlike this started here and\nI do need to use this drive, okay?\n\n498\n00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.130\nNow, the other thing that\nwe also have to have,\n\n499\n00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.210\ncuz I told you that on\nthe other end of it, right?\n\n500\n00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.590\nOn the machine you're gonna plug into,\nthose are the requirements.\n\n501\n00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:49.870\nBut on your end, you have to be\nrunning what the operating system is,\n\n502\n00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.120\nso Windows 10.\n\n503\n00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.590\nEnterprise is the key for\nwhat we're gonna be doing.\n\n504\n00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:59.270\nAnd then on the drive that you're also\ngonna use for that device, there are what\n\n505\n00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:04.760\nwe call USB certified, excuse me,\nUSB Drive Certified for Windows to go.\n\n506\n00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.080\nAnd there are multiple\ndevices that are out there,\n\n507\n00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.980\nnot every single USB device out there\nis certified for it to work well.\n\n508\n00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.180\nCan you still run it on those?\n\n509\n00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:13.700\nYes.\n\n510\n00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.680\nAre you gonna experience\na performance hit?\n\n511\n00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.480\nYes.\n\n512\n00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.510\nSo, of course,\nthey only recommend the ones and\n\n513\n00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.470\nyou can actually find those\nrecommendations online.\n\n514\n00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:24.080\nAnd when you purchase those, you'll\nactually see that they'll actually say\n\n515\n00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.030\nthat, certified for Windows to go and\nthen you choose one of those drives.\n\n516\n00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.320\nA little bit more expensive but\n\n517\n00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.400\nit is worth it cuz you will get\nthe performance that you need out of it.\n\n518\n00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.900\nNow in the configuration part,\nit's not very difficult.\n\n519\n00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.410\nAnd we actually do have\ntime to show you that.\n\n520\n00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:40.450\nSo let's go ahead, and at least get the\nstartup of it happening for what we need.\n\n521\n00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:44.150\nSo, remember, I have,\nactually, some ISOs on here.\n\n522\n00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:48.210\nAnd I am gonna plug that into\nmy USB port on one side or\n\n523\n00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.250\nthe other here is what I\nam going to need to do.\n\n524\n00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:56.260\nAnd let me go on and\nconnect this to my Windows machine.\n\n525\n00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:01.580\nAnd then I also need the drive\nthat I am going to use for,\n\n526\n00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.110\nwell, the USB to go, okay?\n\n527\n00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.210\nSo on this one right here,\n\n528\n00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:08.970\nthis particular drive I think is\na terabyte drive that we're going to use.\n\n529\n00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.180\nAnd what we're gonna do is we\nare also going to use that.\n\n530\n00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.300\nAnd that's gonna become\nmy Windows To Go drive.\n\n531\n00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.620\nSo let me plug that one in.\n\n532\n00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.090\nAnd I just need to make sure I\nconnect both of these into my machine.\n\n533\n00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.500\nSo now that they are both connected.\n\n534\n00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:29.060\nLet me make sure that it's actually\nactivated the way that we need, so\n\n535\n00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.640\nthat the operating system sees it,\nis pretty much the cool thing here.\n\n536\n00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:39.460\nSo here we go So I have a lot of disks\nthat are actually out there for me.\n\n537\n00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.400\nThis one that's untitled over here,\n\n538\n00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.520\nthat is actually the drive where\nI have my ISOs that I need.\n\n539\n00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.290\nAnd then the other one of course is\nthe drive that I'm going to begin\n\n540\n00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.170\nthe Windows To Go process.\n\n541\n00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.330\nIn the search bar here I'm\ngoing to type in Windows To Go.\n\n542\n00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:57.230\nNow on the Windows To Go\nyou are looking for\n\n543\n00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:00.160\nthat where it says\nWindows To Go Control Panel.\n\n544\n00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.760\nNow I did actually boot up another\nmachine which was running Windows 10 and\n\n545\n00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.910\nit only had the second option.\n\n546\n00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:08.570\nWell that's true, for one reason or\nanother, that means that on that machine,\n\n547\n00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.190\nyou won't be able to create\nthis Windows To Go machine.\n\n548\n00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.840\nSo if you don't have that option\navailable to you in control panel,\n\n549\n00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.160\nit's probably not going to be there.\n\n550\n00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.740\nSo just kind of realize that that's\nwhat you'll have to find out and do.\n\n551\n00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.730\nSo, it asked me what\ndrive do I want to use?\n\n552\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.870\nI'm going to select this one terabyte\ndrive here, this WD Element.\n\n553\n00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:29.930\nNow it's already noticing that it is not\nactually that certified, USB 3.0 drive.\n\n554\n00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.010\nSo, we're only gonna begin the process and\n\n555\n00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.760\nwe'll talk about why\nin just a moment here.\n\n556\n00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.230\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick next at this point, too.\n\n557\n00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:40.810\nNow, it's searching for\nwhat we call a Wim file.\n\n558\n00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:45.370\nNow, I don't actually have a Wim\nfile that I created an image off of.\n\n559\n00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:52.310\nBut I can mount the stock Windows 10\nimage, is what I can actually do here.\n\n560\n00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:53.930\nI went ahead and mounted this one.\n\n561\n00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:58.470\nAnd I think I have to go to sources here,\nI might be wrong.\n\n562\n00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:03.960\nLet me go and add a new search\nlocation inside of the ISO folder.\n\n563\n00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:06.520\nLet's see here.\n\n564\n00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.020\nMaybe.\n\n565\n00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:09.460\nI know what I did.\n\n566\n00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.030\nI did it wrong in here.\n\n567\n00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:15.320\nI need to go down and find that\nmounted drive that I just created.\n\n568\n00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.320\nHere it is.\n\n569\n00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.400\nThat's what has to happen.\n\n570\n00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.020\nThere we go.\n\n571\n00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.080\nSo notice you can now see where it says,\nWindows 10 Enterprise.\n\n572\n00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:24.900\nSo, that's the difference.\n\n573\n00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:29.130\nNow, if you're in an Enterprise\nenvironment, wherever you store your\n\n574\n00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:33.730\nimages, your production images, that's\nwhat you'd want to mount here instead.\n\n575\n00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.590\nAnd then from that point, you click next.\n\n576\n00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.540\nAnd now you have an option.\n\n577\n00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.470\nDo you want to protect\nthis with BitLocker.\n\n578\n00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.980\nIf that is going to be your main drive,\nwhere you're using it everywhere.\n\n579\n00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.680\nIf Daniel's going to go to a hotel and\nuse that computer down in the lobby,\n\n580\n00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.180\nwhich, Daniel, you should never do.\n\n581\n00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.520\nIf you are actually gonna do that,\n\n582\n00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.150\nright, you wanna make sure\nit's protected with BitLocker.\n\n583\n00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:54.150\nThat way, if somebody goes, oh look,\nDaniel left his key on there,\n\n584\n00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.975\nas soon as I pull it out,\nit's gonna encrypt the drive.\n\n585\n00:29:56.975 --> 00:30:00.405\nBut for this point, because it'll slow our\nprocess down, I'm not going to do that.\n\n586\n00:30:00.405 --> 00:30:03.515\nI'm simply going to go ahead and\nskip this at this point here.\n\n587\n00:30:03.515 --> 00:30:08.535\nThen it says we are ready to go ahead and\ncreate our Windows To Go workspace.\n\n588\n00:30:08.535 --> 00:30:13.070\nNow, when we do this,\nthis can take a long time.\n\n589\n00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:16.240\nIt can take fifteen to twenty minutes,\nit can take up to an hour.\n\n590\n00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.320\nAnd on this drive because it's not\na certified Windows To Go drive\n\n591\n00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.790\nit may actually take a longer process for\nus to actually be able to do that.\n\n592\n00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.130\nBut once everything is actually done,\n\n593\n00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:31.650\nyou'll end up seeing that we have to\nreboot that drive multiple times.\n\n594\n00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:35.458\nBecause of what's actually\ngonna end up happening here is\n\n595\n00:30:35.458 --> 00:30:39.589\nthat I will have created a Windows\n10 computer on that drive.\n\n596\n00:30:39.589 --> 00:30:45.630\nBut I'm actually doing it off of\na VMware Fusion virtual machine.\n\n597\n00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:49.310\nWell remember that it's still tied to the\nhardware, right, when I create that image.\n\n598\n00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:51.430\nThen I have to move it\nto another computer.\n\n599\n00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.450\nAny other computer and\nthen it has to tie itself to that.\n\n600\n00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:56.340\nAnd it has to keep those configurations.\n\n601\n00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.420\nDaniel goes to another city.\n\n602\n00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.350\nHe might find another computer and\nhave to do that as well.\n\n603\n00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.880\nSo every time he goes to a new computer,\n\n604\n00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.600\nit's going to have to boot\nup a couple of times.\n\n605\n00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.730\nAnd it may take a little bit\nof a longer process to do so\n\n606\n00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:10.840\nwhen we actually have something\nlike that to have to deal with.\n\n607\n00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.890\nBut once it actually finishes doing all\nthe stuff that needs to configure that\n\n608\n00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:15.500\nhardware and recognize it.\n\n609\n00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.420\nHe'll be ready to go at that point.\n\n610\n00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.380\nSo there is a lot for\nus to actually go through.\n\n611\n00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.450\nWe're not gonna take the time to sit here\nand wait for an hour for us to do this.\n\n612\n00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:24.960\nThe good thing is I've already\ncreated a Windows 10 to go.\n\n613\n00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.370\nAnd that means that our process now is\njust verifying that it's actually up and\n\n614\n00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:29.440\nready to go.\n\n615\n00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.660\nBut Daniel it looks like I've talked\ntoo much and that once again means,\n\n616\n00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.261\nwell we need another part.\n\n617\n00:31:35.261 --> 00:31:37.630\n>> Well this is a great\nconversation to be having so\n\n618\n00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.080\nit's okay that Ronnie\ntalked plenty about it.\n\n619\n00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.230\nTo be honest with you, Windows To Go,\n\n620\n00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:44.090\none of the coolest features that\nthey've ever come out with.\n\n621\n00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:47.500\nI can basically take my desktop\nenvironment that I'm so\n\n622\n00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.400\nused to, slap it on a drive and\ntake it wherever I go.\n\n623\n00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.250\nI always have my computer no matter\nwhat computer it is I'm working on.\n\n624\n00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.770\nI don't have to worry about remoting in,\nI don't have to worry about any of that.\n\n625\n00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:01.120\nI've got that drive and\nit has an encryption in it as well.\n\n626\n00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.190\nAll I need is one of those awesome\ncertified to make it a little bit easier\n\n627\n00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.000\nfor us as well.\n\n628\n00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.690\nBut you can use any drive\nyou have available.\n\n629\n00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.370\nA lot of times it will allow you to\njust continue on through with that.\n\n630\n00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:11.890\nVery cool features.\n\n631\n00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.650\nNow we are going to have to\nmake another part to this, so\n\n632\n00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:16.940\nhopefully, we're gonna\nsee you guys on that one.\n\n633\n00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.220\nBut I can go ahead and\nthank you for watching this part.\n\n634\n00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.255\nHopefully we'll see you at the next one.\n\n635\n00:32:20.255 --> 00:32:22.297\nWe're going to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n636\n00:32:22.297 --> 00:32:23.817\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n637\n00:32:23.817 --> 00:32:24.840\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n638\n00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.584\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n639\n00:32:28.584 --> 00:32:32.800\n[NOISE]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.840\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.050\nHere with me, as always, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.870\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:21.850\n>> It is going great!\n\n7\n00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.202\nIt's another great day to be right here,\ntaking a look at Windows 10 devices,\n\n8\n00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:29.340\nspecifically taking a look at\nmobility configurations or\n\n9\n00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.403\noptions that we have available to us.\n\n10\n00:00:31.403 --> 00:00:37.310\nAnd in a previous episode we had began\nthe configuration of using Windows To Go.\n\n11\n00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.120\nAnd inside of Windows 10, and\nwe showed you the walkthrough.\n\n12\n00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.230\nIt really is just making sure that you\nhave all of those things in hand that you\n\n13\n00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.730\nneed to, and then allowing Windows 10\nto do the rest of that configuration.\n\n14\n00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.740\nNow, remember that when you do it,\nyou have to actually be very patient.\n\n15\n00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.630\nThe overall time that it took for\n\n16\n00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.880\nme to configure that Windows device,\nit actually did take a long time.\n\n17\n00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.700\nAnd part of that is because I used a\nlarger hard drive, so it has to format and\n\n18\n00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.730\ndo all that stuff, and\nthat takes a long time.\n\n19\n00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.060\nAnd then, it had to also,\nat that point, install Windows on it.\n\n20\n00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.620\nRemember that we don't just do it from\nthe ISO a base install of the image,\n\n21\n00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.690\na lot of times, what we do is we\nactually have created our own image, and\n\n22\n00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.190\nthen from that point we install that\nimage onto that Windows To Go device.\n\n23\n00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.180\nSo normally when you do this, I did forget\nto mention this in the last episode so\n\n24\n00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.970\nthis is also something else that we need,\nthat particular USB drive whether it's\n\n25\n00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.600\nsomething this small or whether it's\none of the little USB to go hard or\n\n26\n00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.420\nof one of the little USB hard drives\nhas to be a minimum of 32 gigs.\n\n27\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.970\nThe good thing is that\nthe wizard that's actually\n\n28\n00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.690\ninvolved in you creating that\nwill tell you, so if you try and\n\n29\n00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.190\nstick in a 16 gig drive it'll tell you,\nyeah this is not big enough.\n\n30\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.480\nSo it requires at least 32 gigs for\nyou to do that.\n\n31\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.920\nSo by me increasing it to 500 gigs or\n\n32\n00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.740\nto a terabyte, it took much longer\ntime before everything got installed.\n\n33\n00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.330\nSo normally it can take anywhere\nbetween 15 to 20 minutes.\n\n34\n00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.390\nMine took around an hour to actually\nget installed and ready to go.\n\n35\n00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.810\nNow, once that's actually all done,\n\n36\n00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.440\nremember that at that point it's gonna ask\nwhether you wanna reboot immediately or\n\n37\n00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.430\nwhether you're gonna take that machine and\nreboot somewhere else.\n\n38\n00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.070\nThe great thing about it,\n\n39\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.100\nis because it is Windows To Go it really\nonly matters that it meets those MIM\n\n40\n00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.400\nhardware requirements that we\ntalked about in a previous episode.\n\n41\n00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.120\nAnd once that requirement is met,\n\n42\n00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.780\nthen it doesn't matter what machine\nyou bring that Windows To Go drive on.\n\n43\n00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.440\nSo I created inside of a VMware Fusion VM.\n\n44\n00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.950\nSo that's what I did.\n\n45\n00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.900\nAnd that VMware Fusion means it's\nalso running on top of a MacBook.\n\n46\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.760\nAnd now what I've done is\nI've switched computers.\n\n47\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.230\nSo I'm now actually on a Dell XPS12, so\n\n48\n00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.690\nthe hardware configuration\nis totally different.\n\n49\n00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.020\nIt is night and\n\n50\n00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.330\nday, I'm running on a Windows based\nmachine versus the Mac computer.\n\n51\n00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.560\nSo I created that Windows 10\nimage on the Mac computer, and so\n\n52\n00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.020\nin theory you would kind of think like,\n\n53\n00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.250\nhey that image is probably not gonna\nwork if you try and bring it on over.\n\n54\n00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.180\nBut it worked perfectly fine.\n\n55\n00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.600\nWhen you first do this,\nwhen you plug that into the computer,\n\n56\n00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.210\nyou've got to make sure that\nboots up to the USB device first.\n\n57\n00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.000\nNow, when it does that you're gonna\nprobably see it's gonna reboot a couple\n\n58\n00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.140\nof times, if not three or\nfour times to try and\n\n59\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.430\nmake sure it actually\nrecognize the hardware.\n\n60\n00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.780\nOnce it does that,\nthen you're ready to go.\n\n61\n00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.320\nNow, there's actually something that's\na little bit kinda funny about what\n\n62\n00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.270\ncan happen here.\n\n63\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.350\nSo let me show you a couple of\nconfigurations you can make sure that you\n\n64\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.980\npay attention to when\nsomething like this happens.\n\n65\n00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.310\nSo I went ahead and here I am inside\nof just a base install of Windows 10.\n\n66\n00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.852\nIt's got a couple of\nfeatures running on it, but\n\n67\n00:03:35.852 --> 00:03:38.090\nover all though is pretty much that way.\n\n68\n00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.060\nNow, if I go ahead and\nclick on the Search the Web in Windows and\n\n69\n00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.740\nI type in Windows To Go.\n\n70\n00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.540\nAnd on this particular machine\nthe only thing I have is where it says\n\n71\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.110\nChange Windows To Go startup options.\n\n72\n00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.130\nOn the other machine, I had the ability\nto configure a Windows To Go drive.\n\n73\n00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.820\nBut on this one I only get this option and\n\n74\n00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.640\nthis is gonna be very important\nif I am running Windows 10.\n\n75\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.490\nBecause, it says,\n\n76\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.700\ndo you want to automatically boot your\nPC from a Windows To Go workspace?\n\n77\n00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.575\nSo this PC can run Windows To Go using 64\nbit addition of windows and I can either\n\n78\n00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:15.585\nsay yes or no, so it might be that\nthis computer is not ready for it yet,\n\n79\n00:04:15.585 --> 00:04:20.352\nso you have to go in and you might have\nto make sure that USB boot is enabled.\n\n80\n00:04:20.352 --> 00:04:23.152\nYou make sure that that's actually\nenabled inside of the Bios and\n\n81\n00:04:23.152 --> 00:04:27.072\nonce everything is, then you're perfectly\nfine and you're also ready to go, as well.\n\n82\n00:04:27.072 --> 00:04:30.052\nBut you do wanna be careful if you're\nactually do this all the time.\n\n83\n00:04:30.052 --> 00:04:33.608\nIf you know that this computers only\ngonna be running from that Windows To Go,\n\n84\n00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:37.127\nthen yes some of these drives can harm\nyour computer so you wanna be careful.\n\n85\n00:04:37.127 --> 00:04:40.760\nNow, in theory, that shouldn't happen.\n\n86\n00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.781\nWith Windows To Go,\nif everything is legitimate, what should\n\n87\n00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:47.547\nhappen is that that Windows To Go drive\nisolates the hardware that you're on.\n\n88\n00:04:47.547 --> 00:04:52.620\nIn other words, the hard drive is not\naccessible from your Windows To Go drive.\n\n89\n00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.760\nSo in theory,\nsomebody couldn't just launch that up and\n\n90\n00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.070\nthen use that to jump over to get access\nto the hard drive on your hardware.\n\n91\n00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.360\nIt should be isolated\nwhere its not gonna do it.\n\n92\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.370\nThe other neat feature here Daniel,\nis something I find incredibly neat here.\n\n93\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.805\nWith Windows To Go, because its\nactually plugged into a USB port,\n\n94\n00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:14.180\nthere's a chance somebody fumble like me,\nsome are going,\n\n95\n00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.040\noh I forgot what that drive was for\nand just unplug it.\n\n96\n00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.640\nWell, if I'm in the middle of working and\nnow I've pretty much pulled my hard drive\n\n97\n00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.350\noff that computer, well you would think\nthat that machine would die right then.\n\n98\n00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.440\nWindows To Go has actually given\nyou a little bit of a grace period.\n\n99\n00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.120\nSo normally it can actually survive\nup to about a minute's time\n\n100\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.880\nbefore it actually recognizes\nthat that drive is gone.\n\n101\n00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.940\nSo it can't even protect you from that,\nas well, until all of a sudden it says,\n\n102\n00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.430\nhey, you need to insert this or\neverything's gonna come crashing down.\n\n103\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.220\nSo it really does isolate all of the\nhardware that's actually on your computer,\n\n104\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.820\njust using really the CPU and\neverything else but the hard drive.\n\n105\n00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.470\nSo it should protect your hard drive,\nas well.\n\n106\n00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.460\nSo now that I actually have my drive and\nI need to reboot the computer,\n\n107\n00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.910\nremember that what I need to do is\nactually go ahead and boot up from USB and\n\n108\n00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.230\nmake sure that that works here.\n\n109\n00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.760\nI just wanna show you that if you're\ngonna be doing that all the time,\n\n110\n00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.520\nhere's the setting that you need to do.\n\n111\n00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.010\nBut if this is gonna be the only talk, so\nDaniel's coming to your place and he says,\n\n112\n00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.980\nI need to actually boot up, do you mind\nif I use my Windows To Go machine,\n\n113\n00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.170\nI may not choose to do this all the time,\nso\n\n114\n00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.370\nI'm probably actually not gonna set\nthat up, so I'm just gonna click Cancel.\n\n115\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.010\nAnd now, when I reboot my machine,\nI need to select my boot options.\n\n116\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.290\nOn this particular machine it's\nactually gonna be the F12 key, so\n\n117\n00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.710\nlet me go ahead and\nreboot this machine here.\n\n118\n00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.450\nSo like always, Daniel,\nyou know how slow I am.\n\n119\n00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.110\nSo there is a chance that\nI am going to miss this.\n\n120\n00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.147\nOf all the people that can miss it,\n\n121\n00:06:40.147 --> 00:06:44.150\nI am probably 80% sure that I'm\ngonna miss this restart here.\n\n122\n00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.877\n>> Yeah.\n80% accurately will miss the opportunity\n\n123\n00:06:46.877 --> 00:06:47.977\nto make this happen.\n\n124\n00:06:47.977 --> 00:06:49.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is without fail [LAUGH]\n\n125\n00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.600\n>> Yeah, as soon as I see the Dell logo,\n\n126\n00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.820\nI should begin to, and I'm not seeing it.\n\n127\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.910\nSo it actually does look\na little bit stuck there.\n\n128\n00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.319\n>> Ronnie lives in a delayed reality.\n\n129\n00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:59.680\n>> I do.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n130\n00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.500\n>> So here in a moment-\n\n131\n00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.680\n>> You have to anticipate the F12.\n\n132\n00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.400\n>> Yeah, I did.\n\n133\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.370\nLet's see what happened there.\n\n134\n00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.790\nSo here, in a moment,\nit should kinda boot up.\n\n135\n00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.260\nAnd let's see where it goes.\n\n136\n00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.310\nAnd, of course, I think I missed it.\n\n137\n00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.700\nYep, apparently, I missed it.\n\n138\n00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.790\nLet's see if I actually missed it.\n\n139\n00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:17.840\nYep, I sure did.\n\n140\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.720\nSo it's just like I said.\n\n141\n00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.985\nSo this time, what I'm gonna do instead,\nis, I'm just gonna shut the computer down.\n\n142\n00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:24.910\nCuz I can normally get it from there.\n\n143\n00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.780\nI've been a little bit luckier than that.\n\n144\n00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.220\nAnd I mean, if you're fast at\ndoing this great, for one reason,\n\n145\n00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.760\nthere apparently is some delayed\nreaction between the nerve in my eye and\n\n146\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.850\nwhat my brain and\nthen my fingers actually say.\n\n147\n00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.490\nI'm verifying that the laptop\nis actually off now.\n\n148\n00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.040\nAnd now, I'm gonna turn it back on.\n\n149\n00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.930\nAnd then, I'm looking for\nthat BIOS display here.\n\n150\n00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.550\nAnd it looks like I missed it again.\n\n151\n00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.980\nI don't know how I did that.\n\n152\n00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.840\nThat is incredible.\n\n153\n00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.780\n>> You are a phenom, Ron.\n\n154\n00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.216\n>> I am phenomenal at doing this.\n\n155\n00:07:52.216 --> 00:07:53.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is amazing.\n\n156\n00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.602\nNow, one more here, and third time it\ndoesn't happen I'm gonna give it up,\n\n157\n00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:00.838\nI'm gonna let Daniel do this,\nis what's gonna end up happening.\n\n158\n00:08:00.838 --> 00:08:02.750\nBut I shouldn't be missing this.\n\n159\n00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.569\nIt should be fairly easy So there it is.\n\n160\n00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:05.508\nIt's completely off.\n\n161\n00:08:05.508 --> 00:08:06.860\nI don't see any lights.\n\n162\n00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.770\nI know, it's so embarrassing,\nbecause, well, one, it's me.\n\n163\n00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.431\nNow that time-\n>> Now Ronnie's talking about it, and\n\n164\n00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:17.645\nI think he might have got it that time.\n\n165\n00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:19.140\nNo?\n>> I still didn't get it.\n\n166\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.950\n>> That's a quick one.\n\n167\n00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.220\n>> This is incredibly fast, and\nthat's what happens sometimes.\n\n168\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.240\nOn these newer drives that boot up to USB,\nit's very difficult, not USB.\n\n169\n00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.340\nTo the solid state drives,\n\n170\n00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.650\nvery difficult to catch at times here but\nthis one should not.\n\n171\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.750\nI've practiced this a couple of times just\nwant to make sure its actually in there\n\n172\n00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.030\nand that I am ready to go now.\n\n173\n00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.420\nAll right so\nI'm just going to start pressing it now.\n\n174\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.800\n>> Yeah quickly.\n\n175\n00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.900\n>> There it goes I finally got it and\n\n176\n00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:51.260\nI mean it was really like a millisecond I\nmean that was amazing, so now here we are.\n\n177\n00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.415\nOn my screen if we can take a look at it.\n\n178\n00:08:53.415 --> 00:08:57.570\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Oh, are you joking?\n\n179\n00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.070\nAll right, let me see.\n\n180\n00:09:01.064 --> 00:09:03.485\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yes.\n\n181\n00:09:05.165 --> 00:09:06.425\nLet's see if it actually comes up now.\n\n182\n00:09:06.425 --> 00:09:07.113\nIs it not gonna come up?\n\n183\n00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:09.553\n>> Probably not.\n\n184\n00:09:09.553 --> 00:09:11.105\n>> Nothing.\n\n185\n00:09:11.105 --> 00:09:12.505\n>> Nothing.\n>> Of course.\n\n186\n00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:14.235\nWhy would it?\n\n187\n00:09:14.235 --> 00:09:20.039\nSo I'll just have to talk about it at this\npoint Yeah, just come to me full screen.\n\n188\n00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:24.345\nWin some, lose some.\n\n189\n00:09:24.345 --> 00:09:28.010\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Oh, yeah, that's fine.\n\n190\n00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.355\n>> Yeah.\nAll right so my computer is now-\n\n191\n00:09:30.355 --> 00:09:32.180\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n192\n00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.735\n>> Oh sorry, okay.\n\n193\n00:09:33.735 --> 00:09:36.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can say that all you want.\n\n194\n00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:43.380\nMy computer's now booted up, and I finally\ndid catch that screen that I needed to,\n\n195\n00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.230\nand so, now what I'm actually seeing is\nthe boot options and the boot manager.\n\n196\n00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.380\nNow, you're not able to see it.\n\n197\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.560\nWe've got a limitation, for whatever\nreasons this XPS is not showing that.\n\n198\n00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.750\nBut what I'm looking for\nis actually an entry here.\n\n199\n00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.220\nIt says, USB entry for Windows To Go and\nit's telling me the name of that drive.\n\n200\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.360\nSo I either have\nthe Windows Boot Manager or I have that.\n\n201\n00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.450\nSo I'm gonna select that entry for\nUSB To Go.\n\n202\n00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.070\nAnd then it's simply going to\nboot from that point on, and\n\n203\n00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:12.540\nthat should catch it where it actually\nlaunches me into the Windows To Go drive.\n\n204\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.570\nNow remember that if this is the first\ntime doing it, it's gonna take a little\n\n205\n00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:20.237\nbit of time setting up, it might\nactually do it a couple of times here.\n\n206\n00:10:20.237 --> 00:10:25.577\nBut then it has to update\ncritical files from Windows.\n\n207\n00:10:25.577 --> 00:10:26.842\nThat is what it's going to tell you.\n\n208\n00:10:26.842 --> 00:10:29.610\nIt's just making sure that it has\nall the drivers that it needs to.\n\n209\n00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.170\nMake sure it has all the updated and\nlatest files that it needs to as well, so\n\n210\n00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.830\nit can work the way that you\nactually need it to work.\n\n211\n00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.710\nSo once everything is done there\nthe problem that you have is that if you\n\n212\n00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:43.170\ndidn't set it to reboot from Windows to go\nall the time like we showed you in that\n\n213\n00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.430\nprevious configuration.\n\n214\n00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.430\nIt's gonna boot back into\nthe regular Windows and\n\n215\n00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.510\nwhen something like that happens you\nmay get a little bit confused, so\n\n216\n00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.900\nit may ask you to just take a moment,\nand that's what mine is doing.\n\n217\n00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.430\nIt's just taking a moment here.\n\n218\n00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:59.250\nAnd we're hopefully about to see\nthis right here where it is waiting.\n\n219\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.050\nAnd so once it says please restart.\n\n220\n00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.470\nThe key here is when I press this,\n\n221\n00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.540\nI shouldn't see the word user anymore cuz\nthat's actually my base operating system.\n\n222\n00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.180\nAnd I should see, here it is.\n\n223\n00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.626\nI am now inside and it says Ronnie.\n\n224\n00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:15.590\nAnd so, right now I am actually running\n\n225\n00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:21.150\noff that USB drive instead, and I am\nisolated away from all the other hardware.\n\n226\n00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:26.330\nSo I've taken a machine that I created on\na Mac book essentially and now I'm running\n\n227\n00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:30.800\nit inside of an XPS, it's not actually\nnot designed to run anything on Mac here.\n\n228\n00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.070\nIt's just taking a little bit of time\nbecause it's been a little bit of\n\n229\n00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.850\ntime since I logged in.\n\n230\n00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.790\nAnd we should see it actually come\nup,and then I'll show you the hardware\n\n231\n00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.280\nconfiguration background.\n\n232\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.280\nSo if I had an image in which I\nloaded up all the applications that I\n\n233\n00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.450\nwould normally run,\nit should run perfectly fine, right here.\n\n234\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.210\nWe should have all those things ready.\n\n235\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.070\nI am connected to the network, I believe.\n\n236\n00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.970\nWe'll see here in just a moment.\n\n237\n00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.160\nSo, we'll give it a little bit of\ntime once it actually boots up here.\n\n238\n00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.130\nAnd there we go,\nI'm connected to the wireless network.\n\n239\n00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.390\nAnd let's verify that.\n\n240\n00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:07.080\nLet me go ahead and, oops,\nI'm trying to click on The Edge here so\n\n241\n00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.090\nwe can connect out to\nthe internet somewhere.\n\n242\n00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.700\n>> As in the browser and\nnot on the edge of the screen.\n\n243\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.260\n>> As in the browser.\n\n244\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.350\nYes on the edge of the screen.\n\n245\n00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.400\nThat's true.\nYeah.\n\n246\n00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.090\nSo Microsoft's Edge browser here.\n\n247\n00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.730\nAnd so\nit does take a little bit of time right?\n\n248\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.500\nFor it to kind of get everything running.\n\n249\n00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.050\nSo you may find some sluggishness\nto it at the very beginning,\n\n250\n00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.820\nas everything is configuring\nup the way that we want it to.\n\n251\n00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.520\nAnd let me go to a website.\n\n252\n00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.880\nOf course, why would you actually\ndo what I want you to do instead?\n\n253\n00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:41.010\nSo now you actually see where it's\ntrying to update everything else and\n\n254\n00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.400\nI just have to be patient.\n\n255\n00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.124\nMy patience is wearing thin\nwith the Edge as well.\n\n256\n00:12:46.124 --> 00:12:51.390\nAll right so itpro.tv.\n\n257\n00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.680\nLet's see if we can get\nan actually get a search here.\n\n258\n00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.190\nLet's see if Bing returns\nthe right result.\n\n259\n00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.250\nThat would be the first.\n\n260\n00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:57.790\nOh look at that!\n\n261\n00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:58.580\n>> Hey!\n>> There it is!\n\n262\n00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.880\nHey!\nI shouldn't have knocked Bing.\n\n263\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.980\nWhat am I saying.\n\n264\n00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.390\nSo there it is.\nI am now connected.\n\n265\n00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.870\nAnd you might be wondering,\nhow do we know?\n\n266\n00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.170\nWell the one way that you can really tell,\nright?\n\n267\n00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.890\nIs to go into your file explorer and\non this hard drive\n\n268\n00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:17.870\nthat's actually on this XPS,\nit's the 256 GB solid state drive so\n\n269\n00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:25.060\nif I go to this PC I will notice\nthat I have about a 500 GB drive.\n\n270\n00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:30.380\nWell that's almost impossible, and\nI have a 256 gig solid state drive here.\n\n271\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.820\nSo now, we can actually take that\nmachine anywhere that we want to go.\n\n272\n00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.030\nNow, the other benefit behind this is that\nI can actually add in another USB drive\n\n273\n00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.320\nand it will recognize it\ninside of that machine.\n\n274\n00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.750\nSo let me do that as well.\n\n275\n00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:47.090\nAnd so even though I had another drive and\nI needed to load up some files,\n\n276\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.640\nlet me see if I have enough space.\n\n277\n00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.040\nI gotta say, this machine is about\nthe same size as mine, but It feels so\n\n278\n00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.515\nmuch more crunched in now.\n\n279\n00:13:53.515 --> 00:13:56.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That I'm taking a look here.\n\n280\n00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.250\nSo, we can get access.\n\n281\n00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.930\nAnd it's asking me for\nvirus protection, of course.\n\n282\n00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.720\nAnd let's see,\nthat should have recognized here.\n\n283\n00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.760\nAnd there it is.\n\n284\n00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.440\nThere is my folder with the ISOs on it, so\n\n285\n00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:14.130\nif I had my own personal files, I could\nalso offload them to another USB key.\n\n286\n00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.690\nSo even if I had my access to my\napplications and everything else on there.\n\n287\n00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.300\nI wanted to save everything over here.\n\n288\n00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.020\nWe could do it perfectly fine.\n\n289\n00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.570\nAnd that way,\nI'm just carrying on two USB keys.\n\n290\n00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.940\nAs long as I'm willing to deal with\nwhatever the hardware limitations\n\n291\n00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.020\nare on that end.\n\n292\n00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.340\nIf it can run Windows To Go,\nit's a great feature to have.\n\n293\n00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.250\nYou're no longer tied to\none particular device.\n\n294\n00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.020\nIf that laptop fails,\n\n295\n00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.290\nI can actually take this, as long as\nI have those minimum requirements.\n\n296\n00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.640\nWe can boot right up.\n\n297\n00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.590\nAnd now you have your\nfull operating system.\n\n298\n00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.870\nIt is a nifty feature, to say the least.\n\n299\n00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.680\n>> Yeah.\nIt is a really cool proof of concept that\n\n300\n00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.690\nwe just saw.\n\n301\n00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:53.610\nRonnie built an entire operating system in\na virtual machine on a Mac Book and then\n\n302\n00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:57.940\nbuilt the Windows To Go on top of that,\nplugged it in to a Dell XPS and he's right\n\n303\n00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:02.050\nback just like if he was sitting at his\nown computer working with that same VM.\n\n304\n00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.570\nAnd there is no difference as far as\nhis end-user experience is concerned.\n\n305\n00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.260\nHe can then plug-in extra drives, and\n\n306\n00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.340\nstart acting just like it\nwas any other computer.\n\n307\n00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.660\nNow again, like he said,\nyou might be limited as far as what\n\n308\n00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.690\nthe actual computer you're running this\nthing on has, as far as performance goes.\n\n309\n00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.360\nSo, maybe Ronnie's machine\nis top of the line.\n\n310\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.375\nAnd actually, it is.\n\n311\n00:15:23.375 --> 00:15:25.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He has a very very nice MacBook.\n\n312\n00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.890\nAnd this XPS probably isn't as\nrobust as that MacBook may be.\n\n313\n00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.260\nBut it gives him the opportunity to be\nable to go wherever he needs to go, and\n\n314\n00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.780\nnot have to lug a computer around.\n\n315\n00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.520\n>> Right.\n>> All he needs is that USB key.\n\n316\n00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.410\nGo in there, have some access,\nsomeone give him permission,\n\n317\n00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:45.290\nplug that joker right in, and gain access\nto his actual desktop environment.\n\n318\n00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.620\nAnd he's just like he's sitting at home or\n\n319\n00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.080\ndoing whatever,\nmaybe a work PC something like that.\n\n320\n00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.240\nThis is neat stuff.\n\n321\n00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.250\nI really enjoy this.\n\n322\n00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.820\n>> Yeah, this is kinda one of those\nfeatures that really does suit the life\n\n323\n00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.720\nand mobility that we have in\ntoday's business world, right?\n\n324\n00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.820\nThe very fact is we do\nneed to be more nimble.\n\n325\n00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.773\nAnd so even though laptops are getting\nlighter and thinner and stuff,\n\n326\n00:16:05.773 --> 00:16:08.993\nit's still an extra device\nthat you have to carry along.\n\n327\n00:16:08.993 --> 00:16:12.061\n>> And that means you also have to\nprotect that device as well and\n\n328\n00:16:12.061 --> 00:16:15.561\nsometimes you're fairly good at doing it,\nsometimes you aren't.\n\n329\n00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:20.490\nDan and I actually have a friend, he ended\nup with a MacBook that was like two weeks\n\n330\n00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.188\nold and\nhe dropped it into a puddle of water.\n\n331\n00:16:23.188 --> 00:16:28.172\nYou can imagine that sinking feelings you\nhave whereas if you'd just had that USB\n\n332\n00:16:28.172 --> 00:16:32.360\nthumb drive, you probably wouldn't\nhave actually felt that bad.\n\n333\n00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.336\nBut having something like that\nis actually kind of a real great\n\n334\n00:16:36.336 --> 00:16:40.770\nmobility feature that you can't\nimagine how much that frees you up,\n\n335\n00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.608\nwhen you can just stick your\nown computer into your pocket.\n\n336\n00:16:44.608 --> 00:16:48.710\nAnd go to just about any machine\nthat will boot up with USB today and\n\n337\n00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.738\nprobably be able to run Windows 10 and\nget all your work done and\n\n338\n00:16:52.738 --> 00:16:54.847\nit is an amazing feature for you.\n\n339\n00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:58.203\nAnd remember, along with that is that\nkind of safety feature that you have.\n\n340\n00:16:58.203 --> 00:17:02.046\nSomebody comes along and simply unplugs\nit, you still have up to a minute.\n\n341\n00:17:02.046 --> 00:17:04.100\nNow if they run off with it,\nwell, you're kind of toast.\n\n342\n00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.479\nBut overall though, if somebody just\naccidentally unplugs it, it's no big deal.\n\n343\n00:17:07.479 --> 00:17:10.786\nYou just plug the thing back in and\nyou are actually ready to go.\n\n344\n00:17:10.786 --> 00:17:15.418\nIt really does save so much extra cost for\na company, but it really can help\n\n345\n00:17:15.418 --> 00:17:19.843\nyou out especially if you just need\nto have a computer wherever you go.\n\n346\n00:17:19.843 --> 00:17:23.996\nYou don't have access to your laptop,\njust stick that in your bag at some point,\n\n347\n00:17:23.996 --> 00:17:25.659\nyou can actually be ready to go.\n\n348\n00:17:25.659 --> 00:17:31.230\nAnd along with that, Daniel is of course,\nsomething else we need to talk about too,\n\n349\n00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.004\nwhich what if we wanna talk\nabout syncing up devices too.\n\n350\n00:17:35.004 --> 00:17:40.116\nSo let's say you're running Windows\n10 at home on your own computer and\n\n351\n00:17:40.116 --> 00:17:44.745\nyou also have a USB to go,\nas well that you're taking with you too.\n\n352\n00:17:44.745 --> 00:17:49.425\nWell, if I have files on my home drive and\nmy USB drive as well or\n\n353\n00:17:49.425 --> 00:17:51.780\na USB to go, what else can I do?\n\n354\n00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.686\nWell, you can actually sync files\nbetween them, because you and\n\n355\n00:17:55.686 --> 00:17:59.675\nI have access to what we call,\nof course, the Microsoft account.\n\n356\n00:17:59.675 --> 00:18:03.064\nIt's what we are talking, I know,\ngo figure, oh, Microsoft account.\n\n357\n00:18:03.064 --> 00:18:04.017\nThat's right, it's fancy.\n\n358\n00:18:04.017 --> 00:18:05.885\nIt's free,\nit's whatever you want it to be.\n\n359\n00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:10.795\nBut it really does help, because it\nhelps you to sync up differences that\n\n360\n00:18:10.795 --> 00:18:12.735\nyou have through the cloud.\n\n361\n00:18:12.735 --> 00:18:17.105\nAnd that way, between your home computer\nand maybe even your USB to go drive,\n\n362\n00:18:17.105 --> 00:18:20.669\nthat you can actually allow some\nof that sinking to happen, and\n\n363\n00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:22.499\nallow all that stuff to come in.\n\n364\n00:18:22.499 --> 00:18:25.845\nSo of course, if you're talking\nabout needing to actually sync up,\n\n365\n00:18:25.845 --> 00:18:28.790\nthings like themes and\nweb browser settings, passwords and\n\n366\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.389\nlanguage preferences, ease of access\nsettings, whatever it might be.\n\n367\n00:18:32.389 --> 00:18:34.597\nYou're like wow, yeah,\nthere's a whole list of stuff and\n\n368\n00:18:34.597 --> 00:18:37.522\nthat's why I had to look, cuz I wanted\nto make sure I didn't miss any of those.\n\n369\n00:18:37.522 --> 00:18:41.292\nSo once you have all of that configured,\nthe only thing you really need is to make\n\n370\n00:18:41.292 --> 00:18:44.753\nsure that you have a Microsoft account and\nall of that stuff is synced up.\n\n371\n00:18:44.753 --> 00:18:47.528\nNow in my Microsoft account,\nI don't know if I have anything synced up.\n\n372\n00:18:47.528 --> 00:18:51.708\nBut since I'm still on this USB to go and\nwe are connected up to the internet, well,\n\n373\n00:18:51.708 --> 00:18:53.286\nlet's see what we can do here.\n\n374\n00:18:53.286 --> 00:18:57.313\nSo I'm going to right-click,\nactually I don't even need to do that.\n\n375\n00:18:57.313 --> 00:19:00.286\nI'm just going to click\non the Windows button.\n\n376\n00:19:00.286 --> 00:19:04.165\nFrom that point,\nI'm gonna go to Settings and\n\n377\n00:19:04.165 --> 00:19:08.652\ninside of Settings,\nwe are gonna look for Accounts.\n\n378\n00:19:08.652 --> 00:19:11.753\nAnd you can see that it says,\nhey, there it is.\n\n379\n00:19:11.753 --> 00:19:14.168\nAccount administrator saying,\nhey, look you didn't activate it.\n\n380\n00:19:14.168 --> 00:19:17.079\nWell, I don't have that\nactivation right now,\n\n381\n00:19:17.079 --> 00:19:19.427\nbecause I just put this on the USB to go.\n\n382\n00:19:19.427 --> 00:19:21.596\nBut notice I can go ahead and\n\n383\n00:19:21.596 --> 00:19:26.892\nsign in with a Microsoft account\ninstead and get the options here.\n\n384\n00:19:26.892 --> 00:19:30.130\nAnd it might not allow me to,\nsince I'm actually on an unactivated one.\n\n385\n00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:36.995\nSo I'm gonna enter in\nthe account that I've made for\n\n386\n00:19:36.995 --> 00:19:40.904\nthis class here and Hotmail.\n\n387\n00:19:40.904 --> 00:19:46.052\nAnd of course, my super secret password,\nif I can remember it and\n\n388\n00:19:46.052 --> 00:19:49.809\nI can't type in my own\n[LAUGH] passwords either.\n\n389\n00:19:49.809 --> 00:19:52.873\nLet's see if she lets me sign in.\n\n390\n00:19:54.987 --> 00:19:57.053\nSo now it's actually saying,\nhey, are you sure?\n\n391\n00:19:57.053 --> 00:19:59.792\nSo now, it's actually switching\nit over from the local account.\n\n392\n00:19:59.792 --> 00:20:03.854\nIt's saying, hey, the local account is\nsaying, you need to actually type this in\n\n393\n00:20:03.854 --> 00:20:06.886\none more time and now the Microsoft\naccount is now syncing up.\n\n394\n00:20:06.886 --> 00:20:10.346\nAnd so we should see some of\nthe stuff that can come over.\n\n395\n00:20:10.346 --> 00:20:11.978\nNow if it's because the activation,\n\n396\n00:20:11.978 --> 00:20:14.687\nwell that's the reason why we\nare not getting it access there.\n\n397\n00:20:14.687 --> 00:20:17.604\nAnd now it's asking me if I want\nto go ahead and setup a PIN, so\n\n398\n00:20:17.604 --> 00:20:21.166\nI can sign-in a little bit faster and\nI'm just gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n399\n00:20:21.166 --> 00:20:26.380\nSetup a new PIN and\n\n400\n00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.513\nclick OK.\n\n401\n00:20:29.513 --> 00:20:33.612\nNow remember with a PIN, it doesn't\nmatter if you actually know it or not,\n\n402\n00:20:33.612 --> 00:20:37.090\ncuz you don't have access\nto this particular machine.\n\n403\n00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:41.498\nSo even if you knew it,\nyou'd have to get access to this machine,\n\n404\n00:20:41.498 --> 00:20:45.121\ntype in my account and\nalso type in the same password.\n\n405\n00:20:45.121 --> 00:20:47.646\nSo that the chance of those\nthree combinations happening,\n\n406\n00:20:47.646 --> 00:20:50.825\nI'm not saying you can't, I think\nTom Cruise can in Mission Impossible,\n\n407\n00:20:50.825 --> 00:20:52.760\nI think he actually did\nsomething like that.\n\n408\n00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.773\nBut overall though,\n\n409\n00:20:53.773 --> 00:20:56.765\nmost of us are probably not gonna\nbe able to do that very easily.\n\n410\n00:20:56.765 --> 00:20:58.379\nSo, it's actually setting all that up.\n\n411\n00:20:58.379 --> 00:21:03.173\nAnd once everything gets setup here, what\nshould end up happening is that anything\n\n412\n00:21:03.173 --> 00:21:07.214\nthat I've actually configured\npreviously in my Microsoft account,\n\n413\n00:21:07.214 --> 00:21:11.405\nall the stuff will also start transferring\nover to this machine as well.\n\n414\n00:21:11.405 --> 00:21:13.593\nAs long as I'm signed in\nwith that Microsoft account,\n\n415\n00:21:13.593 --> 00:21:15.410\nthat's what should end up happening there.\n\n416\n00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:19.171\nSo it looks like it's just taking a little\nbit of time getting that pin number setup.\n\n417\n00:21:19.171 --> 00:21:21.784\nAnd now you can see where, there it is.\n\n418\n00:21:21.784 --> 00:21:25.132\nThere's the user name that I created\nto make it a little bit easier,\n\n419\n00:21:25.132 --> 00:21:26.149\nronald@itprotv.\n\n420\n00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:31.195\nI am now signed in with my Microsoft\naccount and it's probably because\n\n421\n00:21:31.195 --> 00:21:36.168\nof those other settings where\nthe activation is not coming through.\n\n422\n00:21:36.168 --> 00:21:39.163\nSo at this point,\nI now have access to my Microsoft account.\n\n423\n00:21:39.163 --> 00:21:41.585\nAnd if I have access to one\ndrive in all that stuff,\n\n424\n00:21:41.585 --> 00:21:43.606\nall that would actually be configured and\n\n425\n00:21:43.606 --> 00:21:47.371\nI could get access to all those files\nright there, which I don't have setup.\n\n426\n00:21:47.371 --> 00:21:52.139\nBut it now allows me with a very easy\nsetting to actually make this look like my\n\n427\n00:21:52.139 --> 00:21:57.447\nhome computer or even my work computer, if\nthey allow me to use Microsoft accounts.\n\n428\n00:21:57.447 --> 00:21:59.212\nThere it goes, look at that.\n\n429\n00:21:59.212 --> 00:22:01.848\nIt went ahead and it configured it and\nthat is what I changed,\n\n430\n00:22:01.848 --> 00:22:03.567\nwhich was the theme in the background.\n\n431\n00:22:03.567 --> 00:22:07.193\nIt took a little bit of time, but I didn't\nactually do anything else to it and\n\n432\n00:22:07.193 --> 00:22:07.826\nthere it is.\n\n433\n00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:12.060\nThose are the settings that are there and\nlet's see if I actually have any files\n\n434\n00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.770\nthat are inside of my documents folder,\nnot yet.\n\n435\n00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.229\nSo if I had any, it's probably gonna take\na bit of time before it all syncs up.\n\n436\n00:22:18.229 --> 00:22:21.673\nBut it's probably gonna come over\nafter a period of time, if there's,\n\n437\n00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:25.067\nI don't think there was anything on\none of my other computers in there.\n\n438\n00:22:25.067 --> 00:22:27.412\nBut I had desktop icons,\nit would happen as well.\n\n439\n00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:30.160\nIf I had configured any of\nthose ease of access settings,\n\n440\n00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.260\nall that would be available\nright here on this drive.\n\n441\n00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.207\nSo being able to run a USB and\n\n442\n00:22:35.207 --> 00:22:40.138\nhave it really look like my computer\nat home, it's awesome I think.\n\n443\n00:22:40.138 --> 00:22:43.147\n>> Yeah, I totally like this feature,\nbecause then I can go home,\n\n444\n00:22:43.147 --> 00:22:45.711\nlog in use my Microsoft account,\nhave all the bells and\n\n445\n00:22:45.711 --> 00:22:48.693\nwhistles that I like in the way I\nlike it and then I can go to work.\n\n446\n00:22:48.693 --> 00:22:51.594\nIf I need to make some changes\nto my Microsoft account,\n\n447\n00:22:51.594 --> 00:22:54.881\nI can log in the computer there\nusing that Microsoft account.\n\n448\n00:22:54.881 --> 00:22:58.040\nMake those changes that I need to make and\nit's like I was sitting at home.\n\n449\n00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.016\nI don't have to do any remote desktopping,\nthere's no weird things that you have to,\n\n450\n00:23:02.016 --> 00:23:03.438\nsetting here settings there.\n\n451\n00:23:03.438 --> 00:23:06.712\nCouple of sync options and\nthat's about it, you're off to the races.\n\n452\n00:23:06.712 --> 00:23:09.638\nEverything else is just kind of\npipes itself over the Internet.\n\n453\n00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:13.103\nOnce it sees that I've logged into\na device using that Microsoft account,\n\n454\n00:23:13.103 --> 00:23:15.917\nit's gonna start doing things\nlike changing my wallpaper.\n\n455\n00:23:15.917 --> 00:23:19.767\nChanging my fonts and a couple other\nsink items, that may be I've enabled or\n\n456\n00:23:19.767 --> 00:23:20.376\ndisabled.\n\n457\n00:23:20.376 --> 00:23:23.372\nGet it the way just how I like it and\nI'm good to go.\n\n458\n00:23:23.372 --> 00:23:28.061\nI really like the fact that they're\npushing for people to go to this.\n\n459\n00:23:28.061 --> 00:23:30.800\nIt's kind of a cloud-based\nenvironment to be honest with you.\n\n460\n00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.543\nWhere you are logging in to\nthe internet as you instead of, well,\n\n461\n00:23:34.543 --> 00:23:38.082\nI've got my home network and\nI've got my business network and\n\n462\n00:23:38.082 --> 00:23:42.051\nnever between shall meet unless I hook\nup a VPN and do this and do that.\n\n463\n00:23:42.051 --> 00:23:43.758\nNo, just sign in with one account.\n\n464\n00:23:43.758 --> 00:23:47.576\nMakes it really easy and those sync\noptions, I can set those the way I like.\n\n465\n00:23:47.576 --> 00:23:51.480\n>> And it is amazing that way that the\nworld is going and yes, with Windows 10,\n\n466\n00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.364\nif your environment is actually setup for\nyou to do that,\n\n467\n00:23:54.364 --> 00:23:56.969\nthat is really part of what\nyou want to be able to do.\n\n468\n00:23:56.969 --> 00:23:59.593\nIt does make it a lot easier for\nat least the home user.\n\n469\n00:23:59.593 --> 00:24:03.320\nRemember that businesses are probably\nnot going to be as on the cutting edge\n\n470\n00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.863\nI should say,\non that bleeding edge of saying yes,\n\n471\n00:24:05.863 --> 00:24:09.788\nlet's jump to these Microsoft accounts,\nbecause that's what we wanna use.\n\n472\n00:24:09.788 --> 00:24:11.683\nEverybody has their security features,\n\n473\n00:24:11.683 --> 00:24:14.180\nthey have again Figure out\nhow they're gonna do that.\n\n474\n00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.854\nAnd at some point,\nthey may actually do it.\n\n475\n00:24:15.854 --> 00:24:19.866\nBut if you don't, Windows 10 will still\nwork with you in getting all that stuff\n\n476\n00:24:19.866 --> 00:24:22.320\nset up the way that you need to, as well.\n\n477\n00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.020\nSo you do have a lot of options available,\nand we just kinda showed you some of them.\n\n478\n00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.190\nThat Windows To Go is, by far,\n\n479\n00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.900\none of the neater technologies\nthat we have available.\n\n480\n00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.800\nNow, the other features that we\nalso need to take a look at here\n\n481\n00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.790\nis what we call Wi-Fi Direct.\n\n482\n00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.770\nNow, the problem with Wi-Fi Direct is,\nI hate to say it,\n\n483\n00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.660\nit's not really ready for\nprime time in Windows 10.\n\n484\n00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:48.490\nIt is one of those features that is\nprobably coming in the near future and\n\n485\n00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:52.250\nit is built-in but\nthere are some things and Daniel and I,\n\n486\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.880\nwe were talking about this\nright before the break.\n\n487\n00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:00.920\nOn my own phone, I can actually\ngo to the Wi-Fi settings and\n\n488\n00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.940\nI can click on the menu and drop down and\nit actually says Wi-Fi Direct.\n\n489\n00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:05.820\nAnd when I push that,\n\n490\n00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.580\nit will show me all the other devices\nthat are running Wi-Fi Direct.\n\n491\n00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.040\nAnd what does Wi-Fi Direct do?\n\n492\n00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.780\nIt allows me to make a point-to-point\nconnection between like my phone and\n\n493\n00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.710\nthe other devices that it can find.\n\n494\n00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:20.180\nAnd when I make that connection,\nyou might be wondering,\n\n495\n00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.035\nwhy do I need to do something like that?\n\n496\n00:25:22.035 --> 00:25:26.520\nWel, the whole goal behind it is to\nessentially get rid of the access point\n\n497\n00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.540\nin between those devices.\n\n498\n00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.220\nSo even though we might be\non the same Wi-Fi network,\n\n499\n00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:36.170\nby doing Wi-Fi Direct,\nI am replacing an ad hoc infrastructure.\n\n500\n00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.260\nI'm saying,\nwe're not just doing an ad hoc, here.\n\n501\n00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:42.870\nWe're actually making, just,\nthat one point-to-point connection and\n\n502\n00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.910\nthe reason is fast file transfer.\n\n503\n00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.430\nThat's really the whole goal.\n\n504\n00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:49.225\nIf you like streaming,\nif you like doing stuff like that,\n\n505\n00:25:49.225 --> 00:25:54.310\nWi-Fi Direct is the way to\ngo because you can transfer\n\n506\n00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:59.910\nfive megabytes a second, and\neven more if you need to, very quickly.\n\n507\n00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:02.080\nYou might be able to do that\nover something like Bluetooth,\n\n508\n00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.320\nthough it is very possible but\na lot of times,\n\n509\n00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.118\neven with Bluetooth,\nit can slow down, it can do that.\n\n510\n00:26:07.118 --> 00:26:09.910\nWhereas, with Wi-Fi Direct it's\na much faster connection for\n\n511\n00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:11.410\nus to be able to do that.\n\n512\n00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.110\nNow, you might be wondering, okay,\nso what does support Wi-Fi Direct?\n\n513\n00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:20.500\nWell, it's built into the networking\nprotocol, inside of Windows itself.\n\n514\n00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:26.050\nSo in other words, if you have\n\n515\n00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:30.870\na wireless adapter on your laptop,\nif you're running Windows 10, Windows 8,\n\n516\n00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:36.120\nif you're running that, more than likely\nit does support Wi-Fi Direct, okay?\n\n517\n00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.750\nSo usually you don't really have\nto do much for that to happen.\n\n518\n00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.140\nOn the other end whatever other\ndevices are actually doing that,\n\n519\n00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:44.960\nthey're built into it.\n\n520\n00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.993\nSo hardware devices like Roku's and\ndifferent ones that are out there.\n\n521\n00:26:47.993 --> 00:26:50.590\nThey will also support it as well.\n\n522\n00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:55.160\nSo, if now, and this is the question\nI asked Daniel right before.\n\n523\n00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.790\nDaniel, if I have a Roku\nthat's doing Wi-Fi Direct, and\n\n524\n00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:01.760\nmy laptop can do Wi-Fi Direct, it doesn't\nIt just doesn't show up, does it?\n\n525\n00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.530\nWhat's happening?\n\n526\n00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.050\n>> Yeah, it's just like Ronnie said.\n\n527\n00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.950\nIt's just not quite ready.\n\n528\n00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.010\nYou have to have some third party\nsoftware to get it to work, and\n\n529\n00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:12.787\nI've seen some demonstrations of it, and\neven then it was having a little trouble.\n\n530\n00:27:12.787 --> 00:27:16.170\nJust kinda find the one that works for\nyou if there's one out\n\n531\n00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:20.010\nthere that you'd have to install on top of\nWindows, but Windows will support it and\n\n532\n00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.790\nthat's kind of the point that\nthey want you to get across.\n\n533\n00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:27.265\nThere is no Wi-Fi direct area, per se,\n\n534\n00:27:27.265 --> 00:27:31.170\nin the Windows 10 operating system,\nit is just supported within it.\n\n535\n00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:31.920\nSo right now,\n\n536\n00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.660\nit's third-party apps on top of Windows\n10 lending the support to that app.\n\n537\n00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.050\nAnd then any other device that\nhas Wi-Fi Direct built in,\n\n538\n00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:42.230\nyou should be able to make that\nconnection and start transferring files.\n\n539\n00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.500\nSo that is there,\n\n540\n00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.680\nI assume that in the future they will\nhave their own Wi-Fi Direct area so you\n\n541\n00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.200\njust click a button I want to Wi-Fi Direct\nto this device or something like that.\n\n542\n00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.180\nBut right now it's just third party apps,\nand\n\n543\n00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.650\nthen you can get it going, but\nlike Ronnie said, really cool feature.\n\n544\n00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.510\nTo be able to say I just need to make\na point to point connection between this\n\n545\n00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:05.827\ncomputer and that device and start maybe\nstreaming or maybe transferring files.\n\n546\n00:28:05.827 --> 00:28:10.913\nNice high speed transfers, and you're not\nusing things like Bluetooth to Bluetooth,\n\n547\n00:28:10.913 --> 00:28:14.125\nthe antennas and\nthings tend to use a bit of power.\n\n548\n00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:17.020\nAnd we're talking about\na bit of mobility here, so\n\n549\n00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.570\nyou don't wanna eat up your batteries\nif you're running a laptop or a phone.\n\n550\n00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:24.070\nThe Wi-Fi Direct would probably be\na better way to go at that point.\n\n551\n00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:28.550\nVery cool, I expect big things from\nWi-Fi Direct as we go down the line.\n\n552\n00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:32.040\n>> Yeah, let me show you where\nin theory it should show up,\n\n553\n00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.900\nif everything is actually gonna\nwork the way it needs to.\n\n554\n00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.360\nSo on my computer,\n\n555\n00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.880\nlet's see if we can kinda see that\nthe menu that I'm trying to, there we go.\n\n556\n00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.820\nThat's a little bit better for us.\n\n557\n00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.800\nNow, the way that this works and\n\n558\n00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.640\nyou're probably wondering\nhow the heck do I know this.\n\n559\n00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.360\nWhat you should see under here,\n\n560\n00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.950\nnotice that I have ITProTV as the Wi-Fi\naccess and I have airplane mode.\n\n561\n00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.570\nAnd I have all of these different\nconnections that I normally see\n\n562\n00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:54.830\nover Wi-Fi.\n\n563\n00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.900\nNow that's where I was expecting to see,\nand\n\n564\n00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.220\nwhen you do see other devices\nthat are actually Wi-Fi Direct,\n\n565\n00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.400\nyou'll probably see the word\ndirect in front of whatever name\n\n566\n00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.330\nthat you're given on the SSID there, so\nthat's probably what you'll end up seeing.\n\n567\n00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:09.750\nNow when you don't see that, it doesn't\nmean that it doesn't support it, but\n\n568\n00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:12.160\nWindows 10 is just not ready for it yet.\n\n569\n00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.920\nWhat you'll probably end up\nseeing down here at the bottom\n\n570\n00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.530\nis a button that says connect.\n\n571\n00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:21.005\nWhen you see that button that says connect\nthat means that your Windows 10 is now\n\n572\n00:29:21.005 --> 00:29:26.070\ngonna be ready as you connect to those\nWi-Fi Direct types of connections.\n\n573\n00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.630\nAnd if you're saying,\nhey Ronnie how the heck do you know that?\n\n574\n00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:32.070\nWell it's because on a Windows Phone\nthat's exactly how it appears.\n\n575\n00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:36.270\nIs that when you go to the Wi-Fi settings\nyou see that exact same list there, and\n\n576\n00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.080\nthen you actually see another\nbutton that says connect.\n\n577\n00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.140\nWhen I do that, I see all those\nother Wi-Fi Direct connected\n\n578\n00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:48.380\nare able to connect buttons are machines\nthat are also out there as well.\n\n579\n00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.840\nSo inside the operating system, this is\nwhat we can show you right now is that\n\n580\n00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.370\nthat's probably where it will show up and\nyou'll actually be able to see that.\n\n581\n00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.078\nIf it does say connect,\nconnects to the name.\n\n582\n00:29:56.078 --> 00:29:59.086\nAnd you'll probably see a connect\nicon down at the bottom, and\n\n583\n00:29:59.086 --> 00:30:02.886\nall you have to do is press that, and\nthat will probably limit, in other words,\n\n584\n00:30:02.886 --> 00:30:05.068\nfilter it out so\nthat you will only see those.\n\n585\n00:30:05.068 --> 00:30:06.682\nAnd then you select that option, and\n\n586\n00:30:06.682 --> 00:30:09.445\nthat will begin to build that\npoint-to-point connection and\n\n587\n00:30:09.445 --> 00:30:12.800\nthat way you can transfer, start\nstreaming the information that you need.\n\n588\n00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.710\nAnd that's really what it's\ndesigned to do is high speed, and\n\n589\n00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:20.000\nof course massive amounts of transfer\nregular Wi-Fi, you can do that.\n\n590\n00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.436\nBut remember that you are going\nthrough an access point,\n\n591\n00:30:22.436 --> 00:30:24.313\nwhich means that everybody else is too,\nand\n\n592\n00:30:24.313 --> 00:30:27.681\nthat means that you have to wait in line\nfor everybody else that's connected.\n\n593\n00:30:27.681 --> 00:30:29.527\nBut with a direct point-to-point,\n\n594\n00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:34.090\nthat means nobody else is interfering with\nyour signal when you do that as well.\n\n595\n00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.410\nSo that is the advantage of Wi-Fi connect.\n\n596\n00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:41.044\nWe wish that everything would actually\nwork perfectly, but as of right now,\n\n597\n00:30:41.044 --> 00:30:45.679\nsince Windows 10 has really only been\nout there for about a month and a half,\n\n598\n00:30:45.679 --> 00:30:50.050\nmaybe that long altogether,\nit's just not exactly all filled out yet.\n\n599\n00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:53.529\nBut maybe by the time you're watching\nthis, you're probably gonna go, oh yeah,\n\n600\n00:30:53.529 --> 00:30:55.480\nRonnie, that was done\na couple of months ago.\n\n601\n00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.950\n>> Yeah, it's old news.\n\n602\n00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:58.810\n>> So, it is a great feature, and\n\n603\n00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:02.268\nI think we're gonna look more forward\nto it in the future as it fills in.\n\n604\n00:31:02.268 --> 00:31:03.640\n>> Yeah I sure do.\n\n605\n00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.350\nWell Ronnie, we went through Wi-Fi Direct.\n\n606\n00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.357\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Very cool,\n\n607\n00:31:06.357 --> 00:31:08.977\nI can't wait to see it\ngo live in prime time.\n\n608\n00:31:08.977 --> 00:31:12.075\nWe covered a lot of good stuff about\nWindows To Go, super, super awesome.\n\n609\n00:31:12.075 --> 00:31:14.658\nSync settings, is there anything\nelse we need to cover today?\n\n610\n00:31:14.658 --> 00:31:17.010\n>> Well,\nnot in this particular episode, but\n\n611\n00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:21.397\nas always there are more mobility options\nthat we need to talk about especially one\n\n612\n00:31:21.397 --> 00:31:24.720\ncalled BitLocker which is a pretty good,\nhefty topic for us.\n\n613\n00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.330\n>> Yeah it is.\n\n614\n00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.720\nWell, I guess we're gonna\nhave to make another episode.\n\n615\n00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.930\nHopefully, we'll see you guys there as for\nthis one, we're gonna go to wrap it up.\n\n616\n00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.790\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n617\n00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.540\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n618\n00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.733\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n619\n00:31:35.733 --> 00:31:41.287\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:20.066\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, here with\nme my partner in crime, as always, Mr.\n\n4\n00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:20.687\nRonnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.750\nHow's it going Ronnie.\n\n6\n00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.190\n>> It is going great as we continue\nto take a look at Windows 10 devices,\n\n7\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.700\nespecially taking a look at\nsome mobility options that\n\n8\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.710\nshould be familiar to all of\nus as we support Windows 10.\n\n9\n00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.376\nWe want to continue on and we wanna take a\nlook at some of these last few things that\n\n10\n00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:39.470\nwe need to, well, because they're\nimportant, more than anything else here.\n\n11\n00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.680\nSo there are a few different\nlittle command line utilities,\n\n12\n00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.190\nI should say, that we need to take a look\nat, especially on mobility options,\n\n13\n00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.580\nwhen you just need to see\nsome of these settings here.\n\n14\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.295\nAnd one of them is actually what we\ncall the powercfg, which stands for\n\n15\n00:00:53.295 --> 00:00:54.945\npower configuration.\n\n16\n00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:57.485\nNow, the reason why we might\nwant to take a look at this is,\n\n17\n00:00:57.485 --> 00:01:00.715\nsometimes, we just need to\nsee the consumption idea.\n\n18\n00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:03.145\nSo, even though we know that\nwe can manage power options,\n\n19\n00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:05.485\nwe know that we can do that,\nwe just need to see that.\n\n20\n00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:08.665\nAnd so, that's what we're also\ngonna take a look at today as well.\n\n21\n00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:10.925\nThe other thing that we also\nare going to take a look, of course,\n\n22\n00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:15.950\nis setting up encryption\non mobile devices as well.\n\n23\n00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.075\nSo we'll take a look,\nof course, at power locker.\n\n24\n00:01:19.075 --> 00:01:19.800\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> What?\n\n25\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.790\nI'm combining so many different things.\n\n26\n00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.980\nIt is BitLocker,\nis what we are taking a look at here.\n\n27\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.570\nSo we'll actually take a look\nat both those settings for us.\n\n28\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.850\nSo, remember that when we set up power\noptions, a lot of it is just to make sure\n\n29\n00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.420\nthat we manage the actual battery life in\nour mobile devices the way that we need\n\n30\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.860\nto, but\nsometimes we just need to see the stats.\n\n31\n00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.570\nWe need to be able to\nverify that these things\n\n32\n00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.290\nare running the way that we need to.\n\n33\n00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.440\nAnd we don't need to try and dig through\na ton of information to get that.\n\n34\n00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.570\nCuz normally what we'd have to do is go\ninto our Event Viewer, and then try and\n\n35\n00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.410\nlook at these power settings and go,\nwhich ones are actually relevant and\n\n36\n00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.860\nwhich ones aren't relevant?\n\n37\n00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.510\nAnd so, having a nice little\nisolated command line prompt\n\n38\n00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.560\nwill help us to see that.\n\n39\n00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.890\nSo let's go ahead and run that prompt.\n\n40\n00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.410\nAnd that way we can actually\nsee what we're talking about.\n\n41\n00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.690\nSo in the search, web and Windows,\nI'm gonna call it the correct thing and\n\n42\n00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.030\nthat's what it's actually called here,\nI'm gonna type in cmd, Charlie,\n\n43\n00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.480\nMike, delta, and\nthen run that as the administrator.\n\n44\n00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.200\nNow, I don't know if you necessarily have\nto run that as the administrator, but\n\n45\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.990\nI like doing it just in case\nit asks me in the future.\n\n46\n00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.870\nSo I verify that I have administrator and,\nlet me see, yeah,\n\n47\n00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.510\nlooks like we can see that.\n\n48\n00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.800\nSo what I want to do is\nactually type in powercfg,\n\n49\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.170\nand if you're ever actually not sure,\nalways do a /?,\n\n50\n00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.020\nand that will give you a nice list\nof all the available options that\n\n51\n00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.450\nyou can see with, and\nyou can see that this is a huge list.\n\n52\n00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.360\nIt enables you to actually control\nthe power settings if you want to,\n\n53\n00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.570\nand so, you can actually go through and\nset all these things up.\n\n54\n00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.663\nNow, if I'm doing it from a command\nline prompt, I'm doing this.\n\n55\n00:02:54.663 --> 00:02:57.311\nYou might be wondering like, why does\nit say that you can configure this?\n\n56\n00:02:57.311 --> 00:03:01.620\nBecause you can actually run\nthis as a script instead.\n\n57\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.960\nSo those of you that are into scripting,\n\n58\n00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.402\nyou can actually use this to\ncontrol those power features.\n\n59\n00:03:05.402 --> 00:03:06.970\nWhat we're really taking a look at it for\n\n60\n00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.320\nright now is simply taking a look at\nit from the standpoint of getting data.\n\n61\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.340\nSo if I am not sure that everything is\nactually doing what I need it to do.\n\n62\n00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.760\nI want to do a powercfg, and\nthen I'm going to type in /list.\n\n63\n00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.751\nAnd it can tell me right away what\npower option plan or what power plan am\n\n64\n00:03:26.751 --> 00:03:30.938\nI currently on, and you see the one with\nthe little asterisk at the end of it, and\n\n65\n00:03:30.938 --> 00:03:34.600\nit even shows you the little GUID,\nthe ID that it actually finds.\n\n66\n00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.570\nAnd normally that setting that\n\n67\n00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.120\nwould probably be inside\nof the registry somewhere.\n\n68\n00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.889\nWhich one is actually configured\nas being on at this point.\n\n69\n00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.822\nSo if you think that you're on the wrong\npower plan, here is something that you can\n\n70\n00:03:45.822 --> 00:03:49.768\nrun that actually shows you what the power\nplans are, and which ones your also on.\n\n71\n00:03:49.768 --> 00:03:55.170\nNow another one that's very popular\nis one that is just called /energy.\n\n72\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.830\nOkay, now this one is actually\ngonna take about 60 seconds here.\n\n73\n00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.150\nWhat it's gonna go through,\nwhich is a little bit strange,\n\n74\n00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.990\nit's gonna go through your event log and\nlook up all of those power options that\n\n75\n00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.470\nare happening over the last 60 seconds\nhere, and generate a simple report for us.\n\n76\n00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.130\nAnd it may actually take a little\nbit longer than 60 seconds, for\n\n77\n00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.030\none reason or another,\n\n78\n00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.040\nto pull all of that data together,\nas it actually displays that one too.\n\n79\n00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.240\nNow the last option, so you see where\nit says, Analyses the system for\n\n80\n00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.110\ncommon energy-efficiency and\nbattery life problems.\n\n81\n00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.150\nAnd it will tell me, here are some of\nthe errors that are actually here,\n\n82\n00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.770\nhere's some of the other alerts\nthat you have to pay attention to.\n\n83\n00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.100\nWhen everything is actually done and over,\n\n84\n00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.400\nit will tell me, here's what you\nactually need to look for, and\n\n85\n00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.900\nat that point I may have to go back into\nthe Event Viewer and find those things.\n\n86\n00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.270\nBut at this point here, if I don't\nsee any errors, I'm probably fine,\n\n87\n00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.730\nif I do then I'm actually a little\nbit more behind than I think.\n\n88\n00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.220\nAnd then the last one that\nwe normally take a look at\n\n89\n00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.530\nas far as what we want to do,\nis one that says /BATTERYREPORT.\n\n90\n00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.920\nIt generates a report\nof the battery usage.\n\n91\n00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.370\nAnd you can see why that\nmight be important,\n\n92\n00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.790\nespecially if you think the battery usage\nis getting drained down really fast.\n\n93\n00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.980\nNow, some systems will support this\nsetting, some systems will not.\n\n94\n00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.030\nSo, this is actually where it goes\nin the underlying hardware and\n\n95\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.180\nsays, here's the information\nI'm looking for, and\n\n96\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.540\nsometimes the hardware will say sure, you\ncan have it, I don't mind reporting that.\n\n97\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.480\nSome systems just don't\nhave the settings for them.\n\n98\n00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.285\nSo if it generates something that\ntells you that there is an error,\n\n99\n00:05:24.285 --> 00:05:27.891\nmore than likely you're going to say hey,\nmy system doesn't seem to actually be able\n\n100\n00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:31.840\nto report all that stuff, but those are\nnormally the ones that you're looking for.\n\n101\n00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.300\nAnd you can see that this one is\nactually just kinda sitting there,\n\n102\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.550\nand it's just taking its sweet time\nat generating the overall report,\n\n103\n00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.750\nbut after a while, it should show up.\n\n104\n00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.730\nBut, those are normally the basic ones\nthat we're really taking a look at.\n\n105\n00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.181\nAnd if you buy a model of laptop, like\nthese XPSs, and you bought 50 of them,\n\n106\n00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:52.223\nwell, you wanna make sure\nthat they are consistent.\n\n107\n00:05:52.223 --> 00:05:55.062\nAnd this is probably\nthe easiest way to do so,\n\n108\n00:05:55.062 --> 00:05:59.918\nis to use these types of commands and\nthat way you know, is it with that model,\n\n109\n00:05:59.918 --> 00:06:03.547\nor is that Ronnie just has a bum\nlaptop with a bad battery.\n\n110\n00:06:03.547 --> 00:06:07.263\nThat's the easier one to actually go and\ndo a warranty call and say hey look,\n\n111\n00:06:07.263 --> 00:06:10.227\nhere's these battery configurations,\nand his just dies so\n\n112\n00:06:10.227 --> 00:06:13.330\nmuch faster than everybody else's,\nit's gotta be battery.\n\n113\n00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.520\nAnd that's probably a lot easier for\nthat technician that's gonna go, yeah,\n\n114\n00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.270\nthis is actually really out of\nthe specs that we're expecting.\n\n115\n00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.660\nAnd so, it is something that's good for\n\n116\n00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.790\nan administrator to actually know and\nunderstand, but for\n\n117\n00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.940\nyou, it's just something interesting\nmore than anything else.\n\n118\n00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.900\n>> Yeah, I can't tell you how many times\nI've had people call my office and say,\n\n119\n00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.290\nI'm having trouble with this computer,\nand I'm like,\n\n120\n00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.490\nokay, let's take a look\nat what's going on here.\n\n121\n00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.600\nMaybe it's something like this.\n\n122\n00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.000\nMaybe the battery is\ndraining very quickly, and\n\n123\n00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.990\nthey're saying, well I just bought it,\nit's brand new.\n\n124\n00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.630\nI said, well,\nyou've never heard of a lemon?\n\n125\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.247\nSometimes, lemons get through production.\n\n126\n00:06:46.247 --> 00:06:47.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They don't hit the queue,\n\n127\n00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.980\nthe quality assurance as hard as they\nneed to, and it just slips past and\n\n128\n00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:52.660\ngets out to you.\n\n129\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.207\nYou buy it, you pick it up, and\nit just stops working correctly.\n\n130\n00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:59.220\nThis is the kind of thing that you could\nuse to prove that that is something\n\n131\n00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.160\nthat is happening.\n\n132\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.650\nYou could then call and\nsay, hey, you know what,\n\n133\n00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.650\nI've run these power configuration\ntools that are on my computer, and it's\n\n134\n00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.180\nshowing me that even though this computer\nis a month old, or two months old, or\n\n135\n00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.880\nhowever old, that the battery\nconsumption is draining so quickly.\n\n136\n00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.250\nI've got a report right\nhere I've generated,\n\n137\n00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.700\nyou can take a look at that, it is proof\nto say, I know that this is happening.\n\n138\n00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.370\nIt's not just something that\nI'm experiencing in my mind,\n\n139\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.700\nI think it's running slowly when it's\nreally operating within normal parameters.\n\n140\n00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.930\nThat's the kind of thing that you need,\nbecause sometimes,\n\n141\n00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.610\npeople just won't believe that,\nno, it's probably running.\n\n142\n00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.640\nUsers do tend to exaggerate a little\nbit when it comes to how fast, or\n\n143\n00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.420\nslow, or whatever,\nsomething should be performing.\n\n144\n00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.430\nThey always think it should be a little\nbetter than it normally actually is.\n\n145\n00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.430\nNot a big deal, we can, again,\njump into these settings,\n\n146\n00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.690\nuse those powercfg options to prove, hey,\nlook, this is well within the specs or,\n\n147\n00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.710\nhey, yeah, I think you might actually\nhave a problem here, let's use this and\n\n148\n00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.590\ngo ahead and call in a warranty work.\n\n149\n00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.850\n>> No doubt.\n\n150\n00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.615\nNow, what we want to do is,\nnow that this is actually finished here,\n\n151\n00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:03.060\nlet me show you some of the results.\n\n152\n00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.570\nOf what we're talking about with\nat least the energy setting.\n\n153\n00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.429\nSo, right now you can see that energy\nefficiency problems were found.\n\n154\n00:08:10.429 --> 00:08:12.344\nSo that's actually, well, bad.\n\n155\n00:08:12.344 --> 00:08:13.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> More than anything else.\n\n156\n00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:14.960\nIt found 14 errors.\n\n157\n00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.710\nI wouldn't have actually expected that,\nbut\n\n158\n00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.370\nyou see errors warning that information.\n\n159\n00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.320\nWhere do you normally find that?\n\n160\n00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.120\nWell, inside of the event viewer.\n\n161\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.380\nSo it does show you that\nit is logging these things.\n\n162\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.749\nSo it traced it, it's observed it.\n\n163\n00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:27.709\nIt actually found it, and\nit did the analysis as complete.\n\n164\n00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:31.021\nBut if I want to see more detail and\nnotice it went ahead and\n\n165\n00:08:31.021 --> 00:08:33.584\ngenerated a report here\nin an HTML fashion.\n\n166\n00:08:33.584 --> 00:08:38.481\nAnd the nice thing about that is all I\nhad to do was type in the actual name\n\n167\n00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:43.479\nof that file, and then that brought\nit up inside of my default browser.\n\n168\n00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:44.245\nAnd there it is.\n\n169\n00:08:44.245 --> 00:08:46.551\nI can see power efficiency here.\n\n170\n00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:50.150\nLet me see if I can zoom in on this so\nwe can see a little bit better there.\n\n171\n00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.920\nThere we go.\n\n172\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.078\nOkay, so power efficiency\ndiagnostic reports here, so\n\n173\n00:08:54.078 --> 00:08:56.328\nwe can see where it actually did scan it.\n\n174\n00:08:56.328 --> 00:08:59.970\nAnd it took a look at processes and\ncounts, and there we go.\n\n175\n00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.990\nUSB suspending here,\nUSB Device Not Entering Selective Suspend.\n\n176\n00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.798\nSo, it doesn't like the fact that hey,\nUSB is actually eating up power, and\n\n177\n00:09:07.798 --> 00:09:11.148\nit is because I've got two USB\ndevices now plugged into this thing.\n\n178\n00:09:11.148 --> 00:09:14.346\nSo, it's probably not very happy that\nI'm draining the voltage that I need to.\n\n179\n00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:17.870\nBut all of it seems to be that way,\nand then notice right here,\n\n180\n00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:23.230\nit also tells me that the Power Platform\nManaging Capabilities is disabled.\n\n181\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.716\nWow, it's saying, hey, Ronnie, you're not\nactually allowing me to manage the power.\n\n182\n00:09:26.716 --> 00:09:29.860\nSo, you're probably not\nactually doing that.\n\n183\n00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.680\nSo it's been disabled due to a known\nincompatibility with the hardware.\n\n184\n00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.330\nSo we're not only seeing like\na little bit of information.\n\n185\n00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.390\nDaniel, this is detailed, right?\n\n186\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.460\nIt actually is right down to the setting.\n\n187\n00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.430\nAnd it's saying, yeah, Ronnie.\n\n188\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.878\nIt looks like you actually disabled\nthe active power state management.\n\n189\n00:09:44.878 --> 00:09:45.841\n>> Good job, Ronnie.\n>> Yeah, you're a fool.\n\n190\n00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:46.915\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you're a fool,\n\n191\n00:09:46.915 --> 00:09:47.651\nis what it's telling you.\n\n192\n00:09:47.651 --> 00:09:50.891\nAnd then, of course,\nall the other device drivers,\n\n193\n00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:54.910\nthat's also draining power\nfrom this device, as well.\n\n194\n00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.862\nSo then, of course, there's the warnings.\n\n195\n00:09:56.862 --> 00:10:00.960\nAnd then just informational\nthings that it's expecting.\n\n196\n00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.643\nAnd so you can actually see that,\nthere it is.\n\n197\n00:10:02.643 --> 00:10:07.027\nIt's all these different things, and\nso it's an incredible detailed report,\n\n198\n00:10:07.027 --> 00:10:09.295\nsomething that you may want to hang on to.\n\n199\n00:10:09.295 --> 00:10:11.933\nEspecially when somebody comes\nback to you and says, yeah,\n\n200\n00:10:11.933 --> 00:10:13.962\nwe don't know if this is\nreally a power match.\n\n201\n00:10:13.962 --> 00:10:17.192\nWell you can print that out and\njust email that to that person and go,\n\n202\n00:10:17.192 --> 00:10:19.581\nhere's what I generated\nfrom inside of Windows.\n\n203\n00:10:19.581 --> 00:10:20.696\nIt is this device.\n\n204\n00:10:20.696 --> 00:10:23.480\nThat battery is draining down,\nand there's no way to fix it.\n\n205\n00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.810\nSo that's a warranty\ncall at that point too.\n\n206\n00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.130\nSo a lot of features that are actually\njust built right into Windows.\n\n207\n00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.020\nAnd on mobility devices,\nremember battery life is the key.\n\n208\n00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.112\nIf you're gonna have something that you\nreally are gonna be really liking to use\n\n209\n00:10:36.112 --> 00:10:37.220\nmore than anything.\n\n210\n00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.590\nIt is one of the most\nfrustrating things in the world,\n\n211\n00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.562\na brand new operating system ,and\nyour battery life is now 20 minutes.\n\n212\n00:10:42.562 --> 00:10:46.580\nI mean,\nit is not something that any of us want\n\n213\n00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.640\nto be trying to trace down and figure out.\n\n214\n00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.880\nBut with these power configuration\ncommand lines, very easy utility,\n\n215\n00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.830\na lot of information generated for us.\n\n216\n00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:55.660\n>> Very cool.\n\n217\n00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.980\nNow, that's not the only settings that\nwe need to check out in this episode.\n\n218\n00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.152\nRonnie's got me all flustered-\n>> I do.\n\n219\n00:11:02.152 --> 00:11:04.125\n>> Talking about these\npower configurations.\n\n220\n00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:06.664\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A lot going on in there, obviously,\n\n221\n00:11:06.664 --> 00:11:09.530\nwe can get a lot of\ndetail in those reports.\n\n222\n00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.960\nBut another thing that we do need to\nworry about when it comes to mobility\n\n223\n00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.380\nis security.\n\n224\n00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.140\nNow, security's obviously a big deal,\nright?\n\n225\n00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.800\nEverybody talks about security today,\nhow can we be more secure?\n\n226\n00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.470\nI worked for a company who had\na lot of field agents, right?\n\n227\n00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.182\nThey take a laptop,\nthey go out into the field.\n\n228\n00:11:25.182 --> 00:11:27.840\nThey do work using that laptop,\nthey come home.\n\n229\n00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.442\nSo their laptop is their main mode of,\nwell, computing station, right.\n\n230\n00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:34.620\nI guess that's a proper word there.\n\n231\n00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.940\nRight, that is what they normally use.\n\n232\n00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.050\nThey don't sit at a desktop.\n\n233\n00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.270\nThey have a laptop.\n\n234\n00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.500\nWhat's the problem with laptops?\n\n235\n00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.270\nWell, they could be lost,\nor they can be stolen.\n\n236\n00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:42.946\nThat's the big one.\n\n237\n00:11:42.946 --> 00:11:44.870\nWe don't like devices that get stolen.\n\n238\n00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.570\nGuess what?\n\n239\n00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.170\nWe were having a run on\ntheft of our laptops.\n\n240\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.352\nSo we said, man, there are some really\nsensitive information that are stored on\n\n241\n00:11:53.352 --> 00:11:56.072\nthese laptops cuz these\nagents are out on the field.\n\n242\n00:11:56.072 --> 00:11:58.052\nAnd they come back,\nthey hook into our network, and\n\n243\n00:11:58.052 --> 00:12:00.080\nthen they download that information.\n\n244\n00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.560\nWe needed a way to secure that information\nin the event that something was stolen,\n\n245\n00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.390\nthose laptops specifically.\n\n246\n00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.295\nMicrosoft, well they beat us to the punch.\n\n247\n00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:11.150\nThey said, we hear your woes,\nwe hear your cries.\n\n248\n00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.940\nWorry not, we have built in a feature\nthat's gonna help you out with that.\n\n249\n00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.265\nRonnie, what are we talking about here?\n\n250\n00:12:16.265 --> 00:12:19.885\n>> We are really talking about what\nwe call BitLocker, and BitLocker is\n\n251\n00:12:19.885 --> 00:12:24.625\na total drive encryption where it\nactually encrypts the entire hard drive.\n\n252\n00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:27.105\nNow, we've been using file encryption for\nyears and\n\n253\n00:12:27.105 --> 00:12:32.102\nyears to secure those specific sensitive\nfiles that Daniel was talking about.\n\n254\n00:12:32.102 --> 00:12:34.192\nAnd that's actually been\na very good system.\n\n255\n00:12:34.192 --> 00:12:38.412\nBut the problem with it is still that\neven if those files are encrypted,\n\n256\n00:12:38.412 --> 00:12:39.392\nDaniel's right.\n\n257\n00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:43.054\nThey now have a computer\nthat they have access to.\n\n258\n00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:45.492\nAnd even if they don't have\naccess to all those files,\n\n259\n00:12:45.492 --> 00:12:49.560\nthey have access to a lot of files that\nmay not actually be encrypted as well.\n\n260\n00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.010\nSo one of the better ways that Microsoft\nhas actually talked about encryption\n\n261\n00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.360\nis to say look, the more security\nthat we have, the better.\n\n262\n00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.900\nSo what if we include in with the file\nencryption itself, what we call EFS,\n\n263\n00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:05.080\nthe encrypting file system,\nalong with a drive encryption?\n\n264\n00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.540\nThe advantage of the drive\nencryption along with that is\n\n265\n00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.850\nreally kind of twofold here.\n\n266\n00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.860\nThe reason why it actually works so\n\n267\n00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.116\nwell is now that that hard\ndrive is actually encrypted,\n\n268\n00:13:16.116 --> 00:13:20.501\nyou can actually make sure that it\nrequires a key when you boot it up, okay.\n\n269\n00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:24.081\nSo that way they either have to type in a\nPIN number, have to type in a long number,\n\n270\n00:13:24.081 --> 00:13:27.475\nwhatever it might be for recovery so\nthat they can gain access to that drive.\n\n271\n00:13:27.475 --> 00:13:32.115\nYou can even tie it into the TPM,\nthe trusted platform module.\n\n272\n00:13:32.115 --> 00:13:35.967\nAnd what that means is even if I were to,\nor this drive, right,\n\n273\n00:13:35.967 --> 00:13:38.802\non this laptop,\nwere to get out into the open,\n\n274\n00:13:38.802 --> 00:13:43.423\nand somebody were saying, I know,\nI can't get access to it if I boot it up.\n\n275\n00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:46.438\nBut is there a possibility I\ncan take this drive out and\n\n276\n00:13:46.438 --> 00:13:48.183\nslave it into another system?\n\n277\n00:13:48.183 --> 00:13:52.080\nAnd that way I'm not booting that up,\nI'm just trying to access it as data.\n\n278\n00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.888\nWell, it is possible at times,\nat least it used to be, but,\n\n279\n00:13:55.888 --> 00:14:00.768\nwhat if you actually have it tied to that\nmachine, which is what the TPM does?\n\n280\n00:14:00.768 --> 00:14:04.833\nIf the TPM is tied to that machine, they\ncan take that drive out of that machine,\n\n281\n00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:06.700\ntry and connect it to theirs.\n\n282\n00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.000\nAnd when it first goes to look and\nit says, oh,\n\n283\n00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.740\nI need to see if the TPM matches\nwhat I am actually configured.\n\n284\n00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.190\nAnd if it doesn't, I'm not gonna unlock.\n\n285\n00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:21.080\nSo you do have these advantages for you,\nand Windows has built it into what we call\n\n286\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:25.750\nBitLocker, which is the total\ndrive volume encryption itself.\n\n287\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.020\nSo the hard thing to understand about\nthe way that BitLocker works is it really\n\n288\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:36.600\nactually is an encryption that works\nwhen the computer is turned off.\n\n289\n00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.480\nSo when you are working with it,\neven if you turn BitLocker and\n\n290\n00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.220\nyou're working with it,\nyou don't notice it.\n\n291\n00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.140\nIt is seamless, it is transparent,\nit is in background.\n\n292\n00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.200\nIt is essentially, for\nmy intents and purposes, well, off.\n\n293\n00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.490\nThat's what it seems like.\n\n294\n00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:54.600\nBut when I turn my computer off or I shut\ndown my computer, at any point in time,\n\n295\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.040\nI reboot my computer, well,\nBitLocker turns itself back on.\n\n296\n00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.300\nThe next time somebody tries to get access\nto that volume, well now it's encrypted.\n\n297\n00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.670\nSo, if they're doing shoulder surfing,\n\n298\n00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.440\nright over my shoulder,\nthere is no encryption at all.\n\n299\n00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.320\nBut if they try and access that device,\nstealing it, shutting the computer down\n\n300\n00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.200\nand rebooting it at any point,\nthen that's where the problem comes in.\n\n301\n00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.730\nSo that's what we're really talking about.\n\n302\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.460\nAnd BitLocker is a Microsoft\nproprietary way to do so.\n\n303\n00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:26.280\nNow, it used to be, in the days of Vista,\nit was a bit challenging to set up.\n\n304\n00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.570\nAnd I mean by challenging, you did, you\nhad to kind of shrink the drive a little\n\n305\n00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:34.200\nbit and make sure that it was\nan unpartitioned space about 200 megs or\n\n306\n00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.970\nso because of the way\nthat BitLocker worked.\n\n307\n00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.170\nAnd then from that point,\nyou could actually go ahead and\n\n308\n00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:40.220\nencrypt the drive volume.\n\n309\n00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.278\nNow when you did that,\n\n310\n00:15:41.278 --> 00:15:44.743\nyou could only encrypt the operating\nsystem volume itself, that was it.\n\n311\n00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:47.874\nBut then when they actually came out with\nservice packs, then you could encrypt\n\n312\n00:15:47.874 --> 00:15:50.850\nthe operating system,\nas well as other additional drives.\n\n313\n00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:54.542\nThen with Windows 7 and Windows 8 coming\nout, not only could you do that, you could\n\n314\n00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:57.924\nactually encrypt BitLocker and actually\ndo something like BitLocker to go.\n\n315\n00:15:57.924 --> 00:16:03.344\nOr you could also run BitLocker on well,\nremovable and portable drives too.\n\n316\n00:16:03.344 --> 00:16:07.742\nSo fairly easy, but\nduring that whole time They've made it so\n\n317\n00:16:07.742 --> 00:16:11.930\nmuch easier for you to set up and\nfor you to make it run.\n\n318\n00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:12.980\nAnd that's what we wanna show you,\n\n319\n00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.000\nis how easy it actually is\nto be able to do this, okay?\n\n320\n00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.820\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n321\n00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.990\nSo the easiest way to get\nBitLocker running is,\n\n322\n00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.730\nI'm going to click on File Explorer.\n\n323\n00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.850\nAnd then I'm going to click on\nThis PC over in the left-hand corner.\n\n324\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.630\nAnd now notice I have these two\ndrives that are available, okay?\n\n325\n00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.880\nSo there is this WININSTALL, and\nthen there of course is local disk C.\n\n326\n00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.050\nNow let me just use this drive for\nright now.\n\n327\n00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:44.010\nI'm not going to encrypt the operating\nsystem file, because it's so much bigger.\n\n328\n00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.920\nI actually have a little 8 gigabyte\ndrive that would be a lot faster in\n\n329\n00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.120\nthe encryption,\ninstead of us sitting here waiting for it.\n\n330\n00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.870\nSo, if I right-click on this drive,\nthis is how easy it is.\n\n331\n00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.553\nNotice it says, turn on BitLocker.\n\n332\n00:16:55.553 --> 00:16:57.595\nI mean, is it really that easy?\n\n333\n00:16:57.595 --> 00:16:58.750\nWell, it is now.\n\n334\n00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.430\nSo notice it says, hey,\nthe media in the drive may have changed.\n\n335\n00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.220\nIt doesn't like it.\n\n336\n00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.490\nIt says,\ndon't remove it during this point, here.\n\n337\n00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.910\nSo, let's see.\n\n338\n00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.500\nIsn't that maybe my drive is\nnot the one that needs to.\n\n339\n00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.350\nWhat is happening here?\n\n340\n00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:13.330\nIt says,\nmedia in the drive may have changed.\n\n341\n00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:17.280\nSo it apparently did not recognize,\noh, it did change.\n\n342\n00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.280\nThat is my fault.\n\n343\n00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.600\nI actually unplugged one, and then plugged\nanother one back in is what I did.\n\n344\n00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.760\nSo that's why I was like, oh, okay.\n\n345\n00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.120\nIt is having a misread and an error there.\n\n346\n00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.090\nThere we go.\n\n347\n00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.053\nWell, maybe not.\n\n348\n00:17:30.053 --> 00:17:30.770\nLet's see.\n\n349\n00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.540\nIf I right-click, and\nnow let's try it again.\n\n350\n00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:35.400\nThere we go.\n\n351\n00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.850\nSo, yeah, I had unplugged that\ndrive without safely removing it.\n\n352\n00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.110\nMy fault.\n>> Shame, shame, Ronald.\n\n353\n00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.191\n>> It was my shame.\n\n354\n00:17:42.191 --> 00:17:43.479\n[LAUGH] It really was.\n\n355\n00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:44.960\nAnd then I had plugged it back in.\n\n356\n00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.810\nI couldn't remember if I actually\nhad gotten it to read or not, so\n\n357\n00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.370\nthat's probably why I did that.\n\n358\n00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:50.470\nAnd now notice this,\n\n359\n00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.190\nit actually gives me the option here,\nhow do you want to unlock this drive?\n\n360\n00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.240\nI can have two options here.\n\n361\n00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.700\nI can use a password to unlock this drive,\nand\n\n362\n00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.220\nif I wanted to,\nI can also use a smart card.\n\n363\n00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:07.490\nNotice it gives me that ability to do\nwhat, multi-factor authentication.\n\n364\n00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.750\nEven on a USB drive, imagine that.\n\n365\n00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:11.775\n>> Welcome to the future, Ronnie.\n\n366\n00:18:11.775 --> 00:18:13.191\n>> That is the future, by far.\n\n367\n00:18:13.191 --> 00:18:16.615\nSo, I can either, I can present both,\nor I can present one or the other.\n\n368\n00:18:16.615 --> 00:18:20.780\nAt this point I'm just gonna do one,\nis what we're gonna do here.\n\n369\n00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.300\nAnd of course, look at that,\nI actually typed in the wrong password.\n\n370\n00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.100\nI can even see it, that I typed\nin the wrong password, go figure.\n\n371\n00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.210\nSo there we go, and\nthen I am going to click Next.\n\n372\n00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.140\nNow, what is happening here,\n\n373\n00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.060\nright ,is now it's actually\ngenerating what we actually need to.\n\n374\n00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.420\nAnd now it's asking me how I\nwant to back up my recovery key.\n\n375\n00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.360\nLet me see who I'm logged in as.\n\n376\n00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.780\nI'm just logged in as User1.\n\n377\n00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.284\nNotice it gives me three different options\nhere so that I can actually choose this.\n\n378\n00:18:51.284 --> 00:18:53.525\nI could save it to my Microsoft account.\n\n379\n00:18:53.525 --> 00:18:58.016\nIf I know that I'm gonna be using that\ndrive across every device that I own,\n\n380\n00:18:58.016 --> 00:19:02.880\nsaving it to a Microsoft account is\nprobably the best thing that I can do.\n\n381\n00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.410\nBecause that means as long as\nI log in my Microsoft account,\n\n382\n00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:09.850\nI will have access to be able to do\nthat and not even worry what the key is.\n\n383\n00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:13.660\nAnd then of course, I can print the\nrecovery key, or I can save it to a file.\n\n384\n00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.555\nAt this point I'm just gonna save it to\nthe file cuz I'm not really logged in as\n\n385\n00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:20.675\nthe Microsoft user, and that way we can\nalso see the recovery key if we need to.\n\n386\n00:19:20.675 --> 00:19:24.005\nSo here I'm just gonna generate, I'm gonna\nsave it inside of the Documents folder.\n\n387\n00:19:24.005 --> 00:19:26.754\nNow it is not recommended\nthat we save it on the same,\n\n388\n00:19:26.754 --> 00:19:29.947\nshouldn't save it on the same\ndrive as you're encrypting.\n\n389\n00:19:29.947 --> 00:19:35.008\n[LAUGH] That should be logical,\nright, to encrypt the recovery key\n\n390\n00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:36.042\n>> Encrypt the recovery key, and\n\n391\n00:19:36.042 --> 00:19:36.726\nwe can't get to it.\n\n392\n00:19:36.726 --> 00:19:38.386\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's always a fun good time.\n\n393\n00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.360\n>> And believe it or not, I've done it.\n\n394\n00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.310\nI mean, who else would have done it?\n\n395\n00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.065\nOf course, I have.\n\n396\n00:19:43.065 --> 00:19:45.890\nOf course, it would have been me\nif anybody would have done that.\n\n397\n00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:46.950\nSo, there it is.\n\n398\n00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:52.945\nSo i'm gonna save that key here, and\nthen I'm going to click Next, hopefully.\n\n399\n00:19:52.945 --> 00:19:54.762\nAnd then it's going to say,\nhey, how much do I wanna do?\n\n400\n00:19:54.762 --> 00:19:57.002\nNow, this is actually something\nthat is pretty good, too.\n\n401\n00:19:57.002 --> 00:19:59.962\nIt's saying look,\nif you want to just encrypt a part of it,\n\n402\n00:19:59.962 --> 00:20:03.220\nin other words, just encrypt the files but\nnot the entire drive,\n\n403\n00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.590\nI shouldn't say the files,\na portion of that hard drive.\n\n404\n00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.210\nSo if you want to say hey,\n\n405\n00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:10.830\nI want to leave the rest of this hard\ndrive unencrypted, we can do that.\n\n406\n00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.770\nIt used to be you either\nencrypted the drive or you didn't.\n\n407\n00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.690\nThat was it.\n\n408\n00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.198\nBut now you can actually say look,\n\n409\n00:20:16.198 --> 00:20:19.200\nthere's a lot of free space\nI don't want to encrypt.\n\n410\n00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.888\nBut remember that as drives have gotten\nbigger, like terabyte drives and\n\n411\n00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:27.980\n2 terabyte, 4 terabyte drives,\nyou start encrypting 4 terabytes.\n\n412\n00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.500\nAnd let's say that three and\na half of those terabytes is free space.\n\n413\n00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.830\nIt's going to take a long time.\n\n414\n00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:34.850\nI mean, when I say a long time,\n\n415\n00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:38.754\nI mean days at times if you're\ndoing this because it is running\n\n416\n00:20:38.754 --> 00:20:43.180\nan encryption against the entire\nvolume of what you are talking about.\n\n417\n00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.550\nSo, if you need it a little bit faster,\n\n418\n00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:48.730\nyou may just choose to encrypt\njust the used disk space only.\n\n419\n00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.090\nOkay, so notice that that's what it says.\n\n420\n00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.945\nIt says it's best and faster for\nnewer drives here, and\n\n421\n00:20:52.945 --> 00:20:54.846\nthen I can encrypt the entire drive.\n\n422\n00:20:54.846 --> 00:20:58.363\nBecause we're talking about time,\nwe're just gonna do this portion instead.\n\n423\n00:20:58.363 --> 00:20:59.502\n>> We like the speedy version.\n\n424\n00:20:59.502 --> 00:21:01.380\n>> We like the speedy version, right?\n\n425\n00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.270\nAnd then it's gonna ask if we are ready.\n\n426\n00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.180\nSo it says you'll be able to unlock\nthis drive using a password.\n\n427\n00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.460\nEncryption might take awhile\ndepending on the size.\n\n428\n00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.210\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and encrypt it.\n\n429\n00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.290\nAnd it shouldn't actually take very\nlong because it was such a small drive,\n\n430\n00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.750\nwhich was what we were hoping for.\n\n431\n00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.720\nAnd that's why.\n\n432\n00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.586\nAnd remember,\nif I would've chosen a bigger hard drive,\n\n433\n00:21:17.586 --> 00:21:18.622\nit would've taken a long time.\n\n434\n00:21:18.622 --> 00:21:20.450\nAnd so that does happen.\n\n435\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.960\nNow one thing that you notice right away,\n\n436\n00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.800\nis that the icon changes\nwhere there's a lock.\n\n437\n00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.520\nBut you see that the lock is actually\ncurrently, well, unlocked at this point.\n\n438\n00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.260\nAnd down here on my task bar,\n\n439\n00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.440\nit tells me that it is actually\ncompleted at this point.\n\n440\n00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.210\nSo we're ready.\n\n441\n00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:39.010\nNow if I go ahead and\neject this drive, let me eject it.\n\n442\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:40.780\nSo it's no longer there.\n\n443\n00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.210\nAnd now I can safely remove it,\n\n444\n00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.109\nwhich is what I should have\ndone at the very beginning.\n\n445\n00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.430\nSo it's now removed.\nI'm gonna plug it back in.\n\n446\n00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:52.280\nSo if I now plug the drive back in,\nand in a moment here,\n\n447\n00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.100\nnotice it does say, hey,\nI need to unlock this drive.\n\n448\n00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.760\nSo, let's see, can we see it?\n\n449\n00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.580\nAll right, so there it is.\n\n450\n00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.150\nSo I need to unlock this drive,\nso it's asking me for a password.\n\n451\n00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.350\nSo I can take that drive\nanywhere that I want to,\n\n452\n00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.830\nbut it's always gonna ask for\nthis particular password to do that.\n\n453\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.400\nAnd you see now where\nit's actually locked and\n\n454\n00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.530\nit has a little key inside, saying hey, do\nyou want to actually be able to do this?\n\n455\n00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.604\nNow, this is where the hard part comes in.\n\n456\n00:22:16.604 --> 00:22:21.945\nIf everything is fine, you simply\nunlock it and you are, well, maybe.\n\n457\n00:22:23.595 --> 00:22:25.055\nMaybe I didn't type in the correct one.\n\n458\n00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:26.225\nOh there it goes, okay.\n\n459\n00:22:26.225 --> 00:22:27.565\nSo, there it is.\n\n460\n00:22:27.565 --> 00:22:30.174\nNow it's unlocked, and\nI can get access into that drive.\n\n461\n00:22:30.174 --> 00:22:31.634\nAnd I have a bunch of notes in here and\n\n462\n00:22:31.634 --> 00:22:34.220\nsome different things that\nI have available to us.\n\n463\n00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.350\nSo I can unlock that drive,\nand there it is.\n\n464\n00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.120\nWe are ready to go.\n\n465\n00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.060\nBut what if, though, you don't?\n\n466\n00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.455\nSo let's say somebody steals the drive,\nand there it is.\n\n467\n00:22:41.455 --> 00:22:43.221\nIt's been ripped out of the machine.\n\n468\n00:22:43.221 --> 00:22:49.480\nAnd now they take it home to their new\nmachine here, and they plug it back in.\n\n469\n00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.959\nWell at this point, they shouldn't be\nable to gain access to it to unlock it.\n\n470\n00:22:52.959 --> 00:22:55.269\nNow, I didn't use a super hard password.\n\n471\n00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:57.711\nBut at the same time it should be more of\na challenge if you're going to do this,\n\n472\n00:22:57.711 --> 00:22:59.239\nespecially if you're going\nto take it with you.\n\n473\n00:22:59.239 --> 00:23:01.710\nBut what if you didn't remember?\n\n474\n00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.840\nLet's say you actually stuck this into\nyour bag and go, I just lost a drive,\n\n475\n00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.900\nI don't know.\n\n476\n00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.116\nAnd now two months later as\nyou're cleaning out stuff you go,\n\n477\n00:23:08.116 --> 00:23:09.699\noh there's that drive, and you plug it in.\n\n478\n00:23:09.699 --> 00:23:13.600\nAnd you're like, oh, yeah,\nwhat's that password again?\n\n479\n00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.230\nWell, that's when you\ncan select More options.\n\n480\n00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.790\nAnd then, at that point,\nyou have to enter the recovery key.\n\n481\n00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:24.610\nSo notice that what it's asking for,\nDaniel, is a 48-digit recovery key.\n\n482\n00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.840\nSo it's not something that\nI'm not gonna memorize.\n\n483\n00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.115\nUnless you know Rain Man, I think\nwe're kind of toast, at this point.\n\n484\n00:23:30.115 --> 00:23:30.726\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n485\n00:23:30.726 --> 00:23:34.598\nyou definitely would need that recovery\nkey file at this point in time, and\n\n486\n00:23:34.598 --> 00:23:37.311\nI've had to read this over\nthe phone to many people.\n\n487\n00:23:37.311 --> 00:23:42.135\nAnd I always tell them, get a pen ready\nand be prepared, cuz it's quite lengthy.\n\n488\n00:23:42.135 --> 00:23:43.947\nAnd he's right.\nIt's quite a few characters,\n\n489\n00:23:43.947 --> 00:23:45.800\n48 characters, apparently.\n\n490\n00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.629\nIt does take a little bit\nof time when this happens.\n\n491\n00:23:46.629 --> 00:23:50.250\nMake sure you go slow if you're\nhaving to support someone.\n\n492\n00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:54.110\nOtherwise, you've got that file that\nyou created when we enabled BitLocker.\n\n493\n00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.883\nThat's why Ronnie said,\ndon't save it to the same drive.\n\n494\n00:23:56.883 --> 00:23:58.571\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If he put it on the drive\n\n495\n00:23:58.571 --> 00:24:01.778\nhe's trying to unlock, he's not going\nto be able to look at that key and\n\n496\n00:24:01.778 --> 00:24:04.790\nget the recovery key out of it and\ntype that in and unlock the drive.\n\n497\n00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.237\nIt's going to be encrypted, and\nhe's going to have no access.\n\n498\n00:24:07.237 --> 00:24:11.720\nSo make sure you save those out to another\ndrive so you can go retrieve them.\n\n499\n00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.610\nLike he said, it's a really good idea to\nput something like that up into the cloud.\n\n500\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:17.163\nThat way no matter what\ndevice you're logged into,\n\n501\n00:24:17.163 --> 00:24:20.262\nyou should have access to it and\nthen you can unlock your drive.\n\n502\n00:24:20.262 --> 00:24:25.550\n>> Here is my recovery key that\nwe're taking a look at here and\n\n503\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.920\nthis is actually very critical for\nus to make sure that we see this.\n\n504\n00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.740\nNow if we only have one drive,\nwe know that this is the one but\n\n505\n00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.730\nif I can actually show you\nthe other option here too.\n\n506\n00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:41.300\nIt tells me that I need to look for\nthe recovery key here and\n\n507\n00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.620\nthat it actually ends in this id,\nthis four A, whatever it is.\n\n508\n00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.740\nIf you have multiple of these things,\nyou gotta get the right one and\n\n509\n00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.770\nthat is the one that we're looking for.\n\n510\n00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:56.660\nThe one that ends in 76B7 is the one\nthat I'm looking for and there it is.\n\n511\n00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.660\nIt tells me the identifier.\n\n512\n00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.260\nI thought it was the last few but\n\n513\n00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.510\nit's actually the one that's\nright here at the beginning.\n\n514\n00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.490\nAs long as I have that one that\nmatches what the drive is saying,\n\n515\n00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:09.085\nit is this number right here\nthat I need to enter in now.\n\n516\n00:25:09.085 --> 00:25:12.355\nLet's see if it actually allows\nme to copy and paste this.\n\n517\n00:25:12.355 --> 00:25:13.735\nSome of them will allow you to do it.\n\n518\n00:25:13.735 --> 00:25:18.755\nThe early ones absolutely had you\ntype it in one digit at a time which\n\n519\n00:25:18.755 --> 00:25:24.295\nwas frustrating to say the least in\nthe way that it actually ended up working.\n\n520\n00:25:24.295 --> 00:25:25.735\nSo let's see.\n\n521\n00:25:25.735 --> 00:25:29.900\nNope, it doesn't even allow me to copy and\npaste it in there.\n\n522\n00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.680\nIt says, Ronnie, if you're gonna do this,\n\n523\n00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.770\nit's gonna be a manual copy to put that\nthing in there if you wanna do it but\n\n524\n00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:40.500\nyou can see why this is\nsuch a protection for you.\n\n525\n00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.950\nEven if somebody were\nable to copy that down,\n\n526\n00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.500\nthey still have to take\nthe time to do that.\n\n527\n00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:50.060\nIt doesn't matter what I tried here,\nit was no copying and pasting at all.\n\n528\n00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.010\nI wanna make sure I\nactually did that line.\n\n529\n00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.310\nOh, let's see, maybe I actually\nwas hitting the wrong key.\n\n530\n00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.625\nSo, I'm lying to you.\n\n531\n00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:59.750\n>> Ronnie, why would you lie\nto our viewers like this?\n\n532\n00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:03.020\n>> I hate to say it, being on a MacBook,\nit absolutely had no-\n\n533\n00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.140\n>> It's changed you,\n\n534\n00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.080\nyou're a different man.\n\n535\n00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.730\nI don't even know who you are anymore.\n\n536\n00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:08.190\n>> I know.\n\n537\n00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.610\nApparently, I even copied,\nhow did I copy and paste it wrongly?\n\n538\n00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.200\nSo, that's to, oh.\n\n539\n00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.448\nIt might be, actually, even those dashes.\n\n540\n00:26:15.448 --> 00:26:17.080\n>> Those spaces, yeah.\n\n541\n00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.240\n>> I mean, you name it.\n\n542\n00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.250\nIn that, I'm not actually gonna\ntake the time to do that but\n\n543\n00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.370\nyou can see why this is something.\n\n544\n00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.440\nActually, I think I tried to\npaste it into the password.\n\n545\n00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.300\nMaybe that's why it's not working,\nlet me try it this way.\n\n546\n00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.416\nYeah, let's try it this way.\n\n547\n00:26:32.416 --> 00:26:35.680\nSo, Ctrl + V, there it goes.\n\n548\n00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.700\nNow I can unlock it, if it lets me.\n\n549\n00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.810\nI did press it,\nit is taking its time, there it goes.\n\n550\n00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:42.960\nSo I was lying the whole time.\n\n551\n00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.030\nI thought,\nit's just not even letting me do that.\n\n552\n00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:45.700\nIt's not that.\n\n553\n00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:50.470\nI was trying to do the Cmd + V, which\ndoesn't work, apparently, on Windows, for\n\n554\n00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.140\none reason or another.\n\n555\n00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.970\nSometimes, yeah,\nyou need to look down at the keyboard, and\n\n556\n00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:57.160\nrealize you're pressing\nthe right keys anymore.\n\n557\n00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.750\nBut, yeah, you can be silly like I can and\nthen it doesn't work.\n\n558\n00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.850\nBut notice as long as you have that key,\nthat's what you want.\n\n559\n00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.110\nNow are you gonna leave it on a computer?\n\n560\n00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.480\nNo, that's definitely not\nsomething you wanna do.\n\n561\n00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.700\nEither print it out or make sure\nit's actually stored somewhere safe,\n\n562\n00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.340\nif you are actually gonna be\nusing this to help you out.\n\n563\n00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:19.770\nNow remember you can do this to\nthe entire drive volume as well and\n\n564\n00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:25.890\nthen set a password recovery,\neither by a password itself or\n\n565\n00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.890\nby a USB key too.\n\n566\n00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.860\nIt's like the same process.\n\n567\n00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.950\nWhat they're saying is you can\nuse this as essentially a key, so\n\n568\n00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.330\nthat if this key is missing,\nyou can't boot the computer up.\n\n569\n00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:40.950\nYou can actually set what they call a\nstartup key to make that process work too.\n\n570\n00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:44.975\nWe're not going to do that right now\nbecause it's a 250 gig drive that would\n\n571\n00:27:44.975 --> 00:27:48.585\nhave to encrypt for us to do that and\nit's the same process that we showed you\n\n572\n00:27:48.585 --> 00:27:51.105\nwith a 10 gig drive but\nthat's the only difference.\n\n573\n00:27:51.105 --> 00:27:55.345\nIf I lose this, that's where it becomes\na little bit more problematic but\n\n574\n00:27:55.345 --> 00:27:59.140\nif I do have that recovery key,\nit gives me that ability as well\n\n575\n00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.060\neven during boot up to say hey,\nI need to recover this.\n\n576\n00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.790\nThat means I'd have to type those in\nindividually cuz I don't know how to copy\n\n577\n00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:09.170\nthat from a piece of paper into that\nright then when I'm booting up.\n\n578\n00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:10.260\nThat one you'll have to type in.\n\n579\n00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:14.520\n>> Ronnie will run ever server known to\nman but God forbid you ask him to copy and\n\n580\n00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.530\npaste something, or type something in.\n\n581\n00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.260\nThe man is lost, I'm sorry.\n\n582\n00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:22.500\n>> It is true, I am not good at typing but\nI can do some other things.\n\n583\n00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.642\n>> Hey, we have our strengths,\nwe have our weaknesses.\n\n584\n00:28:24.642 --> 00:28:27.470\nObviously, a BitLocker,\nthough, is a big strength.\n\n585\n00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:31.240\nBeing able to encrypt that entire drive,\nkeep people out, especially those bad guys\n\n586\n00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:36.020\ntrying to steal information, steal data\nfrom us, do things like oh, I don't know,\n\n587\n00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.560\nidentity theft, it's kind of a big deal\nnowadays, gotta watch out for that.\n\n588\n00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.770\nBitLocker helps us out with that.\n\n589\n00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:44.410\nI definitely encourage anyone\nthat's running a mobile\n\n590\n00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.440\nplatform yo use BitLocker.\n\n591\n00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.110\nObviously, it's not that difficult\nunless you have a hard time copy and\n\n592\n00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.295\npasting like my good friend here.\n\n593\n00:28:50.295 --> 00:28:52.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All you have to do is type that guy in,\n\n594\n00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.420\nyou can forget the passwords,\nit's not a big deal.\n\n595\n00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.729\nRonnie, even though you had trouble copy\nand pasting it was a great demonstration.\n\n596\n00:28:58.729 --> 00:29:00.170\n>> Great.\n>> Is there anything else we need to\n\n597\n00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:00.761\nknow about it?\n\n598\n00:29:00.761 --> 00:29:01.700\n>> Not really.\n\n599\n00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.280\nRight now, we've actually gone through and\nmade sure we've taken a look at, at least,\n\n600\n00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.130\nthe major mobility options\n\n601\n00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.500\nthat you can see that's just\nbuilt in to the operating system.\n\n602\n00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.840\nWe didn't even need third party utilities.\n\n603\n00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.700\nIt's all right there inside of Windows\n10 but it does take a little bit of time\n\n604\n00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.660\ngetting used to and\nfamiliar with the configuration of them.\n\n605\n00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.860\nMake sure that you pay\nattention to the policies.\n\n606\n00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.370\nWindows, it really does it.\n\n607\n00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:26.080\nIt really wants to be in the Enterprise,\nso\n\n608\n00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.540\nthose policies are going to\nbecome more and more important.\n\n609\n00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.980\nIf you are a Windows 10 admin, you make\nsure that you actually know those and\n\n610\n00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.600\nall the extra configurations, cuz a lot of\ntimes you are gonna be dealing with people\n\n611\n00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.200\nthat are on laptops,\non tablets, on these phones.\n\n612\n00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.620\nYou just need to know how to configure\nthem and so it is a key environment.\n\n613\n00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.540\nIt is key to understand\nthe context of mobility.\n\n614\n00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.390\nThat's what we did today,\n\n615\n00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.870\nis actually show you all those different\nways that we can configure that.\n\n616\n00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:50.710\n>> Great job, Ronnie.\n\n617\n00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.300\nI hope you guys have enjoyed this episode.\n\n618\n00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.020\nWe had a great time making it for you.\n\n619\n00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:54.870\nThanks for watching.\n\n620\n00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:58.190\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n621\n00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.760\n>> And I'm Ronnie

The guys show that the same configuration settings cn be managed from the GUI in control panel.  Wes then shows how to see the current power plan on his machines using the CLI.  This interface shows us the main piece of information that we will use which is the GUID, Global Unique Identifier, that every power plan has to identify it.  Using some different options, Wes continues to demonstrate how to set a particular power plan as being active as well.  Lastly, the guys show us how to bring up html reports on energy efficiency and battery life that is good to see when dealing with power consumption issues in the workplace.",

00:00:20.100\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're taking a look at Windows 10.\n\n4\n00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.410\nSpecifically take a look at\nconfiguring Windows devices.\n\n5\n00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.138\nAnd who better to help us than Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:25.138 --> 00:00:30.420\nWes Bryan as he comes and helps us out in\nunderstanding more about these devices.\n\n7\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.100\nWes what are we taking a look at today?\n\n8\n00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.040\n>> Well, I tell you Ronnie,\n\n9\n00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.540\nwe've got some things that we\nwant to look at for the exam.\n\n10\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.290\nBecause some of the objectives,\nthe skills measured if you will,\n\n11\n00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.640\nthat call out on the exam\nare power configurations.\n\n12\n00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.030\nConfiguring not only mobility,\nmobile power configurations but\n\n13\n00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.730\ngeneral power options, so that's one of\nthe things that we're gonna dive into.\n\n14\n00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.490\nNow, in another episode within\nthe MCSA with Windows 10,\n\n15\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.150\nin fact Ronnie I think\nyou were in the episode.\n\n16\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.590\nThey did talk about the graphical\nuser interface that we see for\n\n17\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.120\nconfiguring power options, right?\n\n18\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.760\nSo go back and check those out\nbecause we're going get down under\n\n19\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.320\nthe command prompt or\nthe command line today.\n\n20\n00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.030\nAnd we're going to look\nat some of the stuff that\n\n21\n00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.620\nyou can do under the hood\nshould it show up on the exam.\n\n22\n00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.180\nIt's good information to know, but\n\n23\n00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.480\nit's probably going to be some information\nthat you really want to have at your side.\n\n24\n00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.770\nMaybe not at your side if\nyou're in an exam booth, but\n\n25\n00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.680\nup here when you do get\ninto that exam booth.\n\n26\n00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.260\nSo we're going to be looking more\nspecifically at a command known\n\n27\n00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.406\nas power CFG, or\nthe power configuration utility.\n\n28\n00:01:26.406 --> 00:01:30.020\n>> All right, so Wes, as somebody who's\nactually working in the enterprise,\n\n29\n00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.310\nthe idea here is,\nthe very fact is we know that more and\n\n30\n00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.500\nmore people are moving to laptops, and\nof course the BYOD, and what begins\n\n31\n00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.570\nto happen is that you start to lose track\nof how much battery power that you have.\n\n32\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.140\nAnd you start to actually wonder where\nthe actual battery consumption is going or\n\n33\n00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.550\nwhatever it might be.\n\n34\n00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.615\nWindows 10, then,\n\n35\n00:01:49.615 --> 00:01:53.570\nwhat you're telling us is that it has more\nthan just what we see inside the GUI.\n\n36\n00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.845\nAnd what we can do is we can actually find\nout a bit more information information\n\n37\n00:01:56.845 --> 00:01:58.275\nby using this command, right?\n\n38\n00:01:58.275 --> 00:02:02.155\n>> That's really it and like we've\ntalked about in other episodes and\n\n39\n00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:05.995\neven other courses, you're limited\nin the GUI by what you can do.\n\n40\n00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:09.625\nIf they don't have a button for it, you\ndon't have a button that you can push on,\n\n41\n00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:11.315\nyou don't get that functionality.\n\n42\n00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:15.295\nAnd, again in the command prompt here\nyou can see that we can drop down\n\n43\n00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:15.885\nthe command line.\n\n44\n00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:18.965\nWe can do a little bit more that\nwe were a little bit limited\n\n45\n00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:19.895\nto in the power options.\n\n46\n00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:21.660\nSo let's go ahead and jump right in.\n\n47\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.440\nOne of the first things that we're gonna\nlook here, I've got a command prompt or\n\n48\n00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.506\na power shell open.\n\n49\n00:02:25.506 --> 00:02:29.830\nNow, I'm doing this from power shell guys\nyou can do this from an administrative\n\n50\n00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.040\ncommand prompt or an administrative\npower shell command line and\n\n51\n00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.790\nthe reason I'm doing this from power shell\nis because I can launch either one so\n\n52\n00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.200\nwhy not launch just one utility?\n\n53\n00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.560\nSo one of the first things that\nwe're gonna do is look at what this,\n\n54\n00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.490\nhow do we even really, what is the command\nthat we're even looking at here.\n\n55\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.570\nWell, it's the powercfg command.\n\n56\n00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.500\nAnd one of the first things that we\ndo with this is we find out what\n\n57\n00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.850\nare the power plans,\n\n58\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.020\nthe power schemes that are available\ninside of the operating system.\n\n59\n00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.557\nNow if you're in the control panel,\nwe've got a nice GUI to do this but\n\n60\n00:03:03.557 --> 00:03:05.420\nif we're in a command line,\nobviously we don't.\n\n61\n00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.070\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee what we have available.\n\n62\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.970\nWell, one of the first options\nthat I want you to know for\n\n63\n00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.820\nthe exam is the list option.\n\n64\n00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.260\nWhen we run the list option,\nit gives us a series of GUIDs.\n\n65\n00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.460\nNow, I'm sorry for\nthis alphabet soup here, but GUID,\n\n66\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.500\nwhat does that mean for us?\n\n67\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.180\nWell, that's Globally Unique Identifier.\n\n68\n00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.730\nIt's how we identify software and\n\n69\n00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.730\ncertain software settings\ninside of the operating system.\n\n70\n00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.630\nI know what you might be thinking.\n\n71\n00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.990\nYou might look at these numbers here and\nsay,\n\n72\n00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.090\nwell, why would I ever wanna\nremember these numbers?\n\n73\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.310\nGood thing is you don't have to.\n\n74\n00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.340\nThey don't expect you to know these\ncrazy string of numbers, but you have to\n\n75\n00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.370\nunderstand conceptually what these numbers\nmean for us and how we'd get to them.\n\n76\n00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.990\nNow, if we're looking at\nthe command prompt or\n\n77\n00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.200\na power shell, this is what we see.\n\n78\n00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.820\nWhat does this mean for us relative to the\nGUI, so we're gonna kinda jump back and\n\n79\n00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.770\nforth here, Ronnie.\n\n80\n00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.720\nAnd I'm gonna up to power options and\n\n81\n00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.920\nagain we're not going to spend\ntoo much time in the GUI.\n\n82\n00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.600\nDefinitely check out the episodes because\nit was already covered pretty good here.\n\n83\n00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.630\nBut what you'll see here is I have\na series of available power plans right,\n\n84\n00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.630\npreferred plans here.\n\n85\n00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.740\nAnd you can see the different\nones that we have here right.\n\n86\n00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.080\nWe've got balance, we've got high\nperformance, we've got power saver.\n\n87\n00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.150\nWell interestingly enough, if I compare\nthat over to what I see here, right,\n\n88\n00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.705\nyou'll see balanced, high performance,\nand you'll see power saver.\n\n89\n00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:24.790\nWel,l these are the same plans.\n\n90\n00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.526\nBut it's not really too\nhuman readable ,right?\n\n91\n00:04:28.526 --> 00:04:31.547\nThey do give us the benefit here\nof having it in parenthesis so\n\n92\n00:04:31.547 --> 00:04:32.684\nat least we can see it.\n\n93\n00:04:32.684 --> 00:04:36.390\nIt is important that you realize\nwhat you are seeing here.\n\n94\n00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.762\nWhat you're doing and\nreally, how we use this too.\n\n95\n00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:43.570\nAnd one of the great things about these.\n\n96\n00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.175\nThese numbers, let's go and edit and\nsay, it's alphanumeric here.\n\n97\n00:04:48.175 --> 00:04:52.364\nThe string of characters is the same no\nmatter what machine you're on, all right.\n\n98\n00:04:52.364 --> 00:04:56.133\nIt's not like I have one power plan that\nhas a certain identifier, a certain GUID\n\n99\n00:04:56.133 --> 00:04:59.820\nand if I go to another machine,\nit's gonna have a different one, right.\n\n100\n00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.371\nWell, one of the things that\nRonnie mentioned was BYOD, right.\n\n101\n00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:04.544\nIf I want a consistency\nacross all devices,\n\n102\n00:05:04.544 --> 00:05:08.200\nit really would start to get difficult\nif every one of these GUIDs changed.\n\n103\n00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.620\nIt would just be a nightmare to manage.\n\n104\n00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.860\nSo, let's go ahead and switch on over\nto another machine that I have, and\n\n105\n00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.940\nlet's see if that's true.\n\n106\n00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.380\nAgain, we're just going to run that\npowercfg, and if we zoom in here,\n\n107\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.510\nyou can see that I'm just typing list.\n\n108\n00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.840\nAnd when I run that, notice that, well,\nI've got a series of power plans.\n\n109\n00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.510\nNow, I'll show you why there's\nan extra one coming up here.\n\n110\n00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.760\nYou'll notice that there's a little bit\nmore here than I have on the other machine\n\n111\n00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.240\nAnd well that's because I've configured\nit the way I like this machine.\n\n112\n00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.500\nNow I'm gonna copy this real quick.\n\n113\n00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.440\nWhat I want to do is jump back\nto the other machine here and\n\n114\n00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.460\nI want to paste that in there.\n\n115\n00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.670\nNow, there's a reason I did that because\nthis was the high performance GUID\n\n116\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.490\nthat was on a completely\ndifferent machine.\n\n117\n00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.790\nAnd we're not going to do, and\nsit here, take my word for it.\n\n118\n00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.200\nYou can if you want to pause the video and\n\n119\n00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.990\ncheck, but\nthey are identical across both machines.\n\n120\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.390\nAnd that's good for consistency.\n\n121\n00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.390\nMaybe you're in a domain environment,\nwhich most likely if you're running\n\n122\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.560\nWindows 10 Enterprise, you're going\nto be in a domain environment, and\n\n123\n00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.860\nyou want to push these settings and\ndefine them with a Group Policy.\n\n124\n00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.870\nWell, you want them to be consistent,\nright?\n\n125\n00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.170\nIf it's a different\nnumber on every machine,\n\n126\n00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.250\nthere's no way we can centrally\nmanage these settings.\n\n127\n00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.930\nAnd that's one of the reasons\nthey keep it consistent.\n\n128\n00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.080\nNow you'll notice something.\n\n129\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.840\nOne of the things that I\ndid is I copied that GUID.\n\n130\n00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.520\nNow depending on what\nversion of command prompt or\n\n131\n00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.430\npower shell you're in,\nthank goodness we're in Window 10.\n\n132\n00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.939\nAnd one of the things Windows 10 does is\nit gives you the ability to copy the GUID.\n\n133\n00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:35.410\nWhy is that so important?\n\n134\n00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.250\nWell, I don't know about you Ronnie,\nbut you've seen my typing.\n\n135\n00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.540\nI can't type to save my life.\n\n136\n00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.710\nAnd I would hate to have to type that, and\nI certainly don't expect you to type that.\n\n137\n00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.380\nSo what is a GUID?\n\n138\n00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.700\nLet's talk a little bit more about\nwhat the GUIDs themselves are.\n\n139\n00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:55.840\nOkay, the GUID defines a suite, a global\nsuite of power settings for the machine.\n\n140\n00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.690\nNow they can be done at the power plant or\nscheme, you'll see\n\n141\n00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.260\nthat they've changed their names through\nthe years, it's the same concept,\n\n142\n00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.150\nit depends on what you're talking,\nwhat operating system you're in.\n\n143\n00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.850\nBut they can be defined\nat the scheme level or\n\n144\n00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:12.620\nthe power plan level when that says, I've\ngot a pre-defined suite of settings and\n\n145\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.310\nthat's how we're gonna\nidentify that Power Plan.\n\n146\n00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.490\nBut you can also do this\nat the device level.\n\n147\n00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:24.000\nNow, this is where powercfg starts\nto become a little intimidating,\n\n148\n00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.570\ncertainly don't expect you by any\nmeans to again, remember these GUIDs.\n\n149\n00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.910\nBut just to understand what the GUID\nis and what it does for us.\n\n150\n00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.246\nLet me show you what I mean by\ndefining at the settings level.\n\n151\n00:07:34.246 --> 00:07:35.777\nThese are the plans, right?\n\n152\n00:07:35.777 --> 00:07:39.770\nBut if I do a power config,\nand its powercfg.\n\n153\n00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.450\nIt's just I'm so used to calling it\nthe power configuration utility.\n\n154\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.820\nAnd instead of doing list this time,\nI type in query.\n\n155\n00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.800\nNow, Ronnie did you catch the setting and\nthe GUID?\n\n156\n00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.885\nProbably not, right?\n\n157\n00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:51.656\n>> Yeah, too fast for me.\n\n158\n00:07:51.656 --> 00:07:54.428\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what do we have here?\n\n159\n00:07:54.428 --> 00:07:57.200\nWell, let's kind of show you\nagain related back to the GUID.\n\n160\n00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.450\nI'm gonna switch back over\nto my other machine here,\n\n161\n00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.702\ncuz I can zoom in a little bit.\n\n162\n00:08:00.702 --> 00:08:05.392\nAnd, we'll run that same command over\nhere, we'll do the query option and\n\n163\n00:08:05.392 --> 00:08:07.700\nwe're gonna bring up again the GUI.\n\n164\n00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.990\nLike I said, for the most part,\nwe're gonna stay in the command line but\n\n165\n00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.150\nit is kinda good to see this.\n\n166\n00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:20.690\nAll right, so, if I go over to change\nplan settings here in the control panel.\n\n167\n00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:27.020\nAnd then, I choose the advanced power\nsettings down at the bottom right there.\n\n168\n00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:32.450\nIf I choose those, now I get\nthe ability through the graphical\n\n169\n00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.670\nuser interface to define settings\nindividually and I'll go ahead and\n\n170\n00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:39.960\nscroll all the way down because that's\nwhere we are in our command prompt here.\n\n171\n00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.270\nBut if you notice,\nlet me go ahead and shut this down.\n\n172\n00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.290\nAnd, let's look at the last setting\nthat we see here at the bottom.\n\n173\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.090\nNotice it says, reserve battery level.\n\n174\n00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.190\nWhat does that mean for me?\n\n175\n00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.820\nWhat is this crazy GUI mean for me?\n\n176\n00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.160\nWell, it doesn't mean anything to me.\n\n177\n00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.570\nIt means to the system, that how\nthe systems identifies the setting.\n\n178\n00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.750\nAnd, when we look,\nif I expand out battery here,\n\n179\n00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.730\nnotice the last option,\ncomparative to this GUID.\n\n180\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:11.217\nIf we kind of zoom in on this here,\nmaybe, but maybe not.\n\n181\n00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:15.610\n[LAUGH] You can see that I have,\nwell I got, Reserve battery level here.\n\n182\n00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.460\nAnd, if I expand this out,\nnotice that it says, on battery 7%,\n\n183\n00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.975\non power plugged in 7% as well.\n\n184\n00:09:22.975 --> 00:09:25.650\nWell, guess what,\nthat's directly related to\n\n185\n00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:30.040\nReserve battery level that we see right\nhere in command prompt or PowerShell.\n\n186\n00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.410\nAnd notice the value is set down here.\n\n187\n00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:38.120\nSo, every one of these individual granular\nsettings can be defined by a GUID.\n\n188\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.900\nIn fact, they are defined by a GUID.\n\n189\n00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.000\nThank goodness for us, just know\nhow to set the Active Power Plan.\n\n190\n00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.630\nBut it is important when it\ncomes to GUIDs to understand\n\n191\n00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:47.690\nwhat do they even mean for us?\n\n192\n00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.172\nAnd, thank goodness they mean\nabsolutely nothing for us and more for\n\n193\n00:09:51.172 --> 00:09:54.004\nthe system but\nwe might have to implement them at times.\n\n194\n00:09:54.004 --> 00:09:55.017\n>> All right, so Wes,\n\n195\n00:09:55.017 --> 00:09:58.544\nwe've actually taken a look at just\na little bit of information here.\n\n196\n00:09:58.544 --> 00:10:01.512\nBut what you've clearly shown us,\nat least up and this point,\n\n197\n00:10:01.512 --> 00:10:03.080\nis that when using the Power CFG,\n\n198\n00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.853\nwe can actually list at least all the\navailable power plans that we're seeing.\n\n199\n00:10:06.853 --> 00:10:10.692\nOr we can actually query it till she find\nthat one that my computer's actually on\n\n200\n00:10:10.692 --> 00:10:13.350\nright now for\nthe segment you are talking about.\n\n201\n00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:17.000\nBut you just said that I can also be able\nto change a power plan setting through\n\n202\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.860\nthe command prompt here?\n\n203\n00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:18.410\n>> Definitely.\n\n204\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.590\nAnd, that's where that copy portion\nof the command prompt or PowerShell.\n\n205\n00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.722\nIn Windows 10, they did an,\nI don't know why it took so long,\n\n206\n00:10:25.722 --> 00:10:27.710\nyou don't have to right click and\nmark anymore.\n\n207\n00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.010\nYou can just highlight something and copy.\n\n208\n00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.300\nLet me show you what I mean by that.\n\n209\n00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.260\nIf I go back, and I'm going to\njust rerun the same command again,\n\n210\n00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.670\nit's just power CFG list, all right.\n\n211\n00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.200\nNotice that I do have these GUIDs here and\nall I'm gonna do,\n\n212\n00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.990\nlet's say that I wanna change.\n\n213\n00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.750\nI wanna be on the Power Saver plan,\n\n214\n00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.410\nactually I probably should put\nthis on the Balanced plan,\n\n215\n00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.710\nbecause this episode will be very\nshort if this computer goes to sleep.\n\n216\n00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.900\nSo, now I've copied that GUID.\n\n217\n00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.810\nNow, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do\nanother command, Power CFG, and I want to\n\n218\n00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.660\nbe careful with this one guys because\nI'm gonna type two different ways and\n\n219\n00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.252\nthis is something for the exam\nbecause it very well could show up,\n\n220\n00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:13.200\nand I want you guys to\nsee what's going on here.\n\n221\n00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.790\nNotice that I have s or setactive.\n\n222\n00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.080\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n223\n00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.790\nWhat's the difference?\n\n224\n00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.500\nNothing, all right.\n\n225\n00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.430\nAnd if you aren't in this powercfg\nutility, and you've never used it, and\n\n226\n00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.440\nthey gave you an option on the exam,\nwould you know what s meant?\n\n227\n00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.816\nVersus maybe seeing something\nthat says setactive.\n\n228\n00:11:30.816 --> 00:11:33.580\nThey say, you need to apply the active\npower plan, how do you use it?\n\n229\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.920\nWell, if they give you the answer that\nsays setactive, it's kinda obvious.\n\n230\n00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.390\nBut they don't do it like that, right?\n\n231\n00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.148\nMurphy's law says the one way you studied\nit probably won't be the way they ask you\n\n232\n00:11:43.148 --> 00:11:43.760\non the exam.\n\n233\n00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.695\nSo, that's why I want you to\nknow the s option either.\n\n234\n00:11:46.695 --> 00:11:51.420\nNow, for purposes of our demonstration\nhere, I'm gonna spell it out so\n\n235\n00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:56.310\nyou can remember, remember repetition\nleads to your success on the exam.\n\n236\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.940\nSo, I'm gonna spell the whole thing out.\n\n237\n00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:03.000\nSetactive and\nthen all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna paste\n\n238\n00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.350\nthat GUID right there in the command\nprompt and I'm gonna hit enter.\n\n239\n00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.740\nNow, wasn't that amazing?\n\n240\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.040\nDoes it look like it did anything?\n\n241\n00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.320\nWell, that's where that list option,\nthat list parameter comes in.\n\n242\n00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.410\nIf I rerun the list,\nI want you to notice something.\n\n243\n00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.350\nNotice the asterisk symbols here.\n\n244\n00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.220\nThe asterisk symbols are what shows\nme what is the current power plan?\n\n245\n00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.840\nMaybe you've seen on other episodes\nwhere we run like disk part and\n\n246\n00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.390\nif you select a disk,\nit has a little asterisk next to it.\n\n247\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.610\nIt's no different in our powercfg utility.\n\n248\n00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:34.172\nWherever the asterisk symbol is,\nthat dictates what power plan you're on.\n\n249\n00:12:34.172 --> 00:12:37.360\nSo Ronnie, very easy,\nyou don't have to remember the GUIDs,\n\n250\n00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.670\njust copy them in there.\n\n251\n00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.550\nPowercfg space forward slash s or\nforward slash setactive.\n\n252\n00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.950\nPaste that GUID in there,\nyou're good to go.\n\n253\n00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.180\nRerun your list command.\n\n254\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.800\nMake sure you applied the one that\nyou wanted, because if it's a laptop,\n\n255\n00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.990\ncritical laptop, you've accidentally\nset it to the high performance,\n\n256\n00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.580\nyou might come back within\n15 to 20 minutes and\n\n257\n00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.420\nnotice you've got a machine that shut\ndown and maybe you've lost some data.\n\n258\n00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.930\n>> Now Wes, even though this does show us\nhow we can actually set what our power\n\n259\n00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.350\nplan that we want and it actually shows us\nwhat specific power plan that we're on,\n\n260\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.760\na lot of times, what we're really looking\nfor is, especially let's say on a laptop\n\n261\n00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:16.030\nthat made the older, is how well is\nsomething like that battery actually doing\n\n262\n00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.850\nand am I actually close to the time for\nreplacement?\n\n263\n00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.160\nDoes it have some type of\nreporting feature for us?\n\n264\n00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.148\n>> It certainly does and\nI really like this feature.\n\n265\n00:13:25.148 --> 00:13:30.140\nPower CFG has a couple of hidden\nutilities that really are kinda gems and\n\n266\n00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.240\nsometimes, we are intimidated\nby that command line utility and\n\n267\n00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:38.420\nthe first one is, what's known as\nbeing able to run an energy report.\n\n268\n00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:42.320\nHow efficiently is our\ncomputer currently using\n\n269\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.415\nthe energy settings that we have in place.\n\n270\n00:13:44.415 --> 00:13:46.140\nWell, let's go and check that out.\n\n271\n00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.080\nSo again,\nI'm gonna run the powercfg space / and\n\n272\n00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.160\nthis one is a little bit easy to remember\nwhen it comes the one with the options.\n\n273\n00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.620\nThis one actually,\nyou just spell out energy.\n\n274\n00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:00.570\nAnd again, as we know with Wes' spelling,\nhopefully I can spell energy.\n\n275\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.280\nNow, what this does is it\nstarts a tracing, all right?\n\n276\n00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.730\nIf you guys have ever been\nin performance monitor, and\n\n277\n00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.084\nyou're running one of the data\ncollector sets, the DCS', and it takes,\n\n278\n00:14:09.084 --> 00:14:12.410\neven if you don't make a data collector\nset, you want the system to find.\n\n279\n00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:15.439\nAnd it sits there and you run it for\nhowever long it is that you wanna run it.\n\n280\n00:14:15.439 --> 00:14:17.790\nAnd then, you come back and\nyou stop it, all right?\n\n281\n00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.160\nAnd then, once it's stopped,\n\n282\n00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.470\nyou'll see that it takes a second,\nit generates a report.\n\n283\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.250\nAnd then, in the report's location,\nyou can open it up and\n\n284\n00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.320\nyou can view the information.\n\n285\n00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.750\nSo, when it says tracing, what it's doing\nis it's looking at certain settings,\n\n286\n00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:34.250\ndevice settings, that's probably querying\nsome of those GUIDs that we look for\n\n287\n00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.870\nto try to generate this information.\n\n288\n00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.255\nTakes about, they say about 60 seconds,\n\n289\n00:14:38.255 --> 00:14:41.255\ncuz it's just gonna\nanalyze this information.\n\n290\n00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:43.780\nFirst, it actually goes in two parts,\nright?\n\n291\n00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.710\nIt gathers the information and\nthen it analyzes the information.\n\n292\n00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.840\nNow, maybe a third part, if you will.\n\n293\n00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.390\nOnce it gets done analyzing\nthe information, it turns around and\n\n294\n00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.490\nit gives you some output, right?\n\n295\n00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.788\nNow, the output is what\nyou can then go through,\n\n296\n00:15:00.788 --> 00:15:05.143\nscroll through the list, and\nyou can find out what's going on.\n\n297\n00:15:05.143 --> 00:15:10.006\nBut, be careful with that, because\nnotice what we see here on our screen.\n\n298\n00:15:10.006 --> 00:15:14.845\nWe see on our screen it says, energy\nefficiency problems were found, right?\n\n299\n00:15:14.845 --> 00:15:17.246\nWell, great.\n\n300\n00:15:17.246 --> 00:15:18.361\nWhat are they?\n\n301\n00:15:18.361 --> 00:15:22.720\nI've got 14 errors, I've got 6 warnings,\nand I've got 23 informational.\n\n302\n00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.728\nIf you've ever been in event viewer,\n\n303\n00:15:24.728 --> 00:15:29.100\nyou've probably seen some of this\nevent levels inside of event viewer.\n\n304\n00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.990\nBut it's a generic information so\nit really doesn't show us much.\n\n305\n00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.760\nNow, Ronnie and I were actually talking\nbefore we started this episode and\n\n306\n00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.130\ndepending on how you run this,\nwhether you're a standard user or\n\n307\n00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:45.420\nan administrator, dictates where\nyou'll find that, all right?\n\n308\n00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.670\nSo, I'm so used to running these command\nprompts or PowerShell at administrative\n\n309\n00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:56.590\nlevel, that, when I accidentally run it\nin a standard user, I lost the report.\n\n310\n00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.513\nThe reports actually put in the profile so\nwherever your user profile is,\n\n311\n00:16:00.513 --> 00:16:02.930\nif you run it as a standard user,\nlook there.\n\n312\n00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.523\nBut let's go ahead and\nlet's find that report.\n\n313\n00:16:05.523 --> 00:16:10.359\nAnd by default, again, if you're in\nan administrative command prompt,\n\n314\n00:16:10.359 --> 00:16:12.984\nyou're going to be looking down in c:.\n\n315\n00:16:12.984 --> 00:16:15.553\nSo we'll go ahead down here and\nit drops it right there and\n\n316\n00:16:15.553 --> 00:16:19.560\nyou'll notice this energy report here and\nwe'll go ahead and open that up.\n\n317\n00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.490\nNow what are we seeing here.\n\n318\n00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.060\nLet's see if we can zoom in.\n\n319\n00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.240\nMake that a little bit easier to read.\n\n320\n00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.030\nThere we go.\n\n321\n00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.480\nAll right.\nSo what is it we're seeing here.\n\n322\n00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.660\nWell, a lot of information believe it or\nnot.\n\n323\n00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.330\nI mean it's almost like it combines\nlike our MS Info 32 system information,\n\n324\n00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.840\na portion of that, and\nputs it right here in this report.\n\n325\n00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.910\nNice HTML format that we\ncan launch in a browser.\n\n326\n00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.550\nEven more so, let's say Ronnie's\nthe system administrator.\n\n327\n00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.300\nAll right, and maybe I'm a junior\nadministrator and he's not around.\n\n328\n00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.420\nHe says, Wes, I need you to generate a\nreport, I need you to email it out to me.\n\n329\n00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.850\nWell, I can do exactly that,\n\n330\n00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.900\nI can generate this report or\nyou can even script it out, right.\n\n331\n00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.720\nAnd have somebody just click a little\nbatch file that runs this and\n\n332\n00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.440\nyou could say email me the document.\n\n333\n00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.190\nYou're having problems with your computer,\nbe it's shutting down on you or what\n\n334\n00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.630\nare you doing on the computer, the person\nsays, I'm not really doing anything.\n\n335\n00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.060\nWell now as administrator, I can say,\n\n336\n00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:12.280\nwell do I, first of all have the right,\ndo I even have the right machine?\n\n337\n00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.490\nI can see what time it was running,\n\n338\n00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.950\nyou can see a lot of these\ninformation here as well.\n\n339\n00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.810\nI can see the BIOS date, right.\n\n340\n00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:24.050\nMaybe Intel out there's got like a thermal\ndynamics driver something that's\n\n341\n00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.310\nI don't know, not installed, right.\n\n342\n00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.030\nAnd I've might see that I need to update.\n\n343\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.950\nBut here's where it starts\nto get interesting, and\n\n344\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.810\nhere's one of the things I really, really\nenjoy about this Energy report is the fact\n\n345\n00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.600\nthat these errors,\nwe have tangible information.\n\n346\n00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.010\nWe don't have guides anymore that\nreally just looks like a bunch of\n\n347\n00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.000\ngarbled output on the screen.\n\n348\n00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.170\nBut, if I really want to, I can zoom in\nhere and I can look at this information.\n\n349\n00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.420\nI can see it says,\ndisplay timeout is disabled.\n\n350\n00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.540\nRight, you don't wanna do that.\n\n351\n00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.010\nNow understand some of these errors are\ngenerated by the way I set up the power\n\n352\n00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.650\nplay on this laptop so\nthat I can remote into it.\n\n353\n00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:06.200\nAnd it's telling me that you're\ntime out is completely disabled,\n\n354\n00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.600\nyour on a mobile, not a mobile operating\nsystem but a, on a mobile device and\n\n355\n00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.930\nyou said don't shut it,\ndon't put it to sleep.\n\n356\n00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.400\nWell, that could be a bad thing.\n\n357\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.240\nIn my case it's planned which is good.\n\n358\n00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.960\n[LAUGH] System availability.\n\n359\n00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.100\nYou can see some of the other things.\n\n360\n00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.150\nThe big things with the red ones here,\nhonestly to understand,\n\n361\n00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.620\nyou don't have to know any of this\ninformation for the exam itself.\n\n362\n00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.490\nJust know that the red ones here,\nthey're errors.\n\n363\n00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.710\nAnd, I know what the errors\nare because they're color coated.\n\n364\n00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.490\nRight?\nAnd, just like picture books.\n\n365\n00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.830\nIf you got a lot of pictures,\nI don't mind reading that book.\n\n366\n00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.000\nAnd you can see device drivers here but\n\n367\n00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.360\nwanna get down into some of the error or\nthe warnings, okay?\n\n368\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.320\nSo look at the warnings here right.\n\n369\n00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.070\nNot everything that's you know\nnecessarily cause you problems.\n\n370\n00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.220\nBut it could and you might need\nto know that and so you know.\n\n371\n00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.600\nYou've got errors,\nyou've got warnings, and\n\n372\n00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.840\nthe last thing you've got is informational\nwhen it comes to informational stuff,\n\n373\n00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.810\nthese aren't things that\nactually hurt the laptop.\n\n374\n00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.760\nThey just tell you here's\nthe current state.\n\n375\n00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.630\nI don't know when I did the power\nCFG forward slash query.\n\n376\n00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.100\nI don't know what any of those GUIDs mean.\n\n377\n00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.310\nI would have to literally look down\nat every single individual setting,\n\n378\n00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.000\nthen maybe go down and\ndo some research to figure out what it is.\n\n379\n00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.560\nHere, I know what it is.\n\n380\n00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.790\nWhat is the active power plan?\n\n381\n00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.760\nThis is the original equipment\nmanufactured balanced.\n\n382\n00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.630\nWhat do we see here Ronnie?\n\n383\n00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.170\nKind of looks like that same crazy\nstring of GUIDs that we just\n\n384\n00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.730\nseen in the command prompt.\n\n385\n00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.250\nAnd again, just basic,\nyour basic settings.\n\n386\n00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.790\nNow this is also really cool, too.\n\n387\n00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:36.700\nI like this because it tells you,\nwhat kind of battery do I have?\n\n388\n00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.130\nNotice the Chemistry right there,\ntells me it's a lithium ion.\n\n389\n00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.640\nTells me right away what it is.\n\n390\n00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.740\nTells me the Design Capacity.\n\n391\n00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.490\nSee these XPSs that we had, Ronnie and I\nand some of the other hosts, we've had for\n\n392\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.570\nawhile now.\n\n393\n00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.300\nI don't know how many years,\nbut when they first came out\n\n394\n00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.770\nyou could see what the charge\ncapacity was, almost 50,000 Right?\n\n395\n00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:59.310\nAnd now, over the lifetime of the battery\nand the usage, I can see that the current\n\n396\n00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:03.520\nfull charge is considerably lower that\nwhat it was when it first came out.\n\n397\n00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.080\nSo then, maybe, if again,\nrunning into hit this report, and\n\n398\n00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.950\nhe is troubleshooting this, he might say,\nwell, I found out what it is right away.\n\n399\n00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:14.264\nYour charge capacity is 12,000,\nwhen it showed it'd originally been 50.\n\n400\n00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.090\nNow we know that there's\na battery problem,\n\n401\n00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.420\nwe might end up having\nto replace the battery.\n\n402\n00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.540\nAnd we're gonna talk more\nabout these sleep states.\n\n403\n00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.360\nI don't want to go into\nthem too much here, but\n\n404\n00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.090\nyou can see the different low power\nstates and if they're supported.\n\n405\n00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.430\nSo I'm gonna kind of breeze by on those\ncuz I want to get back to the command\n\n406\n00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.050\nprompt with that one.\n\n407\n00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:36.440\nAnd so Ronnie, what it comes down to it,\nenergy report is a very good thing and\n\n408\n00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.370\na lot of people don't ever use it, because\nthey're so used to going to that GUI.\n\n409\n00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:45.970\nWell if I go to the GUI and Ronnie asks me\nthe same information, what do I gotta do?\n\n410\n00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.720\nI gotta take about 50 screenshots and\nbundle it up in a zip file folder and\n\n411\n00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.530\nsend it out to him and\n\n412\n00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:54.010\nhe's gotta try and figure out in all\nthose screenshots what he's looking at.\n\n413\n00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.710\nVersus one html document.\n\n414\n00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.797\nLike we're doing here, scrolls to it,\nfind the settings and says,\n\n415\n00:20:58.797 --> 00:21:01.220\nthat's your corporate or maybe nothing is.\n\n416\n00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.290\nWe gotta figure out and go elsewhere.\n\n417\n00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.020\nSo the very cool report,\nI really like think this one.\n\n418\n00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.530\n>> Yeah.\nThe nice thing about this\n\n419\n00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:11.660\nis that it really does generate that\none report that it really save us from\n\n420\n00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.520\nhaving to go into the event and\ntrying to find those settings instead.\n\n421\n00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.810\nand it actually did list\nout the warnings and\n\n422\n00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.410\nthe errors that we saw as well\nas the informational matter.\n\n423\n00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:24.480\nNow, the energy report really does help\nus in the fact that it gives us about\n\n424\n00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.280\na 60 seconds scan of real-time data\nthat the machine is actually generating,\n\n425\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.310\nthat Windows 10 is actually capturing.\n\n426\n00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.890\nBut remember that there's actually\nsomething nice about Windows 10, as well,\n\n427\n00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:36.290\nthat is designed not\nonly to work on desktops.\n\n428\n00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:40.830\nBut also, on mobile devices and they\nspecifically try to plan for windows 10 to\n\n429\n00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.882\nbe much more energy efficient\nespecially when working with batteries.\n\n430\n00:21:43.882 --> 00:21:47.380\nAnd she specifically reports for\nbatteries.\n\n431\n00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.330\n>> This is the second one I mentioned,\nlike I said, I actually like this\n\n432\n00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.990\none a little bit better than\nthe first one that we just seen and\n\n433\n00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.690\nthe editor reports were really nice but\nHow about a battery report, right?\n\n434\n00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:02.380\nWe talked all the settings themselves\nrelated to how a systems is handling and\n\n435\n00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.520\nmanaging power settings.\n\n436\n00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.820\nThe acpi settings inside\nthe operating system.\n\n437\n00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.950\nWell, how about a battery report?\n\n438\n00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:08.910\nLet's check that out here.\n\n439\n00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.150\nSo, I'm gonna run powercfg,\nand I'm gonna run a forward /.\n\n440\n00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.150\nAnd, I'm gonna type quite\nliterally batteryreport.\n\n441\n00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.210\nAll right, and when I hit enter,\nit gives me an error.\n\n442\n00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.880\nWell why is it giving me an error?\n\n443\n00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.490\nI'm able to perform operation,\nunexpected error has occurred.\n\n444\n00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:28.610\nWell, that's actually because guess what,\nI'm not on a laptop.\n\n445\n00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:32.810\nThis is a desktop machine that I'm remoted\ninto so it doesn't have that option.\n\n446\n00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.440\nSo if you get this error and\nyou're remoting in,\n\n447\n00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.520\nyou should really know the device\nthat you're remoting into, regardless\n\n448\n00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.980\nthat might be the reason that's,\nit is the reason you're getting that.\n\n449\n00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.880\nSo let's go back over to a laptop and\nrun the same things.\n\n450\n00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.240\nSo we're gonna do a Power CFG and\nwe're gonna run our battery report.\n\n451\n00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.290\nNow this ones really cool because\nit doesn't take any tracing data.\n\n452\n00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:56.280\nNotice Ronnie, the moment I hit\nthat command it says it's ready.\n\n453\n00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.500\nNow again, if you're running\nthis from a standard user,\n\n454\n00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:03.670\nstandard users have the privileges\nif you will to run this report but\n\n455\n00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.380\nthey're gonna find it in\ntheir user profile, right.\n\n456\n00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.660\nAdministrators, they're the ones that get\ninto Sequel and standard users don't.\n\n457\n00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:15.530\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ndrop down to our file explorer here.\n\n458\n00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.350\nAnd now, notice that we got two reports.\n\n459\n00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:20.100\nNow, we got a battery-report.html.\n\n460\n00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.680\nNow, this shouldn't be\nmuch of a surprise here.\n\n461\n00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.820\nIt's the same html format.\n\n462\n00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.820\nright?\n\n463\n00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.210\nAnd, let's zoom in there,\nmake it a little easier to see.\n\n464\n00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:32.400\nAnd, I can see right now\nthat it's my tablet.\n\n465\n00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.460\nI can see what the manufacturer is.\n\n466\n00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.000\nI can see BIOS revision too.\n\n467\n00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.720\nAnd then if I scroll down,\nnotice I don't have all those errors and\n\n468\n00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.960\nthose information this, and warning this,\nand red light, yellow light, green light.\n\n469\n00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.530\nAll I get is information\ndirectly related to the battery.\n\n470\n00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.297\nHence, Battery Report.\n\n471\n00:23:51.297 --> 00:23:55.761\nAnd I can see though that the battery is\nreporting the same information that it\n\n472\n00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:58.793\ndid in the energy report\nhere at the battery report.\n\n473\n00:23:58.793 --> 00:24:01.054\nSo, this information is\nisn't any difference guys.\n\n474\n00:24:01.054 --> 00:24:02.619\nJust as a head's up.\n\n475\n00:24:02.619 --> 00:24:04.844\nHowever this is, and\nthis is what I really like.\n\n476\n00:24:04.844 --> 00:24:06.860\nLike I said,\nthis is one that's kinda hidden.\n\n477\n00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.967\nIt's been around for a while.\n\n478\n00:24:07.967 --> 00:24:09.380\nIt's not the first time we've seen it.\n\n479\n00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.720\nBut like Ronnie says, because of Windows\n10 being so integrated into BYOD,\n\n480\n00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.230\nyou really should use this.\n\n481\n00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:20.625\nAnd, it just shows me what the remaining\ncapacity is, and the certain times, and\n\n482\n00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:21.910\nit does trending data.\n\n483\n00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.936\nAnd then it'll come down\nhere at the bottom and\n\n484\n00:24:24.936 --> 00:24:27.660\nit'll tell me that I generated a report.\n\n485\n00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.811\nNow Ronnie, other thing that\nI like about this one is, and\n\n486\n00:24:31.811 --> 00:24:36.132\nI'll probably have to shrink\nthis up just a little bit here,\n\n487\n00:24:36.132 --> 00:24:40.130\nzoom out there,\nis the graph that this provides.\n\n488\n00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.210\nIt gives me a graph, a chart.\n\n489\n00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:47.430\nSo that I can turn around and I can see\nwhere the battery drain was trending data,\n\n490\n00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.810\nright, over a pattern of time.\n\n491\n00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.830\nIn this case,\nit's over the last three days.\n\n492\n00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:55.060\nSo, I can see, is the battery\nperforming the way I need it to?\n\n493\n00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.330\nWe know that batteries are gonna,\nfrom the factory,\n\n494\n00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.720\nstart losing their lives, their lifespan.\n\n495\n00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.640\nThat's just what batteries do.\n\n496\n00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.480\nBut are they doing this in a efficient\nmanner which means that the laptops gonna\n\n497\n00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.440\nlast a year and\nthe battery itself I should say or\n\n498\n00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.260\nis the battery pretty much gonna\nbe dead within a few weeks.\n\n499\n00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.695\nAnd we can see that information, we got\nwarranties on any of our devices and\n\n500\n00:25:15.695 --> 00:25:17.145\nthat happens, well guess what?\n\n501\n00:25:17.145 --> 00:25:20.535\nWe've got valid information that could\nsay hey, what's wrong with the battery?\n\n502\n00:25:20.535 --> 00:25:23.115\nWe might need to return\nit to the manufacturer.\n\n503\n00:25:23.115 --> 00:25:26.785\nAll right usage history, now you can\nsee that there's not a lot of usage.\n\n504\n00:25:26.785 --> 00:25:29.665\nI guess apparently I don't\nuse my computer much there.\n\n505\n00:25:29.665 --> 00:25:32.965\nAnd I can also see the battery\ncapacity history all right.\n\n506\n00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:34.125\nWhat's a full charge?\n\n507\n00:25:34.125 --> 00:25:36.385\nThis information is all\nrelated to what we saved.\n\n508\n00:25:36.385 --> 00:25:38.595\nIt just gave the what,\nwhere are we at now, and\n\n509\n00:25:38.595 --> 00:25:40.780\nthis is over a period of time here.\n\n510\n00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.360\nBattery life estimates, right?\n\n511\n00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.590\nWe'll talk a little bit more\nabout that connected standby,\n\n512\n00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:49.040\nand why that information is empty.\n\n513\n00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.120\nHow about not from a period of time?\n\n514\n00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.210\nHow about all the way since I\ninstalled this operating system?\n\n515\n00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.710\nAll right, so,\nif you get this mobile device, right?\n\n516\n00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.310\nYour company maybe does imaging or\nsomething.\n\n517\n00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.860\nOr maybe your get it OEM, right from\nan original equipment manufacturer.\n\n518\n00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.908\nYou're going to see the battery usage\nstatistics and the battery charge capacity\n\n519\n00:26:08.908 --> 00:26:12.320\nfrom the moment that manufacturer\ninstalled the operating system.\n\n520\n00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.509\nSo lot of good information,\nlike I said, you could take this,\n\n521\n00:26:15.509 --> 00:26:18.937\nyou can take these battery, or\nthese reports and if somebody is your\n\n522\n00:26:18.937 --> 00:26:22.846\nadministrator and you're helping out or\nyou're one of the administrator,\n\n523\n00:26:22.846 --> 00:26:27.270\nyou can collect this information and then\nwe can analyze it overtime, no difference.\n\n524\n00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.893\nConsider it as kinda like\na performance baseline for\n\n525\n00:26:29.893 --> 00:26:32.500\nyour battery and your energy reports.\n\n526\n00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.689\n>> This is actually really critical\ninformation especially for\n\n527\n00:26:35.689 --> 00:26:39.670\na company that is going to be managing\nmultiple devices where they have to keep\n\n528\n00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:43.610\na track of the lifespan of these devices\nespecially on their battery power.\n\n529\n00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:47.249\nA lot of times it is easy just to think\nthat somebody isn't plugging it in\n\n530\n00:26:47.249 --> 00:26:47.977\ncorrectly but\n\n531\n00:26:47.977 --> 00:26:51.450\nwhat this gives us the ability to do\nright is to have this report run.\n\n532\n00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.922\nAnd we can actually tell them we need\nto run this report over several days,\n\n533\n00:26:54.922 --> 00:26:56.378\ngather the historical data and\n\n534\n00:26:56.378 --> 00:26:59.660\nsee if we are actually are trending\nthe way that we need to.\n\n535\n00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:03.843\nWe might find out that everybody on that\nXPS12 that has that one, the battery life\n\n536\n00:27:03.843 --> 00:27:07.846\nis running just about the same in this two\nor three years later and we realize that\n\n537\n00:27:07.846 --> 00:27:11.349\nthat means hey, those batteries\nare draining at a consistent rate.\n\n538\n00:27:11.349 --> 00:27:15.457\nBut you may also find that if you're doing\nthis with multiple laptops at the same\n\n539\n00:27:15.457 --> 00:27:17.664\ntime, you find one is actually spiking and\n\n540\n00:27:17.664 --> 00:27:20.510\nnow it can't hold as much of\na charge as the other ones.\n\n541\n00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:24.314\nThat may actually give you an indication\nthat a warranty call is available and\n\n542\n00:27:24.314 --> 00:27:27.010\nWindows 10 is right there to help you out.\n\n543\n00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:29.950\nThe other idea behind\nusing the Power CFG here,\n\n544\n00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:34.730\nright is from the command prompt,\nif we can type it, it also means Windows\n\n545\n00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:38.690\n10 is also giving us the ability\nto create scripts with it as well.\n\n546\n00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:42.710\nAnd that's what we also want to\nmake sure that we understand too.\n\n547\n00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.000\nIs that these power configurations, even\nthough they might not seem very important\n\n548\n00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.130\nto, well, you and me if were just thinking\nabout, I just want to get on my laptop.\n\n549\n00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:56.110\nBut to a company that is monitoring energy\nefficiency to a company that wants to\n\n550\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:00.840\nbe able to run these on multiple devices\nat the same time, the power CFG is the one\n\n551\n00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.180\nthat gives us all the details that we\nactually need, and can really help us out.\n\n552\n00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.880\nEspecially, when we\nare actually doing that idea\n\n553\n00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.390\nof historical performance monitoring too.\n\n554\n00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:14.940\nNow, Wes, there's a lot more to go\non battery power but as far as what\n\n555\n00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.010\nwe're taking a look at in just being able\nto see the reports, and just being able\n\n556\n00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.865\nto pull out the power plan, is there\nany other details that we need to know?\n\n557\n00:28:22.865 --> 00:28:26.390\n>> No I was thinking pretty much the same\nthing that you had just mentioned about\n\n558\n00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:28.080\nthe scripting capabilities.\n\n559\n00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.200\nBecause of the fact that,\nif you're watching us right now,\n\n560\n00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.390\nyou might be thinking,\nwell why would I have to script that out?\n\n561\n00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:35.240\nI've got a single computer here.\n\n562\n00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:40.000\nBut with the trend of these mobile\ndevices, and there could be 500 of them.\n\n563\n00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.560\nWell, 500 unless you're getting paid\nhourly you probably don't want to going\n\n564\n00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.110\nsneakernet computer to computer\nto computer doing this.\n\n565\n00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.312\nSo you can provision\nit,a little bit easier,\n\n566\n00:28:49.312 --> 00:28:51.410\na little more simplified administration.\n\n567\n00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:55.770\nBut as far as the settings,\nknow the difference between like for\n\n568\n00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:58.110\ninstance an s and a set active.\n\n569\n00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:06.350\nThey're just very, very notorious for\njust do you know the command, right.\n\n570\n00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.960\nYou don't ever have to type set active but\n\n571\n00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.940\nI would give you a recommendation for\nthis exam.\n\n572\n00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.180\nType it out like I've been typing it out,\nset active, set active, and\n\n573\n00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.179\njust keep doing that over and\nover and over.\n\n574\n00:29:16.179 --> 00:29:18.525\nSo when you see it on the exam they\ndon't give you that option but\n\n575\n00:29:18.525 --> 00:29:19.960\nthey do give you that forward slash s.\n\n576\n00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.483\nYou'll know exactly what it is and\n\n577\n00:29:21.483 --> 00:29:24.380\nhopefully you'll be able to make\nthe right decision on the exam.\n\n578\n00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.810\n>> Yeah getting ready for\nthe exam is a big part of this.\n\n579\n00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:30.460\nRemembering that what we're doing here is\nwe're taking a look at Windows devices\n\n580\n00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.010\nthat we're actually\nbeing able to configure.\n\n581\n00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:35.940\nWindows 10 is designed to be able\nto run not only on laptops but\n\n582\n00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.070\nas well as tablets and\nof course even mobile devices.\n\n583\n00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.850\nThat's why we're actually seeing\nthis as being a very important part.\n\n584\n00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:45.780\nBattery life is by far still the most\ndisappointing aspect of mobile computing,\n\n585\n00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:50.140\nand that means Windows 10 wants you\nto be able to manage it even better.\n\n586\n00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:55.140\nSo in this episode, we did take a look at\nthat big command that we call powercfg.\n\n587\n00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.440\nThat will actually allow us to go to\nrun those reports that we need to and\n\n588\n00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.610\nactually show what particular\nbattery plan that we are on and\n\n589\n00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:04.665\neven be able to set another\nbattery plan that we need to.\n\n590\n00:30:04.665 --> 00:30:08.158\nWes actually did talk to us about\neach one of those and showed us\n\n591\n00:30:08.158 --> 00:30:12.510\nthe available reports and the benefits of\nactually taking a look at them as well and\n\n592\n00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.960\nthen emphasized for\nus the idea of scripting too.\n\n593\n00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.730\nWell that's a great place for\nus to go and end this episode then.\n\n594\n00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:23.230\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n595\n00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:23.960\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n596\n00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.320\n>> And we'll see you next

and\n\n3\n00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.967\ntoday we're tickling and\nfiguring Windows devices,\n\n4\n00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:22.710\nspecifically focusing on Windows 10.\n\n5\n00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.280\nWindows 10 is our current\noperating system in Windows for\n\n6\n00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.540\ndesktops as well as laptops,\nphones, tablet PCs, you name it.\n\n7\n00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.440\nIt's actually a big operating system\nthat we're actually focusing in on.\n\n8\n00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.450\nAnd we're taking a look at power\nconfiguration options that we've had\n\n9\n00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.310\nin a previous episode and it was so jam\npacked that we needed to take a part two.\n\n10\n00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.630\nAnd who better to help us out in\nunderstanding the rest of what we need to\n\n11\n00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.930\nthen Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.050\nWes, what is left for us, we've taken a\nlook at a lot of information on PowerCFG.\n\n13\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.320\nSo what do we have left to do?\n\n14\n00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.330\n>> Yeah, I talked way too\nmuch in that first episode,\n\n15\n00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.610\nRonnie just let me ramble on.\n\n16\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.844\nNo, in all seriousness guys, there\nare power CFG, it's got so many options.\n\n17\n00:01:04.844 --> 00:01:07.957\nThere are a few more that I wanted\nto hit just so when you were,\n\n18\n00:01:07.957 --> 00:01:11.867\nif they ask you any question about power\nCFG on the exam you're going to knock\n\n19\n00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:13.110\nit out of the ball park.\n\n20\n00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.902\nAnd you'll probably know\nmore than you need to for\n\n21\n00:01:15.902 --> 00:01:20.420\nthe exam which is always better to be\nover prepared than under prepared.\n\n22\n00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.780\nSo, one of the things we didn't mention\nwhen we talk about power management we\n\n23\n00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.650\nreally haven't talked about the different\npower states that a computer can be in.\n\n24\n00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.640\nI do want to take a little bit\nof time to kind of explain this.\n\n25\n00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.660\nNow from a basic standpoint\nwe've got two major\n\n26\n00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.130\ndifferent low-powered states, all right?\n\n27\n00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.170\nIn one of those powered states\nit breaks down even farther.\n\n28\n00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.470\nBut, let's go ahead with\nthe high level overview,\n\n29\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.160\nthe umbrella overview if you will.\n\n30\n00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.470\nAnd, that's the sleep and hibernate.\n\n31\n00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.940\nNow, you might see other things too,\n\n32\n00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.900\nstandby, suspend, depends on\nwhat operating system you're in.\n\n33\n00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.470\nBut, largely for us over the last\ncouple of Windows operating systems\n\n34\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.280\nwe're really only talking about sleep and\nhibernation.\n\n35\n00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.590\nSo, what's the difference\nbetween these two?\n\n36\n00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.870\nCuz they're both low powered states.\n\n37\n00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.560\nWell, there's a couple of\nthings to consider here.\n\n38\n00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.758\nOne is how fast if your computer\nis in a low powered state,\n\n39\n00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:16.742\ndo you wanna resume normal operations?\n\n40\n00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:20.130\nHow fast do you wanna get back\nto your productive desktop?\n\n41\n00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.800\nWell, that's one consideration.\n\n42\n00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.910\nThe other consideration is how important,\nwell I guess your data's always important.\n\n43\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.620\nHow important is your data?\n\n44\n00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.810\nWell it's always important,\n\n45\n00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.650\nbut can you afford to lose information or\nnot lose information?\n\n46\n00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.650\nThat's gonna be a very important\nthing to understand for\n\n47\n00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.810\nwhat's known as hibernation, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.130\nSo what are the differences\nbetween sleep and hibernation?\n\n49\n00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.700\nWell when we talk about sleep\nwhat happens is your computer and\n\n50\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.290\nyour devices are put in a low powered\nstate, but there's a little bit of\n\n51\n00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.890\nan electrical current that's just\nconstantly refreshing the RAM, right?\n\n52\n00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.390\nWe talk about it in our A+ courses,\nyou know the volatile nature of RAM.\n\n53\n00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.880\nGo back and check some of those episodes\nout if this sounds foreign to you.\n\n54\n00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.310\nBut the problem with RAM is well,\n\n55\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.490\nif I pull the plug,\nall the data that's in RAM is lost.\n\n56\n00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.370\nWell certain aspects maybe you're not\n\n57\n00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.700\nconcerned about then in\nother aspects maybe you are.\n\n58\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.757\nWell if you're more concerned about a low\npowered state and just power efficiency\n\n59\n00:03:15.757 --> 00:03:19.417\nand you're not really keeping documents\nopen on your desktop and stuff.\n\n60\n00:03:19.417 --> 00:03:22.808\nThen sleep state might be okay\nif you know you're going to\n\n61\n00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:27.543\nresume to normal operations because if\nyour computer goes into a sleep state and\n\n62\n00:03:27.543 --> 00:03:31.590\nyour battery completely loses power,\nyour data's gone, right?\n\n63\n00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.180\nIt's still in memory,\nit's being refreshed,\n\n64\n00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.590\nbut once that refresh doesn't happen\nanymore, all the data is lost.\n\n65\n00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.750\nThat brings us to our\nsecond major power state.\n\n66\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.500\nThat's hibernation.\n\n67\n00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.800\nSo what's the difference?\n\n68\n00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.088\nAll right, well this is\nactually a zero powered state.\n\n69\n00:03:48.088 --> 00:03:53.130\nNow, they have some classifications for\nit that we'll talk about in a second.\n\n70\n00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.972\nBut what happens with hibernation is\ninstead of keeping the current to the RAM,\n\n71\n00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:03.172\nwe take the state of the desktop and\nthe configurations.\n\n72\n00:04:03.172 --> 00:04:07.661\nAll of that gets bundled in and written\ninto a file called hyberfield.sys, and\n\n73\n00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:11.614\nthat's stored on the hard drive,\nand then everything is turned off.\n\n74\n00:04:11.614 --> 00:04:13.160\nNow you might say wait a second Wes.\n\n75\n00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160\nYou mean everything there,\nthe computer's shut down?\n\n76\n00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.070\nWell, yes I do.\n\n77\n00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.990\nAll right, so\nwhy would I use one or the other.\n\n78\n00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.960\nWell again, if your data preservation is\nwhat you're really concerned about, and\n\n79\n00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.660\nmost of us are.\n\n80\n00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.692\nI mean data is important.\n\n81\n00:04:24.692 --> 00:04:27.710\nIt's why we're even into\ncomputing to begin with right.\n\n82\n00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.460\nSo if I don't wanna lose my data and\n\n83\n00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.990\nI can't afford that,\nhibernation might be your better option.\n\n84\n00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.220\nNow between hibernation and sleep,\nhibernation is gonna take a little bit\n\n85\n00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.040\nlonger to get back to\na productive desktop, but\n\n86\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.380\nyou're gonna be a little bit safer, the\nfact that your data is still on the disk.\n\n87\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.330\nNow, it's not quite as long as\na full boot process, all right?\n\n88\n00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.820\nNow again high level overview here cuz we\nwere talking about low power states than\n\n89\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.300\nwe are talking about the boot process.\n\n90\n00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.710\nJust understand when the boot loader goes\nto load the operating system it looks for\n\n91\n00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.450\none of two things, the operating system or\nhibernation state information.\n\n92\n00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.950\nAll right, if it finds a hibernation fill\nfile and its got hibernation state and\n\n93\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.220\nit loads that into RAM and that's where\nyou resume from there productive desktop.\n\n94\n00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.730\nIf it doesn't find that information then\nyou go through the normal Windows boot\n\n95\n00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.200\nprocess.\n\n96\n00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.020\nNow that doesn't seem\ntoo confusing until you\n\n97\n00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.620\nstart looking at the available power\nstates inside of your operating system.\n\n98\n00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.200\nSo I've already droned on for\na few minutes here.\n\n99\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.320\nLet's go ahead and\nshow you guys what I'm talking about.\n\n100\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.770\nPower CFG, if I type it in.\n\n101\n00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.990\nAnd I type, here we go back to, if you\nremember the first part of this episode,\n\n102\n00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.910\nI told you about forward slash s\nversus forward slash set active.\n\n103\n00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.040\nThere's gonna be another one that if\nyou haven't been in the power CFG and\n\n104\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.800\nyou get in the exam booth.\n\n105\n00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.640\nYou might get this one wrong,\nand here's why I say that.\n\n106\n00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.413\nAll right, there is a command that is, and\n\n107\n00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:50.505\nRonnie I am gonna challenge\nmy ability to type.\n\n108\n00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:54.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n109\n00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.050\nhere it goes, so availablesleepstates.\n\n110\n00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.170\nYeah it's a long command, I realize that.\n\n111\n00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.610\nAnd if I type this out,\nit gives me these low powered states.\n\n112\n00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.091\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n113\n00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:12.291\nI'm gonna switch over to another machine\nbecause I want you to know that we don't\n\n114\n00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:16.703\nhave to remember all of that if you're in\nthe field and you're using this, do a /a.\n\n115\n00:06:16.703 --> 00:06:19.170\nDoes the same thing, it's no different.\n\n116\n00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.190\nI'll show you why we're seeing\na little bit different of an output,\n\n117\n00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.280\nthat's based on the machine.\n\n118\n00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.240\nIf you remember the first\nepisode that Ronnie and\n\n119\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.350\nI were in, we were on a desktop and\nwe were on a laptop.\n\n120\n00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.880\nAnd the available power states\nare completely different sometimes, and\n\n121\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.150\nmost time they are because\nthe battery options.\n\n122\n00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.840\nSo the first one that you\nsee here is a desktop.\n\n123\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.670\nThis one right here, however, is a laptop.\n\n124\n00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.970\nSo let's go ahead and let's talk about,\nyou say, well, wait, wait,\n\n125\n00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.610\nWes, you said that we have sleep or\nhibernate.\n\n126\n00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.225\nWhy am I seeing all of\nthese different options?\n\n127\n00:06:53.225 --> 00:06:55.730\nLet's gonna go ahead and\ntalk about the options.\n\n128\n00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.700\nWhen it comes to these standby states,\n\n129\n00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.440\nthat's why I said it depends on\nwhat operating system you're in.\n\n130\n00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.680\nThey haven't changed it in the command\nprompt regardless of what they\n\n131\n00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.360\ncall it in the GUI.\n\n132\n00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.920\nThe standbys are the sleep states.\n\n133\n00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.260\nAnd there is,\nthese are industry-wide standards.\n\n134\n00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.100\nThese are OEM standards by the way,\nnot a Windows standard.\n\n135\n00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.810\nSo it doesn't matter what machine you're\non or what operating system you have.\n\n136\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.880\nAnd you have what's known as S0.\n\n137\n00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.550\nS0, what does that mean for us?\n\n138\n00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.940\nAbsolutely nothing when\nit comes to saving power.\n\n139\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.180\nAnd that's because S0 is a fully\nfunctional operating system,\n\n140\n00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.040\nno low-powered state.\n\n141\n00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:34.200\nHowever, you have S1, 2 and 3, and\nmore appropriately, S1, S2, S3.\n\n142\n00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:39.360\nThese are your sleep states and\nthey differ in their degree of\n\n143\n00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.260\nhow much of the machine is\nput into a low power state.\n\n144\n00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.020\nThat's all you need to know for the exam.\n\n145\n00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.536\nJust remember that the S options in\nthere in case they ask you, right?\n\n146\n00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:53.130\nThey say, I need you to set a power state\nand they say, you need to set us S1.\n\n147\n00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.964\nNote that that's sleep, okay?\n\n148\n00:07:54.964 --> 00:07:58.784\nNow the one that Hibernate\nfalls under is S4.\n\n149\n00:07:58.784 --> 00:08:01.815\nAll right,\nyou don't see S4 in the list here do you?\n\n150\n00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:05.170\nWell, that's because they mark it out\nof the command prompt as Hibernate.\n\n151\n00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.040\nBut technically, if we wanted to say that,\n\n152\n00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.652\nwe could say, all right,\nwell, Hibernate is S4.\n\n153\n00:08:13.652 --> 00:08:16.000\nNow, that means shut everything down but\n\n154\n00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.971\nbefore that write that information\nto the hard drive so that if power.\n\n155\n00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:22.400\nWell, power is gonna be lost\nbecause it's gonna be shut down, so\n\n156\n00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.313\nthat I can resume that\ninformation once I'm done.\n\n157\n00:08:24.313 --> 00:08:30.950\nNow, there are different S1s,\nsleep states support it.\n\n158\n00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.110\nAll right, notice that I've\ngot a couple machines here.\n\n159\n00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:41.720\nI've got S1,\nS2 isn't supported by this machine.\n\n160\n00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:47.180\nHowever, if I go over to the desktop,\nnotice S1 and S3 are, why is that?\n\n161\n00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.750\nWell, different machines have\ndifferent powered states.\n\n162\n00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.680\nThe options are industry-wide standards,\n\n163\n00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.360\nit's up to the manufacturer\non how they implement them.\n\n164\n00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.254\nBut I do wanna talk about some of\nthese other options that are here.\n\n165\n00:08:58.254 --> 00:08:59.360\nWhat is this hybrid sleep?\n\n166\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.890\nWhat does that mean for us?\n\n167\n00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:06.017\nWell, hybrid sleep is actually very,\nvery, very cool, I like this one.\n\n168\n00:09:06.017 --> 00:09:11.735\nHybrid sleep is anywhere from S1 to S3,\nit's gotta be a sleep state,\n\n169\n00:09:11.735 --> 00:09:17.180\nS4, you're hibernating,\nS5 is fully powered off, by the way.\n\n170\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.810\nYou don't need to know that for\nthe exam, but\n\n171\n00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.145\nS5 is the lowest powered state you've got,\nfully shut off.\n\n172\n00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:27.580\nHybrid sleep, how about the ability\nto get the best of sleep and\n\n173\n00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.980\nhibernate at the same time.\n\n174\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.740\nMy machine is on, it gets put into\na low-powered state, we refresh the RAM.\n\n175\n00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.268\nBut before we do that we write all\nof the hibernation state data to\n\n176\n00:09:37.268 --> 00:09:38.980\nthe hiberfil file.\n\n177\n00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.996\nSo what happens if I lose all\npower to my operating system?\n\n178\n00:09:41.996 --> 00:09:44.280\nNo different than hibernate.\n\n179\n00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.290\nThe operating system might crash because\nyou have critical kernel power failure,\n\n180\n00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.250\nbut the moment you reboot you can resume.\n\n181\n00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.470\nCuz the boot loader will see that\nhibernation state, load it into RAM, and\n\n182\n00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.840\nyou start from there.\n\n183\n00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.595\nBut at the same time, another one of\nthe benefits is, if you don't completely\n\n184\n00:10:00.595 --> 00:10:05.330\nlose power on your battery,\nthen you get the ability to\n\n185\n00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.170\nresume to a productive desktop just\nas fast as you would in sleep.\n\n186\n00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.770\nSo that's a really good thing.\n\n187\n00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.050\nNow there's another one here and\nit's not on this list.\n\n188\n00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.280\nAnd I want you guys to know about it and\n\n189\n00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.120\nthat's the transition from\nWindows 8.1 into Windows 10.\n\n190\n00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.010\nAnd that's something known as\nconnected standby, all right?\n\n191\n00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:27.190\nConnected standby was something\nthat would allow you to\n\n192\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:32.320\nkinda use best of both worlds with\nalmost like a fast start up, too.\n\n193\n00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.810\nA lot of devices didn't support it,\nso in Windows 10,\n\n194\n00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:40.180\nthey came with what was\nknown as modern standby and\n\n195\n00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:45.486\nit's a low power profile so\nyou'll see actually two different S0s.\n\n196\n00:10:45.486 --> 00:10:50.090\nYou'll see an S0 which\nis a working machine and\n\n197\n00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:54.810\nthen you'll see an S0 low powered\nwhich means you're gonna try to reduce\n\n198\n00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:59.250\nsome of the power in the devices, but\nyou're not gonna go into a sleep state.\n\n199\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.440\nSo that's the modern standby,\nit was introduced in Windows 10.\n\n200\n00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.070\nI think, Ronny, the only one that\nI'm missing here is fast start up.\n\n201\n00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.840\nNow fast start up maybe you've seen\nthis before maybe you haven't.\n\n202\n00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.700\nFast start up is like a hibernation state.\n\n203\n00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:20.900\nWhat it does is, it reduces the size\nof the hiberfil file, right?\n\n204\n00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.200\nSo, if you have a machine that's\ngot very limited storage.\n\n205\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.160\nNow, in today's day and\nage that's kind of trivial, but\n\n206\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.950\nif you do happen to have a machine,\nlike a device, if you have a phone, right?\n\n207\n00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.500\nAnd it's got limited storage space.\n\n208\n00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.380\nI don't want that Hibernation file,\nthat hiberfil file being gigantic, right?\n\n209\n00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.580\nAnd having all this information, so\nthat's all the fast start up does.\n\n210\n00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.700\nIt's one of the things that it gives\nyou the ability to use Hibernation, but\n\n211\n00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:49.800\nat the same time reduce the size\nof the Hibernation file.\n\n212\n00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.960\nAlright, now there are some other\nthings that we want to look at too,\n\n213\n00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.909\nbecause in talking about\nthese power states,\n\n214\n00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.660\nwhich of your devices support\nthese low-powered states?\n\n215\n00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.370\nIf somebody says,\ndoes your network adapter or\n\n216\n00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.270\ndoes this device that is a Bluetooth\nradio support this setting?\n\n217\n00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:12.310\nOr does the 802.11 wireless adapter in\nyour machine support a low-powered state?\n\n218\n00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.770\nI don't know, I have no clue.\n\n219\n00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.330\nSo we also got another option that's\ncalled the device query parameter.\n\n220\n00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.810\nAnd it is a good parameter to know for\nthe exam.\n\n221\n00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.030\nAnd quite literally it's just, and let me\ngo ahead and clear the screen out here and\n\n222\n00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.600\nmake it a little, oop.\n\n223\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.640\nMaybe clear the screen out,\nif I could spell clear.\n\n224\n00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.372\nLet's see what that does for us.\n\n225\n00:12:29.372 --> 00:12:33.990\nPower CFG, and if I type out,\nI wish there was an abbreviation for\n\n226\n00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.122\nthis one but unfortunately, there's not.\n\n227\n00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:42.200\nAll right, I could do a device query,\nif I want and if you're not sure\n\n228\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.960\nof what the commands are or the options\nwith this one, use your copy and paste.\n\n229\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.380\nLike we talked about the GUIs\nat the first part of this,\n\n230\n00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.860\nwhen this outputs, you might be in for a\nlittle bit for more typing than you want.\n\n231\n00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.810\nSo what this is telling me,\nI haven't added any options to this,\n\n232\n00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.360\nI still have to query the device for\n\n233\n00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.860\na specific low-powered state\nto see if it supports that.\n\n234\n00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.010\nRight, so let's do that.\n\n235\n00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:09.990\nAll right, I wanna know, since I know\nthat my device, if you remember,\n\n236\n00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.560\nsupports an S3 low powered state.\n\n237\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.910\nWell, I'm gonna copy that, and\nthen I'm gonna come back here, and\n\n238\n00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.600\nlet me clear the screen again, put it up\ntowards the top so you guys can see it.\n\n239\n00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:24.220\nAnd I'm gonna run the power, CFG, and\nyou got to add the device query but\n\n240\n00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.630\nremember that's only\na portion of the command.\n\n241\n00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:33.230\nAnd then I paste in\nwake_from_s3_supported, and I run that.\n\n242\n00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.390\nWell, what does it do?\n\n243\n00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.450\nIt outputs the hardware devices that\nare in this machine right now that\n\n244\n00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:43.860\ncurrently support S3 suspended state,\nand you can see.\n\n245\n00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:49.040\nI can see right here that I have\na remote desktop keyboard device.\n\n246\n00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.280\nIt's an emulated device cause\nI've remote into the machine.\n\n247\n00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.790\nBut yes, I can see that hey,\nlook my Bluetooth device supports this.\n\n248\n00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:01.630\nWhat if I wanna know do the devices\nsupport maybe the S2 or S1.\n\n249\n00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.640\nWell you can do that.\n\n250\n00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.416\nNow, since we've already got our command\nin here all I'm gonna do is change\n\n251\n00:14:08.416 --> 00:14:12.510\nthat 3 to a 2, and there are some\ndevices that support the S2.\n\n252\n00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.590\nEven though my computer,\nthe whole power scheme,\n\n253\n00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.650\nthe whole entire thing doesn't support the\nS2 state, you could still potentially have\n\n254\n00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:24.130\ndevices within your computer\nthat do support that state.\n\n255\n00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.300\nAll right.\nYou just don't get any benefit from it, so\n\n256\n00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.300\nthat's one of the things that you can do.\n\n257\n00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.000\nWhat if I wanna figure out what\nthe state is for all devices?\n\n258\n00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.850\nWhat do they support?\n\n259\n00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.190\nWell, that's easy enough too.\n\n260\n00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:40.220\nWe're gonna do powercfg, and\nwe'll run our devicequery option again.\n\n261\n00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.460\nBut now what I'm gonna do, instead of\nputting in just one low-powered state,\n\n262\n00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.405\nI'm just gonna type out all_devices.\n\n263\n00:14:48.665 --> 00:14:50.530\nAll_devices, did I get that right?\n\n264\n00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:51.680\n>> Underscore\n>> Underscore, thank you,\n\n265\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.130\nthank you very much Ronnie there.\n\n266\n00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.310\n>> Can't forget\nthe underscore in that one.\n\n267\n00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.472\nAnd you can't forget to spell it right.\n\n268\n00:14:58.472 --> 00:15:01.552\n[LAUGH] Now, Ronnie that one\ncame across the screen so fast,\n\n269\n00:15:01.552 --> 00:15:04.830\nwe didn't even really get to see it,\nright?\n\n270\n00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.500\nI'm not saying that this is a practical\napplication, guys, it's just for the exam.\n\n271\n00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.120\nHowever, knowing if you\nhave devices that support,\n\n272\n00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.280\nwhat devices support a powered state\nthat you could potentially use,\n\n273\n00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.800\nthis just lets me know all of the devices,\nright?\n\n274\n00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.380\nAnd I can see,\n\n275\n00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.610\nif I check out these codes, I could\nfind out a little bit more information.\n\n276\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:28.060\nNow, do I have any devices in the machine\nthat can trigger a wake up from sleep.\n\n277\n00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.800\nWell, I don't know, right?\n\n278\n00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.740\nThis might be something that if you\nwant to set your network adapter in\n\n279\n00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:37.130\na way that it could be woken up\non a Remote Desktop Connection,\n\n280\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.320\nyou might wanna find out if\nthat is turned on or not.\n\n281\n00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.850\nNow this is fairly easy because\nI just do a powercfg again.\n\n282\n00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.054\nAnd I do a space, and\nwe're gonna do awake.\n\n283\n00:15:46.054 --> 00:15:48.543\nYou gotta remember your\ndevicequery option.\n\n284\n00:15:48.543 --> 00:15:49.901\nAs much as I say that, I forget.\n\n285\n00:15:49.901 --> 00:15:53.883\nAnd then what I'm gonna do is awake_armed.\n\n286\n00:15:53.883 --> 00:15:56.707\nAll right, I don't have any devices.\n\n287\n00:15:56.707 --> 00:15:59.428\nNow the remote desktop mouse device,\nif you will,\n\n288\n00:15:59.428 --> 00:16:02.000\nthat's me connected over the network.\n\n289\n00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.500\nAll right, so\nI really don't have to worry about that.\n\n290\n00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.348\nSo, you can see that with that\ndevice query command, you have\n\n291\n00:16:08.348 --> 00:16:13.300\nthe ability to find out what devices\nsupport certain low powered states.\n\n292\n00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.290\nAnd you might make some considerations.\n\n293\n00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.020\nMaybe you're out there and\nyou're putting together machines.\n\n294\n00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.630\nMaybe you're not going to OEM.\n\n295\n00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.120\nRight, maybe you're saying, okay, I've got\na build, and I wanna put this together,\n\n296\n00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.250\nand these machines have to do such and\nsuch according to the low powered state.\n\n297\n00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.180\nWell, guess what?\n\n298\n00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.910\nYou can find out which\nof those devices support\n\n299\n00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.940\nthe low powered state\nthat you're looking for.\n\n300\n00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.480\n>> Now Wes, is there, for\nus especially using the command or\n\n301\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.580\nthe powercfg here, for\nus to be able to change that power state?\n\n302\n00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.350\n>> Yeah, Ronnie, we actually can.\n\n303\n00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.298\nSometimes you might have to\nchange the low powered state.\n\n304\n00:16:42.298 --> 00:16:43.670\nMaybe I set it in sleep, and\n\n305\n00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.570\nI realized that this user might be losing\ntoo much data by putting it in sleep.\n\n306\n00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.110\nThey walk away, and they go for a coffee\nbreak, and they come back in two hours.\n\n307\n00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.490\nWell, that's where we need to\nmaybe change to hibernate.\n\n308\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:55.420\nLet's show you how to do that.\n\n309\n00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:59.100\nSo it's same command that we've\nbeen running and powercfg, and\n\n310\n00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.040\nthen it's gonna be the /h.\n\n311\n00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.470\nHowever, I'm gonna stop here just for\na second and warn you.\n\n312\n00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.770\nJust like some of the other\navailable options that we've seen,\n\n313\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.290\nset active is abbreviated to s.\n\n314\n00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.430\nAvailable sleep states\nis abbreviated to a.\n\n315\n00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.440\nThis one, you could spell out, and\n\n316\n00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.070\nas you're practicing it,\nI would spell it out, hibernate.\n\n317\n00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.856\nBut it can be abbreviated\nwith the letter h as well.\n\n318\n00:17:20.856 --> 00:17:26.170\nSo if I say /h, or\n/hibernate, and I say on.\n\n319\n00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.100\nFor the option there, we don't really\nget much of a verification there, but\n\n320\n00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.700\nit does turn the ability to hibernate on.\n\n321\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.920\nSo now if that person decides\nthat they're gonna walk away and\n\n322\n00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:42.080\ngo take a long coffee break, and they come\nback and the machine is no longer on.\n\n323\n00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.938\nWell, as least from\nan administrative standpoint,\n\n324\n00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:46.848\nthat user's data is gonna be safe.\n\n325\n00:17:46.848 --> 00:17:49.898\nAnd that really is something that we\nhave to consider when it comes down to\n\n326\n00:17:49.898 --> 00:17:50.450\ncomputing.\n\n327\n00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.260\nAnd I mean,\nbecause what is computing about?\n\n328\n00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.320\nIt's all about your data.\n\n329\n00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.340\nSo yes, you can, Ronnie, very easy.\n\n330\n00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.130\nTurn it on or off.\n\n331\n00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.950\nJust remember the parameter\nthat goes after it, on or off.\n\n332\n00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.860\n>> So Wes, if I were to say switch\npower states from that hibernate to\n\n333\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.610\none of those sleep states here, we would\nsimply turn off whatever state we're on.\n\n334\n00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:06.160\n>> That's right.\n>> And\n\n335\n00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.080\nthen we'd run the command\nto turn on the other state.\n\n336\n00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.288\n>> That's right.\nSo, for instance,\n\n337\n00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:11.590\nif I went, and good question, by the way.\n\n338\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:17.210\nIf I turned around and I went powercfg\nforward slash, and then I said, and I'll\n\n339\n00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.840\nabbreviate it just to show you guys, I'll\ndo the opposite of what I said not to do.\n\n340\n00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.590\n[LAUGH] All right, so now I turned\nit off and if I look again, and\n\n341\n00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.750\nI want to find out well,\nwhat are the available power states?\n\n342\n00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.080\nIt's just easy as typing that\na option there and again.\n\n343\n00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.110\nSo, I think that's got all\nof the states that we have.\n\n344\n00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.810\nNow you get to see\nthe S0 low powered idle.\n\n345\n00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.050\nI did mention that as being\none of the power states.\n\n346\n00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.370\nThat's the one that Windows changed\n\n347\n00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.990\nin Windows 8.1 from connected\nstandby to the modern standby.\n\n348\n00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.840\nSo if they ask you about modern standby,\nmaybe they'll give you\n\n349\n00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.680\na screenshot that says,\nwhich power setting is modern standby?\n\n350\n00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.490\nKnow that for the exam, again, it doesn't\nhave to be so cryptographic or anything,\n\n351\n00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.115\nthat standby S0 low power,\ncuz remember S0.\n\n352\n00:19:04.115 --> 00:19:06.930\nS0's a fully functional computer,\nit's not in a low power state.\n\n353\n00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:12.280\nSo this is kind of between that S0 and\nS1 called modern standby.\n\n354\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.600\n>> All right, Wes, well,\nthank you again for that information.\n\n355\n00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.910\nRemember what we took a look at\nhere in this particular episode\n\n356\n00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:22.090\nis that we talked about the idea of the\ndifferent power states that we can use.\n\n357\n00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.270\nNow you might actually think,\n\n358\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.100\nwhere in the world is there\na practical application for this?\n\n359\n00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.620\nMost of the time, we do change this,\n\n360\n00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.390\nand end users tend to change\nthis when they're on laptops.\n\n361\n00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.380\nIf they have to go to a meeting and\nthere's no available power source,\n\n362\n00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.480\nyou may find them changing from the active\nstate they have to a low powered state, so\n\n363\n00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.620\nthat they can save electricity\nwhile they're in that meeting and\n\n364\n00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.260\nthey're not actually plugged in.\n\n365\n00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.720\nYou may also see\nthe scenario that Wes gave,\n\n366\n00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.050\nthe very fact that we might actually\nhave to ensure that we need to go,\n\n367\n00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:53.580\nhey, if I lose power, that I ensure that\neverything that's on my screen is saved.\n\n368\n00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.220\nRegardless of the power that's actually\nlost, I wanna make sure that that\n\n369\n00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.960\ndata is not lost there,\nusing hibernate is another one.\n\n370\n00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.409\nSo, not only do we actually need the keys\nof understanding how we can change just\n\n371\n00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:08.452\nusing powercfg, but a lot of times when\npreparing for Windows exams especially,\n\n372\n00:20:08.452 --> 00:20:12.680\nyou're gonna see those scenario driven\ntypes of questions in which they'll ask,\n\n373\n00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.220\nwhich of the following is gonna\nactually be your best option here?\n\n374\n00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.010\nAnd make sure you understand\nthat usage as well.\n\n375\n00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.110\nSo just think about what we've\nactually talked about here,\n\n376\n00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.450\nthe difference between low powered and\nthe hibernate.\n\n377\n00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:27.300\nThe idea of actually having a little bit\nof electricity kind of seeping out and\n\n378\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.410\nmaking sure that the RAM stays active, or\n\n379\n00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.755\ndo we need to completely\npower off state as well.\n\n380\n00:20:32.755 --> 00:20:37.020\nWes showed us that when using this\npowercfg, that also we emphasize the fact\n\n381\n00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:41.260\nthat this means that we can script it to\nfind out what state can we actually get\n\n382\n00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.490\nour computers into or certain devices that\nare connected to our computers as well.\n\n383\n00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:48.000\nSo we wanna make sure that\nwe pay attention to that.\n\n384\n00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.270\nLastly, Wes also pointed out this newer,\nmodern?\n\n385\n00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:52.240\n>> Modern standby.\n\n386\n00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.210\n>> Modern standby versus\nthe connected standby, as well.\n\n387\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.140\nTake a note of that,\n\n388\n00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.730\ndo a little bit more research on that\nif you're still not sure about that.\n\n389\n00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.670\nCuz if you're coming from the Windows\n8 days, you may actually go, wow,\n\n390\n00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.820\nI've never heard of that.\n\n391\n00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.995\nGo back and take a look, and then compare\nthat to the modern power state that Wes\n\n392\n00:21:06.995 --> 00:21:09.840\nalso described and\nsee what happens there too.\n\n393\n00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.470\nSo that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode.\n\n394\n00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.480\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n395\n00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.240\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n396\n00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.808\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:17.280\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.809\ntoday we're taking a look at\nconfiguring devices in Windows 10.\n\n5\n00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:24.250\nNow what we're specifically\nfocusing in on Windows 10 today,\n\n6\n00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.343\nis gonna be a technology is very neat for\nus, which is gonna be BitLocker and\n\n7\n00:00:28.343 --> 00:00:31.880\nwho better to help us out than Mr.\nWes Bryan, himself?\n\n8\n00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.890\nWes, when we talk about BitLocker, even\nthough we're gonna go into something that\n\n9\n00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.200\nwe may not have seen before, why don't you\nat least tell us a little bit about why we\n\n10\n00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.320\nwould choose to use BitLocker and\nthen tell us why we want this episode?\n\n11\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.950\n>> [LAUGH] That's right, for sure.\n\n12\n00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.660\nWell, one of the reasons you might choose\nBitLocker is for drive encryption.\n\n13\n00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.450\nIf you think about it, data security\nis very important in computing,\n\n14\n00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.220\nlike we said,\nit's all about our data itself.\n\n15\n00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.810\nWell, BitLocker was a technology that was\nfirst introduced way back in the days of\n\n16\n00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.400\nthe beautiful operating system\nknown as Vista and it's\n\n17\n00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.150\ndefinitely gone through its advances in\nWindows 7, all the way up into Windows 10.\n\n18\n00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.780\nIt is a full drive encryption technology.\n\n19\n00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.250\nNow that being said,\nI think I'm going to step back and\n\n20\n00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.060\ndo a little bit of the apologetic\nexplanation first and here's why.\n\n21\n00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.180\nYou hear a lot of people talked about\nBitLocker, how great it is, or how not so\n\n22\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.890\ngreat it is.\n\n23\n00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.490\nWell, let's understand\nwhat it is first so,\n\n24\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.520\nthat you can judge it based on what\nMicrosoft originally intended it for.\n\n25\n00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.310\nIt is a offline data protection solution,\n\n26\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.100\nwhich means when your computer's off,\nyour data's fully encrypted and\n\n27\n00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.370\npractically impossible,\nyou can never say impossible in security.\n\n28\n00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.130\nIf somebody takes that drive out of your\nmachine, puts it into another one and\n\n29\n00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.300\ntries to fire up that machine and read\nthat data, it's going to be encrypted.\n\n30\n00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.890\nIt's going to look for\n\n31\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.710\nsome certain characteristics, and\nit's not going to find it, and it's going\n\n32\n00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.370\nto throw it into what's known as recovery\nmode, basically protecting your data.\n\n33\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.400\nNow that's what BitLocker\nwas intended for.\n\n34\n00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.590\nYou might see people out there, in\nthe forums, maybe sometime that say, yeah,\n\n35\n00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.700\nBitLocker is easy to crack, but\nthen you look at how they've started,\n\n36\n00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.760\nit's because the computer system is online\nand typically the user's logged in.\n\n37\n00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.296\nIt's never what it was intended for, it's\nan offline data protection solution and\n\n38\n00:02:13.296 --> 00:02:15.690\nit also even protects\nyour operating system,\n\n39\n00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.800\nbecause it can do it really\nearly on in the boot process.\n\n40\n00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.850\nIt can check your boot configuration\ndata to make sure things like ELAM,\n\n41\n00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.000\nyour Early Launch Anti-Malware system\ndrivers haven't been modified.\n\n42\n00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.460\nAnd if it does see that there's bee\nmodifications like a rootkit that likes\n\n43\n00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.430\nto slip itself in there and execute\nbefore the operating system comes online.\n\n44\n00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.040\nIt says wait, wait,\nwait a second somethings wrong here.\n\n45\n00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.050\nOur checks and balances, our check\nsums aren't matching up, and again,\n\n46\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.220\nit throws it into recovery mode.\n\n47\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.930\nSo, BitLocker is a full\ndrive encryption technology.\n\n48\n00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.200\nNow, I will just take a brief\ndetour off the beaten path here and\n\n49\n00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.122\nalso mention BitLocker To Go.\n\n50\n00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:54.600\nBitLocker To Go brought in the ability\nto take USB removable media and\n\n51\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.040\nbring that encryption technology to USB or\nto through product called Bitlocker To Go.\n\n52\n00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.780\nNow, why do we need this episode?\n\n53\n00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.310\nHopefully that explains a little\nbit about what BitLocker is,\n\n54\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.290\nwhy do we need this episode?\n\n55\n00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.490\nBecause in past episodes,\n\n56\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.750\nwe've shown you how to configure it to\nthe graphical user interface, the GUI.\n\n57\n00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.120\nAll right,\nWe're not going to do it that way.\n\n58\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.970\nAgain, we're going to live\na little more dangerously.\n\n59\n00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.610\nWe're going to drop back to our\ncommand line and we're going\n\n60\n00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.800\nto see one of the utilities that has been\nin Windows, that most likely, I can't tell\n\n61\n00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.558\nyou if it will or won't, but I'll say most\nlikely is going to show up on the exam.\n\n62\n00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:27.220\nAnd Ronnie, that's what we're going to\nbe looking at today more specifically,\n\n63\n00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.050\nis the manage-bde command.\n\n64\n00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.290\n>> All right, so this particular command\nis something that you'll probably likely\n\n65\n00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.800\nfind, not only here, but you actually see\nit in other Windows server exams as well.\n\n66\n00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.840\nBut just remember that,\n\n67\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.750\nas a supporting technician, we have\nto go beyond just that GUI interface.\n\n68\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.430\nDon't get me wrong,\nthe GUI interface is very intuitive.\n\n69\n00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.230\nIt allows you to be able to\ntell a user what you need.\n\n70\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.970\nBut, when we start managing 10, 50,\nhundreds of computers at one time,\n\n71\n00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.800\na lot of times what we actually need is\nsomething that will allow us to be able to\n\n72\n00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.070\ngroup those computers together,\nthat actually write scripting for them,\n\n73\n00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.510\nbe able to configure them all at one time.\n\n74\n00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.950\nThis idea of actually using BitLocker from\nthe command line is really gonna help you,\n\n75\n00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.430\nas an enterprise support technician,\nto get started.\n\n76\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.230\nSo this is a very essential function and\n\n77\n00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.590\nyou're more likely to see\nthis on that 70-697 exam.\n\n78\n00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.360\nSo it's something you definitely want to\npay attention to as well because if not,\n\n79\n00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.560\nyou'll get a little bit skewed by what you\nactually end up thinking and seeing here.\n\n80\n00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.590\nSo not only do you actually\nwanna know the other side of it,\n\n81\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.950\nwhich we had already previously recorded,\nand you definitely wanna check that out,\n\n82\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.250\nbut you also wanna pay attention here,\nespecially with this particular command.\n\n83\n00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.070\nSo, Wes, what are you showing us first?\n\n84\n00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.670\n>> Very good.\nSo, like I'd mentioned,\n\n85\n00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.990\nwe're going to look at\nthe manage-bde command.\n\n86\n00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.010\nAnd there are some, some are basic,\nI will say, some are, maybe, not so basic.\n\n87\n00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.570\nAnd like Ronnie mentions, we don't\nwant you to come across on the exam,\n\n88\n00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.740\nmaybe a manage-bde command and say, guys,\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n89\n00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.670\nI've studied it just from\na graphical user interface.\n\n90\n00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.530\nSo, you need to be pretty fluent in\n\n91\n00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.950\nsome of these options that\nwe're gonna show you.\n\n92\n00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.660\nLet's dive right in and\nshow you what I'm talking about.\n\n93\n00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.260\nSo, I've got our PowerShell brought up\nhere, and I'm just gonna type manage-bde.\n\n94\n00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.002\nNow, in doing that,\n\n95\n00:05:08.002 --> 00:05:10.410\nthere's a couple of different options\nthat we could use right away.\n\n96\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.020\nThe first one I wanna know is,\nis BitLocker turned on?\n\n97\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.150\nWhat is the state of BitLocker\nright now on this machine?\n\n98\n00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.000\nWell that's a very easy command,\nor parameter I should say.\n\n99\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.490\nAll we have to do is manage-bde-status.\n\n100\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.520\nAnd it's a fairly easy command,\nif you know how to type, but\n\n101\n00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.930\nif your like Wes, [LAUGH] you might have\na little bit of challenge with that.\n\n102\n00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.290\nNow, what are we looking at,\nwhat are we seeing here?\n\n103\n00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.010\nWell, notice, oops, apparently not much.\n\n104\n00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.700\nLet's try that again.\n\n105\n00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.695\nAll right, well we are seeing that our.\n\n106\n00:05:40.695 --> 00:05:43.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna try that one more time.\n\n107\n00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.720\nThere we go.\n\n108\n00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.790\nSo we're seeing the size of the drive.\n\n109\n00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:47.660\nThat is important, right?\n\n110\n00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.030\nThe size of the drive,\nthe BitLocker version, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.600\nNow I don't have a BitLocker version on\nright now, but we're gonna show you how\n\n112\n00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.150\ncan you actually upgrade your\nBitLocker version if you need to.\n\n113\n00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.360\nI can see that the, is it decrypted,\nis it encrypted now, right, if it is,\n\n114\n00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.270\nencrypted, and the encryption process is\nfinished, I'm gonna see a 100% encrypted.\n\n115\n00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.280\nNotice here, what does it say?\n\n116\n00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.050\nIt says fully decrypted.\n\n117\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.590\nNow, I can see that I don't\nhave an encrypted drive.\n\n118\n00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.890\nI can also see that the protection\nstatus is turned off.\n\n119\n00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:20.420\nSo essentially,\n\n120\n00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.620\nwhat this is telling me is that BitLocker\nisn't turned on on this machine.\n\n121\n00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.936\nAnd that's a good command to know,\nnotice the status.\n\n122\n00:06:25.936 --> 00:06:28.910\nNow, I will tell you, I don't think that's\ngonna be the only parameter that they\n\n123\n00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.740\nmight throw you on the exam.\n\n124\n00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.246\nNow, let's go ahead and\nlet's show you how you enable BitLocker.\n\n125\n00:06:36.246 --> 00:06:40.260\nNow, in enabling BitLocker, there are some\nthings that you have to consider,\n\n126\n00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.790\nand one is known as the TPM.\n\n127\n00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.140\nTPM is the Trusted Platform Module and\nit's a industry wide standard that's\n\n128\n00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.100\noverseen by a consortium called\nthe Trusted Computing Group.\n\n129\n00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.010\nSo, it's not specific to Microsoft,\nit's not specific to Linux,\n\n130\n00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.270\nit's not specific to Mac or\nanything, this is a consortium\n\n131\n00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.830\nof manufacturers who get together and\nthey promote this standard.\n\n132\n00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.020\nNow the TPM is a hardware module.\n\n133\n00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.740\nIt's a chip, it's a processor chip, right.\n\n134\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.260\nIf you see the documentation, they use\nfancy words like cryptographic processor.\n\n135\n00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.540\nWhat does that mean?\n\n136\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.720\nIt's a chip that stores\nsecurity information.\n\n137\n00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.230\nMake it easy.\n\n138\n00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.490\nThat's really all it is.\n\n139\n00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.990\nNow, security information\nthat's stored in there\n\n140\n00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.020\ncan be implemented in\na few different ways.\n\n141\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.640\nSpecifically, in BitLocker\nit stores a few things.\n\n142\n00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.340\nThe TPM holds the configuration\nstate of your operating system.\n\n143\n00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.990\nAny software that's supposed\nto start up very early,\n\n144\n00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.710\nwhat is the state of that software?\n\n145\n00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.210\nWhat is the state of the drive?\n\n146\n00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:37.590\nNow it holds, also, for\ninstance, your encryption keys.\n\n147\n00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.480\nIf I need to read this drive\nI need to be able to get\n\n148\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.440\nto the encryption keys\nto do the decryption.\n\n149\n00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.880\nWell, that's stored in\nthe Trusted Platform Module.\n\n150\n00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.620\nNow if your machine does have a TPM,\nthen you're ready to go with BitLocker.\n\n151\n00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.030\nYou don't really have to worry about\ntoo much more than just turning it on.\n\n152\n00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.545\nShow you what I mean.\n\n153\n00:07:54.545 --> 00:08:00.802\nSo if I do a manage, and\nI do mean manage-bde.\n\n154\n00:08:00.802 --> 00:08:05.130\nAnd I do a /on, right?\n\n155\n00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.000\nNot really too difficult.\n\n156\n00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.980\nI can provide it with a volume letter,\nright, if you have multiple drives.\n\n157\n00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.750\nYou have three different types of drives\nthat you could see for BitLocker.\n\n158\n00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.430\nAll right,\nfirst one is called a fixed data drive,\n\n159\n00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.790\nand that's another drive that\ndoesn't hold your operating system.\n\n160\n00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.750\nThe drive that I'm looking at here\nis the operating system drive, and\n\n161\n00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.030\nyou also have the removable drives, where\nwe briefly mentioned BitLocker to go.\n\n162\n00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.872\nSo, what I need to do is I need to\nadd the volume letter to the drive\n\n163\n00:08:29.872 --> 00:08:34.107\nthat I wanna encrypt, and\nthen I already that it is C:.\n\n164\n00:08:34.107 --> 00:08:37.501\nIf you don't know what your drive is,\njust look inside of File Explorer,\n\n165\n00:08:37.501 --> 00:08:41.250\nfigure out what your operating system\ndrive is, most likely it's gonna be C:.\n\n166\n00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.266\nAnd when I put in C:, all right,\n\n167\n00:08:43.266 --> 00:08:47.446\nit's gonna tell me some key protectors\nhave been added, all right.\n\n168\n00:08:47.446 --> 00:08:52.271\nNow, one of the things to understand, when\nyou implement BitLocker drive encryption,\n\n169\n00:08:52.271 --> 00:08:56.840\nthe encryption process doesn't start\nthe moment you turn it on, right.\n\n170\n00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:02.410\nWell, it tells you, it tells you right\nhere, you need to restart the computer.\n\n171\n00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.521\nNow I don't think you, and I certainly\ndon't think you have to worry about this\n\n172\n00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:07.486\ninformation, notice the TPM's there,\nright.\n\n173\n00:09:07.486 --> 00:09:10.710\nAnd it gives you this GUID,\nlike we've talked about another episode,\n\n174\n00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.940\nthat identifies the TPM, this chip.\n\n175\n00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.920\nThen it has some PCR validation profile.\n\n176\n00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.740\nDon't worry about that for the exam,\n\n177\n00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.450\nthat's part of the trusted\ncomputing group.\n\n178\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.620\nThose are called platform\nconfiguration registers, and\n\n179\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.690\nthere's a series of code that just says,\nthis is the state of your operating\n\n180\n00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.560\nsystem, this is the state of your\nmaster boot record, the BIOS and such.\n\n181\n00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.150\nIt's letting BitLocker know, this is the\ncurrent state, this is what I find now.\n\n182\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.510\nAnd if I find these numbers modified,\nBitLocker says,\n\n183\n00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.580\nmust be some tampering,\nthrows it into recovery mode.\n\n184\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.540\nSo for us,\nwe don't really have to worry about those,\n\n185\n00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.220\nbut just in case you wanted to know that\ninformation, that's what those PCRs are.\n\n186\n00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.250\nNow I have to do my shutdown command\nbecause we have to restart the machine.\n\n187\n00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:54.290\nSo we're gonna go ahead real quick,\nand we're gonna restart this machine.\n\n188\n00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.290\nAnd I'm gonna switch over to another\nmachine because I told you about TPM mode.\n\n189\n00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.150\nWell, what if your\ncomputer doesn't have TPM?\n\n190\n00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.458\nNow, you're gonna see another episode.\n\n191\n00:10:03.458 --> 00:10:10.110\nThey went into how you identify whether\na machine supports TPM mode or not.\n\n192\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.820\nSo we're gonna brief through\nit pretty quickly, just so\n\n193\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.820\nwe can see what it looks\nlike in the command prompt.\n\n194\n00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.380\nIf I was to, again,\nI wanna find out the status,\n\n195\n00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.590\nI don't know what the status of\nBitLocker is on this machine.\n\n196\n00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.620\nSo I'm gonna do a manage-bde.\n\n197\n00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.140\nRemember, don't practice\nthis till you get it right.\n\n198\n00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.520\nPractice it till you can't get it wrong.\n\n199\n00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.310\nThen you know on the exam,\nyou'll always have it right.\n\n200\n00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.556\nSo we're gonna do manage-bde -on.\n\n201\n00:10:32.556 --> 00:10:36.410\nAnd I tell you what, how about status,\nthat's what we need to know.\n\n202\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:40.340\nCuz I honestly, I don't even know if\nthis machine has BitLocker turned on.\n\n203\n00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.719\nSo let's try that again with\nthe right option, status.\n\n204\n00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.256\nNow notice that we have\na terrabyte drive here, okay,\n\n205\n00:10:48.256 --> 00:10:51.380\nit tells me here fully decrypted.\n\n206\n00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.472\nThere is zero percentage encrypted, and\nthe protection is turned off, okay.\n\n207\n00:10:55.472 --> 00:10:58.384\nWe're gonna do the same thing\nwhile that machine's restarting,\n\n208\n00:10:58.384 --> 00:11:01.348\nwe're gonna do the same thing that\nwe did on that other machine, and\n\n209\n00:11:01.348 --> 00:11:06.534\nI'm just gonna just simply type manage,\n-bde,\n\n210\n00:11:06.534 --> 00:11:13.370\nand then it's gonna be a space /on,\nor -on.\n\n211\n00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:18.260\nAnd again, keep in mind, it's requiring\na drive letter because you could have\n\n212\n00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.400\nmultiple drives within the machine,\nall right?\n\n213\n00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.585\nSo we wanna be careful with that.\n\n214\n00:11:21.585 --> 00:11:24.543\n[COUGH] So let's go ahead and\nput the drive letter on,\n\n215\n00:11:24.543 --> 00:11:26.730\nI do know it's SQL in here.\n\n216\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.680\nAnd Ronnie, it's interesting enough,\nnotice it says that there's an error.\n\n217\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:34.140\nI did the exact same thing that I just\ndid on the machine that has a TPM and\n\n218\n00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.390\nthis one's telling me there's an error,\nall right.\n\n219\n00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.270\nSo I'm gonna run a command here that we're\ngonna talk about a little bit more later,\n\n220\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:43.840\nso just bear with me here because one of\nthe parameters that I'm gonna show you,\n\n221\n00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.050\nwe're gonna dive in\ndepth in here in a bit.\n\n222\n00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.520\nSo let's go ahead and do what it says.\n\n223\n00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.210\nIt says you gotta enter a password, right.\n\n224\n00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.880\nI don't have a TPM.\n\n225\n00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.150\nSo there's no trusted platform module for\nthis machine to use, so\n\n226\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.820\nI have to find another way to\nprove that I own this drive.\n\n227\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.490\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n228\n00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.050\nLet's set this one up.\n\n229\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.910\nAll right, we'll do manage-bde.\n\n230\n00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.150\nWe're gonna do protectors.\n\n231\n00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.350\nLike I said, guys, bear with me here.\n\n232\n00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.888\nWell, we'll come back to that protectors,\nand I'm gonna do add and\n\n233\n00:12:10.888 --> 00:12:14.920\nthen I'm gonna do C: and then I'm gonna\nadd password, right, so password.\n\n234\n00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.380\nAnd notice it says,\nthere's your password, set the password.\n\n235\n00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:25.300\nSo we'll go ahead, and we'll set the same\npassword as I have in my luggage.\n\n236\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.250\nAnd notice what happens here.\n\n237\n00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.805\nAnd Ronnie, I'm sure you can see this too.\n\n238\n00:12:29.805 --> 00:12:32.023\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] As he squints,\n\n239\n00:12:32.023 --> 00:12:34.770\nI'm torturing poor Ronnie over here.\n\n240\n00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.570\nNotice it says,\na compatible trusted platform module\n\n241\n00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.550\nsecurity device isn't\nfound on this computer.\n\n242\n00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.000\nSo, I can't turn BitLocker on and\nwell, that's it, right?\n\n243\n00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.970\nGame over, let's go ahead and\nturn the episode off here.\n\n244\n00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:47.700\nWell, not really, all right.\n\n245\n00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.401\nNow, again, they did touch on\nthis in other episodes, but\n\n246\n00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:53.210\nsince we're in the command prompt and\nwe need to enable this,\n\n247\n00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.660\nwe're gonna have to jump back\nto the GUI for a second.\n\n248\n00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.452\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna launch up the local or\n\n249\n00:12:58.452 --> 00:13:00.570\nthe group policy editor.\n\n250\n00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.750\nAnd you will see that in order\nto get BitLocker to work,\n\n251\n00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.020\nyou have to turn on non-TPM mode.\n\n252\n00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.000\nAnd that's all I'm doing here.\n\n253\n00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.215\nI'm going in to the Local Group Policy,\nand I'm going to Computer Configuration,\n\n254\n00:13:12.215 --> 00:13:15.370\nAdministrative Templates,\nWindows Components, BitLocker.\n\n255\n00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.262\nAnd we'll see those three different drive\ntypes, fixed data, operating system,\n\n256\n00:13:18.262 --> 00:13:19.440\nand removable.\n\n257\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.318\nI care about T:,\nit's where my operating system drive is.\n\n258\n00:13:22.318 --> 00:13:25.810\nSo I'm gonna go to Operating System Drive,\nand third down from the top on the right\n\n259\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.290\nhand side in the Policy Settings is\nrequire additional authentication, and\n\n260\n00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.450\nyou're just going to double click this.\n\n261\n00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.360\nAnd the policy setting comes up.\n\n262\n00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.890\nNow, I could set every one of\nthese configurations that we're\n\n263\n00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.910\ngoing to take care of in the command line.\n\n264\n00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.460\nI could set them right here.\n\n265\n00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.665\nBut again, the one way you study\nthis from maybe the other episode,\n\n266\n00:13:44.665 --> 00:13:47.370\nwhere we did it in the GUI, what if they\nask you to do it from the command line?\n\n267\n00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.960\nAnd that's why we're\ntackling both of them.\n\n268\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.310\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\njust enable this.\n\n269\n00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.320\nAnd I'm gonna choose okay, all right.\n\n270\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.430\nNow, if you're doing this\nat a group policy level,\n\n271\n00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.260\nyou might have to run GP update\n/force to update the settings.\n\n272\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.510\nThis is a local group policy and\na computer setting.\n\n273\n00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.220\nIt takes effect right away.\n\n274\n00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.250\nLet's find out.\n\n275\n00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.530\nI'm gonna do the same\nthing that I did before,\n\n276\n00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.680\njust like we did on the other machine.\n\n277\n00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.780\nAnd I'm gonna do a manage-, I really have\na problem with that manage [LAUGH] that\n\n278\n00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:19.689\nword manage, bde -on and\nI'm gonna do a C: here.\n\n279\n00:14:19.689 --> 00:14:22.410\nNow, notice what it's telling me,\nsame thing before,\n\n280\n00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.210\nit's saying well,\nyou're gonna need a password.\n\n281\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.580\nIt looked, it tried to find the TPM,\nand it didn't find it.\n\n282\n00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.607\nBut now what happens when I rerun\nthis command that we just typed in,\n\n283\n00:14:33.607 --> 00:14:38.210\nmanage-bde -protectors -add C:,\nand then -Password.\n\n284\n00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:42.162\nAll right, now let's confirming me\njust like it did before, go ahead and\n\n285\n00:14:42.162 --> 00:14:43.645\ntype that password.\n\n286\n00:14:43.645 --> 00:14:46.565\nAnd again,\nI'll type that super secret password.\n\n287\n00:14:46.565 --> 00:14:48.435\nAnd I want you to see something\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n288\n00:14:48.435 --> 00:14:50.427\nIt says Key Protector Added.\n\n289\n00:14:50.427 --> 00:14:54.675\nAll right, it's gonna take just a second\nhere, and it should give me an output.\n\n290\n00:14:54.675 --> 00:14:57.935\nIf you remember when I was kind of\nexplaining a little bit about what those\n\n291\n00:14:57.935 --> 00:15:02.689\nplatform configuration registers were, now\nwhen I see, when we kinda look in here,\n\n292\n00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:08.800\nnotice that for the protectors,\nI don't see TPM anymore.\n\n293\n00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.960\nRemember on the other machine,\nwe had up here more towards the top,\n\n294\n00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.560\nwe also had right about there,\nwe had a TPM and\n\n295\n00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.320\nthen all that garbled output of the PCRs,\nall right?\n\n296\n00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.970\nI don't have a TPM.\n\n297\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.040\nAnd again,\nwe'll get back to the key protector,\n\n298\n00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.590\nso know in a non-TPM enabled platform,\nyou have to go in and\n\n299\n00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:35.520\nyou have to turn the GPO setting on that\nsays require additional authentication.\n\n300\n00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.090\nNow you might say, well, if that's\nrequiring something, how is that enabling?\n\n301\n00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.496\nIt's forcing me to.\n\n302\n00:15:40.496 --> 00:15:45.701\nNo, it's forcing Windows to draw\na blind eye to the way BitLocker,\n\n303\n00:15:45.701 --> 00:15:50.085\nto get the full protection,\nthe early startup process,\n\n304\n00:15:50.085 --> 00:15:55.841\nprotect all of those boot files and\nsystem drivers, cryptographically,\n\n305\n00:15:55.841 --> 00:16:00.076\nit's basically saying all right,\nnow we can do this.\n\n306\n00:16:00.076 --> 00:16:01.790\nNow, that being said,\n\n307\n00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:07.570\nit's one of the ways that you can start\nyour BitLocker encryption, all right.\n\n308\n00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.970\nNow, if I go back,\nthat I've added my protector.\n\n309\n00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:15.029\nIf I go back and\nI type manage-bde space forge /on and\n\n310\n00:16:15.029 --> 00:16:19.864\nc:, now, Ronnie,\nwe're getting the same thing\n\n311\n00:16:19.864 --> 00:16:23.810\nthat we got on the other machine, right.\n\n312\n00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:27.490\nIt's saying, hey, it's not gonna happen\nand you get the GUI that's popping up.\n\n313\n00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.500\nMy head's kind of covering it up.\n\n314\n00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.410\nBut it'll disappear fairly quick.\n\n315\n00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.520\nBut it's letting me know that hey,\nBitLocker,\n\n316\n00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.180\ndrive encryption is going to start.\n\n317\n00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.330\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'll just do this from the command prompt.\n\n318\n00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.080\nWe'll do our shutdown command real quick.\n\n319\n00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.160\nAnd we'll let that go ahead and restart.\n\n320\n00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.795\nBut I need to verify,\nall right,I need to verify that\n\n321\n00:16:52.795 --> 00:16:58.360\nthe machine itself is running,\nand has completely restarted.\n\n322\n00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.560\nSo I'm gonna have to get back\ninto my remote desktop here.\n\n323\n00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.820\nSo, machine restarted disconnected me.\n\n324\n00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.848\nLet's go ahead and get connected here.\n\n325\n00:17:15.141 --> 00:17:18.410\nAnd give it a second there,\nit might still be restarting on me.\n\n326\n00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.440\n>> Now, Wes, while we're actually waiting\nfor that to restart, in our chatroom,\n\n327\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.270\nsomebody asked about the ability here\n\n328\n00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.560\nto store the BitLocker key\ninside of Active Directory.\n\n329\n00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.490\nCan you just mention a little bit of that?\n\n330\n00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:38.410\n>> One of the important things about,\nwhen you use BitLocker is,\n\n331\n00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.760\nif I forget the password, right?\n\n332\n00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.770\nI would forget my head if it\nwasn't attached to the neck.\n\n333\n00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:46.916\nSo, BitLocker and Microsoft, well, they\nkinda bake in this process that allows\n\n334\n00:17:46.916 --> 00:17:51.931\nyou to recover a BitLocker drive if you\nhappen to forget your password, right?\n\n335\n00:17:51.931 --> 00:17:54.180\nIt's a 48-digit recovery key.\n\n336\n00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.120\nNow, that recovery key\ncan be stored locally.\n\n337\n00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.800\nIt can also be stored in a centralized\nlocation such as Active Directory.\n\n338\n00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.740\nLet's show you what I mean here.\n\n339\n00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.385\nIf I decide that I do want to store\nthis key inside of Active Directory,\n\n340\n00:18:08.385 --> 00:18:10.766\nthen what we do is the manage-bde.\n\n341\n00:18:10.766 --> 00:18:13.400\nAnd this is under the Protectors option.\n\n342\n00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.174\nAnd I'll just kinda show you where\nthat option lies here, protectors and\n\n343\n00:18:18.174 --> 00:18:19.190\nwe'll do a /?\n\n344\n00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.260\nAnd you can see down here towards\ncloser to the bottom here,\n\n345\n00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.900\nit gives us the option,\nit says AD back up.\n\n346\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:31.150\nAnd like the question asked,\nthat backs up that recovery information to\n\n347\n00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:34.232\nthe Active Directory, where you\ncan do centralized administration.\n\n348\n00:18:34.232 --> 00:18:37.485\nYou could couple it with something\nlike MBAM Microsoft BitLocker and\n\n349\n00:18:37.485 --> 00:18:41.483\nAdministration and Monitoring, so that\nyou got that centralized location for it.\n\n350\n00:18:41.483 --> 00:18:43.990\nBut that brings us to the next thing.\n\n351\n00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.820\nWe wanna kinda find out,\nwhere is the status of our drive.\n\n352\n00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.770\nRemember that we have restarted our\nmachine and it said that the encryption\n\n353\n00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.020\nprocess wouldn't start until\nthe machine was restarted.\n\n354\n00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.740\nSo, let's find out, let's verify.\n\n355\n00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:59.775\nRemember you always have\nthat manage-bde and\n\n356\n00:18:59.775 --> 00:19:03.600\nthe -status option, right?\n\n357\n00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.490\nAnd I can say that the encryption process\nis, well, the encryption is in process.\n\n358\n00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.390\nNow, if you'll notice when we first\ntook a look at the status, right, and\n\n359\n00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.480\nthen BitLocker wasn't turned on, it didn't\ngive me a BitLocker version number.\n\n360\n00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.400\nThere's nothing for the machine to read.\n\n361\n00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.510\nWe didn't have BitLocker turned on so\nit can't query the operating system and\n\n362\n00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.210\nsay what version of\nBitLocker are you running.\n\n363\n00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:27.063\nSo, you can see that now it's going\nthrough its encryption process,\n\n364\n00:19:27.063 --> 00:19:28.471\nabout 13.5%.\n\n365\n00:19:28.471 --> 00:19:31.960\nNow, how long this takes is really\ncontingent on how big the drive is.\n\n366\n00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.567\nThis is a smaller drive\nby today's standards,\n\n367\n00:19:34.567 --> 00:19:36.790\nit's a 250 gig solid-state drive.\n\n368\n00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.800\nSo, this one doesn't\nreally take long at all.\n\n369\n00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.060\nIn fact, I was kinda shocked that the\ndecryption process from fully encrypted\n\n370\n00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.230\nreally didn't take that long at all.\n\n371\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:45.870\nSo it's fairly fast.\n\n372\n00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.402\nBut you can see all that\ninformation right here.\n\n373\n00:19:48.402 --> 00:19:50.940\n>> Just remember that even though\nit's gonna be fairly fast on\n\n374\n00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.730\nsomething like a solid state drive,\n\n375\n00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.710\nthat will not be true on a conventional\nregular disk drive as well.\n\n376\n00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.800\nSometimes, especially when you start\ngetting into the hundreds of gigabytes and\n\n377\n00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.280\nthere's actually data on it,\nit can actually take even overnight.\n\n378\n00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.520\nWhen the very first drive was ever\nencrypted, it was about 400 gigs of\n\n379\n00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.230\ninformation and it literally\ntook over 12 hours to encrypt.\n\n380\n00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:16.920\nSo, don't just assume that unless you\nreally know what your solid state drives\n\n381\n00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.980\nare gonna do,\nit might just take several minutes.\n\n382\n00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.110\nIt might take 20 minutes.\n\n383\n00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:23.590\nBut that's a lot faster than taking,\nlet's say, eight hours or ten hours.\n\n384\n00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.745\nBut you can have it where\nit does take that long and\n\n385\n00:20:25.745 --> 00:20:28.025\nit expect it to take\nthat process to do so.\n\n386\n00:20:28.025 --> 00:20:29.195\nSo don't try and rush it.\n\n387\n00:20:29.195 --> 00:20:32.439\n>> Most definitely, and when you get into\nthe size of the drives that we have today,\n\n388\n00:20:32.439 --> 00:20:34.776\nI'm sure if it's a terabyte drive and\nit takes over a day,\n\n389\n00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:37.466\ncan you imagine what a two, three or\nfour terabyte drive would be?\n\n390\n00:20:37.466 --> 00:20:39.512\nSo definitely, a piece of wisdom there.\n\n391\n00:20:39.512 --> 00:20:41.875\nSo, if you're gonna do\nsome drive encryption,\n\n392\n00:20:41.875 --> 00:20:43.557\nyou could still use the computer.\n\n393\n00:20:43.557 --> 00:20:46.391\nAnd that's one of the things I like about\nthe process, as you guys have seen,\n\n394\n00:20:46.391 --> 00:20:47.712\nI can still work with the computer.\n\n395\n00:20:47.712 --> 00:20:50.932\nIt's in the process doing\nthe encryption right now, but\n\n396\n00:20:50.932 --> 00:20:53.932\nI have access to the machine,\nso it is a good thing to do.\n\n397\n00:20:53.932 --> 00:20:56.262\nBut if you need full encryption,\n\n398\n00:20:56.262 --> 00:20:59.330\nmaybe you're doing some kind of security\ncompliance or something like that,\n\n399\n00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.750\nyou might not be able to use the drive\nuntil it is fully encrypted.\n\n400\n00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.970\nMay be some policy there, so\nI'd definitely plan accordingly.\n\n401\n00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.880\nNow, the other thing here that we have,\nI keep mentioning this term, protectors.\n\n402\n00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.355\nAnd I kind of dived into it just a little\nbit when we were trying to show you\n\n403\n00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:15.383\nhow to set up a group policy in order for\n\n404\n00:21:15.383 --> 00:21:18.975\nnon-TPM enabled device,\nwhat are the protectors here?\n\n405\n00:21:18.975 --> 00:21:22.495\nWell, the protectors\nare how you authenticate.\n\n406\n00:21:22.495 --> 00:21:25.265\nHow do I gain access\nto an encrypted drive?\n\n407\n00:21:25.265 --> 00:21:28.582\nNow, if I have something like\nthe TPM that we've seen,\n\n408\n00:21:28.582 --> 00:21:31.986\nthen it's almost that way cuz\nyou have the device there.\n\n409\n00:21:31.986 --> 00:21:36.624\nThe TPM is in the device itself so\nit sees it as a way to unlock the drive.\n\n410\n00:21:36.624 --> 00:21:41.450\nIn non-TPM based machines,\nwe got a couple of\n\n411\n00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.750\noptions if we require that additional\nauthentication you've seen.\n\n412\n00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.920\nLet's go ahead and show you a little\nbit more about the protectors so\n\n413\n00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.140\njust in case it comes up on the exam.\n\n414\n00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:54.230\nNow, if I get back into protectors,\nall right, you\n\n415\n00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:59.690\ncan do the manage-bde space-protectors,\nand then we're gonna do a space -get.\n\n416\n00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.500\nAnd honestly, I don't think you\nhave to put the dash in there.\n\n417\n00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.510\nI'll do a get here.\n\n418\n00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.095\nNo, maybe you do have to do the dash.\n\n419\n00:22:05.095 --> 00:22:11.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Protectors, let me see here what I did.\n\n420\n00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.525\nYou know what?\nDrive letter, drive letter, drive letter.\n\n421\n00:22:13.525 --> 00:22:15.661\n[LAUGH] If you don't put\nthe drive letter on,\n\n422\n00:22:15.661 --> 00:22:18.271\nthen it's not gonna give\nyou the right information.\n\n423\n00:22:21.058 --> 00:22:25.682\nAnd you do have to make sure that you put,\nthere we go, that's what I want.\n\n424\n00:22:25.682 --> 00:22:28.545\nThird time's a charm,\nthree more strikes and I'm out of here.\n\n425\n00:22:28.545 --> 00:22:30.210\nNotice that I have all the protection.\n\n426\n00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:34.840\nBasically, what I wanted to see, how\nare we authenticating on this device or\n\n427\n00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.590\nthis drive, right?\n\n428\n00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:36.560\nYou could see the TPM.\n\n429\n00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.210\nAnd if I type this side that I want to,\nin a non-TPM environment,\n\n430\n00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:44.020\nI wanna add like a password, like\nyou've seen in the other machine there\n\n431\n00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.430\nwhere it said,\nwhat are the protectors you have?\n\n432\n00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.357\nWe didn't see the TPM,\nwe've seen just the password.\n\n433\n00:22:49.357 --> 00:22:52.283\nWell, we could find that\ninformation here but\n\n434\n00:22:52.283 --> 00:22:55.670\nwhat if I want to add\nan additional capability?\n\n435\n00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.890\nWell, to add the additional capability,\nyou could just come in here.\n\n436\n00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:03.877\nAnd you could say for instance,\nI wanna do the manage bde-protectors and\n\n437\n00:23:03.877 --> 00:23:06.546\ninstead of doing -get I can do a -add.\n\n438\n00:23:06.546 --> 00:23:11.429\nAnd if I wanted to,\nI could name the drive, just C: here,\n\n439\n00:23:11.429 --> 00:23:15.420\nand I can do something like TPM and PIN.\n\n440\n00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.160\nRight, now, I will tell you that most\nlikely this is gonna error out on this\n\n441\n00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.800\nmachine because, and we'll go ahead and\nset our pin here and see if it allows it.\n\n442\n00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.820\nAnd one more time.\n\n443\n00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.230\nIt did.\n\n444\n00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:32.560\nWith the TPM being enabled, you don't have\nto worry about the group policy setting.\n\n445\n00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.480\nAnd that's something, honestly,\n\n446\n00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.460\nI was wondering if it was\ngonna come into play here,\n\n447\n00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.010\nrequiring you to choose those\nadditional authentication types.\n\n448\n00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:43.010\nBecause you start out with a TPM, you can\nadd additional protectors if you want\n\n449\n00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.440\nwithout getting back into it and\nrenaming it.\n\n450\n00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.954\nSo now,\nI see that there's a TPM and a PIN.\n\n451\n00:23:48.954 --> 00:23:53.225\nIf I rerun that get command, obviously,\nit really isn't gonna change much here.\n\n452\n00:23:53.225 --> 00:23:55.397\nIt's gonna be what you've\njust seen on the screen.\n\n453\n00:23:55.397 --> 00:23:59.532\nI can now see that not only the way I can\nunlock this drive is with the trusted\n\n454\n00:23:59.532 --> 00:24:00.930\nplatform module.\n\n455\n00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:05.270\nI can also unlock this drive if I need to,\nwith that four letter PIN.\n\n456\n00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.935\nAll right, so we've got our GPM and\nour PIN as far as our protectors.\n\n457\n00:24:08.935 --> 00:24:10.810\nLet me go ahead and\nclear the screen up here.\n\n458\n00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:14.830\nAnd there might be kind of, might come\na situation in which you want to,\n\n459\n00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.700\nyou decide well I don't want\nthe PIN anymore, I've got the TPM,\n\n460\n00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:22.060\nthat's the purpose of having BitLocker\nwith a TPM so you get most of the benefit.\n\n461\n00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.630\nSo let me show you what you can\ndo to take a protector off,\n\n462\n00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.360\ncuz that might come into\nplay in the exam as well.\n\n463\n00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.180\nSo we're gonna do a manage-bde.\n\n464\n00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.814\nWe're gonna do the -protectors.\n\n465\n00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.360\nAll right, and then what we're gonna do,\n\n466\n00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.540\nagain you have to do the -delete,\nand then SQL.\n\n467\n00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.060\nAnd again drive, letter,\ndrive, letter, drive, letter.\n\n468\n00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.810\nAnd it says okay, All Key Protectors.\n\n469\n00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:53.160\nRemember, this is our key protectors,\nTPM and the PIN.\n\n470\n00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.380\nBut now I want you to see something,\nand this is interesting.\n\n471\n00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.110\nIf we rerun, and be careful on this.\n\n472\n00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:02.670\nAnd not so much for the exam, but\nreally, in the real world scenario,\n\n473\n00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:03.970\nif you're gonna use this.\n\n474\n00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:07.980\nCuz if I rerun our protectors option,\n\n475\n00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:13.670\nand then I do a space get on c: again,\nI want you to notice that\n\n476\n00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:18.560\nwhen I said delete protectors,\nit didn't pick and choose.\n\n477\n00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.030\nNotice that right here it says All Key\nProtectors, and then there's brackets.\n\n478\n00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.190\nBasically means this drive\nis no longer protected.\n\n479\n00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.923\nSo be careful with that.\n\n480\n00:25:26.923 --> 00:25:31.036\nIf you delete the TPM and the PIN,\nyou have to come back there and\n\n481\n00:25:31.036 --> 00:25:35.630\nyou have to do a manage-bde, space,\nagain here's our protectors.\n\n482\n00:25:38.311 --> 00:25:43.148\nRight, and again, we're gonna do the add,\nagain your drive letter,\n\n483\n00:25:43.148 --> 00:25:48.070\nand we're gonna go and\nthis time we're just gonna type in TPM.\n\n484\n00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.250\nAnd when we run that,\n\n485\n00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:53.900\nnotice that you see our platform\nconfiguration registers are back.\n\n486\n00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.870\nYou gotta output that and let us\nknow that the TPM is turned back on.\n\n487\n00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.320\nSo Bitlocker is encrypted, right?\n\n488\n00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.990\nSo Bitlocker still turned on but\n\n489\n00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:06.480\nif you disable that TPM and PIN, you're\nreally, you don't get to pick to choose.\n\n490\n00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.950\nYou delete all the protectors.\n\n491\n00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.460\nAnd then once that's done,\ncome back in and reinitiate,\n\n492\n00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.170\nreimplement those\nprotectors that you want,\n\n493\n00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:18.070\nto make sure that you get back in\nthe drive after it's rebooted.\n\n494\n00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:21.030\n>> All right, Wes, that's actually\na great run down for us and\n\n495\n00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:25.500\ntaking a look at managing the idea\nof Bitlocker from the command line,\n\n496\n00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.290\nusing the manage-bde command as well.\n\n497\n00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.250\nSo, what do we take a look\nat in this episode?\n\n498\n00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.240\nWe started out by talking\nbriefly about the idea of\n\n499\n00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.810\nwhat Bitlocker actually does for us,\nwhich is that full drive encryption.\n\n500\n00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:41.870\nWes also reminded us just briefly\nhere that the drive encryption itself\n\n501\n00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:45.560\nis not active as long as\nyou are using the computer.\n\n502\n00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.140\nBut if you happen to reboot the computer,\nif you happen to actually have that drive\n\n503\n00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.010\nremoved, and\nthen stuck into another computer, well,\n\n504\n00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:54.780\nBitLocker will go and enable and\nmake it very difficult,\n\n505\n00:26:54.780 --> 00:27:00.120\nif not almost impossible, for\nsomebody else to get access to that drive.\n\n506\n00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.940\nUnless they have the pass key or\nthe password,\n\n507\n00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.025\nwhatever you wanna call it, the PIN\nnumber to be able to get access back in.\n\n508\n00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:10.490\nWe also take a look briefly at\nthe difference between TPM and\n\n509\n00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:13.650\nthe non-TPM implementation of\nit using the command line.\n\n510\n00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.550\nAnd so remember that Wes also showed us\na couple of things that may trip us up,\n\n511\n00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.500\nmake sure you go back and\nre-watch that section again\n\n512\n00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.940\nthat you understand what could actually\ntrip you up and how you get passed that.\n\n513\n00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.570\nAlso, enabling as well as disabling those\nprotectors, too, of what we can do in\n\n514\n00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:33.110\nterms of a back up for the actual key\nitself, and whether or not we're actually\n\n515\n00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:37.660\ngonna use this one or a single, or we\nactually use TPM and a PIN, you name it.\n\n516\n00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.770\nThere's a lot of different\nconfigurations that we can do here\n\n517\n00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.590\nfrom using that manage-bde command.\n\n518\n00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.359\nAnd this is something you\nwill see on that 70-697 exam.\n\n519\n00:27:47.359 --> 00:27:49.610\nI'm not gonna say you're\ngonna see everything.\n\n520\n00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:53.909\nBut just don't put it past them for\nthem to be able to go ahead and say,\n\n521\n00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:58.284\nwhich of the following commands do you\nactually need to be able to run If\n\n522\n00:27:58.284 --> 00:28:03.200\nyou're going to disable the protectors,\nor if you wanna remove just the PIN.\n\n523\n00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.964\nRemember that you have to remove that,\nbut if you enable the TPM again,\n\n524\n00:28:06.964 --> 00:28:09.380\nyou gotta add that one back in as well.\n\n525\n00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.160\nSo there's a lot of different\nthings that can be done.\n\n526\n00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.710\nSo, Wes, any last words for\nsomebody getting ready for\n\n527\n00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.600\nthe exam here when they take\na look at managing BitLocker?\n\n528\n00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.540\n>> There is one more thing.\n\n529\n00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.400\nI'm going Columbo on you guys out there.\n\n530\n00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.500\nThere is one more thing that we want\nto take a look at, just very briefly.\n\n531\n00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.890\nAs we've talked about in some of these\ncommands, they have abbreviations.\n\n532\n00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:31.270\nLet me show you what I mean and\nI want you guys to practice this, okay?\n\n533\n00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:35.770\nHere on my computer, all I did was\na manage- bde, space protectors,\n\n534\n00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.915\nspace add, forward slash, question mark.\n\n535\n00:28:37.915 --> 00:28:43.140\nAnd you're going to notice that TPM TP,\nTPM and\n\n536\n00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.460\nStartupKey is also abbreviated TSK.\n\n537\n00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.890\nPassword is abbreviated PW.\n\n538\n00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.440\nSo if you are preparing for\nthis exam, you wanna get certified,\n\n539\n00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.650\nI would take some time here not only\nto look at what, how we've set it up.\n\n540\n00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:00.010\nBut also come back in here and pay\nattention to the abbreviations because if\n\n541\n00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:03.910\nyou spell out TPM and startup key,\nwell what if they just give you TSK?\n\n542\n00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:07.150\nWell, you know what it means on the exam,\nso study the abbreviations,\n\n543\n00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.390\nand all in all, I think you'll be doing\nreally well for the certification exam.\n\n544\n00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.210\n>> It's a great reminder for us,\nWes, and that's a great place for\n\n545\n00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:17.730\nus to also go ahead and end this episode\nfor configuring Windows devices.\n\n546\n00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.853\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong,\n\n547\n00:29:20.853 --> 00:29:21.619\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n548\n00:29:21.619 --> 00:29:23.372\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n549\n00:29:23.372 -->

00:00:14.487\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n4\n00:00:14.487 --> 00:00:19.770\nwe're talking about\nconfiguring Windows devices.\n\n5\n00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.862\nWe're specifically focusing\nin on Windows 10 and\n\n6\n00:00:21.862 --> 00:00:24.820\ntaking a look at some of the devices\nthat we actually are gonna configure.\n\n7\n00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.349\nBut we're specifically gonna be focusing\nin on supporting networking, and\n\n8\n00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.830\nwho better to help us than Wes Bryan?\n\n9\n00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.190\nWes, welcome back to our studio.\n\n10\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.970\n>> Thanks, man.\n\n11\n00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.850\nIt's always good to be here\nwith ITProTV in the studios.\n\n12\n00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.600\nI appreciate you having me.\n\n13\n00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.890\nThat's right, we're gonna be\ndiving into supporting networking.\n\n14\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.706\nAnd in some of the other shows that we've\nalready got on tap for you guys out there,\n\n15\n00:00:44.706 --> 00:00:48.100\nwe've really looked at networking\nfrom the graphical user interface.\n\n16\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.042\nSo definitely go back and check those\nepisodes out, and then hopefully,\n\n17\n00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:54.180\nyou can couple it with some of the command\nline stuff that we're gonna do here.\n\n18\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.206\nSo that on that MCSA exam, if they do\ngive you any questions about networking,\n\n19\n00:00:58.206 --> 00:01:02.660\nyou're gonna be familiar with some of\nthe topics that we're gonna look at.\n\n20\n00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.020\n>> Now Wes,\nbecause we're taking a look at Windows 10,\n\n21\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.660\na lot of people, even right now,\neven though it's been around for\n\n22\n00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.290\na little bit of time,\nthey're still getting confused,\n\n23\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.560\nespecially with some of the different\nnetwork settings that are out there.\n\n24\n00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.780\nIt was fairly familiar in Windows 8.1,\nbut now we're\n\n25\n00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.600\nactually starting to see a few things\nthat are a little bit more different.\n\n26\n00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.290\nAnd we just want it to work\nthe way that we need it to.\n\n27\n00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.050\nAnd so, Wes, you're gonna help us to\nmake sure that we understand the ins and\n\n28\n00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.850\nouts of helping support\nusers when doing this.\n\n29\n00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.825\n>> Most definitely.\n\n30\n00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:33.885\nSome of the things that you gotta look at\nis that Windows does have a technology\n\n31\n00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:36.582\nbuilt into it called\nnetwork location awareness.\n\n32\n00:01:36.582 --> 00:01:41.272\nAnd for us, there's many different things\nthat this technology helps us benefit,\n\n33\n00:01:41.272 --> 00:01:44.918\nlike location aware printing and\nother location type services.\n\n34\n00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:48.266\nBut for us, this has actually\nbeen around since Windows 7, and\n\n35\n00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:52.172\nnetwork location awareness really is\njust the ability that software can be\n\n36\n00:01:52.172 --> 00:01:55.768\nconfigured based on a choice that\nyou make, what network location,\n\n37\n00:01:55.768 --> 00:01:57.829\nwhat network profile are you a part of.\n\n38\n00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.755\nSo let's go ahead and look in that.\n\n39\n00:01:59.755 --> 00:02:02.625\nWe're gonna kind of start out in the GUI\n\n40\n00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:05.845\nfirst because I want you to see what these\nprofiles are that we're talking about.\n\n41\n00:02:05.845 --> 00:02:08.075\nSo I'm in Windows 10 here on my laptop,\nbut\n\n42\n00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:11.725\nI'm just gonna minimize my PowerShell\nthat I have open here because\n\n43\n00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:14.945\nwe do kinda wanna start seeing this\nfrom the graphical user interface.\n\n44\n00:02:14.945 --> 00:02:16.630\nAnd we're going into Control Panel.\n\n45\n00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.740\nNow I'm one that likes the large icons,\nso I can find what I want,\n\n46\n00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.450\ninstead of a door in front of a door,\nbut if you haven't configured this or\n\n47\n00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.640\nmodified it,\nyou might be in the category view here.\n\n48\n00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.530\nSo we'll go ahead and\nleave it with the defaults.\n\n49\n00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.580\nNow I'm gonna jump in here real quick,\nthe System and\n\n50\n00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.627\nSecurity, and then the Windows Firewall.\n\n51\n00:02:34.627 --> 00:02:37.970\nAnd we're gonna look at\nallowing applications or\n\n52\n00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.030\nfeatures through the firewall.\n\n53\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.910\nAnd what I really wanna just focus\nin on are what are these terms,\n\n54\n00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.720\nwhat are these two terms here mean for\nus, private and public?\n\n55\n00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.170\nWell, these are what are called\nnetwork locations as it relates\n\n56\n00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.630\nto the firewall itself, it's a global\nsuite of security settings and\n\n57\n00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.040\ndifferent configurations\nbased on what you choose.\n\n58\n00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.100\nSo think about being at the hotspot,\nright.\n\n59\n00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.840\nIf you're on a public hotspot there, a\nWiFi hotspot, and you're at your favorite\n\n60\n00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.080\ncoffee store, well, I might not want to be\nput into a private profile configuration.\n\n61\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.310\nWe're gonna kind of look\nat why here in a bit.\n\n62\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.480\nAnd that's because certain things\non my device become discoverable.\n\n63\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.090\nPeople can connect to my device, and if\nthey happen to have a password, they can\n\n64\n00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.560\npotentially not even just hack into my\ndevice, but they could share files.\n\n65\n00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.890\nAnd if I'm at one of those place,\nlike a public WiFi hotspot,\n\n66\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.220\nI might not wanna be\ndiscoverable on the network.\n\n67\n00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.530\nSo it's very important to\nhave these configured right\n\n68\n00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.510\nfrom a security standpoint, but\nyou also have to make sure even from\n\n69\n00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.100\na network communication standpoint, that\nyou have these configured appropriately.\n\n70\n00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.210\nAnd let me give you an example.\n\n71\n00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.100\nOne of the things that you can\ndo is you can come in here, and\n\n72\n00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.815\nyou could turn on the remote\ndesktop software.\n\n73\n00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:48.640\nSo when it comes down to it,\n\n74\n00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.860\nI could come in here, and\nlet me get back to my screen here.\n\n75\n00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.450\nI could come in here, and\nif I wanted to, I could go into system.\n\n76\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.390\nAnd Ronnie and I were talking about\nthis before we started the show, and\n\n77\n00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.610\nyou can see that I could\nturn on remote connections.\n\n78\n00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.080\nRight now, somebody should be able to\nconnect to this computer and manage it,\n\n79\n00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.970\nadministrate it, if you will,\nfrom a remote location.\n\n80\n00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.122\nNow here's the thing.\n\n81\n00:04:10.122 --> 00:04:12.731\nYour firewall is set up appropriately,\nit says okay,\n\n82\n00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:16.830\nI see that you're gonna allow inbound\ntraffic, we're gonna allow communication.\n\n83\n00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.800\nBut if the network profile changes, all of\nthe settings become null and void because\n\n84\n00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.810\nit won't allow an inbound communication,\neven though that you've set it up.\n\n85\n00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.710\nAnd that's where we're getting to when\nwe drop back into the command prompt.\n\n86\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.180\nWe're gonna look at these profiles a\nlittle bit, show you how to identify them,\n\n87\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.618\nand then also show you how\nto manage them as well.\n\n88\n00:04:36.618 --> 00:04:39.642\n>> All right, Wes, so before we do that,\nlet's go and take a look at our Network\n\n89\n00:04:39.642 --> 00:04:43.840\nand Sharing Center and show them how\ncan they actually tell whether or\n\n90\n00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.170\nnot the user is gonna be on a private\nnetwork or gonna be on a public network.\n\n91\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.220\nAnd that would get us set up for\nwhat you're about to do.\n\n92\n00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.430\n>> Definitely.\nSo if you're in the Control Panel,\n\n93\n00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.260\nvery easy place to go, we're gonna\ngo to Network and Internet, and\n\n94\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.460\nthen at the top,\ndoor in front of a door, right?\n\n95\n00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.450\nWe're gonna go the Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n96\n00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.810\nAnd inside of the Network and\n\n97\n00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.800\nSharing Center, you will see that\nwe've got a couple of options here\n\n98\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.990\nwhen it comes to the networks\nthat we're connected to, right?\n\n99\n00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.540\nYou can see the ITProTV network.\n\n100\n00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.920\nThat's our network here in the studios\nthat this machine is connected to.\n\n101\n00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.822\nAnd you can see that it says\nprivate network, but then we've got\n\n102\n00:05:13.822 --> 00:05:17.280\nan unidentified network that also\nsays private network here as well.\n\n103\n00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.230\nWell, that is the profile.\n\n104\n00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.670\nThat is the network location.\n\n105\n00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.450\nAnd they're really all tied together,\nright.\n\n106\n00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.080\nA network location is the ability for the\ndevice to be discovered on the network.\n\n107\n00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.440\nLet me show you what I mean in\nmore of the newer interface.\n\n108\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.099\nIf we go down to Action Center in\nthe lower right-hand corner and\n\n109\n00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:39.010\nwe go to All Settings and then you're\ngonna see Network and Internet here.\n\n110\n00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.863\nAll right, if I look at Ethernet, you\ndon't really see too many settings here,\n\n111\n00:05:42.863 --> 00:05:45.469\nbut if you click on the actual connection,\nremember,\n\n112\n00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:47.980\nI told you we were connected\nto the ITProTV network.\n\n113\n00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.950\nAnd if we look at this, you'll see\nthat we've got this option here.\n\n114\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.698\nSo in some of the older\neditions of Windows,\n\n115\n00:05:53.698 --> 00:05:57.339\nyou might have a little bar that\nslides out from the side and\n\n116\n00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:01.520\nsays, do you wanna make your device\ndiscoverable on the network?\n\n117\n00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.019\nAnd you can see here, this might not be\nsomething that I wanna do [LAUGH] if I'm\n\n118\n00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:07.580\non a public hotspot here.\n\n119\n00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.220\nAnd that's one of the things that\nsets the private profile and\n\n120\n00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.926\nthe public profiles a little\nbit different from one another.\n\n121\n00:06:12.926 --> 00:06:16.110\nSo a couple different locations,\nyou got the traditional control panel, and\n\n122\n00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.530\nif you're coming from a Windows 7,\n\n123\n00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.230\na Windows 8, 8.1,\nyou're probably familiar with that.\n\n124\n00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.110\nBut I would be familiar with\nthe new Action Center and\n\n125\n00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.450\nhow to get there inside of\nthis graphical user interface.\n\n126\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.340\nBut speaking of graphical user interface,\n\n127\n00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.820\nwhat do you say we get into\nthe command prompt now?\n\n128\n00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.650\nI'm actually in a PowerShell, and\n\n129\n00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.070\nwe're gonna show you a couple\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n130\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.770\nCuz PowerShell can help you out,\nand tell you what,\n\n131\n00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:45.150\nlet's bump up that font a little bit,\nmake it easier for all of us to read here.\n\n132\n00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.810\nThere we go.\n\n133\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.170\nSo, what we're gonna do here, we're\ngonna start out by the PowerShell, and\n\n134\n00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.258\nwhat you can do is just do a Get-net.\n\n135\n00:06:55.258 --> 00:06:58.110\nAnd I just really,\nI type the first couple of letters,\n\n136\n00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.970\nand I use the tab functionality.\n\n137\n00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.420\nNow you probably won't have the tab\nfunctionality on the exam, but\n\n138\n00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.570\nI recommend if you're not familiar with\nPowerShell, use the tab functionality.\n\n139\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.170\nIt'll help you get used to\nsome of the commandlets,\n\n140\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.260\neven if you don't know how to\nspell them right up front.\n\n141\n00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.520\nSo this is Get-NetConnectionProfile.\n\n142\n00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.610\nAnd when I run this, it's gonna tell\nme what profiles my network is,\n\n143\n00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.230\nbased on the network that I'm attached to.\n\n144\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.920\nNow there's two networks that this,\nsame network but\n\n145\n00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.730\ntwo different network adapters that we're\nusing here because we wanna show you some\n\n146\n00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.590\nof the WiFii settings that you can\nmanage inside of the PowerShell.\n\n147\n00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.950\nSo I can see that Ethernet,\nthis is the ITProTV.\n\n148\n00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.600\nNotice the network category\nis private right there.\n\n149\n00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.540\nWe've seen that inside of the Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n150\n00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.360\nIf I was to take the setting\nin the newer Action Center and\n\n151\n00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.600\nI was to turn that off, it would\nflip me over to the public profile.\n\n152\n00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.589\nAnd then my device would no longer be able\nto be discovered by other devices that\n\n153\n00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:50.830\nare out there searching for it.\n\n154\n00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.563\nSo, it's a good way if you wanna\nfind out what are the profiles,\n\n155\n00:07:54.563 --> 00:07:59.491\nwhat's the current profile for the network\nadapters that you have in your machine.\n\n156\n00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:04.707\nNow, what if I decide\nthat maybe I don't want\n\n157\n00:08:04.707 --> 00:08:11.540\na network to have a certain\ntype of network category?\n\n158\n00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.770\nWell we can change that and\nthat's what were gonna do.\n\n159\n00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.760\nNow, I'm actually [LAUGH] remoted Into\nthis computer on the ITProTV network.\n\n160\n00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.190\nSo I'm not [LAUGH] gonna modify that one,\nbecause remember what I told you,\n\n161\n00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.580\nif you don't have the right profile\nsetting you can disable certain things.\n\n162\n00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.390\nWell, if I were to change this to\npublic right now my RTP session\n\n163\n00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.960\nwould close like that.\n\n164\n00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.266\nWhich is another good thing to\nrecognize when you're troubleshooting.\n\n165\n00:08:32.266 --> 00:08:33.990\nSo we're gonna go and\nchange this around a little bit.\n\n166\n00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.170\nRemember you get, get shows you,\nset configures it.\n\n167\n00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:39.730\nAnd that's what were gonna do.\n\n168\n00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.540\nWe're gonna do set net connection profile.\n\n169\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.610\nAnd you got a couple of different\noptions here on this next parameter.\n\n170\n00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.430\nYou've got interface alias or\n\n171\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.130\nyou got interface index it\ndepends on how you wanna do this.\n\n172\n00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:56.840\nSo if I do interface,\nyou can see I can use InterfaceAlias.\n\n173\n00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.940\nNow, if I use InterfaceAlias, then what\nI'm gonna do is find the appropriate alias\n\n174\n00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.510\nup here at the top, and I could type\nin Ethernet or I could type Wi-Fi.\n\n175\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.415\nSo I'll just come down here and\nI'd say WiFi.\n\n176\n00:09:07.415 --> 00:09:11.515\nAnd, it is important,\n[LAUGH] to type the alias correctly.\n\n177\n00:09:11.515 --> 00:09:14.495\nAnd then the next thing that were\ngonna do, we have to find out.\n\n178\n00:09:14.495 --> 00:09:16.355\nWell, there's a network category.\n\n179\n00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:20.895\nSo if you add the option, network\ncategory, and then I can turn around, and\n\n180\n00:09:20.895 --> 00:09:22.505\nI can type which category it is.\n\n181\n00:09:22.505 --> 00:09:24.585\nNow, remember,\nyou got a couple of options.\n\n182\n00:09:24.585 --> 00:09:26.690\nYou can use public, or\nyou can use private.\n\n183\n00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.570\nIf you're in a domain environment,\nyou'll also have another profile domain.\n\n184\n00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.870\nBut typically that's gonna be\nmanaged by a domain control.\n\n185\n00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.550\nIt's gonna be managed by\na systems administrator.\n\n186\n00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.220\nSo you're not gonna see it here.\n\n187\n00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.060\nAnd if I run this, well look at that.\n\n188\n00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.640\nDoes absolutely nothing.\n\n189\n00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.010\nWhat [LAUGH] did we just do?\n\n190\n00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.050\nAnd that's where we're gonna\nrerun that command again.\n\n191\n00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.950\nAnd we're gonna do a get-net.\n\n192\n00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.660\nConnection, provided I type the G first.\n\n193\n00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.690\nSo get -net.\n\n194\n00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.720\nConnection profile and\nif I re-run this again,\n\n195\n00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.210\nyou can now see that the WiFi\nis on the public network\n\n196\n00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:03.310\ncategory versus up here where it's started\nit was on the private network category.\n\n197\n00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.640\nNow that was doing it\nby the interface alias.\n\n198\n00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.540\nAgain you can also set these\nby the interface index too.\n\n199\n00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.110\nNow this is where you have to pay\nattention to the index number so\n\n200\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.720\nlet's do that get network or\nget -net connection profile again and\n\n201\n00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.630\nnotice that we've got this other option,\ninterface index.\n\n202\n00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.240\nNow it doesn't look like\nan option right now but\n\n203\n00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.370\nI'll show you that here in a second.\n\n204\n00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.050\nSo if I wanted to say take the WiFi\nnetwork and I wanted to say maybe set it\n\n205\n00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:33.260\nback to private then what I could do\nis the set -net connection profile and\n\n206\n00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.960\ninstead of doing the interface alias I\ncould switch it one more interface index\n\n207\n00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.260\nand it's just how the computer identifies\nwhat network adapter you're talking about.\n\n208\n00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.760\nSame option as before, network category,\n\n209\n00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.479\nso dash network category,\nwe'll do a space, and we'll type private.\n\n210\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.930\nAll right, there again not [LAUGH]\nvery flashy, once it's done.\n\n211\n00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.730\nAs long as you're not\ngetting a red output.\n\n212\n00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.920\nYou know typically you probably\nconfigured it right but\n\n213\n00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.010\nyou always wanna double check.\n\n214\n00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:04.550\nSo let's do that one more time and\nwe'll see that.\n\n215\n00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.310\nThere we go.\n\n216\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.300\nCouple different ways Ronnie,\n\n217\n00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:11.050\nif we wanted to set out network category\nwe can do it by interface alias or\n\n218\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.430\nwe could do it by interface index on\nthe exam, does it matter which one?\n\n219\n00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.370\nI don't know, and\nthat's why I showed you both.\n\n220\n00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.350\nSo if it comes up on the exam,\nthey give you a couple of parameters\n\n221\n00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.900\nthat maybe you weren't expecting,\nyou're gonna have both of them.\n\n222\n00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.890\nAnd you should be able\nto get that one right.\n\n223\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.640\n>> Learning these commands are actually\nreally essential especially in\n\n224\n00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.640\nthe support environment as well.\n\n225\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.353\nThere's a lot of times,\nespecially on a brand new computer,\n\n226\n00:11:32.353 --> 00:11:34.977\nwhen somebody is trying to get\nconnected to their network.\n\n227\n00:11:34.977 --> 00:11:38.207\nYou might find out something which\nis how I found out the hard way,\n\n228\n00:11:38.207 --> 00:11:42.026\nis that as soon as they brought up let's\nsay like a Microsoft Surface tablet it\n\n229\n00:11:42.026 --> 00:11:46.025\nautomatically connected them to that\npublic profile which meant it actually had\n\n230\n00:11:46.025 --> 00:11:49.728\nall those same benefits that West was\ntalking about, the restrictions and\n\n231\n00:11:49.728 --> 00:11:52.050\neverything else that we needed to.\n\n232\n00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.970\nBut through that GUI interface, through\nthat network and sharing center, is not as\n\n233\n00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:01.330\neasy to actually be able to change\nthat connection just like you think.\n\n234\n00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.580\nI always thought you just click on\nthe icon and that should change it, but\n\n235\n00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:05.460\nyou'll find out something.\n\n236\n00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.840\nIt doesn't work that easily.\n\n237\n00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.450\nBut if you can at least learn this\ncommand, the set dash network connection\n\n238\n00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:15.700\nprofile is really gonna help you out when\nyou do need somebody to actually change,\n\n239\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.010\nor you actually have to change\nthat profile for someone.\n\n240\n00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.410\nMake sure you know that you can do\nit either by the index number, or\n\n241\n00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.960\nby the alias interface, and\nknow what you wanna change it to.\n\n242\n00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.090\nSo also the other thing\nthat West also mentioned\n\n243\n00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:32.650\nis that even though we tend to see two\ndifferent connection profiles by default.\n\n244\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.780\nIf that particular device\nnow is actually joined to\n\n245\n00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.100\nyour active directory network right,\nyour Microsoft active directory network,\n\n246\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.840\nyou also end up with third\nprofile also called Domain.\n\n247\n00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.920\nSo, don't think your limited by two, it\njust depends on the context that your in.\n\n248\n00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.140\nSo, this is a great little\ntroubleshooting tool when somebody says\n\n249\n00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.540\nI can't get connected\nthe way that we want.\n\n250\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.810\nAnd you actually have to realize that\nit could be that connection profile is\n\n251\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.980\nsomething that we actually need to check\nout first before we actually start\n\n252\n00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.260\ntrying to troubleshoot by turning\noff the firewall completely and\n\n253\n00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.710\ngo, that should fix it.\n\n254\n00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:05.624\nGood luck.\n[LAUGH]\n\n255\n00:13:05.624 --> 00:13:06.263\n>> Yeah, and\n\n256\n00:13:06.263 --> 00:13:10.949\nRonnie there is one other one and this\none I'll mention it real quick the reason\n\n257\n00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:15.493\nI don't think it's really an appropriate\nmethod is because there are times\n\n258\n00:13:15.493 --> 00:13:20.393\nwhere in my lab environments we all have\nlabs here we're running Windows machines\n\n259\n00:13:20.393 --> 00:13:22.855\nthat I need to have a private profile.\n\n260\n00:13:22.855 --> 00:13:24.505\nThis is the way that you should do it.\n\n261\n00:13:24.505 --> 00:13:26.235\nThere are other ways that\nyou can do it like for\n\n262\n00:13:26.235 --> 00:13:30.800\ninstance if I was to run my gpedit.msc.\n\n263\n00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.978\nSo sorry Ron, here I'm kinda going off\nthe beaten path here a little bit.\n\n264\n00:13:33.978 --> 00:13:36.620\nAnd just kinda showing you this one here,\nbecause if we're under\n\n265\n00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.470\nthe Windows settings, and\nhere's the reason I don't like this,\n\n266\n00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:43.580\nbecause what does it say that you're\nabout to start modifying, right?\n\n267\n00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.810\n>> Just like Ronny said, we don't just\nturn the firewall off and leave it off and\n\n268\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:47.680\nthink that it's a fix.\n\n269\n00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.830\nIt might be a short term\nway to identify a problem.\n\n270\n00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.180\nBut it's definitely not long term.\n\n271\n00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.340\nBut if I was to go in here,\ninto to the security settings and\n\n272\n00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:03.960\nI drop down to, you'll see this\nlocation network list manager policies.\n\n273\n00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.480\nI could force it.\n\n274\n00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:11.200\nTo say that all identified networks,\nI want all identified\n\n275\n00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.840\nI wanna configure them and I wanna\nforce them into a certain location.\n\n276\n00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.810\nNow I don't recommend it this way\njust because this is permanent,\n\n277\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.440\nthat's the beauty of\nnetwork location awareness.\n\n278\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.700\nNetwork location awareness is I just\nrealized, you connected to a new network.\n\n279\n00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.910\nAnd I'm gonna warn you about that.\n\n280\n00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.510\nYou're not gonna get the warning here.\n\n281\n00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.570\nOnce you set it here in your local policy,\nit's gonna say I don't care that I\n\n282\n00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.900\ndetected that you connected\nto another network,\n\n283\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.160\nyou're gonna get the private profile.\n\n284\n00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.250\nSo, I just kinda, bring that one up there.\n\n285\n00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.740\nCuz it is a method, I've used it because\nI've had to demonstrate the homegroup,\n\n286\n00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.730\ngot to be a part of the private profile,\nwhich might be a good thing to mention.\n\n287\n00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.348\nOr if you're supporting a home group out\nthere, maybe you're supporting a small\n\n288\n00:14:53.348 --> 00:14:56.287\noffice that doesn't have enterprise\nlevel editions of Windows,\n\n289\n00:14:56.287 --> 00:14:59.090\nthen you might need to\nimplement the homegroup.\n\n290\n00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.310\nIf you're on a public profile, you're\nnot on a private profile, guess what?\n\n291\n00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:04.220\nNo homegroup.\n\n292\n00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.060\nNot even the ability to create or\njoin one.\n\n293\n00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.070\nSo that is something to keep in mind.\n\n294\n00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:13.500\nNow that being said, we've looked at\nPowerShell, but there's other command.\n\n295\n00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.400\nThere's a command that's been\naround in Windows for a long time,\n\n296\n00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.360\nand it's one that kinda\nscares people at first.\n\n297\n00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.380\nI know it gave me chills the first time\nI'd seen it because of its complexity.\n\n298\n00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.340\nIt's very powerful and that's the Netsh\ncommand, there's also ways we can look at\n\n299\n00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.900\nprofiles with Netsh, so these are a couple\nof different commands that could show up.\n\n300\n00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.530\nWhether it's command within PowerShell or\nit's the traditional command in command\n\n301\n00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.500\nprompt, I would definitely\nbe aware of them.\n\n302\n00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.664\nSo let's take a second here and\nlook at that.\n\n303\n00:15:38.664 --> 00:15:43.592\nNow Netsh has an option AdvFirewall and\nI'll tell you Ronnie I always mess this\n\n304\n00:15:43.592 --> 00:15:48.447\none up sometimes because, when you're\nconfiguring the firewall you have to\n\n305\n00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:53.544\nname it twice, AdvFirewall, and then you\ndo a space, and then firewall again.\n\n306\n00:15:53.544 --> 00:15:55.546\nBut what this is gonna show us is,\n\n307\n00:15:55.546 --> 00:15:59.348\nwhat is the state of the firewall\nas it relates to the profiles?\n\n308\n00:15:59.348 --> 00:16:03.514\nSo we're gonna do a show All and\n\n309\n00:16:03.514 --> 00:16:09.580\nprofiles, and did I not do that right?\n\n310\n00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.250\nShow all profiles to make sure,\ndouble check.\n\n311\n00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.770\nOne of the things that you have\nto make sure though is that it's,\n\n312\n00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.490\nyou might have seen me typing all and\nthen space profiles.\n\n313\n00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:24.040\nIt's one word so we have to do it a little\nbit different here, we're gonna do it.\n\n314\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.070\nIn fact, I'll tell you what let me\nkind of clear the screen here and\n\n315\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.990\nget this to the top and\nmake it a little bit easier.\n\n316\n00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.810\nSo I was typing the word separate,\n\n317\n00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:38.420\nif you dot netsh advfirewall show and\nthen allprofiles.\n\n318\n00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.770\nNow it shows me what\nare the current profiles right.\n\n319\n00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.700\nRemember when firewall typically,\nhow host based firewalls and\n\n320\n00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.940\nmost firewalls are to set to block all\ninbound communications except those\n\n321\n00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.850\nthat you allow through,\noutbound communications are allowed.\n\n322\n00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.880\nAnd we can see in fact this\n\n323\n00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.580\nis nice you can see the main profile\nsetting here that we were talking about.\n\n324\n00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.120\nYou can see the private\nprofile setting and\n\n325\n00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.590\nthen finally the public profile setting.\n\n326\n00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:09.310\nNotice that the firewall policy,\nblock inbound, allow outbound.\n\n327\n00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.680\nNotice block inbound, allow outbound.\n\n328\n00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.680\nThat's typically the default state of\nour firewalls so you do get to see some\n\n329\n00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.940\nof the characteristics of those\nprofiles when you use that command but.\n\n330\n00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:26.250\nMaybe concerned about the profile that's\ncurrently attached to the machine.\n\n331\n00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.510\nWell it's not really too\nmuch different here.\n\n332\n00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.326\nWe're just gonna do netsh, and, again,\n\n333\n00:17:31.326 --> 00:17:36.650\nadvfirewall, all right.\n\n334\n00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.350\nAnd, again, this last perimeter\nmake sure that the words together.\n\n335\n00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.590\nThey're not separate.\n\n336\n00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.670\nAnd that is current,\nall one word, current.\n\n337\n00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:50.150\nProfile and now what I can do\nis,instead of just seeing all\n\n338\n00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.000\nthe firewall profiles, I can see the one\njust specifically that I want and\n\n339\n00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.305\nmore importantly the one that is\ncurrently affecting my machine.\n\n340\n00:17:58.305 --> 00:18:01.845\nNow you can also get a little\nbit more granular if you just\n\n341\n00:18:01.845 --> 00:18:04.225\nwant maybe not to see all of the profile,\nbut\n\n342\n00:18:04.225 --> 00:18:07.575\nyou say I don't know what the current\nsettings are for the public profile.\n\n343\n00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:11.110\nEven though I can see right now that\nI'm attached to the private profile.\n\n344\n00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.855\nWel,l we can do that as well.\n\n345\n00:18:12.855 --> 00:18:17.985\nYou can do instead of saying show current\nprofile just take that word current.\n\n346\n00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:25.390\nAnd you're going to replace it with public\nor privateprofile, again all one word.\n\n347\n00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:30.260\nSo if we do for instance I know that\nI'm attached to the privateprofile, but\n\n348\n00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.540\nmaybe I want to know what setting\nare in the publicprofile.\n\n349\n00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.050\nSo there again.\n\n350\n00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.950\nSo more of the manipulations and\nidentifying the profiles,\n\n351\n00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:38.990\nwhat are their current settings.\n\n352\n00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.570\nAnd including the ones that\nare currently attached to the machine\n\n353\n00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.740\nif you need to do trouble shooting.\n\n354\n00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.900\nRemember, from a trouble shooting\nstand point maybe you don't know\n\n355\n00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.130\nwhy things like RDP aren't connecting.\n\n356\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.700\nAll right, well you can do some remote\nadministration, connect to that machine.\n\n357\n00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:56.860\nFire up a command prompt or if you\nwill a power shell and turn around and\n\n358\n00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.350\nenter these commands, and find out\nexactly what the state of the profile is.\n\n359\n00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.480\nSo, Ronnie a few different ways right?\n\n360\n00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.370\nWe got our power shell, we got GET.\n\n361\n00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.978\nRemember this too for the exam.\n\n362\n00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:10.790\nIf sometimes, cuz we all get nervous\nwhen we're in the exam booth.\n\n363\n00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.860\nIf you can remember, a lot of times\nwhat they'll do is they'll say\n\n364\n00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.410\nChoose two answers, each answer\nrepresents a complete solution.\n\n365\n00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:21.610\nRemember right away, Get and then Set.\n\n366\n00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.410\nGet connects to an object, Set\nconfigures the object, in this context.\n\n367\n00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.480\nI know there are hundreds of other\noptions and commands that's out there,\n\n368\n00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.270\nbut that is one way that you can\nreally narrow down on the exam.\n\n369\n00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:36.640\nAnd it might be something that helps you\nout, get that answer right on the exam.\n\n370\n00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.000\nWes, there is no doubt that what we\nactually see here is a bunch of nice and\n\n371\n00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.350\nvery powerful commands that\nreally help us to support users\n\n372\n00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.220\nas they're trying to get connected.\n\n373\n00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.270\nAnd more than anything, in today's world,\nwe're actually seeing more of those\n\n374\n00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.830\ntablets, more Windows phones,\nmore devices that are out there.\n\n375\n00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.190\nAnd it's gonna all be things\nlike wireless connections, and\n\n376\n00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.870\nwe do have to verify that that\nprofile is really gonna help us out.\n\n377\n00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.420\nBut there may be even more information\nthat we have to be able to get to,\n\n378\n00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.020\nsuch as configuring all\nthe wireless lan as well.\n\n379\n00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.580\nSo Wes what do we need to look at here?\n\n380\n00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.090\n>> Well you're wireless local area\nnettings, if I could say that,\n\n381\n00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.500\nhow about I just say WLAN?\n\n382\n00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.940\nYour wireless local area network\nsettings are important for you,\n\n383\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.930\nand This is another thing, that yes we can\nfall back to the graphical user interface.\n\n384\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.820\nIt's one of the reasons we have the GUI,\nbut on the exam,\n\n385\n00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:26.620\nthey might call out, what can you\ndo inside of a command prompt.\n\n386\n00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.210\nOr what can you do inside\nof a PowerShell window, and\n\n387\n00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.340\nthat's what we need to look at here.\n\n388\n00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.270\nNow, I say that, this is actually coming\nfrom the traditional command prompt.\n\n389\n00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.130\nIt just so happens that conveniently,\n\n390\n00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:39.210\nwe can run command prompt\ncommands inside of a PowerShell.\n\n391\n00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.110\nBut you need to know that this is\nin a commandlet, this is a command.\n\n392\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.670\nAnd again we're going back to the NSH\ncommand so let's check back over to our\n\n393\n00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.240\npower shell window, and I'll go ahead and\nclear the screen up here.\n\n394\n00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.770\nAnd what I might wanna do is I might\nwanna find out does this device,\n\n395\n00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.940\nis this device even using\nwireless I don't know.\n\n396\n00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.310\nSo let's go ahead and type a command\nthat'll allow us to find that out.\n\n397\n00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.580\nThat's going to be netsh, and now,\n\n398\n00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:06.470\ninstead of using the add firewall option,\nwe're changing that.\n\n399\n00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:11.780\nWe're using the wla,\nyour wireless local area network, so wlan.\n\n400\n00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:17.660\nAnd, when we run this we're going to\nadd a couple of options in Fairly easy.\n\n401\n00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.870\nShow and then space, interface.\n\n402\n00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:24.780\nAnd when we run this it's gonna show\nme what is the current configuration,\n\n403\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:29.670\nif any, of the wireless network that this\ndevice might be connected to, right?\n\n404\n00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.670\nAnd I can see a lot of\ndifferent information.\n\n405\n00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.370\nAbout our wireless profile.\n\n406\n00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:36.730\nI can even see things\nlike signal strength.\n\n407\n00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.000\nI can see what the profile is.\n\n408\n00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.950\nWell what does a profile mean for me?\n\n409\n00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:40.630\nWell, let's go ahead and\n\n410\n00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:44.280\nshow you a little bit about that because\nagain this might come up on the exempt.\n\n411\n00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.000\nLet's give you a scenario right.\n\n412\n00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.980\nOne of the scenarios might be that\nyou need to configure somebody's\n\n413\n00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.870\nwireless settings on their laptop,\n\n414\n00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.940\nbut you don't want to give them\nthe password to your network.\n\n415\n00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.380\nMaybe you've got a security that says\nthat only the administrators know that.\n\n416\n00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.090\nRight.\nI don't want to write that down,\n\n417\n00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.480\ncertainly don't want to\nemail it to anybody.\n\n418\n00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:06.430\nWell, is there a way that we\ncan have settings imported into\n\n419\n00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:11.790\na machine so that all a person has to\ndo is turn the wireless on, connect.\n\n420\n00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:12.660\nLet's go ahead and see that.\n\n421\n00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.570\nSo, we're going to go ahead and\ntake this profile that you see.\n\n422\n00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.650\nNotice is says profile.\n\n423\n00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:19.430\nIt says ITProTV.\n\n424\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.200\nWe're going to take the IT ProTV\nwireless profile and\n\n425\n00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.970\nwe're going to export it out to a file.\n\n426\n00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.060\nSo, before I do that, let me go ahead and\nagain clear the screen so\n\n427\n00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.870\nit'll make it easier for\nyou guys to see out there.\n\n428\n00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.170\nSo this is going to be your Netsh and\n\n429\n00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.770\nremember it's W land now because\nwe're not working with a firewall.\n\n430\n00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.970\nThis is going to be export Profile.\n\n431\n00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.870\nAnd then we're going to do, name.\n\n432\n00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.660\nYou've got to be careful because\nyou'll see when we turn around and\n\n433\n00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.940\ndo an import,\nit wants filename as the option.\n\n434\n00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.840\nOn the export here it says name, and\n\n435\n00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.530\nthat might be something that\ncatches you on the exam.\n\n436\n00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.990\nAnd you have to name the profile right.\n\n437\n00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.490\nI can't just pick and\nchoose something here.\n\n438\n00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.660\nNow when I export that,\nit's gonna put this at again, and\n\n439\n00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.000\nit's cuz it's an administrative command\nprompt, it's gonna put this down in C: and\n\n440\n00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.300\nwe'll drop down there real quick.\n\n441\n00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.810\nAnd I can see WiFi profile right there.\n\n442\n00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:15.340\nWiFi ITProTV, if I do a DIR,\n\n443\n00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.450\nI could also see this file here\non the command prompt as well.\n\n444\n00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:22.680\nNow let me go ahead and show you\nguys something, I really like this.\n\n445\n00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.330\nAnd I know that's the geek coming out\nof me, but I really do like this.\n\n446\n00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:29.630\nWhat I'm gonna do here, is just so we\nknow, a little bit about what's going on,\n\n447\n00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.510\nso that no tricks,\nno cards up the sleeve here.\n\n448\n00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.400\nI'm gonna go in and\nwhat I'll do is I'm gonna disconnect.\n\n449\n00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.840\nFrom this network now this is gonna\nbring up the new interface and\n\n450\n00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.410\nI would be familiar with this interface.\n\n451\n00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:45.360\nYou see me drop back down to\nlike a control panel that's been\n\n452\n00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.020\naround since Vista.\n\n453\n00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.722\nI would really well control panel's\nbeen around a lot longer than that but\n\n454\n00:23:49.722 --> 00:23:51.084\nI would definitely get used to this.\n\n455\n00:23:51.084 --> 00:23:54.470\nNow I want you to notice something here,\nI'm gonna disconnect But\n\n456\n00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:58.280\nI'm going to go a little bit farther\nthan that, because if I turn around and\n\n457\n00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.294\nconnect, I want you to see something.\n\n458\n00:24:00.294 --> 00:24:01.386\nWhat'd it do?\n\n459\n00:24:01.386 --> 00:24:02.234\nIt didn't do anything.\n\n460\n00:24:02.234 --> 00:24:04.892\nAnd that's certainly not gonna\nbe something that we have to,\n\n461\n00:24:04.892 --> 00:24:08.317\nwe're not gonna get that same experience\nif we're configuring this laptop for\n\n462\n00:24:08.317 --> 00:24:09.530\nthe first time.\n\n463\n00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.430\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto go a little bit farther down here.\n\n464\n00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.570\nAnd down at the bottom here,\nyou'll see manage known networks.\n\n465\n00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.760\nNotice that if I,\nlet me move that up a little bit.\n\n466\n00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.860\nNotice that there's a Forget, right?\n\n467\n00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:23.660\nAnd if I choose Forget,\n\n468\n00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.180\nit does exactly what we've talked about\nin some of our networking series, too.\n\n469\n00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:33.220\nAnd, now when I go to connect to ITProTV's\nnetwork, it's challenging me, right?\n\n470\n00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.860\nJust like it would any\nother wireless network.\n\n471\n00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.400\nNow, it wants you to put\nthe key in there but,\n\n472\n00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.630\nI don't want the user to have the key.\n\n473\n00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.920\nNobody can have the key except for\nAdministrators, right?\n\n474\n00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.630\nSo now we're kinda stuck.\n\n475\n00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:44.940\nSo what do we do?\n\n476\n00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.740\nWell we're gonna drop back\ndown to our command prompt.\n\n477\n00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.810\nAll right, or PowerShell, if you will.\n\n478\n00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:51.540\nAgain, keep in mind,\n\n479\n00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.010\nthis is traditionally,\nNet SH is a native command prompt command.\n\n480\n00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.600\nAnd now what we're gonna do,\nis we're gonna import that\n\n481\n00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.130\nprofile back into the machine, and\nlet's see what the results are there.\n\n482\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:06.040\nLet's see if I would have to give\nthe user, the SSI, or not the SSID,\n\n483\n00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.230\nwell really any of that information,\nor even the, maybe the W2, WPA2 key.\n\n484\n00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.280\nSo we'll go head and do our Net SH.\n\n485\n00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.780\nAnd again, remember,\nit's W land on this one.\n\n486\n00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.860\nAnd we're doing add, Profile.\n\n487\n00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:24.440\nAnd here, pay attention on the exam with\nthis one because it'll trip you up, right?\n\n488\n00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.160\nSo the first time when we exported it out,\nit wanted a name equals.\n\n489\n00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.630\nIn the import, it wants Filename equals.\n\n490\n00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.410\nAnd other than just a slip-up on the exam,\n\n491\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.620\nthat's the only reason I mention it,\nit's not really that big of a deal.\n\n492\n00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:45.370\nBut what is a big deal is if Wes can\nspell itprotv.xml appropriately.\n\n493\n00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.210\nAll right, let me just double\ncheck that before we run this.\n\n494\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:55.360\nAll right, so now notice it says profile\nITProTV has been added on interface Wi-Fi.\n\n495\n00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.180\nWhat do you mean interface Wi-Fi?\n\n496\n00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:04.030\nWell, let's go back to our\nGet-NetConnectionProfiles and\n\n497\n00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:08.240\nnotice that, well wait a second,\nwhere is my Wifi profile?\n\n498\n00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.240\nI don't have one, remember?\n\n499\n00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.270\nIt disconnected.\n\n500\n00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.290\nSo it still knows that there is\na Wifi settings in there and\n\n501\n00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.970\nwatch what happens if I drop back down and\nwe'll\n\n502\n00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.790\ngo to the graphical user interface way so\nyou guys can see the newer interface here.\n\n503\n00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.090\nGo to network and internet.\n\n504\n00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:25.080\nNotice the Wifi, ITProTV is at the top.\n\n505\n00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.400\nWatch what happens when I click it.\n\n506\n00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.650\nAll right, checking network requirements.\n\n507\n00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:30.460\nAnd it connects.\n\n508\n00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.530\nNotice it didn't challenge me this time.\n\n509\n00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:36.160\nSo this is something as an administrator,\nif I needed to export that profile out,\n\n510\n00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.590\nthat file just an xml file,\n\n511\n00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:41.410\nlike a lot of the other configuration\nfiles that we do inside of Windows.\n\n512\n00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.610\nWord of advice, word of caution.\n\n513\n00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:47.232\nDon't start emailing that file around.\n\n514\n00:26:47.232 --> 00:26:49.845\nAll right, Ronny and\nI were just looking at it.\n\n515\n00:26:49.845 --> 00:26:51.790\n[LAUGH] We'll leave it off camera here.\n\n516\n00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:55.040\nIt's got the key inside of that file.\n\n517\n00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:55.990\nSo be careful.\n\n518\n00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:58.550\nThis might something that if you need\nto sneakernet it over to somebody,\n\n519\n00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.890\nmaybe you want to use BitLocker to go and\nencrypt on a USB, right?\n\n520\n00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.350\nYeah, if nothing else, right?\n\n521\n00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.799\nYou're probably,\nif you're in the domain setting,\n\n522\n00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:09.259\nyou might actually end up just using this\nas a script more than anything else,\n\n523\n00:27:09.259 --> 00:27:11.889\nand so this is something else\nyou want to pay attention to.\n\n524\n00:27:11.889 --> 00:27:15.790\nThe advantage of this is, once again,\ninstead of you having to tell everybody\n\n525\n00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:19.808\nwhat the password is, you just go ahead\nand you allow this particular script, or\n\n526\n00:27:19.808 --> 00:27:22.847\nyou go ahead and run the same\ncommand that Wes was showing us.\n\n527\n00:27:22.847 --> 00:27:23.972\nAnd it puts it right on there, and\n\n528\n00:27:23.972 --> 00:27:27.030\nthen they're ready to connect without\nhaving to actually do anything else.\n\n529\n00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.690\nSo there's a lot of different commands\nthat we actually do have to think about\n\n530\n00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:35.080\nwhen we're actually supporting wired\nnetworks and even wireless networks, and\n\n531\n00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.080\nWes is just showing us a few of them.\n\n532\n00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.940\nRemember that when we\nstarted off in this episode,\n\n533\n00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.770\nwe really did take a look at\nthe idea of those profiles.\n\n534\n00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:46.210\nAnd that by default right, when Windows\n10 tries to connect regardless of which\n\n535\n00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:50.030\ndevice it is, it's going to actually\npick one of those profiles.\n\n536\n00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.510\nSometimes you actually just,\nit actually just tells you, hey,\n\n537\n00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.150\nyou're connecting to a wireless network.\n\n538\n00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:55.140\nWhich of these profiles?\n\n539\n00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.280\nAnd you don't think about it and\nyou just pick whatever the default is,\n\n540\n00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.190\nit might actually end up defaulting to\nthat public profile, which means you're\n\n541\n00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.420\nprobably not gonna get access to what\nyou think you're going to get access to.\n\n542\n00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.800\nSo remember that Wes also showed us\nthat command inside of the Power Shell\n\n543\n00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.620\nto allow us to change that very easily.\n\n544\n00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.650\nAlso he showed us where we can get a look\nat what profile that we currently are on,\n\n545\n00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:20.990\nas well as the profiles that are actually\non the computer itself by using net SH\n\n546\n00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.340\nadvanced firewall commands as well.\n\n547\n00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.270\nThen lastly here,\nhe showed us how we can actually export\n\n548\n00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:29.950\nas well as import the actual\nwireless LAN configurations, too.\n\n549\n00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:33.280\nSo it gives us that ability to be\nable to help support the user,\n\n550\n00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.090\nregardless of where we are.\n\n551\n00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.750\nNow Wes, there's a lot more for\n\n552\n00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:40.300\nus to be able to cover as far as\nsome of these different commands,\n\n553\n00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.680\nthat a good support technician\nshould at least be familiar with.\n\n554\n00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.140\nBut I think we actually have\nto pull this into a part two.\n\n555\n00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.150\n>> I know,\nI did kinda talk a lot on this one.\n\n556\n00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:52.330\nI tell you what,\nwe do have just a couple more minutes.\n\n557\n00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:55.040\nSo it doesn't get a little bit\ndisjointed on wireless networks,\n\n558\n00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.200\nI just wanna show you one real quick\nthing in the graphical user interface, so\n\n559\n00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.110\nthat you can see, and we're right\nhere in the wireless interface.\n\n560\n00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.270\nIf you want to manage your WiFi settings,\n\n561\n00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:07.030\nIf you want to manage your WiFi\nnetworks you have it right here.\n\n562\n00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:09.050\nYou can connect to additional networks,\nif you wanted.\n\n563\n00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.630\nWe can see the ones that we\nare currently connected to.\n\n564\n00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:15.490\nIf I wanted to go down and\nmanage the WiFi settings, I can do that.\n\n565\n00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:16.830\nManage known networks here.\n\n566\n00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:20.904\nThe other thing is, I have the advanced\noptions and the advanced options,\n\n567\n00:29:20.904 --> 00:29:24.770\nthis is your graphical user interface\noutput, and notice some of the stuff that\n\n568\n00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.120\nwe've seen in the command prompt,\nI could copy it to a clipboard right here.\n\n569\n00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.400\nNow it doesn't do what we showed you\nwhere it copies the key or anything but\n\n570\n00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.530\nif you needed information like this on\nwhat the current settings were if you're\n\n571\n00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:38.340\nin a support technician type of stance\nyou could just tell the user copy this,\n\n572\n00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.828\nthrow it in a text document,\nemail it out, and I can look at it.\n\n573\n00:29:41.828 --> 00:29:45.198\n>> All right Wes, well that's\na great place for us to also go and\n\n574\n00:29:45.198 --> 00:29:49.577\nend this episode then, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Long.\n\n575\n00:29:49.577 --> 00:29:53.490\n>> And I'm Wes Brian and\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n576\n00:29:53.490 -->

00:00:17.086\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:20.370\ntoday we're taking a look at\nconfiguring Windows devices.\n\n5\n00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.540\nWhat we want to do here is we want to\nspend a bit of time inside of Windows 10,\n\n6\n00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.020\nand who better to help us as we focus\nin on networking, than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.240\nWes, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.660\n>> Thank you for having me back.\n\n9\n00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.858\nIt's always good to be here in the studio.\n\n10\n00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:36.866\nWe're coming back actually with\na part two to Supporting Network.\n\n11\n00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:40.316\nAnd yes, Ronnie let me talk way\ntoo much in the first one, so\n\n12\n00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:43.020\nwe're coming back at you\nwith a part two here.\n\n13\n00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.480\nWhat we're gonna do here is\nwe're gonna drop back down.\n\n14\n00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.980\nWe've at the command prompt, right?\n\n15\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.680\nWe've been looking at\nsome PowerShell commands.\n\n16\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.280\nWell, imagine a situation in\nwhich you connect to a machine\n\n17\n00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.540\ndoing remote administration.\n\n18\n00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.880\nAnd the only thing, maybe, that you have\navailable to you is well, a command line.\n\n19\n00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.020\nWould you be able to configure the network\nadapter if that's all you had?\n\n20\n00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.160\nMore so if you're in an exam situation.\n\n21\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.620\nYou're sitting, hopefully taking\nthe MCSA in Windows 10 and\n\n22\n00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.180\nthey ask you which of these commands or\n\n23\n00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.030\ncommand wits would you configure a network\nadapter, would you be able to do it?\n\n24\n00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.080\nThat is why we're going to show you\nhere because there might be a time where\n\n25\n00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.020\nyou connect to a machine for\nremote administration purposes.\n\n26\n00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.110\nAnd the only thing you\nhave is a command prompt.\n\n27\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.270\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\njump right back in,\n\n28\n00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.270\nI've got my PowerShell open here and\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n29\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.070\nwe're gonna look at some of\nthe network settings that we have.\n\n30\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.935\nSo we're gonna start out by just running\nour traditional IP config, right.\n\n31\n00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:43.285\nLet's just see where we're at right now.\n\n32\n00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:46.605\nSo I've got an ethernet connection and I'm\nnot really gonna manipulate the ethernet\n\n33\n00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:48.645\nconnection too much and I tell you why.\n\n34\n00:01:48.645 --> 00:01:50.322\nI'm remoted into this machine.\n\n35\n00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:54.392\nIf I start messing around too much with\nthat network adaptor, well guess what?\n\n36\n00:01:54.392 --> 00:01:57.977\nI'm gonna disable my session here and\nwe certainly don't want that.\n\n37\n00:01:57.977 --> 00:02:02.416\nSo we're gonna look at this wi-fi\nconnector, or excuse me the wi-fi adaptor.\n\n38\n00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:05.710\nAnd you can see that it's\ngot some IP settings here.\n\n39\n00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.130\nWell, what happens if those IP\nsettings aren't correct and\n\n40\n00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.980\nyou need to change them?\n\n41\n00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.670\nWould you be able to do that?\n\n42\n00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.850\nSo that's kinda what we're gonna look at.\n\n43\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.010\nSo the first thing that we're gonna do is,\nwhat are some of the basic things that you\n\n44\n00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.700\ncan do to turn a network adaptor on or\nto turn a network adaptor off.\n\n45\n00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.640\nWell one of the first\nthings you have to know is,\n\n46\n00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.880\nyou have to know the interface alias.\n\n47\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.876\nRemember the first part of this, we\nshowed you how to do a get-netconnection,\n\n48\n00:02:29.876 --> 00:02:31.560\nprofile right.\n\n49\n00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.210\nI use that because it's\nvery easy to just find out,\n\n50\n00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.010\nwell what is the interface\nname of the one in question.\n\n51\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.880\nThe one that you want to configure and\n\n52\n00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.960\nI can see right interface\nalias is going to be WI-FI.\n\n53\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.270\nWell it's already enabled.\n\n54\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.090\nLet's go and turn it off, right.\n\n55\n00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.290\nSo we're gonna do a disable.\n\n56\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.690\nRemember your PowerShell command\nthat said, verb noun syntax.\n\n57\n00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.900\nWe're gonna do disable net adapter,\nall right and I have to give it a name.\n\n58\n00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.910\nSo the parameter here is name and\n\n59\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.190\nremember we just looked at that interface\nalias, we're gonna disable the wi-fi.\n\n60\n00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.100\nNow when you do this it's gonna ask you,\nare you sure you wanna do that?\n\n61\n00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.370\nAll right, you can say yes,\nyou can say A for Yes to All.\n\n62\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.020\nAnd Ronnie, I'm gonna live dangerously\nhere and I'm just gonna say A for\n\n63\n00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.210\nYes to All so we don't get a series\nof questions over and over and over.\n\n64\n00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.900\nNow, does that actually\ndisable the network adapter?\n\n65\n00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.230\nWell, we can always, if you want,\n\n66\n00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.590\nwe can drop down to our graphical\nuser interface and we can look, and\n\n67\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.390\nwe can see right here, good all Atheros\nwireless network adaptor is now disabled.\n\n68\n00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.170\nWell, it's easy enough.\n\n69\n00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.140\nWhat if you want to enable it?\n\n70\n00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.010\nWell, we can do that, too.\n\n71\n00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.500\nAnd the good thing about this is,\nthe syntax is fairly easy to understand.\n\n72\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.860\nAll I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna change that Disable to Enable.\n\n73\n00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.760\nAnd it takes a second here, and\nit's gonna do the same thing.\n\n74\n00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.820\nIt doesn't look like it did much, right?\n\n75\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.230\nSo let's go ahead and find out.\n\n76\n00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.960\nAre we back up?\n\n77\n00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.050\nAnd this time, I'll go ahead and just kind\nof stay inside of the command prompt.\n\n78\n00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.560\nNow, you notice that I have Wi-Fi, right?\n\n79\n00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.230\nMedia is disconnected.\n\n80\n00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.440\nWhy isn't this connected?\n\n81\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.430\nWell I disabled the network adaptor.\n\n82\n00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.753\nI haven't told it to connect\nback to the wi-fi network.\n\n83\n00:04:10.753 --> 00:04:14.330\nSo just enabling the network adaptor\nisn't the only thing you have to do.\n\n84\n00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.190\nYou'd still have to go in here,\n\n85\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.800\nwe'd have to right click on the wi-fi\nnetwork adaptor, we choose connect.\n\n86\n00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.820\nKeep in mind it's gonna bump you over to\nthe newer interface and since the profile\n\n87\n00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.120\nfrom the first part of this episode,\nremember the profile is stored?\n\n88\n00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.250\nI don't have to reauthenticate,\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n89\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.240\nSo fairly easy.\n\n90\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.390\nNot to difficult to enabling and\n\n91\n00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.280\ndisabling a network adapter,\nthrough the command prompt.\n\n92\n00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.150\nBut what if we wanna go\na little bit farther than that?\n\n93\n00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.760\nWhat if we want to actually\nset the IP address?\n\n94\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.970\nNotice when I run my IP config command,\nright?\n\n95\n00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.550\nMaybe I determined that these,\nthese IP, or TCP/IP properties,\n\n96\n00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.370\nparameters, aren't what I want.\n\n97\n00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.060\nMaybe I want to define them.\n\n98\n00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.930\nAll right, well,\nif we go a little bit farther than that,\n\n99\n00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.880\nwe run our IP config /all, and I'm gonna\nactually pipe this out to the more option.\n\n100\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.970\nI've got so many of these IPv6 adapters,\n\n101\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.500\nit's kind of hard to\nsee which one you want.\n\n102\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.820\nAll right, and if I get in here and we'll\nscroll through these a little bit here.\n\n103\n00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.902\nThere's my wi-fi adaptor.\n\n104\n00:05:14.902 --> 00:05:18.680\nNotice that I do see that it's set up for\nDHCP.\n\n105\n00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.440\nWell what if I want to\nstatically configure that?\n\n106\n00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.110\nIf you were given a scenario\nwhere you have to connect\n\n107\n00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.600\nthrough things like remote administration,\nwould you be able to do that?\n\n108\n00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.590\nWould you be able to reconfigure it?\n\n109\n00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.450\nSo one of the first things that we're\ngoing to do is we're gonna disable DHCP.\n\n110\n00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.650\nI'm going to hit my space button.\n\n111\n00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.900\nWe'll go ahead and clear the screen.\n\n112\n00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.310\nNow what I'm gonna is, instead of\nhaving to call on this network adapter\n\n113\n00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.000\nevery single time, I'm gonna kinda\ngo off the beaten path here and\n\n114\n00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.500\nI'm gonna wrap it up in a variable.\n\n115\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.640\nSo what I'm gonna do is just\na dollar sign for our variable.\n\n116\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.820\nAnd I'm going to call this net adapter,\nand\n\n117\n00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.470\nthis just makes it easier because then\nI don't have to call that every time.\n\n118\n00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.716\nBut what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto pipe this out to the get net\n\n119\n00:06:02.716 --> 00:06:07.390\nadapter, and we have to give it a name.\n\n120\n00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.716\nAll right, so the name that I'm giving it,\nit's that wi-fi, remember?\n\n121\n00:06:12.344 --> 00:06:16.940\nAll right, and\nlet me try that one more time.\n\n122\n00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.975\nApparently I didn't have\nthat interface right.\n\n123\n00:06:18.975 --> 00:06:26.230\nGet-NetAdapter, all right so right away a\nbunch of red means I didn't type it right.\n\n124\n00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.768\nRonnie pointed out I was piping this out.\n\n125\n00:06:27.768 --> 00:06:31.589\nThis is actually an equal sign cuz we're\ntelling it what the variable means.\n\n126\n00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:36.340\nNow anytime I want to use\nthat Get-NetAdapter cmdlet,\n\n127\n00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.380\nI don't have to call on it anymore.\n\n128\n00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.820\nI can just do the variable.\n\n129\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.210\nAnd what's really cool about PowerShell\nis it auto fills your variables too.\n\n130\n00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.790\nSo now what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna set the interface, all right?\n\n131\n00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.440\nSo I'm calling on my variable.\n\n132\n00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.200\nI'm gonna pipe it out this\ntime to the Set-NetIP and\n\n133\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.600\nI believe it's interface space and\nthere's the parameter for DHCP.\n\n134\n00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.270\nAll right, so\nhere's where DHCP comes into play for us.\n\n135\n00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.990\nAnd then I'm gonna choose disable.\n\n136\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.170\nAgain what if you're setting it to DHCP?\n\n137\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.940\nIt'd just be enabled, all right?\n\n138\n00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.289\nBut we're actually gonna\ndo a disable here.\n\n139\n00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.530\nAnd we're gonna run it.\n\n140\n00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.510\nNow, wasn't that absolutely amazing?\n\n141\n00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.280\nI don't know, did it do what we wanted?\n\n142\n00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.090\nLet's drop back an ipconfig and\nwe'll double check that real quick.\n\n143\n00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.960\nWe're gonna do ipconfig word slash all,\n\n144\n00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.830\nagain pipe that out some more so\nit's easier to see.\n\n145\n00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:39.630\nAnd we get down here and\nwe should see DHCP is not longer enabled.\n\n146\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.550\nAll right, now there is\nsomething to keep in mind when,\n\n147\n00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:49.170\nif you use this, because of the fact\nthat you had an APIPA address, right?\n\n148\n00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.200\nBut notice something.\n\n149\n00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.260\nYou still have a default gateway.\n\n150\n00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.800\nAll right, so just be careful with that.\n\n151\n00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.719\nYou're gonna have to define\nall of these settings.\n\n152\n00:07:55.719 --> 00:08:02.363\nJust turning DHCP off isn't enough, and\nthat's where we set our static addresses.\n\n153\n00:08:02.363 --> 00:08:06.990\nSo we're not done yet, and we're gonna\ndefine all of these other options here.\n\n154\n00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.202\nNow, when we do this again,\nI'm just calling on that variable again,\n\n155\n00:08:10.202 --> 00:08:12.890\nand I'm going to pipe this out\nnow to something different.\n\n156\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:21.133\nI'm going to pipe this out to\nthe new-ipaddress, netipaddress.\n\n157\n00:08:24.813 --> 00:08:30.920\nYou've got to type it right,\nnew-netip, there we go, and address.\n\n158\n00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:37.190\nAnd we got to tell it, are we modifying\nthe IPv4 interface or the IPv6 interface?\n\n159\n00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.310\nSo there's an option that says,\naddress family, and\n\n160\n00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.660\nthen after that I'm gonna type IP and\nyou'll see that I've got the option.\n\n161\n00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.180\nIf I tab through I get IPv4, IPv6,\nin this case we're just looking at IPv4,\n\n162\n00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.610\nall right, then once that's done,\nI'm gonna tell it what the IP address is.\n\n163\n00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:00.562\nAnd for us, let's see Ronnie,\nlet's say 10.0.1.100, all right?\n\n164\n00:09:00.562 --> 00:09:04.540\nNow, we need a subnet mask.\n\n165\n00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.110\nIt doesn't say subnet mask.\n\n166\n00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.560\nIf you can remember some of the other\nnetworking shows that we have,\n\n167\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.720\ngo back and check.\n\n168\n00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.180\nThe amount, we need a prefix length.\n\n169\n00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.820\nAnd that's what this is\ncalled when we set that.\n\n170\n00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.260\nRemember, we're just worried about\nthe bits in the subnet mask.\n\n171\n00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.860\nSo, we're gonna do dash,\nwe're gonna do prefix length.\n\n172\n00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.899\nAnd for me,\nit's gonna be a 24-bit subnet mask.\n\n173\n00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.770\nNow, this is really cool too,\n\n174\n00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.710\ncuz you gotta tell it that it's a Unicast\naddress, which is kind of interesting.\n\n175\n00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:36.049\nSo, the next thing is, we are going to\ndo a type, and then it's a Unicast.\n\n176\n00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.350\nAnd then, at the end of it,\nI'm gonna run the default gateway.\n\n177\n00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.220\nWe need to communicate.\n\n178\n00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.040\nSo, this is where those settings will\nchange, even though, we disabled DHCP and\n\n179\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.987\nyou see that default gateway\nwas still there but I do a 1-1.\n\n180\n00:09:49.987 --> 00:09:52.570\nNow, one of the good things\nabout this command is,\n\n181\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.630\nit actually outputs what you've just done.\n\n182\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.170\nYou've seen some of\nthe commands that Ronnie and\n\n183\n00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.620\nI have been looking at here, right.\n\n184\n00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.130\nAnd you hit the command, or\nthe commandlet, you hit enter,\n\n185\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.280\nand it doesn't show you anything.\n\n186\n00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.000\nThen, you have to go back and\nrun IP config.\n\n187\n00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.285\nWhatever, like we've been doing.\n\n188\n00:10:05.285 --> 00:10:07.690\nGet-net connection profile.\n\n189\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.130\nWell, the good thing is,\nit shows you right here.\n\n190\n00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.340\nIt shows you your prefix link,\nit shows you your IP address.\n\n191\n00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.630\nRemember, InterfaceIndex versus alias,\njust identifying it.\n\n192\n00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.860\nIt lets us know that it's infinite,\nright, so it's a static setup.\n\n193\n00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.720\nNow, at this point, we have our IP address\nset up, and we should be ready to go.\n\n194\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.510\nNow Wes, before we move any further,\n\n195\n00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.398\nas we take a look at that command\nright at the top of your screen there.\n\n196\n00:10:30.398 --> 00:10:32.326\n>> Sure.\n>> Lets kind of review that cuz\n\n197\n00:10:32.326 --> 00:10:34.252\nthat was a lot of information.\n\n198\n00:10:34.252 --> 00:10:34.894\n>> It is.\n>> So,\n\n199\n00:10:34.894 --> 00:10:36.100\nlets make sure we understand\n>> Yep.\n\n200\n00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.990\n>> Here, the variable that we created that\nsent you just a shortcut or alias for\n\n201\n00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.650\nus and the only thing that Wes put behind\nthat is that he was calling upon that\n\n202\n00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.110\ninterface, what did you call it?\n\n203\n00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.720\nEthernet 2?\n\n204\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.381\n>> Yup.\n>> Yeah, so he actually,\n\n205\n00:10:47.381 --> 00:10:51.180\nhe was just saying on Ethernet 2,\nhere is what we're gonna set up.\n\n206\n00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.240\nEverything that was piped after that.\n\n207\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.410\nSo, what that should do is attach all\nthe extra information that Wes has\n\n208\n00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.790\ntyped in there to that\none Ethernet 2 location.\n\n209\n00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.960\nThat's actually kind of key for\nus because if we don't, and\n\n210\n00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.890\nit actually pipes into another interface,\nthen we're actually gonna be in trouble.\n\n211\n00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:13.250\nSo, sometimes, what you actually will get,\nright, is not only the need to be able to\n\n212\n00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.120\nknow how to do this, but it's verifying\nthat this is the right information.\n\n213\n00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.050\nEspecially, when you go on to the exam and\nyou might find out that they might say\n\n214\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:27.350\nwhat do the following actually does\nput this IP address on this interface.\n\n215\n00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.900\nWhich of the following is\n\n216\n00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:35.120\nthis command actually going to\nbe put on to or what interface.\n\n217\n00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.320\nSo, in other words, it is enough that\nyou actually know what's going on,\n\n218\n00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.140\nbut only if you understand\nwhat the command actually did.\n\n219\n00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.590\nSo, that's why I wanted to emphasize that.\n\n220\n00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:48.240\nCuz it's very easy just to get caught\nup in knowing what the specific is, but\n\n221\n00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.710\nif you don't actually know what it did,\nit's not gonna help you out here.\n\n222\n00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.260\nSo, you need to make sure that you go\nback, and you pay attention to this and\n\n223\n00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.250\neven try some of these commands yourself.\n\n224\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.110\nThe way that Wes did is he just put\nanother interface on his machine\n\n225\n00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.200\nto be able to try this out.\n\n226\n00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.860\nBut it's something that you should\nactually consider as well because\n\n227\n00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.900\njust seeing it may not be enough.\n\n228\n00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.490\nActually, putting it to actual use and\n\n229\n00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.330\nseeing what happens might actually\nbe the better route to go.\n\n230\n00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.360\n>> Most definitely.\n\n231\n00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.555\nAnd one of the important things\nthat we can check that command,\n\n232\n00:12:16.555 --> 00:12:19.389\nthat big crazy long commandlet out,\nthe last portion,\n\n233\n00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:22.240\nthis is really what you're\ngonna be seeing on the exam.\n\n234\n00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.620\nThat new net IP address.\n\n235\n00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.440\nHow do we set up that static address?\n\n236\n00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.390\nSo, definitely,\npay attention to that last portion here.\n\n237\n00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.050\nNow, we've set the IP address, right?\n\n238\n00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.190\nWe said that this is an IPv4 address,\nwe've said what the address is.\n\n239\n00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.430\nWe said that it's a 24-bit subnet mask,\nit's a Unicast,\n\n240\n00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.300\nand what the default gateway is.\n\n241\n00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.770\nNow, that's got my IP addresses set up,\nright?\n\n242\n00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.489\nHopefully, I can communicate\nwith the network.\n\n243\n00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.590\nBut what did it do to DNS, right?\n\n244\n00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:53.870\nLet's go ahead real quick and re-run\nthat trusty oldie but goodie, ipconfig.\n\n245\n00:12:55.050 --> 00:13:01.460\nAnd let's see if it did anything to the,\noops, let me try that again there.\n\n246\n00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.410\nIf it did anything to DNS for us.\n\n247\n00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.200\nAll right.\n\n248\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.770\nAnd we'll kind of scroll through here,\nthrough these options.\n\n249\n00:13:12.028 --> 00:13:14.160\nAnd my DNS server.\n\n250\n00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.590\nI didn't se that DNS server.\n\n251\n00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.430\nSo, where'd it come from?\n\n252\n00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.370\nIt's leftover from when I disabled DHCP,\nand that's why it's important.\n\n253\n00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:26.090\nSo, the next thing we have to do,\nhow can we set our DNS servers?,\n\n254\n00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:31.050\nnow, be careful with this one, I'm not\ngonna be, on this one it's just a straight\n\n255\n00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.770\ncommandlet, there is no piping\nthat is supports there,\n\n256\n00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:38.940\nso all we're gonna do was we're gonna\ndo is set DNS client server address.\n\n257\n00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:46.290\nAnd one more there.\n\n258\n00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.920\nApparently, there's a lot of them there.\n\n259\n00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.830\nAnd again you have the option,\nyou can do the interface\n\n260\n00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.640\nindex or we do interface alias.\n\n261\n00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.150\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n262\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.179\nstick with alias because I can remember\nit's WiFi that we are setting here.\n\n263\n00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.724\nAll right, and then the next thing that\nwe're gonna do, is we're gonna say, well,\n\n264\n00:14:05.724 --> 00:14:06.570\nserver addresses.\n\n265\n00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.930\nAnd then for me, I'm just gonna\nput a single server address here,\n\n266\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.580\nbecause honestly, on this one,\nit's not gonna be connecting outbound.\n\n267\n00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.980\nServer addresses, and I'm gonna say,\n\n268\n00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.480\nokay, I want the,\nmaybe we got an internal DNS server.\n\n269\n00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.550\nSo, I'm gonna say 10.1,\nmake sure I do that right.\n\n270\n00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:27.009\nHow about 10.0 so\nwe're on the same network, .1 and\n\n271\n00:14:27.009 --> 00:14:30.560\nwe'll say, be the 150 for the DNS server.\n\n272\n00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.000\nNow, these settings, these parameters are\ngonna change according to your network.\n\n273\n00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.560\nSo, pay attention to\nthe scenario that you're in and\n\n274\n00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.350\nmake sure that you\ntailor-make the question,\n\n275\n00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:44.230\nright, that they ask you to whatever\nthe situation they put you in front of.\n\n276\n00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:49.850\nSo, if we rerun our ipconfig\nspace forward slash all command,\n\n277\n00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:56.130\nand let's see now, if we've got\nan administratively defined DNS server.\n\n278\n00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.605\nAnd right there we have, we got our DNS\nserver, so we showed you how to enable or\n\n279\n00:15:04.605 --> 00:15:09.340\ndisable DHCP, if you're gonna do a static\nassignment, you gotta disable DHCP first.\n\n280\n00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.790\nKeep in mind, it leaves some of\nthe remnants of those settings,\n\n281\n00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.075\neven if you've got that tricky\nAPIPA address in there.\n\n282\n00:15:14.075 --> 00:15:18.825\nThen,we showed you how to reconfigure\nthe network adapter as well as finally\n\n283\n00:15:18.825 --> 00:15:20.965\nput those DNS server addresses in there.\n\n284\n00:15:20.965 --> 00:15:23.760\nAnd remember, we're gonna need some\nkinda name resolution as well.\n\n285\n00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.870\nSo, that is pretty much how you're\ngonna configure a network adapter,\n\n286\n00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.640\nif you have to do it inside a PowerShell.\n\n287\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.320\n>> So, the PowerShell command list that\nWes talked, really are very helpful,\n\n288\n00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.010\nif we do need to do this\ntype of configuration.\n\n289\n00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.150\nA lot of times, you might actually\nbe doing this just to help you to do\n\n290\n00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.000\nsome trouble shooting on the network,\nmost devices that we tend to bring on our\n\n291\n00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.340\nnetwork, especially,\nwhen we're talking about mobile devices.\n\n292\n00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.990\nWe're probably not gonna configure them\nwith static IP addresses to often.\n\n293\n00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.250\nBut it is a great way,\n\n294\n00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:57.720\nat least, to begin to actually do some\ntroubleshooting, set what your address is.\n\n295\n00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.224\nAnd that way,\n\n296\n00:15:58.224 --> 00:16:00.748\nyou actually know that everything is\nconfigured the way that you want.\n\n297\n00:16:00.748 --> 00:16:03.799\nAnd that way you can actually start\nyour troubleshooting based from there.\n\n298\n00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:06.031\nYou do wanna take a look\nat these commands,\n\n299\n00:16:06.031 --> 00:16:10.185\nbecause it is actually one of those things\nthat They expect somebody supporting\n\n300\n00:16:10.185 --> 00:16:14.215\nWindows devices needs to at least be\nable to know what's going on, because if\n\n301\n00:16:14.215 --> 00:16:18.245\nyou find this type of command in a script,\njust like what Wes was showing you,\n\n302\n00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:21.850\nyou need to understand what was\nactually done in this script.\n\n303\n00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:25.610\nSo, it's very important that you\nunderstand what is happening there, too.\n\n304\n00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.420\nNow, Wes, what else do we\nactually need to take a look at?\n\n305\n00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.000\n>> We've kinda flip flopped back and\nforth, right, between PowerShell, and\n\n306\n00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.220\nthen we've kinda dropped back and I say\ndrop back command prompt as we're doing it\n\n307\n00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.120\nall in the same interface, but we've used\nsome traditional, the Netsh command.\n\n308\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.250\nWell, can you set an address\nthrough the Netsh command?\n\n309\n00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.500\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n310\n00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.260\nLet's go ahead and show you that\none real quick again, just so\n\n311\n00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.310\nif it comes up on the exam,\nyou're going to be prepared.\n\n312\n00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.610\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and\nclear my screen.\n\n313\n00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.290\nAll right, now, I'm going to modify\nthe address just a little bit here, but\n\n314\n00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.010\nwe're going to do a Netsh.\n\n315\n00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:58.570\nNow, this one,\nyou have to say interface and\n\n316\n00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:02.840\nthe next option, I have to tell you, you\ncould see a couple of things on the exam.\n\n317\n00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:08.590\nI can type IP just like I typed and it'll\ndefault IPv4, all right, it is just way\n\n318\n00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:14.428\ndefaults or I could specifically say IPv4,\njust know that you if leave the IPv4 off.\n\n319\n00:17:14.428 --> 00:17:18.600\nThat's what you'll be configuring because\nyou can also configure IPv6 with that, and\n\n320\n00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.940\nthat would be much different, right,\n\n321\n00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.110\nyou'll just be adding\na six to the end of IPv.\n\n322\n00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:24.700\nSo, we can do that, now,\nwhat we're gonna do?\n\n323\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.610\nSo, we're saying Netsh.\n\n324\n00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:28.450\nThe interface is IPv4.\n\n325\n00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:32.770\nAnd, what we're going do is we're going\nto tell it, what are you doing with IPv4?\n\n326\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.300\nAll right, you've told me that, that's\nwhere we're working, what are you doing?\n\n327\n00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.470\nWell, now, we're going to do a set,\nspace, address.\n\n328\n00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.740\nAll right, so we're saying,\nwe're setting the address.\n\n329\n00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.340\nBut now, I have to name the interface.\n\n330\n00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.800\nAnd if you've been\nfollowing along with us,\n\n331\n00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.590\nyou know that the name of the interface\nthat we've been looking at\n\n332\n00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:53.250\nis none other than our trusty\nWiFi network interface.\n\n333\n00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.400\nNow, once I have said what the name is,\nnow,\n\n334\n00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.920\nthe next option is gonna\nbe a source equals.\n\n335\n00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.630\nSo, what does the source equals mean for\nus?\n\n336\n00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.820\nWell, where is the source of\nthe IP address coming from?\n\n337\n00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:11.210\nIf I wanted to turn this into a just DHCP,\nI can just do a source equals,\n\n338\n00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:16.180\nmaybe if I could spell out DHCP, and now,\n\n339\n00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.990\nI am setup for\ndynamically assigned address.\n\n340\n00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.510\nBut that would be a little bit too easy.\n\n341\n00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.970\nWe are not going to be\nthat easy on this one.\n\n342\n00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.480\nSo, we are going to say source\nequals static, we're telling it\n\n343\n00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.850\nthat we're gonna define it, and then after\nthat we're gonna put the IP address.\n\n344\n00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.740\nSo, I put ten, I tell you what,\nwe're gonna change\n\n345\n00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.840\nit up cause I've already got that\none there, so 10.10.10.100, right?\n\n346\n00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.410\nEasy for Wes to type.\n\n347\n00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.480\nNow, there's a couple of other things\nthat you can do here too, right?\n\n348\n00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:48.180\nYou can type just\nthe dotted decimal notation\n\n349\n00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.920\nof your subnet mask followed by the dotted\ndecimal notation of your default gateway.\n\n350\n00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.170\nHowever, that might not be the way\nthat they ask you on the exam.\n\n351\n00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.370\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n352\n00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.270\nSo, I said static, and\nthen what the IP address is?\n\n353\n00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.312\nNow, what I'm gonna do is mask equals, and\n\n354\n00:19:04.312 --> 00:19:08.919\nthen I'm gonna say 255 255.255.0.\n\n355\n00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:12.210\nYou don't have to put\nthe mass= if you space it out.\n\n356\n00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:15.780\nBut just so you know that both of them,\nwhichever of them you see on the exam.\n\n357\n00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:21.820\nThe next thing that I do is a gateway=,\nand then whatever the gateway is.\n\n358\n00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.697\nIn this case, we'll do 10.10.10.1.\n\n359\n00:19:24.697 --> 00:19:30.400\nAnd when I run this, it doesn't really\n[LAUGH] look like it did much, right?\n\n360\n00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:36.140\nWe don't get the benefit that we did\nwhen we did the new-ip interface, right?\n\n361\n00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:40.380\nMoment we set it outputs and\nsays, okay, here's what you got.\n\n362\n00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:46.120\nSo, we have to go back\nto our ipconfig /all and\n\n363\n00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.960\nI'll type again, I'll type out\nthe more just to make it a little bit\n\n364\n00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.890\neasier to look at what\nwe're trying to identify.\n\n365\n00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.300\nAll righta now, notice what we did.\n\n366\n00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.870\nI said no, this is not going to be.\n\n367\n00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.820\nSo, as it relates to that command,\n\n368\n00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.950\nright, no, it's not gonna be DHCP,\nsource equals static.\n\n369\n00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.980\nI'm statically assigning the IP address.\n\n370\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:06.860\nAll right.\n\n371\n00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.570\nI said,\nI want the IP Address to be 10.10.10.100.\n\n372\n00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:14.842\nI said, Mask, in this case, for\nus that's your Subnet Mask,\n\n373\n00:20:14.842 --> 00:20:19.122\nI said Mask equals 255.255.255.0.\n\n374\n00:20:19.122 --> 00:20:24.574\nThen, Gateway equals, in this case, it's\nour Default Gateway, right, 10.10.10.1.\n\n375\n00:20:24.574 --> 00:20:26.803\nAll right, and\nthen when you run that command,\n\n376\n00:20:26.803 --> 00:20:28.990\nit sets the interface appropriately for\nyou.\n\n377\n00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.690\nSo, you can do this\ninside of the Powershell.\n\n378\n00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:35.870\nYou can also do this inside of the Netsh\ncommand, so just recognize the commands.\n\n379\n00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.950\nIt's kind of like Ronnie mentioned,\nrecognize the command.\n\n380\n00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:42.490\nThat is going to be a necessity for\nthe exam.\n\n381\n00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.910\nAs you maybe move and\nadvance into other training.\n\n382\n00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.530\nMaybe you decide to be\na sever administrator.\n\n383\n00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.670\nYou might get into a situation\nwhere you have a server core, and\n\n384\n00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.310\nall you have is the command prompt.\n\n385\n00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.326\nBut for the MCSA and Windows 10.\n\n386\n00:20:54.326 --> 00:20:59.120\nI would recognize the command and I would\nrecognize some of it's parameters, so\n\n387\n00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.080\nyou can be very proficient in\nanswering those questions.\n\n388\n00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.100\nAnd more importantly,\ngetting those questions right.\n\n389\n00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.250\n>> Now Wes, we know that network\nconnectivity is a big thing for\n\n390\n00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.060\nus, especially on different\ndevices that we'll be supporting.\n\n391\n00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.200\nSo, getting access to those commands, and\n\n392\n00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.630\nunderstanding at least what\nwe're actually gonna see, and\n\n393\n00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:20.510\nwhat can be configured through the command\nprompt's actually gonna be very helpful.\n\n394\n00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.000\nBut, we also need to think about\nthe areas of security as well.\n\n395\n00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.090\nAnd one of the big area of security that\nwe tend to have on the individual Windows\n\n396\n00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:32.310\n10 client machines is gonna be\nthe Windows wall with advance security.\n\n397\n00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.300\nWell Wes,\nwhat do we need to learn about this?\n\n398\n00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.510\n>> Well Ronnie, that's a good question.\n\n399\n00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:38.520\nI tell you,\nwhen it comes to modifying the firewall,\n\n400\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.350\nit's not always as easy as we would like\nit to be inside of the command prompt.\n\n401\n00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.610\nSo, let's go ahead and show you how\nyou can make some manipulations.\n\n402\n00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:49.230\nYou can identify firewall rules\ninside of our command prompt.\n\n403\n00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.940\nSo, got the command prompt up here,\nand we're going to start out by Netsh.\n\n404\n00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.310\nAnd, this is going to be, adbfirewall.\n\n405\n00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.220\nAnd here's where, I tell you,\nI always make the mistake.\n\n406\n00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.950\nYou've got to turn around,\nand type firewall again.\n\n407\n00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.300\nJust in case, it didn't know that\nyou were looking at the firewall.\n\n408\n00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.930\nNow, what we're gonna go ahead and\ndo here is,\n\n409\n00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.380\nwe're gonna show the rules\nthat are active.\n\n410\n00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:13.390\nI might have a rule, that for some reason,\nmaybe I think that it's misconfigured.\n\n411\n00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.680\nI've been maybe trying to connect via RDP.\n\n412\n00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.640\nAnd I want to find out, well.\n\n413\n00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.040\nIs it set appropriately?\n\n414\n00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.710\nSo, let's show you how we can do that.\n\n415\n00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.810\nNow, Ronny I need you to pay attention,\nif you will,\n\n416\n00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:29.310\nto the rule that is gonna\npop up here in a second.\n\n417\n00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.840\nAnd let me make sure I put the show rule\nhere, and I need you to catch this one.\n\n418\n00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:41.080\nAll right, so you can see where this\ndoes you absolutely no good, right?\n\n419\n00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:41.950\nThat doesn't help me.\n\n420\n00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:42.690\nWhat is it doing?\n\n421\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.410\nWhen you do a show rule like\nthis it just literally took\n\n422\n00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:50.490\nevery single rule that's in the advanced\nfirewall and outputted it on the screen.\n\n423\n00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:55.260\nSo, if I know what the rule\nis I don't have to name all,\n\n424\n00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.350\nI can come back in here and I'll tell you\nwhat let's clear the screen here, and\n\n425\n00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:02.130\nget this up towards the top make it easier\nto see, I don't have to run it like this,\n\n426\n00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:07.020\nwhat I can do is to specific name,\nmaybe the rule that's in question, for me,\n\n427\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.140\nit's going to be a rule that I know\nthat's been created called allow rdp.\n\n428\n00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:15.110\nSo, it does help to have the name\nof the rule that's in question,\n\n429\n00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.290\neven if it's a default rule.\n\n430\n00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:20.070\nThere's a lot of default\nrules inside of Windows,\n\n431\n00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.330\nso just do your research on\nthe one you're looking for.\n\n432\n00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.810\nNow, I can see that this rule is enabled,\nright?\n\n433\n00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.790\nI can see that this direction is inbound,\nall right?\n\n434\n00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.440\nWhen it comes to the profiles,\nwell, which one does it apply to?\n\n435\n00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.860\nI can see that it applies to\nevery single profile, all right?\n\n436\n00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.070\nIs it a local IP address?\n\n437\n00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.370\nIs it a remote IP address?\n\n438\n00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:38.840\nWell, I can see any.\n\n439\n00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.960\nI can see the protocol that's\nassociated with it, all right?\n\n440\n00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.920\nI can see the local port,\nbut here's a problem.\n\n441\n00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:50.000\nThe local port for RDP is not 3387.\n\n442\n00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.688\nRonnie, you know what it is?\n\n443\n00:23:52.688 --> 00:23:54.493\n>> 3389 is-\n>> 3389, so\n\n444\n00:23:54.493 --> 00:23:58.620\nI've got a problem here with\nthis that I'm not gonna connect.\n\n445\n00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.338\nYeah, I've made the rule.\n\n446\n00:23:59.338 --> 00:24:01.718\nThe rule is there, but\nthe rule is misconfigured.\n\n447\n00:24:01.718 --> 00:24:05.612\nSo, let's show you how you can\nmake a modification to that.\n\n448\n00:24:05.612 --> 00:24:07.802\nNow, what we're gonna go ahead and\n\n449\n00:24:07.802 --> 00:24:11.680\ndo first is we're actually going\nto delete a rule, all right.\n\n450\n00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.390\nSo I need to get this one out of here.\n\n451\n00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.950\nIt's not gonna help me out.\n\n452\n00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.590\nSo what I'm gonna do here is\nI'll rerun that Netsh command.\n\n453\n00:24:21.108 --> 00:24:22.950\nAll right, and, again, adv firewall.\n\n454\n00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.280\nMake sure to put\nthe firewall on there again.\n\n455\n00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:35.380\nAll right, and\nwe are going to do a delete rule.\n\n456\n00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:40.660\nAnd I have to name the rule so I'm gonna\ndo name equals, and it's in parenthesis\n\n457\n00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:46.850\nbecause unfortunately I put a space in\nthe name, remember your are not quotes.\n\n458\n00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.260\nAll right, now notice what it did,\nit said okay, well, the rules deleted.\n\n459\n00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:55.730\nAll right it's gone, but now what will\nI do when I have to configure it again.\n\n460\n00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.150\nThat's where we'll have to,\nwe'll have to get back in here, and\n\n461\n00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.250\nwe'll run our Netsh command.\n\n462\n00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:04.500\nSo what we're gonna do, and on the test,\nwhat I think is very important,\n\n463\n00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.410\nis that you don't have to know\nthe individual specifics,\n\n464\n00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:12.250\nbut just being able to recognize,\nwhat are the options that\n\n465\n00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:16.250\nallow you to configure the firewall,\ninside .Netsh.\n\n466\n00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.550\nSo let's go ahead and do this.\n\n467\n00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.680\nLet's configure this.\n\n468\n00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.130\nWe'll do firewall, again,\nnothing like a door in front of a door.\n\n469\n00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.210\nAnd we're gonna do this time\nwe;re gonna do add rule,\n\n470\n00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:32.810\nname equals, and I'm gonna call it\nsame thing as I did before, allow rdp.\n\n471\n00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.520\nAnd we'll close it off.\n\n472\n00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.930\nNow, we're gonna do the DIR, right?\n\n473\n00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:36.750\nThat means direction.\n\n474\n00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.120\nThat's an inbound and an outbound.\n\n475\n00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.780\nWell, people are gonna be\nconnecting to this machine.\n\n476\n00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.200\nSo I want it to be an inbound rule.\n\n477\n00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.030\nSo I'm gonna do DIR equals,\nDIR equals in, all right.\n\n478\n00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.660\nAnd then we're gonna do action.\n\n479\n00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.060\nNow, the action is allow or deny.\n\n480\n00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.080\nIn this case, I want to allow the action.\n\n481\n00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.020\nAnd I'm gonna choose protocol.\n\n482\n00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.120\nSo, the other option is gonna\nbe protocol equals, and\n\n483\n00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.050\nfor us it's gonna be\ntransmission control protocol.\n\n484\n00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.800\nAnd then I have to assign\nit the local port, and\n\n485\n00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.170\nthat's what was messed up before, right?\n\n486\n00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.310\nWe had a local port, but\nwe didn't have the right local port.\n\n487\n00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.410\nSo, we're gonna take Ronnie's advise here.\n\n488\n00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.380\nWe're gonna put 3389, the traditional\nRDP protocol, and we're gonna hit enter.\n\n489\n00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.360\nNow notice that it said okay, all right.\n\n490\n00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.290\nSo, something's configured.\n\n491\n00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.150\nI don't know if it's\nconfigured appropriately.\n\n492\n00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:24.170\nSo, all I have to do is rerun the command\nthat we just seen there again.\n\n493\n00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.080\nNot delete rule, we want to show.\n\n494\n00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:31.230\nIf I run this now, I can see that yes,\nit's enabled, it's inbound, right.\n\n495\n00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.520\nAnd, make it a little easier for\nyou guys to see there.\n\n496\n00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.590\nAll right,\nnotice that it is enabled, right?\n\n497\n00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.680\nIt's inbound, it's all the profiles,\ndomain, public and\n\n498\n00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.890\nprivate, so it doesn't matter\nwhat network I'm connected to.\n\n499\n00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.670\nI can see what are the IP addresses\nassociated with this rule,\n\n500\n00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.540\nlocal, remote IPs, I'm seeing everybody.\n\n501\n00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.740\nNow we can see that it's\ntransmission control protocol.\n\n502\n00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.490\nI've got the port available.\n\n503\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.580\nNow it's hopefully the right port.\n\n504\n00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.400\nI've configured the rule appropriately,\nand\n\n505\n00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.410\nwe should be allowed to let RDP connect.\n\n506\n00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:08.870\nSo, as a real quick recap, you don't have\nto know every single individual parameter.\n\n507\n00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:13.200\nBut understanding what you're doing\nwhen you're typing this command, right?\n\n508\n00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.990\nI'm adding a rule very basically.\n\n509\n00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:17.300\nThen what do I do?\n\n510\n00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.760\nWhat's the direction in,\naction is allow, what's the protocol.\n\n511\n00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.300\nSo being able to kind of dissect\nwhat's going on here will make you\n\n512\n00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.740\naware of the right answer on the exam.\n\n513\n00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.080\nIt's a long drawn out command, I realize\nthat guys, don't let it intimidate you.\n\n514\n00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.830\nJust know some of\nthe parameters behind it and\n\n515\n00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.970\nit can make it a little bit easier for\nyou when you sit in the exam booth if\n\n516\n00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:43.010\nany of these Netsh commands should\nmake their way on to the test.\n\n517\n00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.260\n>> Now Wes, there is also a way that we\ncan actually export a rule as well and\n\n518\n00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.580\nthis is actually a very important\ncommand for us to think about.\n\n519\n00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:53.040\nJust like we have said in the previous\nepisode, it gives us the ability to\n\n520\n00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.280\nactually take that rule that we might have\ntaken a long time to configure, test out,\n\n521\n00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.180\nverify that it's working, but\nalso then be able to take that rule and\n\n522\n00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.500\nimport it into other workstations.\n\n523\n00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.130\nThat will really help save us some time.\n\n524\n00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:06.330\nSo Wes, how do we do this?\n\n525\n00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:06.900\n>> Definitely.\n\n526\n00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.990\nAnd Ronnie,\nI know you work with switches and\n\n527\n00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.510\nstuff and have probably dealt with ACLs\nmore than you want to in your life.\n\n528\n00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.060\nAnd that's right,\n\n529\n00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.250\nonce you start configuring all,\nall I did was configure the single rule.\n\n530\n00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.770\nBut if you've got 100 rules that\nare configured, can you imagine having to\n\n531\n00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:23.680\ngo back and configure those on\nevery single individual machine?\n\n532\n00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.391\nNow if you're getting paid by the hour,\nit's probably not a bad thing but\n\n533\n00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:30.792\n[LAUGH] most of us aren't gonna\nget paid hourly on this one.\n\n534\n00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:35.480\nSo we can actually export the entire\nNeths or not Neths, excuse me,\n\n535\n00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.210\nthe advanced firewall\nsettings out to a file.\n\n536\n00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:42.800\nAnd for the exam, I want you to know\nthat the file format is something to\n\n537\n00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.730\npay attention to in case they give you\nthat, with the extension and everything.\n\n538\n00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.740\nSo fairly easy on this one too.\n\n539\n00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:49.430\nNetsh.\n\n540\n00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.760\nadvfirewall, all right.\n\n541\n00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.990\nAnd again, on this one,\nwe don't have to tell it a firewall again.\n\n542\n00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:01.980\nCuz remember when you put\nfirewall after advfirewall,\n\n543\n00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.510\nyou're telling it I wanna configure rules.\n\n544\n00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:06.650\nNow what we're gonna\ndo is just say export.\n\n545\n00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:08.750\nI'm gonna name where I\nwant the firewall to be,\n\n546\n00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.690\nor excuse me,\nwhere I want this file to be excuse me.\n\n547\n00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.190\nI'm gonna say WF,\nwe'll say Config, all right, it's\n\n548\n00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:21.670\na Windows Firewall configuration and then\nhere is where I want you to pay attention.\n\n549\n00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.480\nNotice the extension on this one,\n\n550\n00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.860\nall right just in case it\ncomes it comes up on the exam.\n\n551\n00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:31.760\nWe can identify things like TXTs,\nwe can identify things like DLL files,\n\n552\n00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.600\nthings that we commonly see, but\nif you haven't seen this one before,\n\n553\n00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.900\nthat little file extension could\nget you there on the exam.\n\n554\n00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:42.720\nNow, when we run this, it outputs that\nfile, that configuration file down to, and\n\n555\n00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.140\nI guess I could have not cheated here and\nstayed inside of the command prompt.\n\n556\n00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:52.200\nBut now I've got my Windows firewall\nconfiguration file outputted so\n\n557\n00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.580\nthat if I need to,\nI can copy this file and\n\n558\n00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.530\nI can import it to the firewall\non another machine.\n\n559\n00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:00.810\nI don't have to take the time configuring\neach one of the individual rules,\n\n560\n00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:04.700\ngo back and test them out, make sure\nthat they're configured appropriately.\n\n561\n00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.010\nJust import this file.\n\n562\n00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:10.770\nIt sets the firewall according\nto a known good configuration.\n\n563\n00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.580\nThe other great thing about this is\nconsistency in the configuration.\n\n564\n00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.800\nIt's very easy to make one little mistake.\n\n565\n00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.140\nAnd now, you think you have consistency,\nbut you don't.\n\n566\n00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.910\nIf I've got this file exported,\n\n567\n00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.260\nI'm not setting anything other than\nimporting its settings into the firewall.\n\n568\n00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.480\nWe can script it out, we need to automate\nit and we can have consistency in\n\n569\n00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.340\nthe firewall across all of our\nWindows 10 machines inside, like,\n\n570\n00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.600\nan enterprise network.\n\n571\n00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.820\n>> This also seems like a very practical\nway for us to make sure that we backup\n\n572\n00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:39.180\nthe firewall rules configuration\nthe way that we want to.\n\n573\n00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:45.070\nAnd that way if we do have some type of\ndisaster that happens in our machines and\n\n574\n00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.860\nwe want to say, hey,\n\n575\n00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.430\nI needed to reconfigure that on ten or\n12 different devices.\n\n576\n00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.130\nYou have that rule that you\ncan now import back in and\n\n577\n00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:55.045\nbe ready to actually do all\nthe configuration again.\n\n578\n00:30:55.045 --> 00:30:57.120\nWes makes a very important exam point for\n\n579\n00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.550\nus, you gotta know what\nparticular file type this is.\n\n580\n00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:02.060\nAnd this is actually very important for\n\n581\n00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.570\nus Because what we also saw in an early,\nI think it was an earlier episode.\n\n582\n00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.640\nI'm starting to lose\ntrack of our time here.\n\n583\n00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:12.110\nBut where we saw the export was actually\nto an xml file and this one and\n\n584\n00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:15.390\nthe advanced firewall that was to a .wfw.\n\n585\n00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:18.920\nSo a great thing to actually also remember\nwhen you start taking a look at this\n\n586\n00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.530\ninformation as well.\n\n587\n00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:24.580\nSo Wes, in this episode we've\ncovered a lot of information.\n\n588\n00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.570\nTaking a look at the idea of\nthe configuration of the firewall itself\n\n589\n00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:28.550\nfrom the command line.\n\n590\n00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.860\nThe firewall as well as the interfaces\nitself from the command line itself.\n\n591\n00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.690\nAnd then we also saw how we could verify\nand see that information as well.\n\n592\n00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.820\nMake sure you do take a look\nat these different commands.\n\n593\n00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.600\nA lot of times it's not\ngonna necessarily be\n\n594\n00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.510\nwhere you're expected to know everything\nthat there is to know at one time.\n\n595\n00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:51.833\nBut you do need to take a look at\nthose commands and dissect and\n\n596\n00:31:51.833 --> 00:31:54.389\nunderstand what is that\ncommand showing you.\n\n597\n00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:57.508\nThey may be asking you very simple\nquestions on the exam saying,\n\n598\n00:31:57.508 --> 00:31:59.773\ndoes this configured\nthe way that you want to?\n\n599\n00:31:59.773 --> 00:32:02.623\nYou gotta know when you're looking\nat a command if it does or not.\n\n600\n00:32:02.623 --> 00:32:05.258\nSo work through that example\nthat Wes gave you and\n\n601\n00:32:05.258 --> 00:32:08.180\nsee if it actually does\nlogically make sense.\n\n602\n00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.720\nUnderstand those file types as well cuz\nthose actually gonna be very important.\n\n603\n00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:16.420\nIt's wrong if it's a .txt if\nit's supposed to be a .wfw, so\n\n604\n00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.710\nmake sure you also note that as well.\n\n605\n00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:24.400\nRealize you can do this whether it's from\nthe idea of using PoweShell Commandlets or\n\n606\n00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.270\nalso Netsh,\nall that's actually very possible and\n\n607\n00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:32.070\nthat means that you as someone that's\nactually trying to earn your MCSA.\n\n608\n00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:35.890\nYes, it does mean that you need to be,\nyou don't have to be an expert at it, but\n\n609\n00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:40.268\nyou at least need to understand what's\ngoing on when you actually do see it.\n\n610\n00:32:40.268 --> 00:32:44.730\nWhether it is PowerShell or whether it's\nusing Netsh you got to know whether or\n\n611\n00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.880\nnot you can configure the interface or\n\n612\n00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.890\neven the firewall using these commands and\nwhich of the following\n\n613\n00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.210\nis actually something that\nyou're gonna be able to use.\n\n614\n00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.490\nAll of that stuff is testable and\nthe reason why is cuz you're supposed\n\n615\n00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:59.250\nto go beyond the idea of just clicking on\njust what you actually need to know and\n\n616\n00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:02.100\nactually understanding what\nthe workings are also behind it.\n\n617\n00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.280\nSo, not just the idea of\nknowing how to do something but\n\n618\n00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.390\nalso why you do something is also\ngonna be important here too.\n\n619\n00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.925\nSo Wes any last words as we\nare getting ready for the exam?\n\n620\n00:33:10.925 --> 00:33:14.370\n>> I'll tell you what you opened up a can\nof worms here, he has given me longer to\n\n621\n00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:18.180\ntalk, I do have one thing that I meant\nto put inside of the profiles and\n\n622\n00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.280\nthat's where it appropriately goes,\nbut I did forget about it.\n\n623\n00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.750\nAnd we're gonna talk just\na few more minutes about\n\n624\n00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.450\nthe graphical user interface\nas it relates to profiles.\n\n625\n00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:29.990\nSo if you look at my machine here,\nI'm actually in the network and\n\n626\n00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.780\nsharing center, and there's this advanced\nsharing settings over here on the side.\n\n627\n00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:37.310\nAnd I just wanna take a brief second and\njust talk about these,\n\n628\n00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:40.210\nbecause they directly relate\nto the profiles that we were\n\n629\n00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.790\ntalking about in the first\nportion of this episode.\n\n630\n00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.190\nNotice that we have network discovery,\nfile and printer sharing and\n\n631\n00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:50.130\nthen also how do we wanna allow\npeople to connect to home groups.\n\n632\n00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:53.680\nRemember network discovery is\nturned off on a public profile,\n\n633\n00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.190\nyou don't want this on\nin a public profile.\n\n634\n00:33:56.190 --> 00:34:00.020\nPrivate profile, you typically trust\nthe computers, if it's a domain profile,\n\n635\n00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.780\nit might even be managed\nby your administrators, so\n\n636\n00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.130\nyou might see everything grayed out here.\n\n637\n00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:06.650\nIf it isn't typically\non the domain profile,\n\n638\n00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:09.900\nyou typically trust those computers\ntoo cuz this is a work network.\n\n639\n00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.490\nWhen it comes to file and printer sharing,\nit's exactly that do you wanna allow\n\n640\n00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:18.580\nconnections to this machine if this\nmachine has a locally connective printer?\n\n641\n00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.340\nDo you want people to be able to print\nto that all fairly straightforward.\n\n642\n00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:26.830\nAnd one of the last one I'll mention\nhere is the guest and p ublic networks,\n\n643\n00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:29.040\nnotice that this, and\nyou can see that, right?\n\n644\n00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.800\nThe network discovery is turned off,\n\n645\n00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.570\nyou don't want people connecting\nin your machine and sharing files.\n\n646\n00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.670\nLast one is one that applies\nto all of the networks,\n\n647\n00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:41.500\nregardless of their profile that\nis currently on in the machine.\n\n648\n00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.980\nAnd this is the public folder sharing\noptions and then using encryption or\n\n649\n00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.430\npassword protection when it comes to\nwhen people connect to this machine.\n\n650\n00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:50.270\nSo Ronny,\nsomething that I kind of forgot there,\n\n651\n00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:53.860\nwanted to put it in there because it\ndirectly relates to those profiles.\n\n652\n00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:58.660\n>> Make sure you also check out that first\nseries of episodes that we also did here.\n\n653\n00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:01.360\nWes is really helping us fill\nin gaps of places that we\n\n654\n00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.130\nactually didn't end up covering\nin that first series of episodes.\n\n655\n00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.480\nSo this actually does fill that in and\nit actually allows us to be able to see\n\n656\n00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.570\na little bit more, some of the things that\nyou can't connect to are actually simple\n\n657\n00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:14.830\nrules like this under network discovery so\nmake sure you also pay attention there.\n\n658\n00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:18.450\nWell that's a great place for us to also\ngo ahead and say hey, this is where we're\n\n659\n00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:23.570\ngonna end this episode, so signing off for\nITProTV, I'm your host Ronny Wong.\n\n660\n00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:24.224\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n661\n00:35:24.224 --> 00:35:25.386\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n662\n00:35:25.386 --> 00:35:34.540\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.490\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n5\n00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.900\nHere with me today well,\nit's my good friend Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.430\nHow about that?\n\n7\n00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.460\nHow's it going Mike?\n\n8\n00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.110\n>> It's going great Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.710\nExcited about our content today.\n\n10\n00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.300\nWe're doing our Windows 10 content\nobviously and in this episode we're going\n\n11\n00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.010\nto be looking at something called work\nfolders as well as the Phone companion.\n\n12\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.050\nGood stuff, right Daniel?\n\n13\n00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.700\n>> Phone companion,\nit does sound interesting.\n\n14\n00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.380\nAnd guess what?\n\n15\n00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.130\nIt is actually pretty interesting.\n\n16\n00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.860\nIt's cool things that\nwe can have nowadays.\n\n17\n00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.555\nWe do tend to use our phones quite a lot\nfor for business purposes anymore.\n\n18\n00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:47.905\nI worked in the corporate\nenvironment myself, and\n\n19\n00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:49.945\nI can't tell you how many\ntimes people brought it.\n\n20\n00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:50.775\nYeah, I just brought a new phone.\n\n21\n00:00:50.775 --> 00:00:51.955\nI gotta get this hooked up.\n\n22\n00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:53.235\nI gotta be able to use it.\n\n23\n00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:55.205\nI use it for work, I gotta have that.\n\n24\n00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:58.500\nWe also gave phones out to CEOs and\n\n25\n00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.900\nthings that people in the upper\nechelons of the corporation.\n\n26\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.490\nSo they get those types\nof things because why?\n\n27\n00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.940\nThey're basically small computers, so\n\n28\n00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.640\nwe wanna be able to use them in\nour business day-to-day lives.\n\n29\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.050\nSo no matter what device I'm on.\n\n30\n00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.060\nMaybe I'm on a laptop.\n\n31\n00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.336\nMaybe I'm on a tablet.\n\n32\n00:01:14.336 --> 00:01:17.120\nMaybe I'm on a phone, all these\ndifferent types of mobile devices,\n\n33\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.780\nwe've gotta start supporting those\nwe've gotta know what we can do.\n\n34\n00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.410\nWindows 10 has some interesting\nmobility options for that and\n\n35\n00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.500\nthat's what we're gonna talk about today.\n\n36\n00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.160\nMike, the Phone Companion I just\nthink is one of the coolest,\n\n37\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.070\nfunny names that I've ever heard.\n\n38\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.770\nYou definitely won't\nforget it though will you?\n\n39\n00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.180\n>> We were getting a kick\nout of that earlier.\n\n40\n00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.048\n>> Yeah.\nAll right,\n\n41\n00:01:34.048 --> 00:01:35.830\nlet's start of with work folders.\n\n42\n00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.216\nWork folders is a,\nit good way think about work folders is,\n\n43\n00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:41.260\nit's kind of like a private cloud.\n\n44\n00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.102\nWhat that is, is it will be take care of\ncorporate network, we set up a file server\n\n45\n00:01:46.102 --> 00:01:49.809\nand we are going to allow our users\nto connect to this server and\n\n46\n00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:55.010\ncreate a folder for them and they're gonna\nable to upload documents in their folder.\n\n47\n00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.310\nRight like well, okay Mike, great.\n\n48\n00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.020\nThat's a share, whoop de do, right.\n\n49\n00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.330\nWell, here's where it\nstarts getting really cool.\n\n50\n00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.130\nAt work while you're sitting at your PC,\n\n51\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.530\nsure you could upload\ndocuments to this folder.\n\n52\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.010\nWhen you go home and\nyou get on your home computer,\n\n53\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.810\nyour laptop that's not part of the domain,\nyou can still connect to that work folder.\n\n54\n00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.220\nSo, now you can work with documents,\nhave one copy of these documents, right?\n\n55\n00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.260\nYou can connect to it\nwhile you're at work.\n\n56\n00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.640\nYou can put your document up there.\n\n57\n00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.810\nYou can go home.\n\n58\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.670\nYou can work with that document.\n\n59\n00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.640\nIt’s gonna synchronize a copy locally.\n\n60\n00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.580\nYou’re gonna work with it.\n\n61\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.720\nIt’s gonna put it back up\nthere to work folders.\n\n62\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.180\nIt’s all done behind the scenes.\n\n63\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.890\nSynchronization is going on.\n\n64\n00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.070\nWhen you get back to work,\n\n65\n00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.100\nyou’ve got that updated copy\nsitting there in your work folder.\n\n66\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.540\nNo more taking a thumb drive and carrying\nthat file home, making changes to it,\n\n67\n00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.730\nhaving to put it back on the thumb drive,\nbringing it back to work,\n\n68\n00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.750\nputting it back on your PC, there what\nhave you, over riding the original, or\n\n69\n00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.190\nhaving five different\nversions of the file.\n\n70\n00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.640\nSo Work Folders really it is\nlike a private cloud solution.\n\n71\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.090\nAnd it'll work form any\nWindows 8.1 device.\n\n72\n00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.040\nSo if you've got Windows 8.1\nrunning on your machine at home,\n\n73\n00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.210\neven RT, it'll actually work from there,\nas well.\n\n74\n00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.170\nWhich is something we don't see that\noften, RT being a little limited.\n\n75\n00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.170\nWindows 7 is supported, but\n\n76\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.800\nthe Windows 7 machine would\nhave to be part of the domain.\n\n77\n00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.710\nSo, if it was your laptop that you used at\nwork, and then you took it with you, so\n\n78\n00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.090\nit was a domain member and you take it\nwith you when you're on that sales trip or\n\n79\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.320\nyou take it home with you at night or\non the weekends, you could use that.\n\n80\n00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.910\nBut if it's your home PC that's not part\nof the domain that's running Windows 7,\n\n81\n00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.270\nthis won't work for you.\n\n82\n00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.590\nSo you're gonna have to upgrade to Windows\n8.1 if you want that if the machine is\n\n83\n00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.140\nnot part of the domain.\n\n84\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.620\nAnd here's a really cool one.\n\n85\n00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.290\nIt will also work with iOS 8 and\nlater on the iPad.\n\n86\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.160\nYou can go to the App Store, and\nyou can download the app for work folders.\n\n87\n00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.910\nAnd you can actually connect\nto your work folder at work\n\n88\n00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.310\nfrom your iPad when you're out there\non the road or doing whatever.\n\n89\n00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.480\nSo, some really cool\noptions with Work Folders.\n\n90\n00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.270\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n91\n00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.830\nI know that I like to be\nable to take my tablet.\n\n92\n00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.200\nIt's such an easy thing to do,\njust throw that in the bag.\n\n93\n00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.020\nIf I have to go somewhere,\nmaybe I'm taking a day trip,\n\n94\n00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.620\nI don't have to lug around a laptop.\n\n95\n00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.760\nNot that laptops are huge, but\ncompared to a tablet, what's easier?\n\n96\n00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.060\nThe tablet is definitely better.\n\n97\n00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.730\nSo having that access\nto these work folders,\n\n98\n00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.000\nas they call them in Windows, through\nthe tablet, even a competitor's tablet,\n\n99\n00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.300\nthey say, hey, we're not skipping anybody.\n\n100\n00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.560\nIf you need access to work documents,\n\n101\n00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.730\nthese work folders is definitely\ngonna be the way to go.\n\n102\n00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.940\nThis is actually a really interesting\npiece of technology, Mike,\n\n103\n00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.530\nto be able to work on folders whether I'm\nat home, or work on documents whether I'm\n\n104\n00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.810\nat home, whether I'm at work, no matter\nwhere I'm at, I have access to them.\n\n105\n00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.590\nIt doesn't matter that I'm not\ntechnically attached to my work network.\n\n106\n00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.650\nI kinda get like an offline cached\ncopy of these different files,\n\n107\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.750\nmake my changes, sit in the comfort\nof my own Lazy Boy at home and\n\n108\n00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.510\nmake those changes when I come in,\nit just automatically syncs up.\n\n109\n00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.340\nThat sure makes our lives\na whole lot easier.\n\n110\n00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.870\n>> Absolutely.\n\n111\n00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.262\nAnd there's a rumor and\nI don't know how true this is,\n\n112\n00:05:00.262 --> 00:05:03.486\nthat they're actually working on maybe\nsome Android support as well, so\n\n113\n00:05:03.486 --> 00:05:05.740\nthat would be pretty\ncool if they got that.\n\n114\n00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.520\nAnyway, let's take a look at what we\nneed to know about work folders for\n\n115\n00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.160\nthe exam and how we can get this set up.\n\n116\n00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.200\nNow, for this particular exam,\n\n117\n00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.790\nthe server side of things, I don't\nthink you're really gonna need to know.\n\n118\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.290\nYou need to know how to support\nthe clients for the Windows 10 exam.\n\n119\n00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.420\nYou need to see it from\nthe client perspective.\n\n120\n00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.930\nI've always been a fan of\nseeing the big picture.\n\n121\n00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.330\nIf you understand what's\ngoing on on the other side,\n\n122\n00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.670\nit makes it easier to work with, I think.\n\n123\n00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.830\nSo let's just take a look at\nwhat I've got going on here.\n\n124\n00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.220\nThis is my file server.\n\n125\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.240\nAnd I've installed Work Folders on it.\n\n126\n00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.030\nAnd I'm gonna go,\nwell let me do that again a little slower.\n\n127\n00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.000\nIn the server manager, I'm gonna click on\nFile and Storage services and down here I\n\n128\n00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.320\nhave Work Folders, and what I've done\nis I've set up Work Folders earlier,\n\n129\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.000\nbefore we started all this, and\nI create what's called a Sync Share.\n\n130\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.190\nNow, that Sync Share, that's where\nthe folders are going to be created.\n\n131\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.360\nIt's a very simple wizard\nthat I ran through.\n\n132\n00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.280\nI could do it again.\n\n133\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.830\nWe could use new Sync Share, I could walk\nthrough this wizard, and all you're gonna\n\n134\n00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.440\ndo is you're gonna give it a location\nof where you want to store that.\n\n135\n00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.040\nAnd let me just show you guys here.\n\n136\n00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.310\nOops, let's try that again.\n\n137\n00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.770\nI'm going to go to my C drive and\n\n138\n00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.010\nchoose new folder, and\nI'll just call this one test to show you.\n\n139\n00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.410\nI'll select that folder.\n\n140\n00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.970\nSo now it knows where to\ncreate the subfolders.\n\n141\n00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.710\nI click next again.\n\n142\n00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.590\nI can choose user alias or user alias\nat domain and this could be something\n\n143\n00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.240\nthat you end up having to troubleshoot or\nagain, we might not be able to fix it, but\n\n144\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.190\nat least we know what to look for\nand we can escalate it.\n\n145\n00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.310\nIn a single domain environment, user alias\nis fine, right, that's all you need.\n\n146\n00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.050\nIts gonna basically create sub\nfolders based on your user name.\n\n147\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.450\nSo, Mike, Daniel, or MRodrick, and\nDLowry, or whatever the case may be.\n\n148\n00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.900\nIn a multi domain environment,\n\n149\n00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.340\nhowever, we could end up with\na conflict if we do it that way.\n\n150\n00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.470\nWhat if there's an M Roderick in lab.net,\n\n151\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:07.810\nthere's another M Roderick in\nsales.lab.net or some other child domain.\n\n152\n00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.290\nWell, we could end up\nwith a conflict right,\n\n153\n00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.920\ntwo folders that have the same name.\n\n154\n00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.970\nSo that's when you could choose\nuser alias at domain and\n\n155\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.152\nthat way it would give us\nsome uniqueness there.\n\n156\n00:07:19.152 --> 00:07:20.902\nMrodrick@lab.net.\n\n157\n00:07:20.902 --> 00:07:23.550\nMrodrick@child.lab.net, right?\n\n158\n00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.500\nSo they would be different even\nthough they got the same user name.\n\n159\n00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.520\nSo that's something we gotta think about.\n\n160\n00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.450\nYou can also synch just\nindividual folders,\n\n161\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.500\nagain something you might\nhave to troubleshoot.\n\n162\n00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.590\nIf they're asking,\nhow come my documents are synching, but\n\n163\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.520\nthis other folder is not?\n\n164\n00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.740\nWell maybe the admin has decided\nnot to synch everything.\n\n165\n00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.200\nTo limit how much you're actually\nputting up there in your work folders.\n\n166\n00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.490\nMaybe it's just a particular folder,\nnot all of your profile folders.\n\n167\n00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.170\nSo they could choose to synch\nonly the following sub folder.\n\n168\n00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.188\nI'm going to just leave it on\nthe defaults for now, for this example.\n\n169\n00:07:55.188 --> 00:07:56.070\nI'll click Next, Next.\n\n170\n00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.742\nThen you would add.\n\n171\n00:07:57.742 --> 00:08:00.609\nWho you wanted to set up work folders for.\n\n172\n00:08:00.609 --> 00:08:03.060\nIt could be the entire company.\n\n173\n00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.720\nIt could be just the CEO's, right?\n\n174\n00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.450\nMaybe they're the only ones that need\nto be able to do this from outside\n\n175\n00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.640\nthe network or just the sales department.\n\n176\n00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.750\nSo, you would go and pick a group, and\nI'm just going to do domain admins for\n\n177\n00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.700\nthis demo, because I don't\nreally have a lot of groups.\n\n178\n00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.080\nThen I would click okay.\n\n179\n00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.210\nSo this particular sync\nfolder would be just for\n\n180\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.644\nanybody in the domain admins group.\n\n181\n00:08:24.644 --> 00:08:25.886\nI can click next.\n\n182\n00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:28.892\nYou can see by default,\ndisable inherited permissions and\n\n183\n00:08:28.892 --> 00:08:31.750\ngrant users exclusive\naccess to their files.\n\n184\n00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.740\nThis is normally what we\nsee on our profile, right?\n\n185\n00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.440\nWe have that expectancy of privacy\nwhen it comes to our documents and\n\n186\n00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.150\nthings like that.\n\n187\n00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.890\nSo, I typically leave that there.\n\n188\n00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:46.480\nThat prevents, even as an admin, I\nwouldn't be able to get in there directly.\n\n189\n00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.300\nOf course, as an admin,\nI can give myself access but,\n\n190\n00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.580\nthis would prevent me\nfrom just browsing to it.\n\n191\n00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.980\nI click next.\n\n192\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.860\nWe can also set our policies.\n\n193\n00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.610\nAll right?\n\n194\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.370\nThis is company information that\nthey're storing in their work folders.\n\n195\n00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.270\nThey're gonna be accessing it\nfrom outside of the network\n\n196\n00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.730\nfrom devices that are not\nunder my control, right?\n\n197\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.150\nThey're a home computer.\n\n198\n00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.760\nTheir iPad.\n\n199\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.280\nRight?\n\n200\n00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.590\nSo I wanna be able to at least\nprovide some level of security and\n\n201\n00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.280\nthat's what this does.\n\n202\n00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.890\nAutomatically lock the screen\nto acquire password.\n\n203\n00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.190\nSo on that iPad if they've\ndisabled their password, and\n\n204\n00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.170\nthey don't have to type anything into\naccess the iPad, they wouldn't be able to\n\n205\n00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.010\nconnect it to my work folders,\nthey're gonna have to enable that and\n\n206\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.180\nthey're gonna have to agree to\nthis when they first set it up.\n\n207\n00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.330\nSame thing with encrypting work folders,\nright?\n\n208\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.580\nThey're gonna be storing a cache copy\non their home PC or on their iPad.\n\n209\n00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.080\nI might want to encrypt those, right,\n\n210\n00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.940\nbecause I don't know what's\ngoing on at their house.\n\n211\n00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.540\nI don't know what kind of\nphysical security they've got.\n\n212\n00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.610\nThings like that.\n\n213\n00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.960\nSo I might wanna choose to encrypt them,\nas well.\n\n214\n00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.150\nI'm not going to here for this,\njust because I didn't wanna deal with all\n\n215\n00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.585\nthe certificates and\nthings that we have to do for that.\n\n216\n00:09:53.585 --> 00:09:55.880\n[COUGH] I'll go ahead and click Next.\n\n217\n00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.670\nAnd then Create.\n\n218\n00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.060\nAnd then close.\n\n219\n00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.130\nAnd you'll see it creates this Sync Share,\nand I can look down here, and\n\n220\n00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.090\nusers is gonna be that\ndomain admins group.\n\n221\n00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.050\nNow, you can setup one work folder for\nsay,\n\n222\n00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.720\nauthenticated users,\neverybody on the network.\n\n223\n00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.590\nYou could create separate sync shares for\ndifferent groups.\n\n224\n00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.490\nBecause maybe you have\ndifferent levels of security.\n\n225\n00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:24.060\nI wanna store all of the marketing\npeople's work folders on file server A.\n\n226\n00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.870\nI wanna do a separate\nset of work folders for\n\n227\n00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.320\nthe domain from the CEOs and\nthe C-level executives\n\n228\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.230\non a different file server because it\nhas a different level of security maybe.\n\n229\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.824\nSo, you can set up multiple sync shares,\nand\n\n230\n00:10:36.824 --> 00:10:39.364\nbase it on group membership\nlike I just did.\n\n231\n00:10:39.364 --> 00:10:42.477\nOr, you could just do authenticated users,\nfor example, and\n\n232\n00:10:42.477 --> 00:10:44.367\nget everybody in the entire network.\n\n233\n00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:47.150\nAll right, so that's work folders.\n\n234\n00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.940\nThat's from the server perspective,\nthat's work folders.\n\n235\n00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.720\nNow, they are gonna be using an HTTPS\nconnection to connect to work folders.\n\n236\n00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.900\nSo that means my server is\ngonna need a certificate\n\n237\n00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.950\nin order to set up the HTTPS connection,\nI will tell you that in\n\n238\n00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:08.345\nthe corporate environment most of this is\ngoing to be done through group policy.\n\n239\n00:11:08.345 --> 00:11:12.820\nThrough group policy I can\npush out a certificate and\n\n240\n00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.650\nhave all the computers on my network\nautomatically trust that certificate.\n\n241\n00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:21.420\nI can also automatically set up\nwork folders on those domain based\n\n242\n00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:26.180\nclient PC's so that the user\ndoesn't have to do anything right.\n\n243\n00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.760\nBut I'm gonna show you how to do it\nmanually here for two reasons, one you\n\n244\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.920\nneed to see so that you know what they\nmight have to go through cuz maybe I set\n\n245\n00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.430\nit up for authenticated users, everybody\nin the domain, but not everybody uses it.\n\n246\n00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:43.100\nSo, only if you go into the control\npanel and click on Work Folders and\n\n247\n00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.340\nset it up, you get access to it.\n\n248\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.370\nIf you don't care about work folders,\nyou don't take your work home.\n\n249\n00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.470\nYou're not in a department that needs\nto be working on documents at home\n\n250\n00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.290\nthen maybe you never set it up.\n\n251\n00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.430\nSo you might leave it as a manual setup,\n\n252\n00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:00.320\nyou might force that setup\nout through group policy.\n\n253\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.310\nFor those home machines,\ngoing to have to do it manually.\n\n254\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.700\nThey're not under my control.\n\n255\n00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.770\nI can't use group policy and\nconfigure your iPad for\n\n256\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.962\nyou, so\nthose would have to be done manually.\n\n257\n00:12:10.962 --> 00:12:15.710\nAll right so let's see how, I'm going to\nflip back over here, this is going to be\n\n258\n00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.860\na domain-based PC and the first thing I\nwould need to do I've already done this,\n\n259\n00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.580\nI'm gonna go ahead and do it again,\nis install the certificate.\n\n260\n00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.110\nThis is so\n\n261\n00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.630\nthat I'll trust that certificate\nthat that server is setting up.\n\n262\n00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.880\nAgain, this would normally be\ndone through group policy for\n\n263\n00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.650\nyour domain-based machines.\n\n264\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.470\nYou do want to make sure it\ngoes into the trusted root\n\n265\n00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.700\ncertification authority folder.\n\n266\n00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.180\nI will click Next, finish and\nit imports that certificate.\n\n267\n00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.490\nAnd now I am good to go there.\n\n268\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.500\nThe next thing we are going\nto do is go into the,\n\n269\n00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.060\nI guess we could do it either way.\n\n270\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.900\nWe will try the long way here.\n\n271\n00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.510\nIf is go into Control Panel\n\n272\n00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.470\nand I switched my view\nover to large icons,\n\n273\n00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:05.120\nI should be able to find work folders,\nright?\n\n274\n00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.460\nAnd then I can choose set up work folder.\n\n275\n00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.757\nAnd I'm going to use the URL because I'm\nnot running an email the server on this\n\n276\n00:13:13.757 --> 00:13:19.791\nlittle lab environment, so I'm gonna\nconnect over to that server svr01.lab.net.\n\n277\n00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:23.994\nAnd I'll click Next.\n\n278\n00:13:23.994 --> 00:13:26.490\nAnd it's gonna start the process.\n\n279\n00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:31.100\nBy default that's gonna put a folder for\nme in my profile called Work Folders, and\n\n280\n00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:35.030\nanything I put in there then would be\nsynchronized up with that file server.\n\n281\n00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.230\nYou could change that location if you had\na different drive or wanted to move it for\n\n282\n00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.320\nsome reason.\n\n283\n00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.630\nI'll click next.\n\n284\n00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.840\nAnd here's where it's\nshowing me those policies.\n\n285\n00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.620\nI don't know what my company is enforcing,\nit's just saying hey,\n\n286\n00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.720\nthese might be required if\nyou want to use work folders.\n\n287\n00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.480\nAnd I just have to say I accept.\n\n288\n00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.140\nAll right?\n\n289\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.650\nOh, and one we didn't talk about,\nDaniel, is that remote wipe.\n\n290\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:57.592\nErase all files and work folders.\n\n291\n00:13:57.592 --> 00:14:01.310\nAll right, that's a really cool option for\nthe company because that means I can reach\n\n292\n00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:07.710\nout and wipe any synced content on your\nhome PC or your iPad that I need to wipe.\n\n293\n00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:11.030\nI can wipe out your work folders but\nnot the rest of your laptop, right?\n\n294\n00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:16.090\nSo if a person leaves the company, what if\nthey've got content on their home machine?\n\n295\n00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.390\nThis gives me the ability to reach out and\nwipe it but not wipe out their entire\n\n296\n00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.610\nmachine so their calling me up going\nwhat the heck did you do to my machine.\n\n297\n00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.140\n>> Yeah,\nI remember having plenty of people say,\n\n298\n00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.210\nas I was setting up this type of\noption for their mobile devices,\n\n299\n00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:33.720\nand they'd say, what, you have the ability\nto completely wipe stuff out on my device?\n\n300\n00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.440\nWell, yeah, you gotta remember\nyou're accessing company data.\n\n301\n00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.110\nIf you ever quit or\nget fired or things like that,\n\n302\n00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.140\nwe need to have control over that.\n\n303\n00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.330\nSo, there's kind of a compromise\nthat we need to make here between\n\n304\n00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.910\nyour home stuff versus what is\nactually company access data.\n\n305\n00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.990\nSo, you gotta kinda quell\ntheir fears a little bit.\n\n306\n00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.826\n>> Right.\n>> Tell them we're\n\n307\n00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:53.858\nnot gonna wipe your PC out.\n\n308\n00:14:53.858 --> 00:14:57.422\nWe're just going to get rid of whatever\nis our and you have your own stuff.\n\n309\n00:14:57.422 --> 00:14:58.653\n>> Exactly.\n\n310\n00:14:58.653 --> 00:15:02.031\nSo, let's go ahead and click,\nset up work folders, here.\n\n311\n00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:04.809\nNow I'm not an admin on this machine, so\n\n312\n00:15:04.809 --> 00:15:09.840\nI'll give its administrative\ncredentials to finish this process.\n\n313\n00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.620\nIf you use group policy to push this out,\nthey don't have to be an admin and\n\n314\n00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.570\nthey don't need to do this.\n\n315\n00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.540\nIt'll be as the policy will\nescalate credentials to\n\n316\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.130\nconfigure work folders for them.\n\n317\n00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.880\nAnd there it goes.\n\n318\n00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.500\nIt's setting it up, and it now tells\nme it has started the syncing process.\n\n319\n00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.000\nIt's syncing in the background so\nI'll go ahead and click close.\n\n320\n00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.450\nAnd there's my new folder\nthat it created for me.\n\n321\n00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.740\nHere's my work folder.\n\n322\n00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.600\nSo let's make something in here.\n\n323\n00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:42.449\nI'm gonna create a new folder called,\nI don't know, Reports.\n\n324\n00:15:42.449 --> 00:15:45.172\nTrouble with that.\n\n325\n00:15:45.172 --> 00:15:45.940\nThere we go.\n\n326\n00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:46.990\nReports.\n\n327\n00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.550\nAnd maybe I make a document inside there.\n\n328\n00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:51.920\nWe'll do that.\n\n329\n00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.820\nWe'll call it quarter one report,\nor something like that.\n\n330\n00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.480\nSo, just making files, right?\n\n331\n00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.331\nI work on this.\n\n332\n00:15:58.331 --> 00:15:59.491\nI open these up.\n\n333\n00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:00.989\nI do whatever it is.\n\n334\n00:16:00.989 --> 00:16:01.687\nI save.\n\n335\n00:16:01.687 --> 00:16:02.928\nAnd I close these guys.\n\n336\n00:16:04.728 --> 00:16:05.807\nAll right.\n\n337\n00:16:05.807 --> 00:16:09.150\nAnd I'll go ahead and close that as well.\n\n338\n00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.640\nIf you go back to Work Folders in\nthe Control Panel at this point,\n\n339\n00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.630\nthis is the screen you're gonna see.\n\n340\n00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.260\nTells you how much is available,\ntells you when it was last synced, so\n\n341\n00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.300\nas an end user this is where you can find\nout, hey, is everything working properly?\n\n342\n00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:26.860\nBy default it syncs every ten minutes, so\nit's not gonna show up immediately say,\n\n343\n00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.430\non another PC or something like that but\nthat's usually fine, right.\n\n344\n00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.950\nIf I'm at work, it's gonna take me ten\nminutes just to pack up my stuff and\n\n345\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:34.720\nget to my car.\n\n346\n00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.120\nBy the time I get home, those documents\nare gonna be synced and I'm good to go.\n\n347\n00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.490\nThey can choose to sync now if they want\nto force that synchronization to occur.\n\n348\n00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.570\nYou can also tell it to sync\nover metered connections.\n\n349\n00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.410\nBy default it won't do that.\n\n350\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.090\nIf you're on a metered connection,\none where you're getting,\n\n351\n00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:54.330\nyou got a bandwidth cap or\na data cap on there, it won't sync.\n\n352\n00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.050\nSo if you need it to sync over at\nthe metered connection you can\n\n353\n00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.410\nchoose that as well.\n\n354\n00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.390\nAll right, so now if we go back over\nto the file server and I take a look\n\n355\n00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:11.690\nat that location, there's the folder\nit created for my user account.\n\n356\n00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:15.570\nAnd I'm logged in as\nthe admin on this server.\n\n357\n00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:16.750\nAnd notice I can't get access to it.\n\n358\n00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.210\nOnly Mike has access to his folder.\n\n359\n00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.580\nAnd we know that I could\ngive myself access but\n\n360\n00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:22.580\nI'm not going to do that right now.\n\n361\n00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.420\nAll right, so that synchronizing\nfrom that work machine, so\n\n362\n00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.790\nnow the work PC is set up.\n\n363\n00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.079\nI'm at work,\nI can just open up File Explorer,\n\n364\n00:17:30.079 --> 00:17:33.990\nand I can go over to Work Folders,\nand I can work with my documents.\n\n365\n00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.380\nThen when I get to my machine at home,\n\n366\n00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.410\nall right, I've gotta set up\nwork folders here as well.\n\n367\n00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:44.380\nOne of the first things I'm gonna need\nto do is install that certificate.\n\n368\n00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.280\nMost likely they will put\nthis in a share somewhere, or\n\n369\n00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:53.280\nmaybe they've got DFS setup that\nyou can get to from home, or\n\n370\n00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.760\nthey'll put it on a thumb drive,\nor they'll email it out.\n\n371\n00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.770\nThis is the public key of the server,\nso it's not that we\n\n372\n00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:04.150\ndon't need to keep it safe, but\nputting it on a thumb drive and\n\n373\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.930\ngiving it to a user would\nbe acceptable to take home.\n\n374\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:08.810\nClick Next.\n\n375\n00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.560\nAnd I'll go ahead and install it.\n\n376\n00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.410\nAnd it's warning me,\nhey once you trust this certificate\n\n377\n00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.520\nanything that server\ndoes you're gonna trust.\n\n378\n00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.150\nI'm okay with that.\n\n379\n00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.770\nAll right.\n\n380\n00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:19.500\nSo now I trust that server.\n\n381\n00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.050\nYou do need network connectivity back to\nthe corporate office for this to work.\n\n382\n00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:29.170\nSo if you have to establish\na VPN connection or\n\n383\n00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:34.400\nif the URL for\nthe work folder server is public, right.\n\n384\n00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.010\nSo, if they've set it up to where\nyou can access it from the outside.\n\n385\n00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:42.180\nI am going to open up my Control Panel,\nand\n\n386\n00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.700\nchange my view, and go ahead and\n\n387\n00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:52.190\nlaunch my work folders, and\nI'll set up work folders.\n\n388\n00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:53.590\nAgain, I'm gonna use a URL.\n\n389\n00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:57.475\nSo, this would have to be\nresolvable from the outside world,\n\n390\n00:18:57.475 --> 00:19:01.521\nwhich is again something that we\ndo on the server side of things.\n\n391\n00:19:04.271 --> 00:19:10.250\nAnd it's gonna be an https://, in my case,\n\n392\n00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:15.963\nsbr01.lab.net, and I'll click Next.\n\n393\n00:19:15.963 --> 00:19:19.570\nAnd when I set it up on the work PC,\nit didn't prompt me for\n\n394\n00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:23.650\ncredentials, right, because it knew\nwho I was, I was logged on as Mike.\n\n395\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.520\nIt has my Kerberos, all my authentication\nthere, it knows my account, and\n\n396\n00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.060\nit started setting things up.\n\n397\n00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.690\nHere I'm at home,\nI'm not logged on with my work account.\n\n398\n00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.120\nI'm logged in with my, in this case,\n\n399\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.250\nI am logged in with one of my\nMicrosoft accounts, right.\n\n400\n00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.350\nCuz at home I've got my OneDrive and\nall that great stuff,\n\n401\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.460\naccess to the store that I get from\nsigning on with a Microsoft account.\n\n402\n00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.570\nSo it's saying, hey,\nI don't know who that is, who are you?\n\n403\n00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.960\nDo you have permission to\nconnect to this server?\n\n404\n00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.562\nAnd I say I do, I am lab/Mike\n\n405\n00:19:56.771 --> 00:20:01.310\nAnd it shows me it's gonna setup\na folder here on my home PC for me.\n\n406\n00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.880\nI'm gonna have to accept\nthe policies before I move on.\n\n407\n00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.430\nSetup work folders.\n\n408\n00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:10.440\nAnd I'll allow that to go,\nit's got to go through the process.\n\n409\n00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.170\nAnd I click Close and\nthere we go, it's already synced.\n\n410\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.920\nI can get into Reports and\nthere's quarter one report.\n\n411\n00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.630\nSo that's setting it up\non the home machine.\n\n412\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.490\nThe big thing to remember is you got to\ntrust the certificate that's been issued\n\n413\n00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.740\nto the work folder's server.\n\n414\n00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.230\nCuz you're gonna have to\nset up an htps connection.\n\n415\n00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.370\nYou gotta provide credentials when\nyou're doing it on a home machine,\n\n416\n00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:33.330\nbecause I don't have group policy or\nanything like that to set it up.\n\n417\n00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.170\nI'm not logged in on with a work account.\n\n418\n00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.079\nBut, I could go in here and\nI could make changes to this document.\n\n419\n00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.356\nI know I'm very creative with my changes,\nthere.\n\n420\n00:20:42.356 --> 00:20:47.320\nSave it, close it,\nget back into work the next day,\n\n421\n00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.890\nopen up work folders,right.\n\n422\n00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.700\nAnd I do wanna go ahead and\nsync it cuz it hasn't been ten minutes.\n\n423\n00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.350\nSo I'm gonna get it to sync real quick.\n\n424\n00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.580\nOpen that up, and\nthere's my changes, right.\n\n425\n00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.132\nSo now super easy.\n\n426\n00:21:02.132 --> 00:21:06.320\nYou can have one copy of that document and\nI can work with it at work,\n\n427\n00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.120\nI can work with it from home, I can\nwork with it on my iPad, it's that easy.\n\n428\n00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.190\n>> Yeah Mike I really like the way that\nyou compared that to being like a private\n\n429\n00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.360\ncloud scenario.\n\n430\n00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.110\nIt really is how it works itself\nout in practical application.\n\n431\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.650\nYou've got that one spot that you\ngo to no matter where you're at,\n\n432\n00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:22.870\nyou're accessing the same files.\n\n433\n00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:24.880\nI can be at home, I can be at work.\n\n434\n00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.400\nI go to the house, I say, man I really\nneed to finish up some work on that\n\n435\n00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.190\nspreadsheet, I can still get access to it.\n\n436\n00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.280\nOnce I make the changes,\nit will then sync up.\n\n437\n00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.110\nSo, very, very nice.\n\n438\n00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.370\n>> Yeah, and something else I didn't\nmention about work folders and\n\n439\n00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:40.580\none of the advantages of it is, cuz as we\nsay, it's kinda like a private cloud, and\n\n440\n00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.830\nyou might be thinking, well,\nwhy not just use cloud services, right.\n\n441\n00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.440\nWhy not use Dropbox,\n\n442\n00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.060\ncuz that's probably something\nmost of have done already, right.\n\n443\n00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.940\nI'm at work, I just use my personal\nDropbox account to dump stuff in and\n\n444\n00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.180\nthen when I went to get home,\nI can work with it.\n\n445\n00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.900\nAnd the problem is as a company,\nI've lost control over that data, right.\n\n446\n00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.100\nI can't go up to Dropbox and\nforce you to encrypt it.\n\n447\n00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.040\nI can't wipe it if you leave my company.\n\n448\n00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.550\nSo that's a big advantage with work\nfolders is the ability that I can still\n\n449\n00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.650\ncontrol the information that\nyou're putting in there, but\n\n450\n00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.170\nstill give you the functionality of\nsomething like OneDrive or Dropbox.\n\n451\n00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.980\nSo, it really does work out for\nthe organization.\n\n452\n00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.550\n>> Yeah, that's a very, very good point.\n\n453\n00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.880\nAs administrators,\nwe're all about control.\n\n454\n00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.860\nWe don't want our data\nfalling into the wrong hands.\n\n455\n00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:28.540\nSo having that control via using work\nfolders instead of something like OneDrive\n\n456\n00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:29.930\nis definitely the better way to go.\n\n457\n00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.760\nSo, good point there, Mike.\n\n458\n00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.420\n>> Alright so, Daniel,\n\n459\n00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:36.240\nI think we're ready to take a look\nat this Phone Companion now.\n\n460\n00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.820\nSo phone companion is\na way that I can connect-\n\n461\n00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.500\n>> Our phones get lonely.\n\n462\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.070\n>> They do, you know.\n\n463\n00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.049\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Our phones need companions.\n\n464\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.487\nOh Microsoft [CROSSTALK]\n>> We're gonna have fun with\n\n465\n00:22:47.487 --> 00:22:48.160\nthat one guys.\n\n466\n00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.520\n>> Do they not think about this\nbefore they name these products?\n\n467\n00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.480\n>> I guess not.\n\n468\n00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.370\n>> I don't think so,\nthey have no sense of humor.\n\n469\n00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:54.600\nBut they do make good products, and\n\n470\n00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.110\nwe need to make sure we\nknow how to work it, so.\n\n471\n00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:01.930\nPhone Companion is basically a way that I\ncan synchronize information from my phone,\n\n472\n00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:07.100\nmy portable device, back over to my,\nsay, my laptop or something like that.\n\n473\n00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.260\nIf I want to transfer photos, I might\nuse my phone, I'm out in the field.\n\n474\n00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.130\nI'm taking pictures of the,\nlet's say I'm an insurance adjuster and\n\n475\n00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.010\nI'm taking pictures of\ndamage at a location.\n\n476\n00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:20.320\nWhen I get back,\nI've gotta get those over to my PC so\n\n477\n00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.580\nthat I can fill out my paperwork and\nsubmit this stuff.\n\n478\n00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.910\nSo I need to be able to get that\ninformation back and forth.\n\n479\n00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:30.781\nOr when I'm on the My Computer, you know,\nI've got emails or I've got documents that\n\n480\n00:23:30.781 --> 00:23:34.030\nare giving me information about the claim\nthat I'm getting ready to go check out.\n\n481\n00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.920\nAnd I've got to get that to my phone for\nwhen I go out on the field.\n\n482\n00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.360\nSo different scenarios that I'm\nsure you can think of may yourself,\n\n483\n00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.420\nwhy I need to get information from\nmy phone to my PC or vice versa.\n\n484\n00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.760\nThe Phone Companion makes it pretty easy.\n\n485\n00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.470\nWindows 10 is actually,\nit supports the different phones,\n\n486\n00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:55.243\nthe Windows 10 phone, the Android phones,\nthe iPhones, your Apple phones.\n\n487\n00:23:55.243 --> 00:23:57.298\nSo pretty flexible with that.\n\n488\n00:23:57.298 --> 00:24:01.253\nWhat we're gonna do here, I'm gonna try to\nshow you, or I'm gonna show you What it\n\n489\n00:24:01.253 --> 00:24:04.531\nlooks like, I've got a little\nWindows 10 phone sitting here, and\n\n490\n00:24:04.531 --> 00:24:08.110\nI'm gonna show you what happens when\nwe plug it in to a Windows 10 device.\n\n491\n00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:11.461\nSo here we go, keep your fingers\ncrossed that it doesn't blow up.\n\n492\n00:24:11.461 --> 00:24:12.702\nKidding.\n[LAUGH]\n\n493\n00:24:12.702 --> 00:24:13.202\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n494\n00:24:13.202 --> 00:24:15.071\n>> We're gonna plug that guy in, and\n\n495\n00:24:15.071 --> 00:24:19.400\nit's going to recognize my phone, as soon\nas I connect it to the right machine.\n\n496\n00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.950\nSo now the phone is being plugged in.\n\n497\n00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.320\nAnd usually I'll get a little pop up,\nthere we go.\n\n498\n00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.670\nChoose or tap to choose what happens.\n\n499\n00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.100\nAnd I'm going to choose my good\nold phone companion up here.\n\n500\n00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.370\nAnd that's going to launch the app.\n\n501\n00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:40.370\nNow it is important that this app,\nwhen you're doing this,\n\n502\n00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:44.870\neverything nowadays is tied\ninto your Microsoft account so\n\n503\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.250\nyou really need to have Internet\naccess when you're setting this up.\n\n504\n00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.000\nYou need to be logged in\nwith a Microsoft account.\n\n505\n00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.630\nSo you can see down here at the bottom,\nWindows Phone.\n\n506\n00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:59.350\nIt's showing me my charge status,\nhow much data I have,\n\n507\n00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.230\nhow much I have available, my SD card, and\n\n508\n00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:06.190\nit gives me the ability to move some\nof these files and folders manually.\n\n509\n00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.210\nI'm going to hide this for a second.\n\n510\n00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:11.700\nCuz you can see that I also get\nthe option to work with other phones.\n\n511\n00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.960\nGet what you love from your\nPC on your Android, right?\n\n512\n00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.860\nSo I can come in here and\n\n513\n00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:21.800\nI could go through the process of getting\npictures off of my Android phone.\n\n514\n00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.500\nWe'll jump back out to\nthe main screen here.\n\n515\n00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.140\nAnd there you can see we've got\nthe options for Windows, for Android,\n\n516\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:28.930\nfor iPhone or iPad.\n\n517\n00:25:30.825 --> 00:25:32.030\nBut, says I've got a Windows phone.\n\n518\n00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:36.080\nAnd it's really good to go, there\nreally is no setup for a Windows phone.\n\n519\n00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.294\nI don't have to do anything,\nit already understands everything.\n\n520\n00:25:39.294 --> 00:25:41.131\nIf it was an Android or an iPhone,\n\n521\n00:25:41.131 --> 00:25:45.280\nthat's when I'm going to have to go\nthrough this process of setting it up.\n\n522\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:51.370\nGetting started on pictures, back and\nforth to my Android device or my iPhone.\n\n523\n00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:54.002\nSo, either one you've got,\nwhatever your user has.\n\n524\n00:25:54.002 --> 00:25:57.201\nThey're just going to walk through\nthe process of going through these little\n\n525\n00:25:57.201 --> 00:25:58.340\ngetting started wizards.\n\n526\n00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.420\nSo, if you need to help them do that,\nor walk them through that.\n\n527\n00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:05.330\nThat's all there, and\nthey've really made it pretty simple.\n\n528\n00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:08.340\nIt tells you exactly where to\ngo on the phone, what to touch,\n\n529\n00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.870\nmake sure you're logged in.\n\n530\n00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.250\nIt walks you through the entire process.\n\n531\n00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:17.135\nAs far as my phone goes, my Windows\n10 phone, I can do things manually.\n\n532\n00:26:17.135 --> 00:26:22.169\nJust going to open my photos app and\nI can see the pictures.\n\n533\n00:26:22.169 --> 00:26:23.502\nOh, and they disappeared.\n\n534\n00:26:23.502 --> 00:26:25.378\nIt just wiped all\nthe pictures off my phone.\n\n535\n00:26:25.378 --> 00:26:29.524\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] If I now go over to my photos,\n\n536\n00:26:29.524 --> 00:26:31.961\nlet's see what we got.\n\n537\n00:26:31.961 --> 00:26:33.610\nAnd not my pictures here.\n\n538\n00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.230\nThat's something you'll\nhave to get used to, right.\n\n539\n00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.060\nThis is all cloud based.\n\n540\n00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.790\nIt's all through One Drive.\n\n541\n00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.990\nSo I'm gonna go to my\npictures in my One Drive.\n\n542\n00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:44.940\nThere's my camera roll, and\nsure enough, there's my pictures.\n\n543\n00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:50.360\nSo we can see Jason hard at work,\nDaniel hard at work, right?\n\n544\n00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.730\nThese were on my One Drive so\nnow I can get to them from anywhere.\n\n545\n00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:57.380\nAnywhere, any machine that I go and\nlog onto with my account.\n\n546\n00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.780\nI can jump up there to One Drive,\nand I can grab those pictures.\n\n547\n00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.930\nAnd as I take more pictures,\nthey should automatically be synced,\n\n548\n00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:07.900\nin fact if I can try to\ngrab a new photo here.\n\n549\n00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:09.670\n>> You going to take a selfie?\n\n550\n00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:10.669\n>> I'm going to take a selfie.\n\n551\n00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:13.837\nLet me take a selfie.\n\n552\n00:27:13.837 --> 00:27:15.961\n>> Let's watch Mike turn\ninto a 13-year-old girl.\n\n553\n00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:18.669\n>> No we don't want to take a video of me,\nthat's for sure.\n\n554\n00:27:21.461 --> 00:27:22.210\nCome on good old Windows phone.\n\n555\n00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:22.710\nThere we go.\n\n556\n00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.197\n>> I've seen you take pictures\nwith this before Micheal.\n\n557\n00:27:26.197 --> 00:27:28.380\n[LAUGH]\n>> You would think it wouldn't be that\n\n558\n00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:28.940\ndifficult.\n\n559\n00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.508\nOh, that's right this Windows\nphone does not have a-\n\n560\n00:27:31.508 --> 00:27:32.544\n>> Forward facing camera.\n\n561\n00:27:32.544 --> 00:27:33.680\n>> Forward facing camera.\n\n562\n00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:38.360\nSo we'll get Jason again,\nhard at work over there.\n\n563\n00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:46.060\nSo I take that picture and\nnow that is on my phone and we'll see.\n\n564\n00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.030\nIt might take a minute.\n\n565\n00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:50.120\nThe only thing about this\nis it might not be instant.\n\n566\n00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:54.260\nIt might take a minute for\nit to actually get up to the cloud.\n\n567\n00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.800\nSo let's see if I can refresh.\n\n568\n00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:01.790\nSee if it jumps up there.\n\n569\n00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.543\nSo [SOUND].\n\n570\n00:28:04.543 --> 00:28:08.579\n>> Regardless, though, eventually these\nphotos, they are syncing together, so\n\n571\n00:28:08.579 --> 00:28:12.496\nobviously this is going into the Internet,\nso it might take a minute or two, but\n\n572\n00:28:12.496 --> 00:28:14.680\nbasically that's what we're looking at.\n\n573\n00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.580\nI took a picture with my phone,\nI take an audio file with my phone.\n\n574\n00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.820\nWhatever it is I'm syncing up is going\nto eventually sync into that cloud and\n\n575\n00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.140\nshow up, because that's what we wanna do.\n\n576\n00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:28.380\nWe wanna save it to a device,\nbasically cloud storage so\n\n577\n00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.600\nthat I have access to it regardless\nof what device i'm using.\n\n578\n00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:36.020\nAs long as I have access to OneDrive or\nwhatever it is i'm syncing to right Mike?\n\n579\n00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:40.510\n>> Exactly, so eventually this is\ngonna show up and it'll pop up there,\n\n580\n00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:44.010\nit can't really control internet\ncongestion and things like that\n\n581\n00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.360\nWe might not want to wait for it, but\nyou see how easy it is to set up.\n\n582\n00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.920\nAnd the other ones\nare not that bad either.\n\n583\n00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.230\nIf I go to Android, and\nI say, get started.\n\n584\n00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:56.650\nI don't really have an Android phone,\nit's gonna make sure I'm logged in, so\n\n585\n00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:00.950\nI'll say yes this is me, and then it'll\nwalk you through the process, right.\n\n586\n00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:05.668\nYou type in your email address here,\nin fact, I'll go ahead and show you guys.\n\n587\n00:29:05.668 --> 00:29:15.668\nITpro_test@outlook.com.\n\n588\n00:29:19.127 --> 00:29:23.940\nClick on, so I can see my pictures,\nanyway, so I walk through the process.\n\n589\n00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.370\nOh, it's gonna send me my, give me\naccess to the app so I can download it.\n\n590\n00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:29.740\nBut it's that simple.\n\n591\n00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.890\nIt's gonna actually walk you through each\nstep of the process, we would just click\n\n592\n00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:39.660\nnext, yes I'm signed into OneDrive on\nmy device, whatever that might be.\n\n593\n00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.002\nAnd then because it's an Android,\nit knows where the menu is.\n\n594\n00:29:43.002 --> 00:29:46.440\nIt says select the Menu button,\nthe little horizontal bars up there, and\n\n595\n00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.370\nthen select Settings at the bottom.\n\n596\n00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:51.060\nGo to camera upload and\nmake sure it's turned on.\n\n597\n00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.170\nI tell it, yes, I turned it on.\n\n598\n00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:54.080\nI click, Next.\n\n599\n00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.200\nAnd that's it, I'm done.\n\n600\n00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.700\nIt was that easy.\n\n601\n00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.040\nNow I could go back and say, all right,\n\n602\n00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:05.460\nI also want to sync music from my\nPC to my little Android device.\n\n603\n00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.440\nSo, I just walk through these guys and\nset them up.\n\n604\n00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.810\nCouldn't be much easier.\n\n605\n00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.290\nAnd then once you do that,\nyou only have to do that once.\n\n606\n00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:13.710\nThen every time you plug your phone in,\n\n607\n00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:15.690\nit can take care of syncing\nthose files for you.\n\n608\n00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:17.530\n>> Yeah,\nthis is a very nice piece of software.\n\n609\n00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.760\nThis is something we've actually\nbecome used to in today's day and\n\n610\n00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.160\nage to be honest with you.\n\n611\n00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.800\nI mean Apple really started the whole\ntrend with the Itunes and their Iphone.\n\n612\n00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.180\nThen Microsoft said, hey, you know what?\n\n613\n00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.490\nWe can do that too.\n\n614\n00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:32.440\nNow it not only supports Windows\nphones but it supports Android and\n\n615\n00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.548\nApple phones as well.\n\n616\n00:30:33.548 --> 00:30:38.530\nSo it doesn't matter what platform you're\nusing you can use the phone companion\n\n617\n00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:39.595\nto manage that device.\n\n618\n00:30:39.595 --> 00:30:41.240\nThat's a very, very nice feature.\n\n619\n00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.130\nI've used quite a few of the different\ntype of phone managing software, and\n\n620\n00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.270\nthat one seems fairly straightforward and\nsimple.\n\n621\n00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:48.120\n>> It really is.\n\n622\n00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.590\nIt's a lot better than what we\nused to have to do in the past and\n\n623\n00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.740\nset up these sync relationships and\nall this stuff.\n\n624\n00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.430\nThis is pretty much automatic.\n\n625\n00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:56.770\n>> Yes.\nVery, very cool.\n\n626\n00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:57.660\nAll right, Mike.\n\n627\n00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.910\nI'm looking over our notes and\nhave we covered everything already?\n\n628\n00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:02.140\n>> You know, I think we did.\n\n629\n00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:02.850\n>> Well, awesome.\n\n630\n00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.840\nI hope you guys have enjoyed this episode.\n\n631\n00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.877\nWe thank you for watching.\n\n632\n00:31:05.877 --> 00:31:08.044\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n633\n00:31:08.044 --> 00:31:09.790\nI've been your host Daniel Lawry.\n\n634\n00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:10.669\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n635\n00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:14.836\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n636\n00:31:14.836 --> 00:31:18.080\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.310\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.540\nHere with me, as usual, is none other than\nwell Ronnie Wong, how's it going Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.700\n>> It is going great.\n\n6\n00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.670\nWe are taking a look again\ninto Windows 10 devices,\n\n7\n00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.690\nmaking sure that we understand\nhow to configure them and\n\n8\n00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.770\ntoday we're gonna talk about well updates\nmore than anything else that happens\n\n9\n00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.375\ninside of the business world, updates\nare incredibly critical in today's world,\n\n10\n00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:42.185\nespecially on laptops and of course even\non mobile devices that we have out there.\n\n11\n00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:45.625\nSo it is essential that you and\nI have some system of updating.\n\n12\n00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:48.485\nNow, we're not really getting into\nthe automatic updates that are found in\n\n13\n00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:48.995\nWindows 10.\n\n14\n00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:51.310\nWe will have a whole\nseparate show on that.\n\n15\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.830\nBut what we wanna talk about is\nspecifically dealing with Intune and\n\n16\n00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.890\nthe way that Intune can help\nyou to manage updates for\n\n17\n00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.840\nyour organization,\nbecause it is so essential.\n\n18\n00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.110\nThe reality of updates are fairly simple.\n\n19\n00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.305\nIf we allow the end users inside\nof our systems to do the updates\n\n20\n00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:08.725\nwhen they choose, right?\n\n21\n00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:12.455\nWe do get annoyed when we see that\nlittle warning, notification,\n\n22\n00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:13.345\nI can't remember what it's called.\n\n23\n00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:17.425\nThe little bubble that pops up that says,\nhey updates and pending or restart,\n\n24\n00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:20.320\nand it's going to restart in 10 minutes or\nwhatever it might be.\n\n25\n00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.350\nAnd a lot of times,\nyou can just keep delaying it.\n\n26\n00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.070\nYou keep working and it pops up again.\n\n27\n00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.720\nYou just keep delaying it.\n\n28\n00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.650\nAnd then, you just ignore it after a while\nand that's what ends up happening.\n\n29\n00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.460\nAnd now, it's two, three days later and\n\n30\n00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.100\nthere might have been an incredible\nsecurity bug that's been out there.\n\n31\n00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.870\nOr some vulnerability that now that\nsystem has actually remained unpatched.\n\n32\n00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.062\nNow inside of your own organization\nwell what do we tend to\n\n33\n00:01:45.062 --> 00:01:50.362\nrely on in the Microsoft world\nis something that we call W,\n\n34\n00:01:50.362 --> 00:01:54.796\nWS WSUS which is\nthe Windows Server Update System\n\n35\n00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:58.817\n[CROSSTALK] yeah whatever\nit might be [LAUGH].\n\n36\n00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:01.627\nWhatever I'm gonna mangle it\nthis being that what this is,\n\n37\n00:02:01.627 --> 00:02:05.920\nit's Windows Services Update Server I\nthink is what it's actually called here.\n\n38\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.600\nSo that system is designed so\nthat inside your organization,\n\n39\n00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.480\nit's only going to go to that\ntype of server to update.\n\n40\n00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.200\nAnd that means that you\ncan control those updates.\n\n41\n00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.550\nSomebody can't just pick and\nchoose what updates.\n\n42\n00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.620\nYou pick and choose what\nupdates are actually out there.\n\n43\n00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.040\nWorks incredibly well.\n\n44\n00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.260\nThere's a lot of organizations\nthat depend on it, and\n\n45\n00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.520\nthey love it because it works\nthe way that they want it to work.\n\n46\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.810\nBut, what about those\ndevices though Daniel?\n\n47\n00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.310\nThe ones, all of a sudden,\nwe have a laptop and\n\n48\n00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.720\nwe send it out with\nsomebody into the world.\n\n49\n00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.270\nThey're no longer really a part\nof my active directory domain.\n\n50\n00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.010\nDoes the WSUS server\nreally help with that?\n\n51\n00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.770\n>> Not at all.\n\n52\n00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.330\nNot at all.\n\n53\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.060\nAnd here's why,\n\n54\n00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.540\nbecause The WSQS server only works with\ninside your active directory domain.\n\n55\n00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.690\nIt's kind of what Ronnie was eluding to.\n\n56\n00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.590\nIf I've got a user that's got a device and\nit's not connected to that\n\n57\n00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.550\nactive directory domain, even if it is\na part of it it might not be there.\n\n58\n00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.480\nIt might be out on the road,\nthey've got a user, he's a road guy.\n\n59\n00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.750\nHe's going from state to state doing\ncertain things for our business.\n\n60\n00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.450\nHe's not actively checking in with our\nWSUS server, and that's a problem.\n\n61\n00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.920\nNow we do set that to just\ncheck with Microsoft.\n\n62\n00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.520\nIf you can't check in\nwith the WSUS server,\n\n63\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.760\nyou can check in with Microsoft,\nbut here is where the problem lies.\n\n64\n00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.720\nI check in with Microsoft Microsoft says,\n\n65\n00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.660\nhere's all the updates that you need\nto download and install and it does it.\n\n66\n00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.600\nBut what if one of those updates\nis something that breaks one of\n\n67\n00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.050\nthe things that we do\ninside of our business.\n\n68\n00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.210\nNow he might be fine while he's on the\nroad, but as soon as he comes back in to\n\n69\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.450\nthe house and back into our own\nenvironment he's gonna have a problem.\n\n70\n00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.180\nNow that update's gonna\ncause him an issue.\n\n71\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.680\nHow can I stop that from happening?\n\n72\n00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.540\nWhat can I do?\n\n73\n00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.560\nThat's where Intune steps in.\n\n74\n00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.830\nAllows me to continually manage those\nupdates for devices that are not connected\n\n75\n00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.980\nto my active directory domain,\nor in a network where that is.\n\n76\n00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.850\nGives me a lot of flexibility and\n\n77\n00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.530\nthat's why system administrators\nlove stuff like this.\n\n78\n00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.720\n>> Right, with the idea of Intune right?\n\n79\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.940\nRegardless of whether they are inside\nof my active directory domain, or\n\n80\n00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.900\nwherever they are on the planet,\nif those machines are being managed\n\n81\n00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.030\nby InTune I then can\nalso control the updates.\n\n82\n00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.910\nRemember that everybody doesn't\nnecessarily love updates and even though\n\n83\n00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.620\nthey might want them, they could be\nin the middle of doing something or\n\n84\n00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.310\nif it's like what Daniel was saying,\nthey're traveling.\n\n85\n00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.840\nThey spend, let's say, six hours traveling\nand then they get to the hotel room and\n\n86\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.260\nthey turn it on, and they're still trying\nto do work, and they don't update it.\n\n87\n00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.930\nAnd then three weeks later they\ncome back onto the network, and\n\n88\n00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.450\nyou're like, wait a minute, your\nmachine hasn't updated in three weeks?\n\n89\n00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.010\nWhat have you been doing?\n\n90\n00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.165\nAnd you just kind of realize\nthat stuff like that can happen.\n\n91\n00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:38.145\nWell, instead, remember that within\nthe Intune, though, you can configure and\n\n92\n00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:40.445\nmanage updates, and\nthat's what we want to show you.\n\n93\n00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:42.835\nSo, on my computer,\nI went ahead and launched in, and\n\n94\n00:04:42.835 --> 00:04:47.032\nmade sure I logged into the admin\nconsole of Windows Intune and\n\n95\n00:04:47.032 --> 00:04:51.382\non the left hand side I selected\nthe icon that says updates, right?\n\n96\n00:04:51.382 --> 00:04:54.672\nSo whether you're on a Windows 10 computer\nor not, right, you can always go into\n\n97\n00:04:54.672 --> 00:04:58.705\nIntune and you can see these updates and\nwhat you can do with them.\n\n98\n00:04:58.705 --> 00:05:01.012\nSo, I want to show you a couple\nof them and we'll go back and\n\n99\n00:05:01.012 --> 00:05:02.422\ntalk about configuring updates and\n\n100\n00:05:02.422 --> 00:05:05.898\nyou can see where it's actually\na nice little icon for us over here.\n\n101\n00:05:05.898 --> 00:05:09.670\nSo Windows Intune, once you connect and\nit knows updates are fairly important.\n\n102\n00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.870\nSo notice it says all updates right here,\nokay.\n\n103\n00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.090\nSo if I select all updates and\nI take a look and\n\n104\n00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.480\nsee, there's a thousand plus right here\nDaniel, that's a ton of different updates.\n\n105\n00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.880\nBut I'm also starting to\nsee things like XP updates.\n\n106\n00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.570\nWonder what Vista updates.\n\n107\n00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.960\nI'm not running Vista XP,\nI'm running Windows 10.\n\n108\n00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.770\nWhat in the world is this about?\n\n109\n00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.400\nWell, it's because it says I'm connected\nto the actual real Microsoft Updates\n\n110\n00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.570\nserver, and right now it doesn't know\nwhat to do, so it grabbed everything.\n\n111\n00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.290\nCuz it doesn't know systems you're gonna\nhave involved in Windows InTune, so\n\n112\n00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.650\nit says, let me just go ahead and\nbe ready for all of them.\n\n113\n00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.080\nAnd so it grabs them all, and\nin that sense the problem is,\n\n114\n00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.570\nthat's too much, right?\n\n115\n00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.340\nWe don't really want anything like that.\n\n116\n00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.720\nSo I can filter it down to just\ncritical updates if I want to,\n\n117\n00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.660\nand remember that these are actually\ncritical to the operation of your system.\n\n118\n00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.800\nAnd so if there is something that actually\nis broken this is what you normally\n\n119\n00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.160\nwant to do, and you can see where again\nit actually starts with Intune, or\n\n120\n00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.860\nnot Intune, XP, and goes on to Vista and\ncontinues to do that.\n\n121\n00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.500\nBut, really more important for\n\n122\n00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.117\nthe majority of us is going\nto be these security updates.\n\n123\n00:06:14.117 --> 00:06:18.780\nRemember that security updates are really\nabout helping us to patch vulnerabilities\n\n124\n00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.620\nthat exist on our system, or\nwhere there's a discovered vulnerability.\n\n125\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.880\nThese updates are really what we are more\nconcerned about when you start seeing it.\n\n126\n00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.590\nSo, notice that this actually\nis from February of 2002,\n\n127\n00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.320\nbut you actually start seeing that there\nis a lot more that's available there and\n\n128\n00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.720\nso as you go on through you can\nactually see all those too.\n\n129\n00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.440\nAnd then of course definitions,\nservice packs, update rollups and\n\n130\n00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.720\neven mandatory updates that you\ncan make them mandatory and\n\n131\n00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.010\nsometimes you may even see\nnon Microsoft updates.\n\n132\n00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.230\nYou're probably not going to see them\nright here in our screen because we\n\n133\n00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.160\ndon't really have any non Microsoft\nsoftware operating on my computer.\n\n134\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.110\nBut if I do and that system for\n\n135\n00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.820\nupdating is actually out there well Intune\ncan also manage those for us as well.\n\n136\n00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.700\nSo how in the world does it do it for\nyour company and for what you need to do?\n\n137\n00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.890\nSo as just a kind of high level\noverview of what can happen here right,\n\n138\n00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.110\nis that what we want to do is right here.\n\n139\n00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.250\nWe selected overview, and\n\n140\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.020\nover here on the right hand side\nwhere it says configure updates, now,\n\n141\n00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.390\nI can add in my own updates if I want to,\nso if I have my own proprietary software\n\n142\n00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.060\nthat now they've sent me that company\nsays, hey this is a critical patch that\n\n143\n00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.250\nneeds to be pushed out to those devices\nI can add those updates right here.\n\n144\n00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.110\nAnd notice it says I can then\ndeploy them to the devices.\n\n145\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.460\nSo I can select configure updates instead.\n\n146\n00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.130\nSo if I had those in\nthere I could do that but\n\n147\n00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.440\nI actually want to configure\nwhat happens here.\n\n148\n00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.480\nSo here I do have to make some choices,\nproduct category.\n\n149\n00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.211\nSo do I want it for everything or\nam I actually trying to add or\n\n150\n00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:48.020\nmake sure that I monitor for\nsomething specific.\n\n151\n00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.950\nNotice it gives me active directory,\n\n152\n00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.380\nrights management,\nI can use the Antigen server or ASP.NET.\n\n153\n00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.070\nBing, I don't know why I would\never do that, but, I'm joking.\n\n154\n00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.620\nEverybody loves Bing.\n\n155\n00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.159\n>> You kid the Microsoft, right?\n\n156\n00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:02.530\n>> [LAUGH] I do.\n\n157\n00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.310\nIt is so intuitive, yeah.\n\n158\n00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.380\nDeveloper tools, you name it,\nand I can scroll down here and\n\n159\n00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.020\nsee there's exchange server, you name it.\n\n160\n00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.950\nThere's a ton of different updates, and\nthese are all based on Microsoft products,\n\n161\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.970\nand so what I'm gonna do is\nscroll down here and look for\n\n162\n00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.260\nthe Windows stuff is what I'm gonna do,\napparently not fast enough.\n\n163\n00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.720\nThere's some System Center.\n\n164\n00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.020\nThere's the Virtual Machine Manager\nstuff too.\n\n165\n00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.160\nSo you can see where you\ncan actually add that in.\n\n166\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.750\nAnd there it is, I'm finally down to where\nI want to go, which is let's say Windows.\n\n167\n00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.380\nAnd if I'm really looking out for\nWindows 10, notice I can go ahead and\n\n168\n00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.040\njust select those.\n\n169\n00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.420\nLet me just select all\nthe Windows 10 stuff.\n\n170\n00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.030\nAt least some of them.\n\n171\n00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:39.970\nIf I want to.\n\n172\n00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:44.570\nI don't worry about language pacts so\nmuch as well, but let's just do those.\n\n173\n00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.720\nThe most common ones I have.\n\n174\n00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.700\nSo I can select that product\ncategory just for Windows 10.\n\n175\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.250\nIf I know that I have Windows 8 and\n8.1 stuff I might go ahead and\n\n176\n00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.150\ndo that too but let's just select\nthe ones for windows 10 and\n\n177\n00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.950\nthen I can click save at this point and\nmake sure that I save that category.\n\n178\n00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.900\nAnd then I can scroll down and\n\n179\n00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.520\nwhat I'm doing is filtering right I'm\njust saying hey what's really going to be\n\n180\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.260\nwhat I need to do if I'm not really\nconcerned about features or tools or\n\n181\n00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.320\nupdates there, well I actually want to\nmake sure, or just regular updates.\n\n182\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.140\nI can just accept the critical and\nthe security and definition.\n\n183\n00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.290\nI would at least do that as a minimum.\n\n184\n00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.000\nOkay.\n\n185\n00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.090\nService packs right now for Windows 10,\nprobably not so much so, but the very fact\n\n186\n00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.940\nis that in the future it may be\nsomething we want to be concerned about.\n\n187\n00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.290\nTo insure that when people do log in and\nIntune realizes that hey that\n\n188\n00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.630\nWindows 10 instance at that point in\ntime doesn't have the service pack,\n\n189\n00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.200\nit can also do stuff like that too.\n\n190\n00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.520\nThen we can scroll on down,\nI like hitting save after everything.\n\n191\n00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.280\nSometimes, I don't know,\n\n192\n00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.380\nI just like hitting save and\nmaking sure those are actually approved.\n\n193\n00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.890\nAnd then from that point here it is,\nthe automatic approval rules, and\n\n194\n00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.450\nthis is actually fairly key for us too.\n\n195\n00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.600\nCreate rules to automatically\napprove updates.\n\n196\n00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.350\nNew automatic approvals will\napply to future updates, only.\n\n197\n00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.040\nSo this is where it's key, right?\n\n198\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.970\nWhen we select this, and\nthen we actually create it later on.\n\n199\n00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.360\nIt's actually gonna apply to\nwhat's future, coming in.\n\n200\n00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.300\nSo I can then select a new one,\nand just put, Windows 10.\n\n201\n00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:18.010\nWindows 10 updates, as my rule.\n\n202\n00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.760\nAnd from that point on, there it is.\n\n203\n00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.870\nYou can actually go ahead and select\nwhat's actually gonna be approved there.\n\n204\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.250\nSo I'd go on through and\ncreate those, too.\n\n205\n00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.130\nAnd let's see, apparently I\nscrolled past them is what I did.\n\n206\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:36.385\nWindows 8.0 and there's RT.\n\n207\n00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:39.185\nAnd of course this is neat right?\n\n208\n00:10:39.185 --> 00:10:40.405\nThat 10 comes before 7 and 8.\n\n209\n00:10:40.405 --> 00:10:43.598\nOf course,\neverybody would actually think that.\n\n210\n00:10:43.598 --> 00:10:47.698\nSo you can actually do stuff like that\nas well if you were taking a look at\n\n211\n00:10:47.698 --> 00:10:52.514\nthose classifications and let's go ahead\nand select critical and definitions.\n\n212\n00:10:52.514 --> 00:10:53.222\n>> Security.\n\n213\n00:10:53.222 --> 00:10:56.392\n>> Security, why security, no that's fine.\n\n214\n00:10:56.392 --> 00:10:57.599\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Security and\n\n215\n00:10:57.599 --> 00:10:59.690\neven update rollups if you need to.\n\n216\n00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.780\nNow you might be wondering why\nin the heck would I do that.\n\n217\n00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.230\nWell, remember that sometimes it could\ntake a lot of updates, Windows can.\n\n218\n00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.560\nI think Daniel and I, there was one day\nwhere I was running Windows 8.1 and\n\n219\n00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.880\nall of the sudden in the middle of\nthat it actually started rebooting.\n\n220\n00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.439\nIt said, installing one of 175 updates.\n\n221\n00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.290\n>> That's not good.\n\n222\n00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:18.190\nSo I, apparently,\n\n223\n00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:22.390\nhad a very old Windows 8.1 machine that I\nwas rolling around with, 175 updates that\n\n224\n00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.500\nwere waiting around and saying, oh Ronnie,\nhow dare you lecture me about updates?\n\n225\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.530\nYou're right, I shouldn't have done that.\n\n226\n00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.610\nBut yes,\nsometimes it does happen that way,\n\n227\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.710\nso you don't want that of course,\nhappening.\n\n228\n00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.090\nNow, this is where you\ncan get very specific.\n\n229\n00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:39.020\nSo we were talking about this before\nthe show, can Intune really help us to\n\n230\n00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.080\nreally be categorically distributed\nthe way that we want to.\n\n231\n00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.700\nSure it can.\nNotice that I can select all the devices\n\n232\n00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.270\nor even the mobile devices.\n\n233\n00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.570\nIf I had more groups\navailable on this computer,\n\n234\n00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.430\nI could actually add that in as well.\n\n235\n00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:56.410\nBut for right now, since I don't, I can\nclick add, and this is also another key,\n\n236\n00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.300\ntoo, is down here toward the bottom.\n\n237\n00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.430\nIt says, enforce installation deadline.\n\n238\n00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.510\nSo that way, it's not that they can\nactually just go, I don't care.\n\n239\n00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.701\nAfter a while, it's just going to go\nahead and do that, and that should say,\n\n240\n00:12:07.701 --> 00:12:08.830\nhey here's the deadline,\n\n241\n00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.950\nby what time you actually have to\nhave all this stuff installed.\n\n242\n00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.860\nSpecified deadline may result\nin the computer reboots.\n\n243\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.870\nAnd that's also something\nthat's critical as well.\n\n244\n00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.900\nSo if you want to enforce that\nyou simply select that, and\n\n245\n00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.040\nthen you can select well\nhow long you want to be in.\n\n246\n00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.450\nSo, you might not select 14 days,\nbut, probably, within 7 days or\n\n247\n00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.380\nso is probably a good thing.\n\n248\n00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.110\nAnd then Daniel's actually said, no way.\n\n249\n00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.463\nDaniel says, what, one day?\n\n250\n00:12:30.463 --> 00:12:32.344\n>> Yeah, I'm a one day kind of guy.\n\n251\n00:12:32.344 --> 00:12:36.904\nI think the IT department should be\nruling everything in its domain wiith\n\n252\n00:12:36.904 --> 00:12:37.810\nan iron fist.\n\n253\n00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.800\nIf you don't install those updates,\ngoodness, we're going to do it for you.\n\n254\n00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.030\nBecause, think about it,\n\n255\n00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.690\ncritical security updates, they need\nto be applied as soon as possible.\n\n256\n00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.830\nThere are such things out there\nas zero day exploits, and\n\n257\n00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.340\nwe don't want to have our\nsystems vulnerable to that.\n\n258\n00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.940\nNow, I know you'll probably get into\na nice fit with your users and/or your\n\n259\n00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:00.930\nmanagement going, I can't have this,\nI need to have time to not reboot\n\n260\n00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.300\nmy computer, and you'll probably make some\nconcessions here and there, but as a rule,\n\n261\n00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.020\nI generally start with most restrictive,\nthe most oppressive policies,\n\n262\n00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.140\nand then as people complain, I start\nto pull back on the reins a little bit.\n\n263\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.780\n>> So, on my computer what we're actually\nseeing now is we are ready to go ahead and\n\n264\n00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:18.970\napprove the update.\n\n265\n00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.940\nWe've got everything done and\nI just click next.\n\n266\n00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.810\nAnd it's given me a summary,\n\n267\n00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:25.190\nnow this is fairly important even though\nI tend to skip this a lot of times.\n\n268\n00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:29.510\nMake sure that these are the setting\nthat you really want to happen\n\n269\n00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.920\nwhen you actually go ahead and\nclick finish.\n\n270\n00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.050\nDon't get me wrong, you can go back in and\n\n271\n00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:36.190\nchange them if you choose to but over all\nthough it's always better to go ahead and\n\n272\n00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.760\nmake sure that it's really what you\nwant before you go ahead and apply it.\n\n273\n00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.290\nFrom that point there is the automatic\napproval and then we can save it.\n\n274\n00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.770\nAnd once again.\n\n275\n00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.880\nAnd then, of course, you can begin\nto run that update if you want to.\n\n276\n00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.010\nAnd that means you're now applying that,\nit sort of works as policy to\n\n277\n00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:58.085\napply it then to your organization or to\nwhat we've actually selected from there.\n\n278\n00:13:58.085 --> 00:14:04.595\nSo if I go to Groups, and then,\nonce I'm actually inside of Groups,\n\n279\n00:14:04.595 --> 00:14:08.485\nI can now see, hey, there's actually\na warning on one of these computers here.\n\n280\n00:14:08.485 --> 00:14:11.191\nSo let me go down to the Computers.\n\n281\n00:14:12.202 --> 00:14:14.002\nAnd let's see here too.\n\n282\n00:14:14.002 --> 00:14:16.942\nSo there's no issues for\nright now as far as the computers go, but\n\n283\n00:14:16.942 --> 00:14:18.592\nit's probably actually taking a look and\n\n284\n00:14:18.592 --> 00:14:20.592\nrealizing that there are some\nother things that are out there.\n\n285\n00:14:20.592 --> 00:14:23.342\nLet me go back to overview and\nsee what that little warning is about\n\n286\n00:14:23.342 --> 00:14:27.362\non the device alert and\nthat says, oh, look at that.\n\n287\n00:14:27.362 --> 00:14:30.932\nIn that update that I just pushed out,\nI only selected Windows 10, but\n\n288\n00:14:30.932 --> 00:14:34.670\nI know something in my organization\nhere on one of those computers.\n\n289\n00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.900\nAnd, if I go all right, so, it's\ntelling me that there's an alert here.\n\n290\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.920\nAnd, I select my computers,\nand I go to devices.\n\n291\n00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:43.180\nMaybe?\n\n292\n00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:43.880\nThere we go.\n\n293\n00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.870\nClick on it twice.\n\n294\n00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.970\n>> Web based interface.\n\n295\n00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:46.985\n>> Webface interfaces.\n\n296\n00:14:46.985 --> 00:14:48.160\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I can't.\n\n297\n00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.400\nI'm so impatient it's amazing.\n\n298\n00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.130\nI have that Windows 8.1 so\nI selected updates to apply and\n\n299\n00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.258\nit says,\nin that group that you selected, Ronnie,\n\n300\n00:14:56.258 --> 00:15:01.050\non the 8.1 computer and I can't push\nthose Windows 10 updates to that thing.\n\n301\n00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:05.720\nSo you can see where that\nreally does kinda limit you but\n\n302\n00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.520\nreally gives you some power that\nyou can also add in, as well.\n\n303\n00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.640\nSo from that point just take a look,\n\n304\n00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.230\nand a note here that there are all\nthese updates that are available.\n\n305\n00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.080\nNow, you don't have to do that,\nyou don't have to set a policy and\n\n306\n00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.640\ncreate it that way and make that\napproval if you had a particular update.\n\n307\n00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.430\nSo let's say that right now,\na security update came out and\n\n308\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.380\ni just realized I've deployed\nWindows 10 a couple of days ago, and\n\n309\n00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.430\nit's saying this is an important,\nit's a hotfix.\n\n310\n00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.540\nIt is something that will\nfix a zero-day attack.\n\n311\n00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.170\nWell, I don't have one of those right now.\n\n312\n00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:39.170\nBut let's say for an example, on this\nWindows 8.1 update, I can select that\n\n313\n00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.140\none individual one and just go ahead and\napprove it, if I wanted to.\n\n314\n00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.640\nAnd from that point, I can select the\ncomputers that are actually involved there\n\n315\n00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.522\nand then click Next.\n\n316\n00:15:47.522 --> 00:15:51.490\nNow, I could have made a group for\nthat, but then we can do that.\n\n317\n00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.320\nAll right.\nSo, I click Finish, and\n\n318\n00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.670\nnow it's actually going to get lined\nup for approval for that one computer.\n\n319\n00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.470\nSo, you can go ahead and\n\n320\n00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.950\nactually do one of those,\nan individual one-off, if you need to.\n\n321\n00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.520\nAnd even though you can do that,\nthat shouldn't be your standard practice.\n\n322\n00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.490\nLike everything else\ninside of management for\n\n323\n00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:11.600\nyour company, the idea is working with\ngroups is actually gonna be better.\n\n324\n00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.610\nSo even with that one computer,\n\n325\n00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.820\nit would probably have been better if I\nhad actually created a group out of it.\n\n326\n00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.930\nAnd that way as I add in more computers,\nI'm not having to go,\n\n327\n00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.190\nall right, that one has to do it too,\nthat one has to do it.\n\n328\n00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:22.900\nI just apply it to the entire group.\n\n329\n00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.790\nAnd then the updates once you\nget pushed out that way too.\n\n330\n00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.680\nSo just kinda realize you can work with\nall of that together to help you out.\n\n331\n00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.310\nSo we want to make sure that,\nthat you understand,\n\n332\n00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.810\nthat here's how we can actually\nunderstand some of these things.\n\n333\n00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.830\nHere's how we can actually\ncreate approvals for them.\n\n334\n00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.700\nWhether there's an individual or\nnot as well and so\n\n335\n00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.620\nyou can see all that right here underneath\nthe updates inside of Windows Intune so\n\n336\n00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.380\na lot of incredible features for\nus to be able to count on and\n\n337\n00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:51.330\nit can really help us to keep devices\nthat are part of my management,\n\n338\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.800\nregardless of where they are in the world,\nmore secure.\n\n339\n00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.510\n>> That's right.\n\n340\n00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.440\nSo, Ronnie, you've done a great job of\nshowing us how Intune uses updates and\n\n341\n00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.720\nhow we can apply updates.\n\n342\n00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.650\nFantastic demos.\n\n343\n00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:04.320\nHopefully you people out there\nare watching this and you're going man,\n\n344\n00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.520\nthis is a fantastic idea.\n\n345\n00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:11.230\nI can now update any of the computers\nthat are connected to my domain, or\n\n346\n00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.620\nnot connected to my domain anywhere\nwhere they're at, that's awesome.\n\n347\n00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.050\nRight?\nWe have that ability.\n\n348\n00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.940\nIntune is a really nice product.\n\n349\n00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.810\nHave we missed anything as far\nas this show goes, Ronnie?\n\n350\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:21.890\n>> I don't think so.\n\n351\n00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.740\nTo tell you the truth on Intune we've\nprobably actually hit just about\n\n352\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.610\neverything that we needed\nto to get ready for\n\n353\n00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:28.850\nthat exam which is what\nwe really want to do.\n\n354\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.220\nBut maybe this wets your whistle and\n\n355\n00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.550\nthat means that you go I want\nto find out more about it.\n\n356\n00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:37.860\nRemember that you can go and create\na test account just like what we did and\n\n357\n00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.220\npractice these things it's always\nbetter to get a little bit of hands on\n\n358\n00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.030\nIf you're unfamiliar with it.\n\n359\n00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:45.520\nEven if your company says, I'll never used\nIntune, well to get ready for the exam as\n\n360\n00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.370\npart of the exam process, so make sure you\ncreate that test account, take a look at\n\n361\n00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:54.120\nit, set up a little bit of test account,\nand get it ready to go and working.\n\n362\n00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.190\n>> It never hurts to add another\ntool to the toolbox, right?\n\n363\n00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.250\nYou never know when\nyou're gonna need that.\n\n364\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:17:59.880\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n365\n00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.150\nWell, guess we'll go ahead and\nwrap this episode up.\n\n366\n00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.300\nThanks for watching, everyone.\n\n367\n00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.540\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n368\n00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.060\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n369\n00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.966\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n370\n00:18:10.966 --> 00:18:14.670\n[SOUND]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.640\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.040\nHere with me today, well,\nnone other than Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.820\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.770\n>> It is going well.\n\n7\n00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.680\nIt's a great day to be right here\nas we continue to take a look at\n\n8\n00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.770\ntrying to configure Windows 10 devices.\n\n9\n00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.300\nAnd what we're taking a look at today\nis a technology that's actually a cloud\n\n10\n00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.680\ntechnology for us, designed to help\nus to manage, well, Windows devices.\n\n11\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.590\nSo remember that Windows 10 is\nreally designed around the concept\n\n12\n00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.070\nthat a single operating system regardless\nof the devices that you are on.\n\n13\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.560\nSo whether you're talking about laptop,\ndesktop, phone, or some type of\n\n14\n00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.960\ntablet like a Surface Pro tablet while\none operating system can unite them all.\n\n15\n00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.920\nIt is like the Lord of the Ring thing\nwhere one ring unites them all.\n\n16\n00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.570\nBut for us here, it's one operating system\nthat is trying to carry that through.\n\n17\n00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.010\nAnd so even though this cloud technology\nhas been around for a bit of time,\n\n18\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.920\nWindows 10 is supposed to be\ndesigned to integrate into it and\n\n19\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.760\nactually work fairly well with it,\nin other words, seamless.\n\n20\n00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.475\nSo everything that they've tried to\ndo with Windows 10, some of the pain\n\n21\n00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:21.175\npoints we had were migrating to later\noperating systems from earlier ones.\n\n22\n00:01:21.175 --> 00:01:24.335\nThey've tried to eliminate\nas much as possible and\n\n23\n00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:26.525\ntry to integrate it in with\nall of the technology.\n\n24\n00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:30.080\nNow just saying that, right,\nas of the recording right now.\n\n25\n00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.800\nThere are some things that work, there are\nsome things that don't exactly work 100%\n\n26\n00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.330\nwell, but we're going to show you at least\nthe technology that they're talking about.\n\n27\n00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.830\nAnd the reason why right\nis that in our world today,\n\n28\n00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.540\nremember that the business world is\nactually getting more and more devices.\n\n29\n00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.860\nAnd that means it's becoming\nmore difficult to manage.\n\n30\n00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.150\nDaniel you remember the days when you\nactually had users on your network and\n\n31\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.130\nwhen you did something\nlike that you really just,\n\n32\n00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.070\nwell here's your PC and that was it.\n\n33\n00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.800\nRight?\nThey worked it out at the office.\n\n34\n00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.050\nAt the end of the night they kinda\nsigned off and then that was it.\n\n35\n00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.010\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n36\n00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.000\nUnfortunately if I needed to make\na change what did I have to do?\n\n37\n00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.070\nKind of go over to their PC,\nimplement that change.\n\n38\n00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.830\nNow we do have awesome stuff like\nMicrosoft Active Directory, right?\n\n39\n00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.630\nThat did make our lives a whole lot\neasier, and we can push some changes\n\n40\n00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.701\nthrough that, but what if I have devices\nthat aren't part of my active directory.\n\n41\n00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:20.685\nThat comes with a problem.\n\n42\n00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:23.395\nThey still wanna bring\nin devices from home,\n\n43\n00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:25.725\nwhere we live in that BYOD environment.\n\n44\n00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:28.615\nThat Bring Your Own Device\nlevel of the world that we've\n\n45\n00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:32.260\nall grown accustomed to nowadays,\nit's making things a little more difficult\n\n46\n00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.020\nwhen it comes to making sure that those\ndevices are meeting maybe certain\n\n47\n00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.960\nrequirements that our\nnetwork needs to be on there.\n\n48\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.770\nWe don't want you to bringing in bad guys,\nwe wanna make sure you have the software\n\n49\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.530\nyou need, even if you're not\nconnected to our corporate network.\n\n50\n00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.760\nAnd that's where some of these device\nmanagement and management consoles come\n\n51\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.080\ninto play, specifically one that we're\ngoing to talk about today, right Ronnie?\n\n52\n00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.580\n>> Yep.\n\n53\n00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.440\nWith Windows Intune,\nthat is what is happening for\n\n54\n00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.855\nus is with this world which we have so\nmany devices that are out there and that\n\n55\n00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:04.895\nare available, we can't just lock down one\nmachine and think it's gonna be enough.\n\n56\n00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:08.155\nBecause we are bringing in things like\nsurface tablets, we are actually taking\n\n57\n00:03:08.155 --> 00:03:11.680\nlaptops and essentially assigning\nthem to people as well.\n\n58\n00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.850\nAnd even though they're syncing up,\n\n59\n00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.680\nremember that means that\nyour data is out there.\n\n60\n00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.190\nSo whatever your proprietary data is,\nit's out there.\n\n61\n00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.540\nAnd that means you have to be\nable to secure it some way.\n\n62\n00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.880\nAnd because they're taking these\nthings on the road with them,\n\n63\n00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.720\neven on business trips, remember that that\nmeans you now have a device out there with\n\n64\n00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.610\nyour company data and it could be secured,\nit may not be secured.\n\n65\n00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.480\nThe whole idea behind Windows Intune\nis to give you a management system and\n\n66\n00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.410\nyour company a management system that\nwill then allow of course that management\n\n67\n00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.720\nof those devices regardless of\nwhere they are on the planet.\n\n68\n00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.840\nSo whether they bring something\nlike a phone with them.\n\n69\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.920\nSo this one's a little Windows 10 phone or\nany actual phone like an Android or\n\n70\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.390\neven an iPhone if they\nwashi get connected and\n\n71\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.390\nuse Windows Intune you can manage those\ndevices as well, laptops that are on\n\n72\n00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.120\nthe go as well as even your business\nPCs inside of your networks too.\n\n73\n00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.250\nNow all that can be managed\nfrom this one portal.\n\n74\n00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.380\nIn those days that we were talking about\nright, Daniel would actually have to say\n\n75\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.690\noh, well yeah, we need to put that\nsoftware on your laptop Ronnie but you're\n\n76\n00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.810\nout on the road so next time you head in\nyou know so in about three weeks from now\n\n77\n00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.500\nwhen you come back in we'll be able to\ninstall that software on your computer.\n\n78\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.160\nWell by using Windows Intune you can\nactually ensure that it actually\n\n79\n00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.740\ngets installed on there.\n\n80\n00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.560\nAlso, of course, you can make sure that\nall of the kind of security things that\n\n81\n00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.470\nyou want, such as examining anti, or\n\n82\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.300\nmaking sure that antivirus is working and\nall that, it can also be done in Intune.\n\n83\n00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.870\nSo enough of just a [LAUGH]\nbasic description.\n\n84\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.730\nLet's go ahead and talk about the process\nand how this ends up working.\n\n85\n00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.220\nRemember that this is going\nto be a subscription.\n\n86\n00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.000\nIt's a cloud service, and\nyour company will of course pay for\n\n87\n00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.390\nthat, but once that actually\ngets going what you have to do,\n\n88\n00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.150\nof course, is get access to that login for\nWindows Intune.\n\n89\n00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.210\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my computer.\n\n90\n00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.530\nI went ahead and signed in a few times,\n\n91\n00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.620\njust making sure that everything\nactually works for us, but remember that\n\n92\n00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.080\nthere's actually gonna be two things that\nare really going to be a central for us.\n\n93\n00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.440\nOne, if you are going to be\nthe administrator, in other words,\n\n94\n00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.410\nif you're the one that's gonna be\nmanaging your Windows 10 devices or\n\n95\n00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.170\nyour Windows devices here, what's gonna\nhappen is you're actually gonna log in\n\n96\n00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.730\nin a little bit of a different site\nthan where everybody else logs in, and\n\n97\n00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.420\nwe'll show you that difference.\n\n98\n00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.610\nSo, of course when you log in you need\nto get access to the administration side\n\n99\n00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.360\nof Windows Intune, so that makes sense.\n\n100\n00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.230\nWhen everybody else logs in,\n\n101\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.020\nthey really are just trying to\nget connected to Intune, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.360\nSo on the administration side,\nlet me show you.\n\n103\n00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.429\nRight here, the way that you do this is\nthat there's actually going to be a URL\n\n104\n00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:44.454\nand we'll include this in our notes so\nyou don't have to try and scramble and\n\n105\n00:05:44.454 --> 00:05:45.177\nwrite this down.\n\n106\n00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:50.740\nIt's actually one that says\naccounts.manage.Microsoft.com.\n\n107\n00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.360\nI knows that's a long drawn out one and\nyou go, \"Oh no,\n\n108\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.600\nI can't write all that down.\n\n109\n00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.110\nDon't worry about it.\n\n110\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.810\nLike I said, we'll include it in the notes\nto make sure that you have access to it.\n\n111\n00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.430\nBut normally when you log in there, the\nstrange thing is it will bring you up to\n\n112\n00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.820\na page that looks exactly like this,\nand you'll go, okay, I don't see that.\n\n113\n00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.090\nAnd then when we talk about\nthe portal side, the company portal.\n\n114\n00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.150\nThat is where all of your other employees\nthat you're actually saying, hey,\n\n115\n00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.730\nwe're going to manage\nyour devices from here.\n\n116\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.150\nThis is where you're going to\nconnect to get connected in and\n\n117\n00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.730\ndo what you need to as well.\n\n118\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.620\nSo in this instance here.\n\n119\n00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.030\nWhen I log right, I see Microsoft Intune.\n\n120\n00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.170\nI've already logged in a couple of times\nand that's why I've already gone ahead and\n\n121\n00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.470\nset it up for me.\n\n122\n00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.240\nAnd I'm simply going to sign in.\n\n123\n00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.960\nNow we have to at least know\nthis portion of it because\n\n124\n00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.630\nit does actually require us to make sure\nthat we get to the point where we need to.\n\n125\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.380\nNow at the beginning you may\nnot find it actually logged\n\n126\n00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.070\nin exactly in the same\nway that I'm showing you.\n\n127\n00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.710\nBut you may actually end up seeing\nsomething that looks fairly similar\n\n128\n00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.400\nto this.\n\n129\n00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.000\nIf you don't, alright,\nat the top of the page\n\n130\n00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.110\nyou'll actually see three options\nright across the top for links.\n\n131\n00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.920\nOne that says company portal,\nthe other says admin console, and then of\n\n132\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.490\ncourse where you actually are going to be\nlogged in which is kind of an overview.\n\n133\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.360\nSo the only thing that I would have done\ndifferently here is I would have selected\n\n134\n00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.670\nadmin console and that's where it left me.\n\n135\n00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.420\nNow a system requirement\nbefore you go any further.\n\n136\n00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.520\nIs that if you're gonna be\naccessing this admin console,\n\n137\n00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.620\nyou have to ensure that Silverlight,\nright?\n\n138\n00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.340\nWhatever edition or whatever version\nof Windows that you're running.\n\n139\n00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.940\nSo, if you're running a 32 bit edition of\nWindows 10, make sure you actually run\n\n140\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.945\nthe 32 bit edition of Silverlight,\n64 bit, make sure you're running 64 bit.\n\n141\n00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:30.515\nAnd then once that happens\nrefresh the web page, and\n\n142\n00:07:30.515 --> 00:07:33.425\nyou'll get a page that\nlooks like this here, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:33.425 --> 00:07:36.875\nNow this is designed to be an overall\nsummary, and with these gigantic buttons\n\n144\n00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:40.430\nthen you're probably wondering\nwhat's with these gigantic buttons?\n\n145\n00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:45.810\nWell remember that they are designing this\nto be as portable as it needs to be or\n\n146\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.600\nto actually look okay\non a desktop as well.\n\n147\n00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.210\nSo imagine if you're on a Surface Pro\nDaniel and there it is, that little 12 or\n\n148\n00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.320\n13 inch green.\n\n149\n00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.940\nAnd now, you're going, okay let me see\nif I just click that, that little touch\n\n150\n00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.525\nscreen, that little menu option over\non the left hand side, oh, I missed it.\n\n151\n00:08:01.525 --> 00:08:03.662\nWell, why are these buttons so big?\n\n152\n00:08:03.662 --> 00:08:06.645\nCuz it's designed for\nthat touch interface environment as well.\n\n153\n00:08:06.645 --> 00:08:09.141\nSo they're trying to integrate\nboth is what they're trying to do.\n\n154\n00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:14.310\nSo it's not super fancy looking,\ncuz I don't have a ton of devices on here.\n\n155\n00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.660\nBut you can see that it's really giving\nus a summary of some of this stuff, and\n\n156\n00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.920\nthey call this the dashboard feature\nat the very end here, is what we see.\n\n157\n00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:29.120\n>> Kinda like the modern UI that you're\nused to seeing now since Windows 8 or 8.1.\n\n158\n00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.500\nWe see that nice kind of all the tiles,\nkinda reminds me of that actually.\n\n159\n00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.140\n>> Yeah it's actually incredibly similar\nto that and more than likely that's what\n\n160\n00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.930\nthey based it off of and as much as people\ndidn't like it's still a useful interface.\n\n161\n00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:44.840\nAnd if you're got like big chubby fat\nfingers like I do, it's incredibly helpful\n\n162\n00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.520\nif I was on some smaller tablet to\nbe able to kinda do the swipe and\n\n163\n00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.980\nselect what I need to.\n\n164\n00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.980\nAnd then I can click on, so like right\nhere it says end point protection.\n\n165\n00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.030\nI can select that and\nit actually brings me to that location\n\n166\n00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.490\nwithout me having to search for\nit too badly.\n\n167\n00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.830\nSo, it's a lot of features that, you and\nI might not think about because we're just\n\n168\n00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.450\nused to the functionality of things,\nand we just care about getting there.\n\n169\n00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.370\nBut it is about the user\ninterface as well, and\n\n170\n00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.980\nthat's what we wanna make sure of.\n\n171\n00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.810\nSo when you take a look,\nreally, even though you have\n\n172\n00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.700\nthe navigation trees over here on the\nleft-hand side, and you can see where they\n\n173\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.050\ngive you a list of different things\nthat you may actually want to do.\n\n174\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.540\nAnd so normally,\nwhat ends up happening is,\n\n175\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.960\nfrom the dashboard, you actually\nwanna begin configuring stuff, right?\n\n176\n00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.720\nSo you have groups and you have updates,\nprotection, alerts, apps.\n\n177\n00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.270\nAnd then licensing policy and reports, and\nof course another administrative console\n\n178\n00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:40.800\nwhich we'll also talk about\nin this segment as well too.\n\n179\n00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.940\nSo if I were starting of\nwith Windows in tune.\n\n180\n00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.850\nI know that there has to be\nan integration of devices.\n\n181\n00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.700\nAnd of course people that\nare gonna be using this.\n\n182\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.480\nSo, if I click on groups, right here,\nthe idea is fairly simple,\n\n183\n00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.880\nis that when we do this, right, and\nmaybe that you actually do have\n\n184\n00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.625\na group of people let's say that\nare part of the management team and\n\n185\n00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:06.685\nyou want to ensure that you do provide\nthe same type of benefits to that group.\n\n186\n00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:09.315\nAnd then you might want to create another\none that actually provides different\n\n187\n00:10:09.315 --> 00:10:12.115\napplications to another group or\ndifferent monitoring features.\n\n188\n00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:13.690\nWell, you can do that.\n\n189\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.980\nRight at the beginning here we\nactually see the idea of groups here.\n\n190\n00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.990\nNotice that you can actually\ncreate users as well as\n\n191\n00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.740\nactually see the devices that are also\na part of what is actually signed up.\n\n192\n00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.250\nNow I went ahead and\n\n193\n00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.350\npreconfigured some of these devices\nbecause it takes a little bit of time for\n\n194\n00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.420\nthese things to get recognized and we are\ngonna go through a process of enrollment.\n\n195\n00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.730\nBut we are gonna show you that but\n\n196\n00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.460\nthen we are going to have to use these\nthat are already done so we don't\n\n197\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.610\njust waste time watching little bars go by\nor just waiting for something to appear.\n\n198\n00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.530\nSo, right at the beginning if you\nactually know the people that are gonna\n\n199\n00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.590\nbe using Windows Intune,\nthis is where you really do start.\n\n200\n00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.830\nI'm gonna select this overview\nat the beginning here,\n\n201\n00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.940\ncuz this is the easiest way\nto add in additional users.\n\n202\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.060\nFrom the overview, you see the actual\nkind of metro view, or not.\n\n203\n00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:55.990\nCan't say metro.\n\n204\n00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:00.860\nIt's the modern UI type of environment\nover here on the right-hand side.\n\n205\n00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.060\nSo if I scroll on over\nto the right hand side,\n\n206\n00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.560\nthis is where they give you this as well,\nokay.\n\n207\n00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.362\nSo you do see where you\ncan add in some users.\n\n208\n00:11:09.362 --> 00:11:13.110\nSo when you start seeing something\nlike this,notice that over here, you\n\n209\n00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.760\nactually start seeing where it says add\nusers and that's what I would like to do.\n\n210\n00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.340\nSo if I'm gonna be using Windows Intune,\nyou actually have the ability now to\n\n211\n00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.900\nsimple go ahead and do this and we'll\nactually choose one of our cohorts here.\n\n212\n00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.990\nCopeland, and\n\n213\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:32.650\nthen on his display name we'll just call\nit Nate, and actually Nate Copeland.\n\n214\n00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.740\nWe'll do this whole thing since\nit actually gives us that.\n\n215\n00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.690\nAnd then we'll just say this is Nate.\n\n216\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.340\nLet me do it properly here.\n\n217\n00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.230\nI think he prefers Nathan.\n\n218\n00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.370\nAnd look at that,\nit doesn't look it requires a ton right.\n\n219\n00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.460\nAnd then it degenerates us.\n\n220\n00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.510\nNow one of the funny things as\nyou see us typing this in and\n\n221\n00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.670\nthis may kind of confuse you,\nso notice that my ending here.\n\n222\n00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:01.990\nIt says username, it says\n@lab70697iTProTVonmicrosoft.com and\n\n223\n00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.330\nyou might be going why\ndoes he keep using that?\n\n224\n00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.380\nWell at the beginning when you\ncreate an Intune account and\n\n225\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.560\nyou start doing that it\nhad to give you some name.\n\n226\n00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.980\nAnd so\nyou may not have everything set up yet.\n\n227\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.230\nBut once you actually have\neverything set up and\n\n228\n00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.780\neverything tied into your\ndomain you can change that.\n\n229\n00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.200\nSo this is kind of default,\n\n230\n00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.860\nso I didn't actually create a DNS name\nspace out there on the Internet for me.\n\n231\n00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.410\nSo I'm just using the default.\n\n232\n00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.960\nYou can use the default if you want to,\nbut more then likely for\n\n233\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.760\nyour company that will actually change to\nwhatever your company name is gonna be,\n\n234\n00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.150\nif you have that too.\n\n235\n00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.700\nSo of course you want to fill in as much\ndetails as you can at the bottom, but\n\n236\n00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.680\nI'm not gonna do that for right now,\nI'm gonna click next, I almost hit cancel.\n\n237\n00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.290\nAnd if I want to assign\nroles at this point as well,\n\n238\n00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.690\nthis is the way that we do it.\n\n239\n00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.975\nWe can actually select what roll that\nwe want them to actually have inside of\n\n240\n00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:51.490\nIntune or I don't actually\nhave assign any roll at all.\n\n241\n00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.980\nSo I can actually just select no and\nthen a user location.\n\n242\n00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.860\nNow location is going to be import\nbecause it is a cloud service,\n\n243\n00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.350\nlocation really does help to\noptimize how long it takes for\n\n244\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.970\ndevices and of course for\na user to interact, right?\n\n245\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.120\nSo let's say Nate for\nexample is in Japan or somewhere.\n\n246\n00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.750\nWell I'd actually hate to\nset him to United States\n\n247\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:18.180\nbecause when he tries to log in, it's\nautomatically take a look at location and\n\n248\n00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.950\ngo he's in Japan but he's saying that that\nhe's supposed to be in America and so\n\n249\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.660\nit's gonna balance all the way around\nthe world to hit one of the servers that\n\n250\n00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.090\nare closer to the states here.\n\n251\n00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.970\nSo instead you want to make\nsure you set the location\n\n252\n00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:33.225\nproperly where it needs to be since\nwe're all right here in Florida.\n\n253\n00:13:33.225 --> 00:13:36.305\nAt least he's in the next room, so\nI'm assuming he's in the same state.\n\n254\n00:13:36.305 --> 00:13:38.135\nI'm gonna select that as well.\n\n255\n00:13:38.135 --> 00:13:39.235\n>> That's a good assumption.\n\n256\n00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.485\n>> Sometimes I get things right.\n\n257\n00:13:40.485 --> 00:13:44.095\nNot a lot, but I do get some\nof the things right here, and\n\n258\n00:13:44.095 --> 00:13:45.325\nthen it says look here it is.\n\n259\n00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.205\nNow, it says I have 99 of 100.\n\n260\n00:13:47.205 --> 00:13:48.645\nI set up a test account and,\n\n261\n00:13:48.645 --> 00:13:51.830\nby default, they give you a 100\nusers you can test this out with.\n\n262\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.050\nNow, be careful of that, right?\n\n263\n00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:57.260\nIf you go, I'll never set up 100,\nor if you go, I may set up 100,\n\n264\n00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.040\nbut if you do this during a test, you've\ninvested a ton of time in setting all this\n\n265\n00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.780\nup, and your chances have gone,\nI don't wanna ever have to do this again,\n\n266\n00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.560\nyou're probably gonna buy into it,\ncuz you did set it up a lot of times.\n\n267\n00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.070\nI've just set up a couple of them,\nis all I've done here.\n\n268\n00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.520\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and select.\n\n269\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.980\nIt's gonna be Intune,\nby default and click, next.\n\n270\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.370\nAnd then it's gonna ask if\nI want to send an email.\n\n271\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.190\nAnd I'm not gonna worry about\nsending an email to someone.\n\n272\n00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.550\nSo it's no big deal, there.\n\n273\n00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.200\nSo we cannot do that and then, of course,\nit gives you a temporary password.\n\n274\n00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.230\nSo, when you actually\nwant someone to login,\n\n275\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.110\nthis is the information that you would\nnormally send them or you'd call them, and\n\n276\n00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.490\nsay here's what I need you to do.\n\n277\n00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.190\nI need you to register\nyour computer in and\n\n278\n00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.790\nmake sure that you get access to Intune.\n\n279\n00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.870\nLet's take from that example that what\nhappens is with this kind of test account\n\n280\n00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.090\nhere well we can actually do that.\n\n281\n00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.415\nSo we'll end up seeing\nthat as we come along.\n\n282\n00:14:47.415 --> 00:14:49.710\nSo now, we just showed you this and\nyou do that again for\n\n283\n00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.280\na bunch of people in your organization\nthat's gonna be using this.\n\n284\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.580\nSo, that's just kind of the beginning\nof what you see and now, there it is.\n\n285\n00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.200\nThere's all the people that we\nhave inside of our account.\n\n286\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.790\nNow, let's say that for example,\n\n287\n00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.210\nhere, let's see if I can bring this up,\nthere we go.\n\n288\n00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:07.240\nSo let's say that Nate is still on\nthe Windows 8.1 computer system.\n\n289\n00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.180\nAnd it doesn't matter which\nsystem that you're on,\n\n290\n00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.380\nbecause the process that\nwe're talking about, right?\n\n291\n00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.240\nIn getting the enrollment of that\ndevice and of course making sure\n\n292\n00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.360\nthat Nate's also in here in the system,\nIs pretty much the key.\n\n293\n00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.480\nNow I'm gonna use Daniel's account cuz\nI remember what his password is and\n\n294\n00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.800\nI don't remember what the one,\nI could look back here but.\n\n295\n00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.640\n>> You could use my account to\nreset the password of your account.\n\n296\n00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.870\n>> I know, yeah, I probably could but\nlet's not do that.\n\n297\n00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:29.750\n>> Right now [LAUGH].\n\n298\n00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.220\n>> So what do we do here?\n\n299\n00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.320\nSo what we do is we say, hey,\n\n300\n00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.940\nhere's what's gonna happen Daniel,\nis you are gonna launch Internet Explorer.\n\n301\n00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.850\nAnd then when once you actually get\nlaunched into Internet Explorer,\n\n302\n00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.010\nyou have two options.\n\n303\n00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.050\nYou can go ahead and do a search if you\nwant to, but I'm not gonna do that.\n\n304\n00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:55.150\nI'm actually gonna type in\nmanage.microsoft.com and\n\n305\n00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.980\nthis is what will actually\nlaunch us into that same place.\n\n306\n00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.496\nIt looks like we actually can log in.\n\n307\n00:16:01.496 --> 00:16:05.385\nAt this point, what normally would happen\nis if we were selecting Nate's account,\n\n308\n00:16:05.385 --> 00:16:08.891\nit would actually give him an email\naddress and then of course that temporary\n\n309\n00:16:08.891 --> 00:16:12.329\npassword that we assign to him and\nhe'd type that in and get in right away.\n\n310\n00:16:12.329 --> 00:16:15.643\nBut at this point here, we're just\ngonna use Daniel's as an example,\n\n311\n00:16:15.643 --> 00:16:17.090\ncuz it's already set up here.\n\n312\n00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:18.540\nSo I'm gonna select Daniel.\n\n313\n00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.760\nAnd then I type in Daniel's password,\nwhich he told me.\n\n314\n00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.222\nOf course, it's the same as his luggage,\nso it's fine.\n\n315\n00:16:24.222 --> 00:16:24.891\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n316\n00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:28.280\n>> [LAUGH] And then, simply sign in.\n\n317\n00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.660\nOh, there I forgot.\n\n318\n00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.300\nI gotta actually do something else here.\n\n319\n00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.180\nEvery once in a while it kind of gets\na little bit buggy if you've signed in\n\n320\n00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.460\nbefore, so what I'm going to do\ninstead is I'm going to trick it,\n\n321\n00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.650\ntrick it like it doesn't have anything\ncached in the background here,\n\n322\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:46.860\nif I can click on that little gear, and\nselect safety, and let's do an in-private\n\n323\n00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.280\nbrowsing, so that way nothing's cached\nin the background, that's what happened.\n\n324\n00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.800\nFirst time is that actually says\nhey somethings cached back here and\n\n325\n00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.200\nI don't recognize your new fancy stuff so\nhere it is.\n\n326\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:03.140\nSo this is where we type in\nDaniel at lab zero, six, seven.\n\n327\n00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.188\nHopefully to help us remember\nthe exam number as we go and take it.\n\n328\n00:17:06.188 --> 00:17:09.760\n[LAUGH] On Microsoft.\n\n329\n00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.220\nAnd you can see why nobody\nwould really want to do this.\n\n330\n00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.210\nIt's a long, gigantic name.\n\n331\n00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:16.420\nBut remember that's just a default,\nif I had taken time and\n\n332\n00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.150\nattached it to a DNS namespace that I own,\nyou could do that as well.\n\n333\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.395\nSo for us, let's see.\n\n334\n00:17:23.717 --> 00:17:25.710\nAnd then I'm going to go ahead and\nselect sign in,\n\n335\n00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.520\nunless I type in the wrong password.\n\n336\n00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.460\nAnd now it's going to continue.\n\n337\n00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.990\nWell I am lying to you here.\n\n338\n00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:35.390\nSo it says it is not authorized\nto use Microsoft InTune.\n\n339\n00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.020\nWell, let's see what happened over here.\n\n340\n00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.530\nSo Daniel, I do have you actually\nsigned up to use it there.\n\n341\n00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.500\nWe go to the administration console.\n\n342\n00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.790\nAnd so now we're actually troubleshooting\na user account issue instead.\n\n343\n00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.170\nLet me see, this math should be,\nlet me stay on this page.\n\n344\n00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.170\nLet's see what's happened here.\n\n345\n00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.690\nRight, so.\nAll right, let's see, there is goes.\n\n346\n00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.510\nIt's just taking a moment\nto spin out here.\n\n347\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.940\nBut, normally, it should just go ahead and\ngive us the ability to sign in.\n\n348\n00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.980\nLet me check on the groups.\n\n349\n00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.460\nLet's go ahead and\nswitch over to our new computer here.\n\n350\n00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.320\nSo, what I've done is say that.\n\n351\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.690\nNow what we have is a computer and the\nindividual is actually on Windows 8.1, and\n\n352\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.580\nit doesn't matter whether\nthey're on Windows 10 or\n\n353\n00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.860\nWindows 8.1, whatever device that they're\non, they can still connect in the Intune.\n\n354\n00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.387\nNow, the access site that I\nhave been mentioning here\n\n355\n00:18:30.387 --> 00:18:35.830\nwhich is manage.microsoft.com.\n\n356\n00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:39.030\nThis is actually the site and\nI've been trying to get connected and\n\n357\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.380\nI found out something.\n\n358\n00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.495\nThat when I try to connect here, Daniel,\nit just doesn't doesn't work, and\n\n359\n00:18:43.495 --> 00:18:45.525\neven though I thought it's\nactually the right site,\n\n360\n00:18:45.525 --> 00:18:48.685\nit is not the right site that\nwe actually need to connect to.\n\n361\n00:18:48.685 --> 00:18:50.205\nSo, that's what's happening.\n\n362\n00:18:50.205 --> 00:18:52.495\nAnd so, every once in a while\nyou have something like that.\n\n363\n00:18:52.495 --> 00:18:54.671\nIf you're like me,\nyou think you remember everything, and\n\n364\n00:18:54.671 --> 00:18:55.915\nthen you just realize you don't.\n\n365\n00:18:55.915 --> 00:18:58.567\nSo, the site we actually\nneed to go to here.\n\n366\n00:18:58.567 --> 00:19:02.887\nIf I can actually get\nthe browser to work here.\n\n367\n00:19:02.887 --> 00:19:08.257\nAnd let me just do an in-tune not\nin-tune an in private browsing.\n\n368\n00:19:08.257 --> 00:19:17.200\nThat will kind of help us out\ninstead is portal.manage.microsoft.\n\n369\n00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.660\nSo instead of just manage.microsoft,\n\n370\n00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.920\nwhich brings me to of course\nthe account management site,\n\n371\n00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.060\nI think that's an alias for it,\nis actually the portal that we need.\n\n372\n00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.750\nAnd that brings us to the portal page\nthat everybody would actually log into.\n\n373\n00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.960\nSo it is an error on my part,\nbut at the same time\n\n374\n00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.910\nit does happen in reality where you\ngo oh that seems like the right site.\n\n375\n00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.400\nI probably would've actually done\nthat in reality to somebody.\n\n376\n00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.325\n>> [LAUGH] In your defense, Ronnie,\n\n377\n00:19:42.325 --> 00:19:45.626\nthis website does look vaguely\nsimilar to the other one,\n\n378\n00:19:45.626 --> 00:19:50.140\nso I could see that some confusion\nmight have come around because of that.\n\n379\n00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.820\n>> That's the problem, right, is whether\nyou're actually doing the account\n\n380\n00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.710\nmanagement Or the administration side or\nwhether you're actually doing the portal.\n\n381\n00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.830\nThe sign in looks exactly the same.\n\n382\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:03.260\nAnd so this is normally what\nwould end up happening here.\n\n383\n00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.210\nSo let me make sure I sign in with\nthe company name that I create.\n\n384\n00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:10.230\nOops, see that's six, nine oops.\n\n385\n00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.477\nAgain, my typing skills\nare not getting any better.\n\n386\n00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:17.874\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On Microsoft.com,\n\n387\n00:20:17.874 --> 00:20:21.540\nand then Daniel's password.\n\n388\n00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.654\n>> The same as his luggage.\n\n389\n00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:23.479\n>> Super secret.\n\n390\n00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:25.480\n>> Super secret password.\n\n391\n00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.380\nAnd it should give us access in.\n\n392\n00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.930\nSo, you might run into that, where all of\na sudden, you go, oh, it's not working.\n\n393\n00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.570\nWell, check the name of that site.\n\n394\n00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:38.750\nRemember it's portal.manage.microsoft.com,\nnot just manage.microsoft.com.\n\n395\n00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:39.950\nAnd now it is me.\n\n396\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.670\nNow when you see something like this.\n\n397\n00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.060\nNotice that it actually\nhas some information.\n\n398\n00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.940\nRight away it is saying, hey Daniel,\n\n399\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.620\nIf you want to here is some\napplication that you may need.\n\n400\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.430\nSo if these were applications let\nus say instead of these that I\n\n401\n00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.890\ndownloaded right away.\n\n402\n00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:57.960\nIf you had a line of business applications\nspecifically for your company.\n\n403\n00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.280\nYou could put it right here and\n\n404\n00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.250\nthis means it does not matter if Daniel\nis actually traveling for our company and\n\n405\n00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:06.940\nnow he is in the middle of Omaha,\nNebraska and we are right here in Florida.\n\n406\n00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.890\nHe is like man I really need that app.\n\n407\n00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.354\nIn theory what can happen is\nhe can call back and say,\n\n408\n00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:12.810\nRonnie I really need this app.\n\n409\n00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.687\n\".\nAnd I can go ahead and\n\n410\n00:21:14.687 --> 00:21:16.610\nput that into Intune.\n\n411\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.952\nAnd then tell them in\nabout ten minutes here, or\n\n412\n00:21:18.952 --> 00:21:22.701\nmaybe even a little bit less, you can\njust check in on this company portal and\n\n413\n00:21:22.701 --> 00:21:25.680\nit might end up showing up\nright here as an example.\n\n414\n00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.580\nNow at this point, even if it does,\nit's not gonna help them.\n\n415\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.910\nAnd the reason why is this\nlittle gray bar right here.\n\n416\n00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.890\nSo of course you can make sure you\nidentify the right company, and\n\n417\n00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.770\nthat this is your login.\n\n418\n00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:40.030\nBut right here it says this\ndevice is either not enrolled or\n\n419\n00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.300\nthe company portal can't identify it.\n\n420\n00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.710\nSo if I select that, that bar,\nwhat I'm gonna do is actually\n\n421\n00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:50.130\neither enroll this device or\nmake sure it can be identified.\n\n422\n00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.650\nSo it could be a two step process here,\nright?\n\n423\n00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.720\nIt could be that Daniel said,\nRonnie I did that last week.\n\n424\n00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.310\nThis is still telling me\nthat I'm not enrolled.\n\n425\n00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.890\nWell, it's not really doing that.\n\n426\n00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.190\nIt's actually saying,\nI just don't recognize it yet.\n\n427\n00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:02.900\nAnd so, when you come to this page,\n\n428\n00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.810\nyou may see that there's another link\nthat says, Identify this device.\n\n429\n00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:06.710\nIn other words,\n\n430\n00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:10.220\nit's verifying that yes, this is\nthe right device that it's connecting to.\n\n431\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.730\nSo Intune can talk to it but on this one\n\n432\n00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:16.740\nI know that it actually just needs to be\nenrolled, so I'm going to select enroll.\n\n433\n00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.180\nAnd then it's going to download\nthe software that we need.\n\n434\n00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.270\nNow I'm going to go ahead and\njust download and save this software\n\n435\n00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.310\nbecause I want you to see what's in it and\nthis is why it's important right.\n\n436\n00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.090\nSo it doesn't matter,\n\n437\n00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:31.700\nlet's say that Daniel did go on the road\nand he did something a little bit unusual\n\n438\n00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.260\nwhich he accidentally dropped\nhis entire laptop into water.\n\n439\n00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.880\nAnd picks it up and\nrealizes it's not there so\n\n440\n00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.810\nhe actually needs to enroll his new\ndevice that he's got into the company.\n\n441\n00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.520\nSo if he does that then I'm\ngonna open this folder.\n\n442\n00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.310\nWhat we're looking for\nis this Intune setup file,\n\n443\n00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.870\nnow it's normally a zip file, it's just\ntaking a little bit of time to come in.\n\n444\n00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.420\nBut there's actually two files inside and\nthey have to go hand in hand.\n\n445\n00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:59.060\nSo you normally need to make sure\nthat you set that in there and\n\n446\n00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:04.110\nthen you just run it from its zip\nlocation if you're doing that.\n\n447\n00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:08.010\nSo I'm simply going to go ahead and\nat least run that.\n\n448\n00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:11.700\nSee, so does running something in the\nbackground or at least I thought it was.\n\n449\n00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.880\nI saw it do, oh there it goes,\nI see it somewhere.\n\n450\n00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.080\nNow when we run this, it is going to do\nsomething a little bit differently which\n\n451\n00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.220\nis right here, it looks like that\nis opening up a new webpage.\n\n452\n00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:28.290\nIt's really launching\nthat little application.\n\n453\n00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:32.110\nAnd you might be wondering, why is\nit actually making me sign in again?\n\n454\n00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.250\nBecause it's really just making\na connection back to Intune\n\n455\n00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.880\nto run this little application here.\n\n456\n00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.520\nSo, let's see, there it is.\n\n457\n00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:42.880\nSo that's all it's doing\nis actually running this.\n\n458\n00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.970\nNow, it seems like it's running from\nyour computer, and it may be, but\n\n459\n00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.640\na portion of it is actually\nmaking the connection back in.\n\n460\n00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.460\nSo, it's a little bit confusing because\nof all the stuff that you see in\n\n461\n00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.530\nthe background that's saying,\nno, enroll again.\n\n462\n00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.720\nYou keep downloading the software,\nkeep downloading the software.\n\n463\n00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.810\nYou don't have to.\n\n464\n00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.736\nYou just have to take a look at the bottom\ntaskbar, see which one's glowing, and\n\n465\n00:24:00.736 --> 00:24:04.684\nmake sure you allow it to set up there and\ndo everything that you need to do, okay?\n\n466\n00:24:04.684 --> 00:24:07.350\nSo from this point,\nonce everything is actually loaded in,\n\n467\n00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.664\nit's now beginning that\nprocess of enrolling now.\n\n468\n00:24:09.664 --> 00:24:12.089\nThis one's going to take\na few minutes to finish.\n\n469\n00:24:12.089 --> 00:24:13.538\nBut even after it's done,\n\n470\n00:24:13.538 --> 00:24:17.370\nyou can't immediately get access\nto everything that you need.\n\n471\n00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.930\nSo, as much as I'd like to tell\nyou that it's instantaneous,\n\n472\n00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.300\nit probably just depends on your\nlocation compared to the server.\n\n473\n00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.240\nSo, it may take a few minutes.\n\n474\n00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.210\nSome devices can take\nan extremely long time.\n\n475\n00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.440\nSo, on an average, I would give it 10,\n\n476\n00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.790\n15 minutes while it's actually taking\nits time to enroll in the system.\n\n477\n00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.780\nNow if you're actually talking about\nenrolling something like a phone,\n\n478\n00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:38.840\nwell I can do that as well.\n\n479\n00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.360\nI can take a Windows phone.\n\n480\n00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.000\nI can actually take any phone and\ndo the same thing.\n\n481\n00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.280\nI can get enrolled into the system\nby going to that same site.\n\n482\n00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.816\nOr you can actually go to\nthe Windows apps, the Windows Store,\n\n483\n00:24:50.816 --> 00:24:53.020\nWindows Apps Store, Windows Store and\n\n484\n00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.174\nalso be able to find what would\nnormally be on the phone.\n\n485\n00:24:56.174 --> 00:24:57.370\nNow I can't show you that.\n\n486\n00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.516\nThis phone's really tiny, and\nyou don't need to see me going, oh,\n\n487\n00:25:00.516 --> 00:25:02.060\nlook, here's that app.\n\n488\n00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.590\nBut there is an app in there called the\nCompany Portal, is what we're looking for.\n\n489\n00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:09.740\nSo on this one, I just kind of have to\nwait until the enrollment process is done,\n\n490\n00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.480\nand this may be where communication\non both ends is actually good.\n\n491\n00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.830\nIn other words, when I see it actually\ninside of the administrative console here.\n\n492\n00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:23.100\nSo let me see, if I go back to Groups,\nand I select All Devices here.\n\n493\n00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.660\nOnce I see it appear and\npop up here, then I know.\n\n494\n00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.370\nAnd look at that, there it is.\n\n495\n00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:32.450\nThe company, that particular laptop,\nis actually beginning to show up.\n\n496\n00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.360\nBut notice all the other details are not\nshowing up, like the last updatea and\n\n497\n00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.550\nstuff like that.\n\n498\n00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.670\nSo at the beginning here, it's actually\nstarting to show a little bit, but\n\n499\n00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.200\nnothing is actually reporting in yet.\n\n500\n00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.880\nSo it's still gonna take a little bit of\ntime before everything begins to show up\n\n501\n00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.350\nthe way that we need to.\n\n502\n00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.070\nSo once that process is done,\n\n503\n00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:55.550\nwe are now actually enrolling\nthat device into the system.\n\n504\n00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.020\nAnd at that point,\nthat means we can actually go ahead and\n\n505\n00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.300\ndo some other things with it too.\n\n506\n00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.380\nSo what we're gonna do instead is as that\ndevice is kind of coming in and we'll get\n\n507\n00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.700\nthat last update and everything else, and\nit gets registered and doing everything.\n\n508\n00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.831\nWell, at that point what ends up happening\nis that you start seeing a couple of other\n\n509\n00:26:12.831 --> 00:26:15.677\nthings appear especially\ninside of a desktop computer.\n\n510\n00:26:15.677 --> 00:26:18.593\nNow I'm going to show you from\nthis Windows 10 computer here,\n\n511\n00:26:18.593 --> 00:26:21.887\nthat what would normally end up happening\nis it now has installed a little\n\n512\n00:26:21.887 --> 00:26:23.512\npiece of software on the computer.\n\n513\n00:26:23.512 --> 00:26:28.286\nAnd oh, I need to see the lower right-hand\ncorner of my screen over here so\n\n514\n00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:31.140\nI can show you the actual software.\n\n515\n00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.820\nSo inside of this Windows 10 machine, and\nit will be true inside of the Windows 8\n\n516\n00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:40.500\nwhen everything's done, is if I click\non that notification area here,\n\n517\n00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.950\nI'll end up seeing what\nlooks almost like the icon,\n\n518\n00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.770\nat least to me, for the connection,\nthe network connection.\n\n519\n00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:49.730\nBut if I hover over it, it gives me\nan option of whether I want to go to\n\n520\n00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:53.230\nto the Intune Center or\nselect this company portal.\n\n521\n00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:57.816\nSo if I select Microsoft Intune, you can\nsee right here where it actually gives me\n\n522\n00:26:57.816 --> 00:27:01.806\naccess to what Intune really is\nallowing me to do, get applications.\n\n523\n00:27:01.806 --> 00:27:03.965\nI can actually have updates that come in.\n\n524\n00:27:03.965 --> 00:27:06.008\nI can even establish endpoint protection.\n\n525\n00:27:06.008 --> 00:27:09.983\nSo that means that as an administrator,\nif I wanna make sure that that brand new\n\n526\n00:27:09.983 --> 00:27:13.117\nlaptop that Daniel has,\nhas antivirus protection on it, and\n\n527\n00:27:13.117 --> 00:27:16.100\nnot the one that's all\nready installed on there.\n\n528\n00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.550\nI can actually run endpoint\nprotection from Intune and\n\n529\n00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:24.310\nhave it install and actually force it\nto do a scan right away if I wanted to\n\n530\n00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:27.400\nafter everything is actually updated and\ndoing what we need to.\n\n531\n00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.150\nSo this is a little piece of\nsoftware that locks it into Intune,\n\n532\n00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.510\nis what it gives us\nthe ability to be able to do.\n\n533\n00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:38.699\nSo from this point, you can then see that\nif there's actually something checking and\n\n534\n00:27:38.699 --> 00:27:42.268\nit says Microsoft is currently checking\nfor updates that are out there.\n\n535\n00:27:42.268 --> 00:27:46.591\nWell, this is where Microsoft's Intune\nreally does help us out because this is\n\n536\n00:27:46.591 --> 00:27:49.236\nwhat it actually gives us\nthe ability to do is to be\n\n537\n00:27:49.236 --> 00:27:52.360\nable to manage these\ndevices in multiple ways.\n\n538\n00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.520\nSo if I select Client1,\n\n539\n00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.640\nwhich is the one that I just showed\nyou and I right-click on this thing,\n\n540\n00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.330\nthere's actually the ability to do\nwhat we call these different tasks.\n\n541\n00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.810\nNow these are what we call remote tasks.\n\n542\n00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:08.880\nAnd so if I select this Remote Task\nlink up here in this drop down,\n\n543\n00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.430\nyou'll see the same thing.\n\n544\n00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:14.560\nSo it can give me the ability to see\nwhat's actually on that computer.\n\n545\n00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.300\nI can also run full malware scans and\neverything else.\n\n546\n00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.890\nAnd I can even restart this\ncomputer remotely if I wanted to.\n\n547\n00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.910\nSo this is kind of one of\nthose neat things right.\n\n548\n00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:29.040\nIt may be that your software downloads,\nand then it just hangs there.\n\n549\n00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.003\nAnd for one reason or another,\nit's just downloaded, and\n\n550\n00:28:32.003 --> 00:28:34.322\nnow Daniel's gone out to lunch or\nsomething.\n\n551\n00:28:34.322 --> 00:28:36.599\nBut you want it to actually be up and\nrunning.\n\n552\n00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:39.047\nWell, you can select Restart the Computer.\n\n553\n00:28:39.047 --> 00:28:42.490\nAnd if I select that,\nI'm gonna go ahead and say Yes.\n\n554\n00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.300\nAnd them I'm gonna scroll back over here,\nand you'll see,\n\n555\n00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.765\nactually in the lower\nright-hand corner again.\n\n556\n00:28:47.765 --> 00:28:50.675\nIt will actually show you at this point\n\n557\n00:28:50.675 --> 00:28:54.855\na little notification that\nit was about to restart.\n\n558\n00:28:54.855 --> 00:28:58.735\nNow it gives you about 15 minutes, so let\nme show you what I'm talking about here.\n\n559\n00:28:58.735 --> 00:29:02.490\nIf I select now the ability to Shut down.\n\n560\n00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.628\nIt actually is gonna shut down.\n\n561\n00:29:03.628 --> 00:29:07.176\nAnd so even though it gave me like 15\nminutes before I could shut it down,\n\n562\n00:29:07.176 --> 00:29:09.200\nI can just go ahead and\ntell it to restart.\n\n563\n00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.360\nBut in 15 minutes it would have shut\ndown regardless if I didn't, so\n\n564\n00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.380\nI can kind of preempt it if I want to.\n\n565\n00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.600\nSo in the middle of working,\nI kind of know that, hey,\n\n566\n00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:20.910\nin about 15 minutes, this thing is\ngonna shut down, or 10 minutes or so.\n\n567\n00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.160\nAnd it's gonna reboot.\n\n568\n00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.990\nIt's gonna do whatever we need to.\n\n569\n00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:27.087\nSo, it really is powerful where\nI can send something like that.\n\n570\n00:29:27.087 --> 00:29:31.707\nNow, just when I think that that's\nall there is available to us,\n\n571\n00:29:31.707 --> 00:29:36.663\nwe can also do something like what we\ncall here a little bit more on those\n\n572\n00:29:36.663 --> 00:29:40.630\nindividual things such as\ndoing a retire and wipe.\n\n573\n00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.910\nBut there's some other things\nthat are really fascinating for\n\n574\n00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.550\nus to do in the management side.\n\n575\n00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.478\nBut Daniel, I've talked a long time again.\n\n576\n00:29:46.478 --> 00:29:48.686\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that means it's almost time for\n\n577\n00:29:48.686 --> 00:29:51.160\nus to go ahead, and yeah- [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, no.\n\n578\n00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.280\nThis is a great spot for\nus to go ahead and stop where we're at.\n\n579\n00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.180\nWe've seen how to enroll\na device into Intune.\n\n580\n00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:58.730\nThat's awesome.\n\n581\n00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.610\nWe need to be able to do that,\nbecause hey, if the device isn't enrolled,\n\n582\n00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:04.064\nwe're not gonna be able to manage\nit using the Intune console.\n\n583\n00:30:04.064 --> 00:30:08.193\nWe've also seen how to create a user for\nthe Intune console, log in as them so that\n\n584\n00:30:08.193 --> 00:30:12.870\nwe can actually start managing the thing,\nkinda the whole point of the system there.\n\n585\n00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.290\nSo, great stuff, Ronnie,\nthanks for the demonstrations.\n\n586\n00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:16.930\nHopefully we'll see you guys in part two.\n\n587\n00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.660\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this episode up.\n\n588\n00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.479\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n589\n00:30:22.479 --> 00:30:23.200\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n590\n00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.186\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n591\n00:30:24.186 --> 00:30:30.870\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.970\nGreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother fantastic episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.090\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n6\n00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.410\nHere with me, as usual, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.240\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.550\n>> It is going great.\n\n9\n00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.127\nWe are continuing on taking\na look at what Windows Intune, or\n\n10\n00:00:26.127 --> 00:00:28.360\nMicrosoft Intune officially now.\n\n11\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.585\nAnd this is actually a second\npart of our series here so\n\n12\n00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:35.095\nfar, one, the reason why,\nas always, I talk too much.\n\n13\n00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:37.685\n>> Bit of a blabber mouth\n>> Yeah I am a bit of a blabber mouth,\n\n14\n00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:39.605\nbut yes we're taking\na look at Windows Intune.\n\n15\n00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:43.035\nRemember that Intune is all about\nmanagement of different devices.\n\n16\n00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:45.875\nAnd what we want to make sure that\nwe can do, because of the way that\n\n17\n00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:50.315\nthe corporate world is, is that our data\ngets on more devices than we think right?\n\n18\n00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:52.575\nSo even though we might think\nits only on their desktop,\n\n19\n00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:54.990\na lot of time they're bringing\nthe laptop into work,\n\n20\n00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.900\nthey're probably also bringing\nsomething like a thumb drive and\n\n21\n00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.950\nthey're also transferring it to their\nhome computers and working on it there.\n\n22\n00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.900\nAnd then if they can get access to their\nemail, they're probably actually doing\n\n23\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.680\nit through a tablet and\nmaybe even through their phone.\n\n24\n00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.827\nAnd so that means there's a lot of devices\nout there that we normally can't control\n\n25\n00:01:09.827 --> 00:01:12.340\ninside of an active directory environment.\n\n26\n00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.290\nAnd which we still need to have\ncontrol of to a point, right?\n\n27\n00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.962\nTo ensure that our data doesn't\naccidentally get out there.\n\n28\n00:01:17.962 --> 00:01:21.665\nAnd Intune helps us to be able to\nmanage those devices, as well as give\n\n29\n00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:25.585\nusers a little bit more info when they\nneed to, and some applications of course,\n\n30\n00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.815\nto actually be able to control\nthem a little bit better.\n\n31\n00:01:28.815 --> 00:01:30.135\nSo Intune allows us to do that.\n\n32\n00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:34.700\nIn the previous episode, we did kind\nof show you how you could go ahead and\n\n33\n00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.260\nbegin to create users inside of Intune.\n\n34\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.120\nAnd we also showed you the process\nof enrolling the device into Intune.\n\n35\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.570\nNow you can do it in a couple ways.\n\n36\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.030\nThe way that we showed you is that\nif the device isn't even connected,\n\n37\n00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.960\nyou can go and log in through the company\nportal or the portal that's set up for\n\n38\n00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.990\nyour organization.\n\n39\n00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.580\nAnd from that point, it can install\nthat client onto your computer.\n\n40\n00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.565\nAnd then once it's there,\nit's registered, and\n\n41\n00:01:57.565 --> 00:01:59.900\nnow you are ready to manage\nthat device as well.\n\n42\n00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.980\nNow, the idea of management seems\nto be a little bit more murky,\n\n43\n00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.790\nright, if you're not familiar\nwith the idea of IT management.\n\n44\n00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.750\nA lot of this really has to do\nwith maintaining those devices and\n\n45\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.290\nmaking sure you have\nthe control that you need to.\n\n46\n00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.120\nRemember that what ends up happening,\nas well,\n\n47\n00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.240\nis that sometimes a user can end up\nputting something on their laptop,\n\n48\n00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.400\nactually, even a company-owned laptop,\napplications that shouldn't be there.\n\n49\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.340\nThey can end up browsing websites\nthat they shouldn't browse to and\n\n50\n00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.820\nthen end up getting something on there.\n\n51\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.565\nAnd they may not run their antivirus,\nI couldn't remember what it was called.\n\n52\n00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:34.080\nOther malware detection, they may not be\nrunning that the way they need to, or\n\n53\n00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.055\nthey may actually just not even do\nthings like your Windows updates and\n\n54\n00:02:38.055 --> 00:02:39.455\nstuff that needs to be done.\n\n55\n00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:42.155\nWell Intune can help to\ncontrol that situation and\n\n56\n00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:45.045\nensure that that can actually\nend up happening too.\n\n57\n00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:48.005\nSo we want to take a look at some of\nthe additional management features we\n\n58\n00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:49.700\nnormally also find in Intune,\n\n59\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.810\nto help us out a little bit more as we\nstart adding in more and more devices.\n\n60\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.260\nSo on my machine I've got\naccess to the Admin Console, or\n\n61\n00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.740\nwhat they call the Administrative Console\nhere, inside of Microsoft Intune.\n\n62\n00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.120\nAnd you may hear different terms, and\nI wanna make sure that you understand,\n\n63\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.840\ntoday it's called Microsoft Intune.\n\n64\n00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.995\nIn the past and\nprevious editions of operating systems,\n\n65\n00:03:09.995 --> 00:03:14.020\nyou might hear the term Windows Intune,\nthey mean the exact same thing.\n\n66\n00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.630\nSo don't get thrown off by that.\n\n67\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.761\nIf you happen to be reading somewhere and\nit says,\n\n68\n00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:19.930\nin Windows Intune this is how you do this.\n\n69\n00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.070\nOr in Microsoft Intune, and\nthen all of a sudden you're like,\n\n70\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.260\ndoes that mean the same thing?\n\n71\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.070\nIt really does mean the exact same thing.\n\n72\n00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.950\nSo whether you see that on an exam or\nwhether you actually see\n\n73\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.500\nthat when you're reading, they really\nare talking about the same thing.\n\n74\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.250\nIt's just that the terminology\nhas changed over time.\n\n75\n00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.800\nSo one of the first things that\nwe want to actually go into and\n\n76\n00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.980\ntake a look at of course,\nis that when everything is said and done,\n\n77\n00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.010\nright, you and I need to be able to see,\nwell, users that are actually part of my\n\n78\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.310\norganization that I can actually\nassign some management to.\n\n79\n00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.560\nAnd then all of the devices.\n\n80\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.250\nAnd so right here on the left hand side is\nour navigation, and if I select Groups,\n\n81\n00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.480\nyou can see I have Users and\nI have Devices, and\n\n82\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.793\neven Mobile Devices too, and\neven Corporate Pre-enrolled devices.\n\n83\n00:04:00.793 --> 00:04:04.660\nNow you may be asking like, what the heck\nis a corporate pre-enrolled device?\n\n84\n00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.730\nWe'll we happen to buy batches,\nright, in bulk of computers.\n\n85\n00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.430\nWell you can actually enroll them by\nusing things like serial numbers and\n\n86\n00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.310\na whole bunch of other things and\nthat way you can say hey\n\n87\n00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.060\nI'm going to load this up when that person\nlogs in, it'll actually already be there.\n\n88\n00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.980\nAnd that way you actually have a lot more\nmanagement features from that point.\n\n89\n00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.475\nSo there are ways that you\ncan go ahead and do that too.\n\n90\n00:04:24.475 --> 00:04:26.895\nNow in the end there's actually\nthis Ungrouped Devices.\n\n91\n00:04:26.895 --> 00:04:31.220\nUngrouped devices is essentially a list,\na comprehensive list of everything, okay.\n\n92\n00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.315\nSo you might be wondering,\nwhy'd they give us all these?\n\n93\n00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:35.350\nWell, it's more about\nfiltering than anything else.\n\n94\n00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.990\nRight.\n\n95\n00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.410\nIf you want to just see the mobile\ndevices you can do that.\n\n96\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.740\nIf you want to just\nthe computers you can do that.\n\n97\n00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.580\nIf you want to actually see the same thing\nwith users you can see that as well.\n\n98\n00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.840\nBut this power is found in the way\nthat we group these things together.\n\n99\n00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.510\nRight?\n\n100\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.880\nSo if you have multiple departments\ninside of your organization and\n\n101\n00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.080\nyou know that they really need,\n\n102\n00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.580\nlike some of them might need,\nlet's say, Adobe Acrobat Reader, right?\n\n103\n00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.940\nOr the Adobe Reader, it's not\nAcrobat Reader, it's the Adobe Reader.\n\n104\n00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.340\nWell, you might actually go ahead and\nsay, look, this group really needs it,\n\n105\n00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.950\nthis other group doesn't,\nthey really don't need that.\n\n106\n00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.630\nSo, you can separate them out\nby creating different groups.\n\n107\n00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.870\nAnd so, here I show a group here.\n\n108\n00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.410\nSo, like for what I did, it I actually\ndid a test at deployment group.\n\n109\n00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.320\nSo, I just wanted at the beginning to see\nif I could push an application out, but\n\n110\n00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.970\nI didn't want it to be for\neveryone in that group.\n\n111\n00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.060\nI just wanted it to be for certain people,\nso over on the right hand side,\n\n112\n00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.480\nyou can see some of these details over\nhere, that this actually has three users.\n\n113\n00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.190\nAnd all I added in there were three users.\n\n114\n00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.080\nI could have selected the entire\ndepartment if I wanted to.\n\n115\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.060\nBut if I wanted just to create a little\ntest group I could do that as well.\n\n116\n00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.750\nAnd be able to go ahead and create that.\n\n117\n00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.620\nNow when I talk about creating\ngroups as well as users,\n\n118\n00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.580\nit's the same concept, right?\n\n119\n00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.880\nSo over here on the right hand\nside I selected on overview.\n\n120\n00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.030\nYou can actually see where\nwe can create a group.\n\n121\n00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.840\nAnd then once you create that group,\nyou can add users into it.\n\n122\n00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.340\nNow the adding of users into\na group is a little bit more,\n\n123\n00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.820\nI don't wanna say unusual, but\nit does actually kind of get a little bit,\n\n124\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.310\nit's not as intuitive as what we're\nnormally used to seeing inside of Windows.\n\n125\n00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.910\nSo if I wanted to I can also\nclick on Edit a Group, and\n\n126\n00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.120\nthen from this point let's say\nit's this group and I click Next.\n\n127\n00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.960\nAnd this is where it gets\na little bit more muddied.\n\n128\n00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.010\nRight?\nSo you have to select what group\n\n129\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.360\nmembership to start with, or\nyou're gonna create an empty group.\n\n130\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.560\nAnd so that way and then at the bottom\nhere, you can include members from\n\n131\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.230\nother organization, not other\norganizations, but other security groups.\n\n132\n00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.240\nAnd even managers and\nadd them in, if you want to.\n\n133\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.570\nSo you'd actually make sure\nthat those appear here.\n\n134\n00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.440\nBut notice that you can exclude people as\nwell and that way, they don't get applied.\n\n135\n00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.350\nBut I didn't do that, I just went and\ncreated this one group for\n\n136\n00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.480\nus and\nthen added in users to help us out here.\n\n137\n00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.600\nAnd these three users were added in by\ndefault the way that I had it set up.\n\n138\n00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.280\nSo it really does give you that\noption to be able to take a look and\n\n139\n00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.750\nsee what's happening, and\nactually affect those people.\n\n140\n00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.530\nNow what I actually did here is I\nassigned them to this group, and\n\n141\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.810\nthis actually comes down to a little\nbit more of application management,\n\n142\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.590\nwhich we'll actually get to in\nanother segment here as well.\n\n143\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.860\nBut right now,\nyou can see why when you divide them up,\n\n144\n00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.590\nyou can actually make this be\neffective towards what you need.\n\n145\n00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.500\nAnd it's not just like\na one size fits all, right?\n\n146\n00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.200\nSo, you can actually make sure that your\norganization can do what you need to.\n\n147\n00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.920\nSo, Daniel,\nyou've ran into that before right,\n\n148\n00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.462\nwhere a certain group of users needed some\napplications, and certain groups didn't?\n\n149\n00:07:27.462 --> 00:07:28.950\n>> Oh yeah, definitely, plenty of times.\n\n150\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.410\nActually, that is basically what you're\ngoing to run into in any environment.\n\n151\n00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.040\nYou're gonna have a group of people\nthat need a certain type of environment.\n\n152\n00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.000\nAnd you're gonna have another group\nthat's gonna need a completely\n\n153\n00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.020\ndifferent environment.\n\n154\n00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.570\nAnd then there will be some\nsimilarities that cross over\n\n155\n00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.640\nas you have all the different groups that\nare inside of your total environment.\n\n156\n00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.060\nSo, you gotta just start\nfine-tuning each one of those.\n\n157\n00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.581\nAnd really, when we're talking about\ngroups, when you're creating groups into\n\n158\n00:07:53.581 --> 00:07:57.170\nIntune, what you're really doing is you're\nseparating people out by their role.\n\n159\n00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.155\n>> So\nyou're kind of assigning applications and\n\n160\n00:08:00.155 --> 00:08:03.137\neverything based on what\nthey do in your job and\n\n161\n00:08:03.137 --> 00:08:08.047\nthis actually really reminds me a lot\nof the Windows server update service.\n\n162\n00:08:08.047 --> 00:08:12.095\nAnd the way that works, kind of the same\napplication where you're breaking down\n\n163\n00:08:12.095 --> 00:08:16.280\ncomputers into different roles and then\nassigning updates to them as they need it.\n\n164\n00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.040\nThey're doing the same thing\nwith people and devices,\n\n165\n00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.750\nas well in the Intune management.\n\n166\n00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:25.608\nI wouldn't be surprised if they used\nthat as a template for building Intune,\n\n167\n00:08:25.608 --> 00:08:28.388\nbecause it's so similar in my estimation.\n\n168\n00:08:28.388 --> 00:08:32.651\nAnyway, they are giving the ability\nto set those roles and say, hey,\n\n169\n00:08:32.651 --> 00:08:35.188\nI've got HR people, they need HR stuff.\n\n170\n00:08:35.188 --> 00:08:38.248\nThey're gonna need this application for\ntime management,\n\n171\n00:08:38.248 --> 00:08:42.330\nthey're gonna need this application for\nuser management, that kind of stuff.\n\n172\n00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.213\nThey're gonna have to put that in,\nI don't need that for my R and D people.\n\n173\n00:08:45.213 --> 00:08:47.279\nThey do not need access\nto that application.\n\n174\n00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:52.355\nTherefore, I segregate using those groups,\nso that I can set those permissions,\n\n175\n00:08:52.355 --> 00:08:55.702\nI can set those applications\nto install just for them.\n\n176\n00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:59.206\nThey don't have to worry about things that\naren't a part of their environment and\n\n177\n00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:02.075\nthat's what's really helpful when\nit comes to the Intune stuff.\n\n178\n00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:02.736\n>> It really is.\n\n179\n00:09:02.736 --> 00:09:05.841\nWhen you start taking a look\nat everything Intune can do,\n\n180\n00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:10.126\nthat really helps a single manager\nregardless of where that device really is.\n\n181\n00:09:10.126 --> 00:09:11.646\nIt is incredibly helpful.\n\n182\n00:09:11.646 --> 00:09:16.165\nNow the other thing we also wanna take a\nlook at is over here on the left-hand side\n\n183\n00:09:16.165 --> 00:09:19.875\nis the idea of actually take a look\nat alerts and also reporting and\n\n184\n00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:21.236\nmonitoring, as well.\n\n185\n00:09:21.236 --> 00:09:25.560\nSo when we take a look at certain things\nthat are going on inside of our network\n\n186\n00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.141\nand taking a look at the very fact\nthat some devices may update,\n\n187\n00:09:29.141 --> 00:09:30.440\nsome devices may not.\n\n188\n00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.901\nWell, how in the world do you\nknow if that's happening?\n\n189\n00:09:32.901 --> 00:09:36.605\nWell, if you do have Intune on these\ncomputers, it's fairly easy to see.\n\n190\n00:09:36.605 --> 00:09:39.634\nSo we are gonna kind of skip over\na couple of things right away,\n\n191\n00:09:39.634 --> 00:09:42.608\nbecause we do have another segment\non the idea of updating and\n\n192\n00:09:42.608 --> 00:09:46.867\ndoing some things in specialty application\nmanagement, but what we're taking a look\n\n193\n00:09:46.867 --> 00:09:49.766\nat right here is Alerts is what\nwe want to be able to do here.\n\n194\n00:09:49.766 --> 00:09:55.436\nSo I can actually select how I want\nthe Alerts to end up happening, as well.\n\n195\n00:09:55.436 --> 00:09:56.652\nSo when we take a look,\n\n196\n00:09:56.652 --> 00:10:00.178\nit gives us how the reports\nare actually going to take a look here.\n\n197\n00:10:00.178 --> 00:10:04.662\nSo view by date newest on top and\nyou can see that I have one alert type and\n\n198\n00:10:04.662 --> 00:10:09.080\nit says, right here enrollment updates for\niOS and Android CP apps.\n\n199\n00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.967\nAnd I am still at that one instance here,\nyou can see where it went ahead and\n\n200\n00:10:12.967 --> 00:10:15.615\njust gave me that ability\nto see what's going on.\n\n201\n00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:19.733\nI can select view properties and then it\nwill tell me what's actually happening\n\n202\n00:10:19.733 --> 00:10:24.045\nhere in this particular alert and give me\na description of something I need to know.\n\n203\n00:10:24.045 --> 00:10:28.909\nAnd this one is fairly important, because\nof the new iOS that just came out like\n\n204\n00:10:28.909 --> 00:10:31.866\nthis week as of the recording\nof this show here.\n\n205\n00:10:31.866 --> 00:10:34.297\nThat hey, Windows Intune says,\nwe went in and update.\n\n206\n00:10:34.297 --> 00:10:37.169\nThat's what they're essentially\nsaying is the new iOS app\n\n207\n00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:39.188\nshould work perfectly fine with Intune.\n\n208\n00:10:39.188 --> 00:10:41.380\nWe should be ready to go, as well.\n\n209\n00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.000\nBut when we start seeing stuff like that,\nthat's good and these are generic ones,\n\n210\n00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.560\nbut we can also select monitoring here.\n\n211\n00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.751\nAnd now under Monitoring,\nthere's actually nothing there for\n\n212\n00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.030\nus to monitor right away.\n\n213\n00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.320\nBut when I can do this, I can actually\ngo ahead and then start creating.\n\n214\n00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.853\nOnce things are actually happening here,\nI can actually start creating.\n\n215\n00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:04.515\nNow my devices, there's nothing really\nalert-oriented that's going on, except for\n\n216\n00:11:04.515 --> 00:11:05.147\none thing.\n\n217\n00:11:05.147 --> 00:11:08.308\nAnd it's actually giving me the alert,\nbut in the Dashboard.\n\n218\n00:11:08.308 --> 00:11:13.434\nSo all those alerts end up generating to\nthese little check marks that you see and\n\n219\n00:11:13.434 --> 00:11:16.649\nthese apps and\nthese policies that's going on and\n\n220\n00:11:16.649 --> 00:11:19.576\nit looked like it\nactually resolved itself.\n\n221\n00:11:19.576 --> 00:11:24.070\nThere was one that said that my device was\nnot in compliance, my Windows phone and\n\n222\n00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.196\nit looks like it's now disappeared.\n\n223\n00:11:26.196 --> 00:11:29.546\nSo in other words, Windows Intune\nhas already updated that device and\n\n224\n00:11:29.546 --> 00:11:32.972\ngenerated and said, we're now\nbringing this thing in to compliance.\n\n225\n00:11:32.972 --> 00:11:37.004\nAnd that's because this Windows phone even\nthough we've had it for a little bit,\n\n226\n00:11:37.004 --> 00:11:40.979\nI just joined it to Intune and that means\nthat the updates might have actually been\n\n227\n00:11:40.979 --> 00:11:42.674\nout of date on this little phone and\n\n228\n00:11:42.674 --> 00:11:46.319\nthen the one that hadn't made sure\nthat was actually back in compliance.\n\n229\n00:11:46.319 --> 00:11:49.633\nBut yeah, right at the beginning when\neverything was going on, there was\n\n230\n00:11:49.633 --> 00:11:53.321\na little marker that said, hey, here's\nan alert for you that the device that just\n\n231\n00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:56.796\njoined in and it would actually have\nbeen right here under this alert policy,\n\n232\n00:11:56.796 --> 00:12:00.084\nthat it needs to actually go ahead and\ncome back into compliance as well.\n\n233\n00:12:00.084 --> 00:12:02.169\nSo those alerts can be generated and\n\n234\n00:12:02.169 --> 00:12:04.818\nlet me see if I can show\nyou on this thing here.\n\n235\n00:12:04.818 --> 00:12:05.816\nOh, there it is, sorry.\n\n236\n00:12:05.816 --> 00:12:07.348\nConfigure alert type.\n\n237\n00:12:07.348 --> 00:12:09.298\nAnd of course, notification roles.\n\n238\n00:12:09.298 --> 00:12:15.010\nSo if I select that task here,\nhere's some generic ones that you do see.\n\n239\n00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.330\nSo duplicate IP addresses detected and\nyou might see but\n\n240\n00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.050\nnotice it is actually disabled.\n\n241\n00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:24.007\nWell, I can right-click on that and\ngo ahead and enable that if I need to.\n\n242\n00:12:24.007 --> 00:12:27.459\nIf I believe that it is a problem,\nthat is actually on my systems, but\n\n243\n00:12:27.459 --> 00:12:29.615\nI can also right-click and configure it.\n\n244\n00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:33.707\nAnd that way, it actually says that I\ncan either enable it or disable it and\n\n245\n00:12:33.707 --> 00:12:35.033\nyou know we can do that.\n\n246\n00:12:35.033 --> 00:12:38.046\nNow other things, of course,\nas you select on these,\n\n247\n00:12:38.046 --> 00:12:40.479\nnotice you can actually select other ones.\n\n248\n00:12:40.479 --> 00:12:44.071\nApplication Incompatibility,\nI can select configure and\n\n249\n00:12:44.071 --> 00:12:48.163\nit can actually tell me either\na different security level warning or\n\n250\n00:12:48.163 --> 00:12:51.270\nI can actually disable that\none if I need to as well.\n\n251\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.894\nSo there is a lot of them\nactually built-in and\n\n252\n00:12:53.894 --> 00:12:57.270\njust when you think there is\n185 different alert types.\n\n253\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:01.466\nSo they're trying to give us as many as\nthey can actually think of, especially\n\n254\n00:13:01.466 --> 00:13:06.470\ndealing with Microsoft Office, which is a\nbig one for what you end up seeing there.\n\n255\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.420\nSo you can create those alerts and\nthat way,\n\n256\n00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.370\nyou can also get notified\nabout them if you need to.\n\n257\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.518\nSo let me see if I can\nbacktrack over that and\n\n258\n00:13:14.518 --> 00:13:16.980\nthen I can configure\nthese notification rules.\n\n259\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.397\nAnd on these notification rules,\nit does say, hey,\n\n260\n00:13:19.397 --> 00:13:21.291\nwhat's the rules that we actually need?\n\n261\n00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:26.176\nAnd it gives us all critical informational\nRemote Assistance Request, Warning Alerts,\n\n262\n00:13:26.176 --> 00:13:30.546\nall these are actually enabled so they\nwill show up on the console somewhere, and\n\n263\n00:13:30.546 --> 00:13:32.106\nthat way also alert you too.\n\n264\n00:13:32.106 --> 00:13:34.864\nNow of course,\nyou can create a brand new rule and\n\n265\n00:13:34.864 --> 00:13:39.182\nthen you can see that there's a lot of\ndifferent things that it can monitor.\n\n266\n00:13:39.182 --> 00:13:43.131\nAnd here under Monitoring, it does\nlike applications, Office, Windows,\n\n267\n00:13:43.131 --> 00:13:47.260\nitself and you can scroll on down and see\nthat there's a lot of different ones that\n\n268\n00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.380\nare available for\nwhat you might actually choose to create.\n\n269\n00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.701\nMost of the time unless we are actually\nlooking for something very specific,\n\n270\n00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:54.940\nthese are probably enough.\n\n271\n00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.426\nThey are enough to actually make\nus a little bit more worried.\n\n272\n00:13:57.426 --> 00:14:01.983\nWe start actually bringing in older\ndevices into our system here, but\n\n273\n00:14:01.983 --> 00:14:03.769\nyou are starting to see it.\n\n274\n00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:08.598\nSo some of the other management features\nthat we also will end up taking a look at,\n\n275\n00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:12.646\nof course is really over here on\nthe left-hand side of the screen and\n\n276\n00:14:12.646 --> 00:14:17.191\nwe wanna go beyond the idea of alerts and\nthe notifications to taking a look at\n\n277\n00:14:17.191 --> 00:14:20.266\nthese ideas of policy decisions and\nalso reports.\n\n278\n00:14:20.266 --> 00:14:22.689\nNow I had said reports\na little bit earlier, but\n\n279\n00:14:22.689 --> 00:14:25.426\nit by itself can actually be\na whole topic that we see.\n\n280\n00:14:25.426 --> 00:14:28.665\nNow, policy is kind of\na mini group policy.\n\n281\n00:14:28.665 --> 00:14:32.435\nIt gives you the ability to configure\nsome of the things that, well,\n\n282\n00:14:32.435 --> 00:14:34.848\nthose devices will take like group policy.\n\n283\n00:14:34.848 --> 00:14:35.919\nAnd then of course,\n\n284\n00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:40.018\nthat means you also have other devices\nthat may not fit in that same category.\n\n285\n00:14:40.018 --> 00:14:44.608\nSo don't expect these policies to apply\nuniversally across multiple devices when\n\n286\n00:14:44.608 --> 00:14:46.256\nyou start bringing Android.\n\n287\n00:14:46.256 --> 00:14:47.903\nAnd of course, iOS phones,\n\n288\n00:14:47.903 --> 00:14:51.687\nyou may see that some of those\npolicies just won't apply either.\n\n289\n00:14:51.687 --> 00:14:54.958\nSo you can actually create\na policy fairly easily, but\n\n290\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:58.810\nit does require a little bit more\ntechnical assessment to do so.\n\n291\n00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.833\nSo even though I go ahead and\nclick like add,\n\n292\n00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:03.414\nit seems like it should just\nbe a walk-through wizard.\n\n293\n00:15:03.414 --> 00:15:07.714\nAnd from that point, you select which of\nthese devices that you want to try and do.\n\n294\n00:15:07.714 --> 00:15:11.179\nSo I'm just gonna do a custom\nconfiguration of like a Windows 10\n\n295\n00:15:11.179 --> 00:15:14.770\ndesktop and mobile and later and\nthen it says, create the policy and\n\n296\n00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.095\ndeploy a custom policy.\n\n297\n00:15:16.095 --> 00:15:20.086\nI can select that, but this is where\nit becomes a little bit more technical.\n\n298\n00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:24.796\nIf I just create a test policy here and\nI don't have to give a description, but\n\n299\n00:15:24.796 --> 00:15:26.836\nyou normally would, of course.\n\n300\n00:15:26.836 --> 00:15:31.534\nNotice it says, hey,\nI need to add in a OMAURI setting.\n\n301\n00:15:31.534 --> 00:15:34.182\nThat's where all of a sudden,\nmy technical expertise.\n\n302\n00:15:34.182 --> 00:15:36.158\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And now goes what the heck is this?\n\n303\n00:15:36.158 --> 00:15:40.554\nWell, it's the way that Windows 10\nactually does register certain features\n\n304\n00:15:40.554 --> 00:15:41.878\ninside of your device.\n\n305\n00:15:41.878 --> 00:15:45.433\nSo it can control things like your\nBluetooth setting, it can actually\n\n306\n00:15:45.433 --> 00:15:49.361\ndo a whole bunch of different things\nthat are available that you can control.\n\n307\n00:15:49.361 --> 00:15:54.420\nAnd if you're not sure, the good thing\nis it gives you a little link here.\n\n308\n00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.044\nThat says hey, here is the settings\nthat you're looking for.\n\n309\n00:15:57.044 --> 00:16:00.937\nBut even when you select those, right, and\nyou go and bring that web page up and you\n\n310\n00:16:00.937 --> 00:16:04.566\ntake a look, the problem is you actually\ndo have to type it in specifically.\n\n311\n00:16:04.566 --> 00:16:09.129\nAnd it is case sensitive, and\nof course it's not context language.\n\n312\n00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:14.260\nIt's these kind of little half\ncharacters and abbreviations.\n\n313\n00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.400\nAnd so we're not taking\nthe time to configure it, but\n\n314\n00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.050\nwe do want to show you that\nyou can create these policies.\n\n315\n00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.370\nMost of us are probably\nnot going to do that.\n\n316\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.900\nSomebody that specializes\nin it probably will.\n\n317\n00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.300\nBut we just want you to know that\nyou can see these policies too.\n\n318\n00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.680\nThe other ones, of course, here is,\nunder the general Reports that you see.\n\n319\n00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.522\nAnd notice that we can do Update Reports,\nand\n\n320\n00:16:33.522 --> 00:16:36.157\nsee what devices actually have updated and\nwhat they haven't.\n\n321\n00:16:36.157 --> 00:16:41.370\nAnd computer inventory reports, as well,\nand, notice they're not pre-generated.\n\n322\n00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.300\nSo, if I select my\ncomputer inventory report,\n\n323\n00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.380\nit actually says what I can go ahead and\ndo.\n\n324\n00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.549\nSo I've just selected All Devices.\n\n325\n00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:51.245\nIf I want to edit that,\nI can actually just say, hey look,\n\n326\n00:16:51.245 --> 00:16:52.520\nI don't want all devices.\n\n327\n00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.240\nI just want all the computers.\n\n328\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.430\nWell, if I wanted all the computers and\nmobile devices, I could do the same thing.\n\n329\n00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.790\nAnd it's not like it's not\ncomprehensive there, but\n\n330\n00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.260\nnotice you don't have to\nselect everything at one time.\n\n331\n00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.958\nAnd normally of course, the more that\nyou filter it the better, right?\n\n332\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:10.400\nIf you have a company that had like\n6,000 devices and you get a whole,\n\n333\n00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.640\nit's gonna take a long\ntime to generate a report.\n\n334\n00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.977\nSo if you can actually kind of weed\nthat down the way that you need to,\n\n335\n00:17:14.977 --> 00:17:15.886\nthat's gonna be the key.\n\n336\n00:17:15.886 --> 00:17:19.410\nSame thing with the operating system and\nmodels but we can go ahead and\n\n337\n00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.080\nselect View Report.\n\n338\n00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.714\nAnd then it will generate\na nice little HTML report for\n\n339\n00:17:24.714 --> 00:17:26.742\nus over here in just a moment.\n\n340\n00:17:26.742 --> 00:17:28.542\nLook at that, it's stuck on 98%.\n\n341\n00:17:28.542 --> 00:17:30.527\nThat is my life right there.\n\n342\n00:17:30.527 --> 00:17:31.746\nNo, I'm joking.\n\n343\n00:17:31.746 --> 00:17:33.383\nA little skeptical I am here.\n\n344\n00:17:33.383 --> 00:17:35.264\n>> And a bit of a cynic.\n\n345\n00:17:35.264 --> 00:17:37.780\n>> I am, just a tad bit.\n\n346\n00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:42.300\nSo you can see right here where I actually\nhave these two VMs, or virtual machines.\n\n347\n00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.030\nAnd you're looking and like,\nwow that's the most boring and\n\n348\n00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.630\nuseless report I've ever seen.\n\n349\n00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.740\nBut if I scroll over to the right, you can\nactually start seeing a whole bunch of\n\n350\n00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.990\ninformation, the processor, the physical\nmemory, the architecture, you name it.\n\n351\n00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:59.891\nAnd then if I wanted to kind of get\nit a little bit better, I can select\n\n352\n00:17:59.891 --> 00:18:04.213\nHardware Details, or actually,\nit looks like it's not doing anything.\n\n353\n00:18:04.213 --> 00:18:07.022\nSo I was hoping that that would give us\na better format instead of me having to\n\n354\n00:18:07.022 --> 00:18:08.530\nscroll across the screen.\n\n355\n00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.020\nBut you can see where it's actually\ntelling everything, the IP address,\n\n356\n00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.920\nthe serial number and VMware.\n\n357\n00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.770\nWho last logged on?\n\n358\n00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:18.630\nI mean, that's pretty good, and\nalso this idea of assigned user.\n\n359\n00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.120\nThat actually is a great thing for\nus to actually point out here too.\n\n360\n00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.570\nThe idea of assigned user is actually\na very important concept as well\n\n361\n00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.800\nbecause of some of the different things,\nespecially when you start talking about\n\n362\n00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:35.130\nbeing able to control what is on the\ncomputer, which are the applications too.\n\n363\n00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.467\nSo if you do have applications\nthat you are pushing out to, well,\n\n364\n00:18:38.467 --> 00:18:42.420\nthe devices on your network, it's right\nhere that you would normally do so.\n\n365\n00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.868\nBut here is the key, and\nthis is why it will fail.\n\n366\n00:18:44.868 --> 00:18:47.200\nAnd that's what I wanted to get to, okay?\n\n367\n00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:53.610\nIf you know that Daniel has actually,\nhe is allowed to be on Intune, okay?\n\n368\n00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.250\nAnd he's actually got\naccess to the portal.\n\n369\n00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.720\nAnd it shows that he can actually add an\napp or deploy an app into the portal, but\n\n370\n00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.520\nthen it fails on him.\n\n371\n00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.610\nIt doesn't let him do it.\n\n372\n00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.310\nWell, what actually ends\nup happening there?\n\n373\n00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:09.800\nWell every device before you can\nactually deploy the apps to it,\n\n374\n00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.970\nyou have to assign a user to a device.\n\n375\n00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:16.260\nSo, in other words, because of the way\nI have the apps showing up which is\n\n376\n00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.220\nthat they're deployed by the user,\nright, Daniel.\n\n377\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.240\nThe problem is,\n\n378\n00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.860\nI have to actually assign Daniel to\nan actual individual device itself.\n\n379\n00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:30.537\nSo, I could come to All Computers then,\nhere, and select Devices.\n\n380\n00:19:30.537 --> 00:19:34.610\nAnd if I wanted to link a user\nto a device, it's fairly simple.\n\n381\n00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.370\nSo here's that 8.1 computer,\n\n382\n00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:40.660\nand you can see now other\ninformation is now shown up here.\n\n383\n00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.220\nWell then I just simply select Link User.\n\n384\n00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.870\nAnd at this point I actually have two\ndifferent users, and there it is.\n\n385\n00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.740\nIt actually already linked you,\nwhich is nice because we tied it\n\n386\n00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.280\ninto that account right away\nwhen we first enrolled it.\n\n387\n00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.570\nSo we can actually do that.\n\n388\n00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.200\nAnd of course, you can change it.\n\n389\n00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.360\nIf you do have a device listed here and\nit's not linked to a user, that's probably\n\n390\n00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:03.220\nwhy it's not actually able to accept\nwhatever the application it is as well.\n\n391\n00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.290\nNow a couple of other things\nespecially with the Intune account.\n\n392\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.210\nI'm going to select ADMIN\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n393\n00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.140\nAnd then when I do that,\nit's going to change its context, and\n\n394\n00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.940\nyou can see the Administration Overview.\n\n395\n00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:20.930\nAnd it's right here that you can control\nthe overall Intune account itself.\n\n396\n00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.430\nSo if you want to manage your Intune\nsubscription, it's right here.\n\n397\n00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.570\nI'm not going to show you all the details\nbehind that right now, but you\n\n398\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.175\ncan actually see right here that that's\nwhere you would actually go to do that.\n\n399\n00:20:30.175 --> 00:20:33.906\nAnd remember that if you do create just\na test account, when you go to the website\n\n400\n00:20:33.906 --> 00:20:36.931\nand is says create a test account,\nit will give you a little bit.\n\n401\n00:20:36.931 --> 00:20:40.220\nWell I have already showed you, it\nnormally allows you have up to 100 users\n\n402\n00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.720\nin the test account, which is pretty good.\n\n403\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.790\nBut then it used to be\non the cloud storage,\n\n404\n00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.250\nwhere they would give you only 2GB.\n\n405\n00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.970\nWhen I was creating this, they actually\nended up giving me 20GB of storage.\n\n406\n00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.540\nAnd you might, what's that for?\n\n407\n00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.400\nIf you are going to be\ndeploying applications,\n\n408\n00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.790\nright, well they give you a bit of storage\nso that you can deploy those applications.\n\n409\n00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.850\nSo that way you load up all\nthe applications into the Intune cloud and\n\n410\n00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.620\nthen that's where you can go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n411\n00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.160\nAnd if you need to purchase more,\n\n412\n00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.920\nyou can also purchase it from here and\ndo a bunch of other things too, okay?\n\n413\n00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.000\nSo it is amazing how you can go ahead and\n\n414\n00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.900\nbegin to do some of those certain\nthings like being able to manage that.\n\n415\n00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:24.540\nNow really the power behind it, right,\nis not what you see on this end, right?\n\n416\n00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.560\nYou know that that's what\nyour actually expectancy.\n\n417\n00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.144\nBut the power is when you can\ndo that remote management,\n\n418\n00:21:31.144 --> 00:21:35.720\njust like what we showed you before\nwhere you could actually go ahead and\n\n419\n00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.478\nget into a device regardless\nof where it is on this planet.\n\n420\n00:21:39.478 --> 00:21:43.574\nAnd be able to do some of the things to it\nthat you just don't expect to have access\n\n421\n00:21:43.574 --> 00:21:47.260\nto do it, especially if they're\nactually somewhere else.\n\n422\n00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.914\nSo, if we were to take, for\nan example, like this ClientA,\n\n423\n00:21:49.914 --> 00:21:51.760\nthis Windows 8.1 computer.\n\n424\n00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.940\nRemember that I can go ahead and\n\n425\n00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.060\nstart telling it to run a bunch\nof these different scans and\n\n426\n00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:00.428\ndo all of these different things, restart\nthe computer, update malware definitions.\n\n427\n00:22:00.428 --> 00:22:04.410\nIf I have policies that didn't get pushed\nout, I can refresh it right now and\n\n428\n00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.180\npush it out there too.\n\n429\n00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.020\nI can also get a fresh\ninventory from a device.\n\n430\n00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.720\nSo I went ahead and selected that\none to get a fresh inventory.\n\n431\n00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.160\nAnd what that will do is actually\nallow me then to take that device and\n\n432\n00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.650\nthen take a look at the software\nthat's installed on that computer.\n\n433\n00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.783\nAnd depending on how much management\nI have with that computer,\n\n434\n00:22:23.783 --> 00:22:26.625\nsometimes I can look through that list and\ngo, oh Daniel,\n\n435\n00:22:26.625 --> 00:22:30.238\nyou aren't supposed to install that\nAngry Birds thing on your computer.\n\n436\n00:22:30.238 --> 00:22:35.216\nWell, there you go, and then you can\nactually go ahead and maybe at that point\n\n437\n00:22:35.216 --> 00:22:39.827\neven selectively say, hey,\nlet me just remove that application too.\n\n438\n00:22:39.827 --> 00:22:42.367\nSo it's amazing about how\nmuch control that you have.\n\n439\n00:22:42.367 --> 00:22:47.237\nAnd remember that's all done underneath\nwhat we call Remote Tasks of what we\n\n440\n00:22:47.237 --> 00:22:49.800\ncan actually do right there.\n\n441\n00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.430\nNow with the mobile devices, it actually\nworks incredibly well, so well that I\n\n442\n00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.960\nlocked myself out of this device earlier\nto the point I couldn't get back into it.\n\n443\n00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.370\nAnd it's kinda amazing when you do that.\n\n444\n00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:05.330\nSo, one of the last features that we want\nto talk about is the control that we have,\n\n445\n00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.710\nit really does depend on the device here.\n\n446\n00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:12.090\nSo, like on most of these computers right,\nif I select this Retire and\n\n447\n00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:15.360\nWipe feature, it really doesn't\nwanna wipe the entire drive.\n\n448\n00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.626\nYou can see where\nthe other one's grayed out.\n\n449\n00:23:16.626 --> 00:23:20.121\nWhere it says full wipe, return to\nthe device to its factory default,\n\n450\n00:23:20.121 --> 00:23:21.970\nthat's as harsh as it gets, right?\n\n451\n00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.990\nYou're saying wipe it completely clean,\n\n452\n00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:27.470\nleave it back at what it was\nwhen it came from the factory.\n\n453\n00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.790\nIt normally does a selective wipe, which\nis saying, hey if Intune installed it,\n\n454\n00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.930\nif Intune deployed it, do that.\n\n455\n00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.660\nAnything that came from Intune,\nlet's just wipe that stuff out and\n\n456\n00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.610\nleave the device as is.\n\n457\n00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.720\nSo, normally that's something\nthat's actually really good.\n\n458\n00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.190\nBut on these mobile devices, though,\nif I select Mobile Devices, and\n\n459\n00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.360\nlet me see if I can\nfind the device itself.\n\n460\n00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.038\nIt does take a little bit of time here.\n\n461\n00:23:51.038 --> 00:23:54.072\nAnd then, if I select Retire and\nWipe here,\n\n462\n00:23:54.072 --> 00:23:57.024\nNotice that this option is actually full.\n\n463\n00:23:57.024 --> 00:24:00.817\nIt actually gives me both of these\nabilities to do what we actually want to\n\n464\n00:24:00.817 --> 00:24:02.420\nbe able to do here.\n\n465\n00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.450\nSo if you notice that,\nthat's exactly right.\n\n466\n00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.987\nSo if we sent this phone out\nwith Daniel on the road.\n\n467\n00:24:07.987 --> 00:24:13.513\nAnd then Daniel calls back us,\nyeah, I left it at the wing place.\n\n468\n00:24:13.513 --> 00:24:15.285\n[LAUGH] And I have no clue.\n\n469\n00:24:15.285 --> 00:24:18.065\nI can't even tell you when I left it,\ncuz I was there for six hours.\n\n470\n00:24:18.065 --> 00:24:20.235\nAnd so, at some point, what can we do?\n\n471\n00:24:20.235 --> 00:24:24.980\nIt means that Intune can actually take\nthis thing, and wipe it perfectly clean.\n\n472\n00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.470\nAnd there it is.\nEven though somebody has the device,\n\n473\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.980\nwhich is kind of sucky, but,\nat the same time, at least now\n\n474\n00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:34.400\nwhatever proprietary and company data\nthat was on this thing, no big deal.\n\n475\n00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.130\nSo, we can actually do stuff like that.\n\n476\n00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:38.210\nThe other thing, of course,\n\n477\n00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:43.810\nis that if you're still looking for,\nyou can remote lock the device too.\n\n478\n00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.320\nSo, let me see if I can\nget Daniel to do this.\n\n479\n00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.300\nSo, it might take a few seconds or so.\n\n480\n00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.860\nSo let's see here.\n\n481\n00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.790\nSo Daniel, hopefully,\nI'm gonna turn this thing on for us.\n\n482\n00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.820\nIf I actually know how to\nturn it on that would help.\n\n483\n00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.070\nIn just a moment it's\nactually gonna turn on here.\n\n484\n00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:02.210\nBut what we can also do is once everything\ncomes up, it's gonna have a little\n\n485\n00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.610\nfeather on it, so you can't see\nit from the screen right now.\n\n486\n00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:09.791\nBut what I should be able to do, let's say\nthat what we're doing is were pretending\n\n487\n00:25:09.791 --> 00:25:13.610\nthat Daniel is actually going to be\na somebody that stole the phone.\n\n488\n00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.380\nAnd we know that's it's actually\nwithin that same building and stuff.\n\n489\n00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.770\nAnd Daniel calls me for\nsome other reason, I can go ahead and\n\n490\n00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.190\njust send a remote lock signal.\n\n491\n00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.470\nAnd that will lock\nthe phone out to do that.\n\n492\n00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.790\nSo even in the middle of somebody\nusing it, I can lock the phone.\n\n493\n00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:34.070\nAnd then at that point they would have\nto go ahead and then wipe that device.\n\n494\n00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.700\nSo Daniel, it's showing me its on, so\n\n495\n00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.520\nif I select the remote lock at this point,\nnow it says, hey, are you sure?\n\n496\n00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.140\nNow this is actually something\nthat you have to be careful of,\n\n497\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.250\ncuz this is what happened before,\nand it's gonna happen again.\n\n498\n00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.060\nRight here, is that when I send that yes,\n\n499\n00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.710\nwhat should end up happening\nhere in just a second.\n\n500\n00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.240\nIs this gonna look like he's in\nthe middle of doing something and\n\n501\n00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.710\nthen it's gonna lock it up.\n\n502\n00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.380\nAnd then it's gonna ask him for\na PIN number.\n\n503\n00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:01.570\nThe problem that's gonna happen is, well,\nI don't know what the PIN number is now.\n\n504\n00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:04.090\nSo even though I thought I\nknew what the PIN number was,\n\n505\n00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:05.270\nwhat should happen here, Ben.\n\n506\n00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.040\nThis is what you see.\n\n507\n00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.270\nIt says, the device is about to be locked,\nand if the status remains pending for\n\n508\n00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.500\nlonger than 15 it may be unreachable.\n\n509\n00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.100\nSo it could be that he's out of range,\n\n510\n00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.890\nhopefully not,\nit was working a little bit ago.\n\n511\n00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.790\nAnd it should end up being where all\nof a sudden it's gonna lock itself and\n\n512\n00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.035\nthen all he has to do is actually entered\nin the right pin, and there it is.\n\n513\n00:26:23.035 --> 00:26:24.585\nSo Daniel's actually showing it.\n\n514\n00:26:24.585 --> 00:26:26.935\nI don't know if he can try and\nshow it here.\n\n515\n00:26:26.935 --> 00:26:28.085\nYeah, you can't see it very much.\n\n516\n00:26:28.085 --> 00:26:30.565\n>> I was totally logged into this thing,\nI was checking it out.\n\n517\n00:26:30.565 --> 00:26:32.015\nIf I was the thief, I had this.\n\n518\n00:26:32.015 --> 00:26:33.537\nI was like yes, I got me a new phone.\n\n519\n00:26:33.537 --> 00:26:34.427\nI'm gonna check out.\n\n520\n00:26:34.427 --> 00:26:37.017\nMaybe there's some cool\ninformation on here that I can\n\n521\n00:26:37.017 --> 00:26:39.357\nmaybe steal some credit card numbers or\nsomething.\n\n522\n00:26:39.357 --> 00:26:41.947\nI don't know, I'm being as nefarious\nas possible at this point.\n\n523\n00:26:41.947 --> 00:26:43.837\nAll of a sudden, it just locked me out.\n\n524\n00:26:43.837 --> 00:26:46.357\nIt just went right to this\nlittle feathered screen.\n\n525\n00:26:46.357 --> 00:26:48.697\nI tried to unlock it, and\nit said enter the PIN.\n\n526\n00:26:48.697 --> 00:26:53.170\nWell, obviously, if I'm a thief, [LAUGH]\nI probably don't know what the PIN is.\n\n527\n00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.610\nNow, if it was Ronnie's, he'd just\nlost it, and he went and found it,\n\n528\n00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.460\nhe would know his PIN, type your PIN in,\nyou'd be back in business.\n\n529\n00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.020\n>> Right.\n>> But if not,\n\n530\n00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.350\nwe're looking at that remote wipe,\naren't we, Ronnie?\n\n531\n00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.917\n>> We really are, and so this is kind\nof the other neat feature behind it,\n\n532\n00:27:04.917 --> 00:27:06.433\nwhich is if we can't find it.\n\n533\n00:27:06.433 --> 00:27:09.926\nSo here it is on my screen right here,\nand you can see where it verifies,\n\n534\n00:27:09.926 --> 00:27:12.213\nit says remote lock is\nexecuted on the device.\n\n535\n00:27:12.213 --> 00:27:16.392\nBut if Daniel says, I can't find it,\nand really, whether it's locked or not,\n\n536\n00:27:16.392 --> 00:27:17.630\nbut it should tell you.\n\n537\n00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.205\nSo this should at least give you\nsome comfort, but if you absolutely\n\n538\n00:27:21.205 --> 00:27:25.110\nwanna ruin that guy's day, because he\nthinks he's got some of the information.\n\n539\n00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:30.370\nWell then, at that point I can select that\nremote lock or that retire, excuse me.\n\n540\n00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:35.340\nAnd select full wipe and return device\nto its factory default and click Yes.\n\n541\n00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.510\nAnd there the information's\nactually now being processed.\n\n542\n00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.155\nOnce that's done it's going\nto remove it from Intune.\n\n543\n00:27:41.155 --> 00:27:44.238\nBecause that device is no longer\nbeing managed by Intune anymore,\n\n544\n00:27:44.238 --> 00:27:46.661\nit is now actually letting\nit do its factory reset and\n\n545\n00:27:46.661 --> 00:27:48.933\ndoing everything else\nthat's available to it.\n\n546\n00:27:48.933 --> 00:27:50.688\nAnd so, they might have a new phone, but\n\n547\n00:27:50.688 --> 00:27:53.490\nthey won't have any of your\nproprietary data on it.\n\n548\n00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:54.960\nThat's the benefit.\n\n549\n00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.560\nThat's how much control\nyou can get with Intune.\n\n550\n00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.590\nWhether you're talking about some\nof these devices like laptops and\n\n551\n00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:03.120\ndesktops where you'll do that selective.\n\n552\n00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.500\nBut on these mobile\ndevices that are handheld,\n\n553\n00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.270\nsmaller, this is actually a great feature.\n\n554\n00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:13.131\nYou do need to be careful, not everybody\nshould have access to the admin console.\n\n555\n00:28:13.131 --> 00:28:15.731\nWhere Daniel goes,\nI wonder if this really works, click.\n\n556\n00:28:15.731 --> 00:28:19.165\nOh, it did really work, so\nyou just got to realize, so yeah,\n\n557\n00:28:19.165 --> 00:28:22.110\nyou do need to be careful\nabout who gets access.\n\n558\n00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.430\nBut it is a lot of management\nstuff that's available.\n\n559\n00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:27.240\n>> Oh, yeah.\nI was gonna say, I know a lot of people\n\n560\n00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.470\nwill complain about having that\nlittle control by administrators.\n\n561\n00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:35.093\nEven though that it is their own phone,\nthere might be a lot of people bringing\n\n562\n00:28:35.093 --> 00:28:37.562\ntheir own devices and\nhooking up things to it.\n\n563\n00:28:37.562 --> 00:28:40.290\nThey wanna get the same kind\nof experience that they would,\n\n564\n00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.010\nif you were giving them a phone.\n\n565\n00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:46.600\nAnd they said, well, you're asking me to\nbe able to allow you to wipe my phone out\n\n566\n00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.270\nand I'm not really comfortable with that.\n\n567\n00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:52.190\nThey gotta remember, it's gonna\nhave company information on it and\n\n568\n00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.676\nif it gets lost or stolen,\n\n569\n00:28:53.676 --> 00:28:57.813\nwe don't want that to be disseminated\nthroughout the rest of the world.\n\n570\n00:28:57.813 --> 00:28:59.890\nWe want that to remain private.\n\n571\n00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:04.360\nSo having that ability to remote wipe it\nis a very important one for us as admins,\n\n572\n00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.960\nso you gotta kinda talk them into it now\nand then, to go, listen buddy this is for\n\n573\n00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.510\nour own safety, to be honest with you.\n\n574\n00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:13.630\nWe're not gonna just willy-nilly be\nwiping phones off for the fun of it.\n\n575\n00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.070\nWe're only gonna do that in\ncase of an emergency situation.\n\n576\n00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.300\nSo, sometimes you gotta\nlet them know that.\n\n577\n00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.090\n>> There's no doubt that this is one\nof these management features that\n\n578\n00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:23.770\nwe just need to at least be\na little bit familiar with.\n\n579\n00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.810\nYou're not gonna master in\nWindows Intune just from one or\n\n580\n00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:31.760\neven a couple of shows here, but at least\nyou can see the power behind and actually\n\n581\n00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.520\nunderstand that hey, here's some of\nthe stuff that it really does work with.\n\n582\n00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.026\nSo remember how you can identify\nit inside of Windows first.\n\n583\n00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:41.170\nYou're gonna see that little agent\nthat's actually being applied on there.\n\n584\n00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:44.830\nInside of the phones you actually\nsee that you can download an app so\n\n585\n00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.150\nthat you can also manage\nit from there as well.\n\n586\n00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:51.330\nBut then, from that point, anything\nthat can really be done management-wise,\n\n587\n00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:55.300\nif you need to update it,\nif you need application on it,\n\n588\n00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.860\nnow it means that Daniel doesn't\nhave to come in from six weeks.\n\n589\n00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.910\nSo you can get all\nthe applications installed,\n\n590\n00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:04.160\nall that can actually be done remotely\nregardless of where he is, and\n\n591\n00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:09.120\nthat is kind of a cool thing about the way\nthat Intune actually ends up working.\n\n592\n00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:13.154\nI did remember one feature I didn't talk\nabout that we need to at least briefly\n\n593\n00:30:13.154 --> 00:30:16.506\nhere, even though Intune is as\npowerful as it is, Daniel you and\n\n594\n00:30:16.506 --> 00:30:18.259\nI have talked about this before.\n\n595\n00:30:18.259 --> 00:30:20.221\nIt's really not designed to work alone,\nright?\n\n596\n00:30:20.221 --> 00:30:21.219\n>> Oh, no, no, no.\n\n597\n00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:25.189\nThis is definitely a feature that\nMicrosoft really wants you to use.\n\n598\n00:30:25.189 --> 00:30:28.673\nI believe they're called\nthe system configuration.\n\n599\n00:30:28.673 --> 00:30:29.670\n>> Yeah.\nThe System Configuration Manager.\n\n600\n00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.494\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> That's it.\n\n601\n00:30:31.494 --> 00:30:34.811\n>> And so what they've also done then\nis made sure that because it really\n\n602\n00:30:34.811 --> 00:30:38.755\nis designed to work with that right, when\nyou think you have a lot of control here,\n\n603\n00:30:38.755 --> 00:30:41.669\nyou don't have as much control\nas you have in a product called\n\n604\n00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:43.950\nSystem Center Configuration Manager.\n\n605\n00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.420\nThere is something called an Intune\nconnector, that you'll find inside\n\n606\n00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:52.240\na System Center Configuration Manager that\nwill help tie it into Windows Intune.\n\n607\n00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.958\nSo as much control as you have,\neven with Intune,\n\n608\n00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:59.460\nthere's in-depth control with\nSystem Center Configuration Manager.\n\n609\n00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:04.088\nTo the nth degree, and that is really\nthe kind of one, two punch combo, but\n\n610\n00:31:04.088 --> 00:31:09.060\nremember that the more stuff that you had,\nthe more it's gonna cost you.\n\n611\n00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.530\nAnd it also means a lot more knowledge\nthat you have to kind of gain to\n\n612\n00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:13.730\nbring everything together.\n\n613\n00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:14.780\nBut remember, if you're working with both,\n\n614\n00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.980\nthere's something called the Windows\nIntune or the Microsoft Intune connection,\n\n615\n00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:22.830\nor what is it called,\nconnector site is what it's called.\n\n616\n00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:25.240\nSo make sure you actually set that up.\n\n617\n00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:29.300\nAnd make sure that that role is\nturned on inside of system center.\n\n618\n00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.530\nAnd then you will be ready to use Intune,\nand the SCC.\n\n619\n00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.531\nWhatever they call it, yeah.\n\n620\n00:31:34.531 --> 00:31:35.598\nThat is what your asking.\n\n621\n00:31:35.598 --> 00:31:36.458\n>> It's a mouthful, that's for sure.\n\n622\n00:31:36.458 --> 00:31:38.478\n>> It is.\nAnd there's a ton behind that.\n\n623\n00:31:38.478 --> 00:31:42.472\nSo, there's probably more shows coming\nup about that in the fear future.\n\n624\n00:31:42.472 --> 00:31:47.421\nBut as of right now, Daniel, I think for\nIntune, even though we've covered a lot\n\n625\n00:31:47.421 --> 00:31:52.156\nof the management stuff, there's still\na little bit for us to talk about, but\n\n626\n00:31:52.156 --> 00:31:56.076\nDaniel you again have let me talk\na lot and that means part three.\n\n627\n00:31:56.076 --> 00:31:57.586\nYou were born a rambling man Ronnie.\n\n628\n00:31:57.586 --> 00:31:58.330\n>> [LAUGH] That is for sure.\n\n629\n00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:02.393\nThat's okay, because he had a lot\nof good information for us to know.\n\n630\n00:32:02.393 --> 00:32:03.832\nThat we do need to know about Intune.\n\n631\n00:32:03.832 --> 00:32:06.952\nI love the fact that Intune is\nbasically Microsoft's gateway drug into\n\n632\n00:32:06.952 --> 00:32:08.988\ntheir System Center Configuration Manager.\n\n633\n00:32:08.988 --> 00:32:10.671\nThat's pretty funny stuff.\n\n634\n00:32:10.671 --> 00:32:14.837\nBut hopefully, you guys are following\nalong, understanding the power and\n\n635\n00:32:14.837 --> 00:32:17.245\nthe depth that we have\nwith Intune itself and\n\n636\n00:32:17.245 --> 00:32:21.235\nthat we can use it as a standalone\nsystem or in conjunction with that SSC.\n\n637\n00:32:21.235 --> 00:32:23.488\nThat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this episode up.\n\n638\n00:32:23.488 --> 00:32:24.974\nHopefully, we'll see you in the next one.\n\n639\n00:32:24.974 --> 00:32:27.910\nSigning off for ITproTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n640\n00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:28.735\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n641\n00:32:28.735 --> 00:32:29.711\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n642\n00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:35.980\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.668 --> 00:00:19.248\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:22.190\nwe are continuing on with\nour Windows 10 content.\n\n6\n00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.840\nJoining us back in\nthe studio again today and\n\n7\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.220\nto help us out with that very endeavor\nis our good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.790\nWes, welcome back to the show and\nhow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.810\n>> It's going great Dan and\n\n10\n00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.080\nas always it's great to be here\non stage with the ITProTV crew.\n\n11\n00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.470\nAnd that's right we're\ngonna be moving along and\n\n12\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.110\nwhat we're gonna be talking about today\nis MDM, mobile device management.\n\n13\n00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.140\nOn the Windows 10 MCSA exam,\n\n14\n00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.460\nyou're probably going to see\na few questions on InTune.\n\n15\n00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.900\nNow we've already had some\nepisodes that showed you a little\n\n16\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.840\nbit around the interface of InTune and\nhow to create groups if you will.\n\n17\n00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.410\nSo, we're not going to cover those, here\nwe're going to learn a little bit more\n\n18\n00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.192\nabout the policies that\nwe have inside of InTune.\n\n19\n00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:03.290\nWe are to talk about some things\nknown as configuration policies,\n\n20\n00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.370\ncompliance policies and then the goal\nis also to show you deploying\n\n21\n00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.730\nthese policies to devices that have\nbeen enrolled in an MDM solution.\n\n22\n00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.660\nNow, I say MDM solution,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n23\n00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.190\nMobile Device Management.\n\n24\n00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.090\nRemember that mobile device management,\n\n25\n00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.020\nit's actually called open MDM is what\nit's based on, it's a It's an open set of\n\n26\n00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.890\nstandards that I do believe\nMicrosoft started it first but\n\n27\n00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.360\nnow it's overseen by another consortium\nand it's an industry wide standard.\n\n28\n00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.010\nHow does Microsoft implement it and\nwhat does it mean for\n\n29\n00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.670\nthe Windows 10 exam for you?\n\n30\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.936\nWell they implement it\nthrough Microsoft Intune.\n\n31\n00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:40.650\nNow if you've been reading any\ndocumentation that maybe goes back\n\n32\n00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.690\na little bit, you'll probably hear us say\nit a couple of times in this episode.\n\n33\n00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.360\nFor a long time it was\ncalled Windows Intune.\n\n34\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.332\nNow, they changed the name around because\nit's a little misleading saying that it\n\n35\n00:01:52.332 --> 00:01:54.195\nonly controls Windows devices.\n\n36\n00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:55.410\nThere's a lot more than that and\n\n37\n00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.685\nwe'll look at some of the operating\nsystems coming up here.\n\n38\n00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:01.905\nSo Dan, I think one of the first things\nwe're gonna look at are the administrative\n\n39\n00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:06.765\nroles right, inside of the Intune\ninterface, it's gonna be important.\n\n40\n00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:10.895\nYou might have a question that\nasks you to set up a user\n\n41\n00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:14.045\ninside of the Intune console.\n\n42\n00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:17.754\nAs I said we're not gonna go over user\ncreation, it's already been covered, but\n\n43\n00:02:17.754 --> 00:02:19.648\nwe are gonna look at the potential roles.\n\n44\n00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:22.415\nSo I've got a little diagram\nup here on my computer here,\n\n45\n00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:26.568\ntalking about some of the administrative\nroles, actually all of the administrative\n\n46\n00:02:26.568 --> 00:02:30.700\nroles that you'll see inside of Windows\nIntune and then we'll discuss these.\n\n47\n00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.550\nYou'll see that we have around\nsix different administrators.\n\n48\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.730\nYou might say five, and\nI'll tell you why here in a second.\n\n49\n00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.270\nTenant administrator is also\na Global Administrator, so some of\n\n50\n00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.770\nthem blur the lines here, but you can\nsee we have six overall administrators.\n\n51\n00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.360\nAnd you really have to be familiar\nwith these, what are their privileges?\n\n52\n00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.330\nWhat can they do inside\nof the Intune console\n\n53\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.780\nif you were to assign this privilege?\n\n54\n00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.140\nSo let's go ahead and\nlook at the first one now.\n\n55\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.870\nThe tenant administrator,\nall right, is really the very first\n\n56\n00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.670\nadministrator if you will that sets up\nthe subscription inside of Windows Intune.\n\n57\n00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.850\nIt becomes again what's known\nas the tenant administrator.\n\n58\n00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.450\nNow, the tenant administrator it\nneeds to be a protected account.\n\n59\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.870\nIn fact Microsoft tells you really\nyou shouldn't be using the tenant\n\n60\n00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.870\nadministrator to do your day\nto day administration because\n\n61\n00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.530\nlike the default administrative account\nwithin Windows, we disabled that.\n\n62\n00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.210\nWell I say we,\n\n63\n00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.370\nMicrosoft disables it by default\nbecause it's the most powerful account.\n\n64\n00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.440\nIn other operating systems,\nwe say the same thing, right?\n\n65\n00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.930\nThat administrative account not\nmatter if you're a root user, or\n\n66\n00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.320\nWindows administrator,\nyou need to keep it protected, why?\n\n67\n00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.550\nIt's got access to everything you can\ndo inside of the operating system,\n\n68\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.870\nthat's no different here, so the tenant\nadministrator, be careful with that one.\n\n69\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.380\nNow, when you set up your subscription,\nyou sign into the Microsoft Intune,\n\n70\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.030\nyou set up your subscription and\nalso try a free trial there.\n\n71\n00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.220\nTry it out, if you're getting prepared for\n\n72\n00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.560\nthe exam, you might wanna be able to\nsee what goes on in the interface.\n\n73\n00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.470\nWith the tenant administrator, they can\nassign all privileges and all roles,\n\n74\n00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.500\nand they're also called\na global administrator, too.\n\n75\n00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.090\nCuz global administrators are not\nlimited in what they can do.\n\n76\n00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.870\nAnd we'll get back to them, just\nunderstand that the global administrator\n\n77\n00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.210\nis also a role of privilege that is\nassigned to a tenant administrator.\n\n78\n00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.920\nNow we've got some well,\n\n79\n00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.790\nwe'll talk about the Global Administrator\nnow, good time for that.\n\n80\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.624\nThe Global Administrator,\nlet's say I'm the tenant all right,\n\n81\n00:04:26.624 --> 00:04:31.075\nI've setup the interns subscription and\nnow I need administrator that can do\n\n82\n00:04:31.075 --> 00:04:35.206\neverything inside of the Intune console,\nI mean everything, right?\n\n83\n00:04:35.206 --> 00:04:38.950\nWell I say Dan, you know what,\nI need to you be my Global Administrator.\n\n84\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.930\nWhat is Dan have access to?\n\n85\n00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.100\nWell, everything, right?\n\n86\n00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.810\nEverything.\n\n87\n00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.700\nDan can assign other administrative roles.\n\n88\n00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.335\nWhat if Dan says okay,\nwe've got an onboarding process and\n\n89\n00:04:49.335 --> 00:04:53.095\nnow we need to assign maybe a billing\nadministrator or a password administrator?\n\n90\n00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:55.040\nDan got that power, right?\n\n91\n00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.200\nYou've gotta be careful with\nthe global administrator and\n\n92\n00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.320\nunderstand that your company can\nhave multiple global administrators,\n\n93\n00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.500\nit's not just limited to a single one.\n\n94\n00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.330\nAnd by default, as a real quick recap,\nremember the tenant administrator\n\n95\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.360\nbecomes the first global administrator\ninside of your business.\n\n96\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.290\n>> So Wes, obviously we have\nthat tenant account, right?\n\n97\n00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.170\nThe tenant administrator, as I like to\ncall him the super-duper administrator,\n\n98\n00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.040\ncuz we have all these other administrative\naccounts that you're showing us.\n\n99\n00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.370\nIs that really for\nbasically administrative delegation?\n\n100\n00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.204\n>> That,\n>> And\n\n101\n00:05:24.204 --> 00:05:24.736\nthat's the purpose of breaking it up?\n\n102\n00:05:24.736 --> 00:05:25.456\n>> That's exactly what it is.\n\n103\n00:05:25.456 --> 00:05:26.316\nYeah, that's exactly.\n\n104\n00:05:26.316 --> 00:05:27.300\n>> Yeah.\n>> One of the things that when you\n\n105\n00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.460\nsay delegating the administration,\n\n106\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.660\nI think of things like principle\nof least privilege, right?\n\n107\n00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.730\nIf I got somebody that I just want them to\nbe able to maybe view user information,\n\n108\n00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.290\nwe'll see that administrative\nrole coming up.\n\n109\n00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.590\nI certainly don't want to make\nthem this role right here.\n\n110\n00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.810\nIf we look at, again, keep in mind\nthat the global administrators,\n\n111\n00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.220\none of the things that they can do is\nperform directory synchronization.\n\n112\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.550\nNow, I'll show you some of the things\nthe service administrators can do.\n\n113\n00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.820\nThe service administrators,\nkeep in mind that's one of the things that\n\n114\n00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.660\nsets the global administrator apart\nfrom all the other administrators.\n\n115\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.010\nIs the fact that doing this directory\nsynchronization up to Intune.\n\n116\n00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.290\nKeep in mind though, that again a company\ncan have multiple global administrators.\n\n117\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.740\nNow, the next one we have is\nthe Billing Administrator.\n\n118\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.040\nAnd I do understand that the billing\nadministrator it does seem like,\n\n119\n00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.010\nwell I think I could probably\nlogically deduce that one on the exam.\n\n120\n00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.480\nWe don't want you to just do that, we want\nyou to know exactly what they can do.\n\n121\n00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.570\nKeep in mind that you're not\njust making purchases and\n\n122\n00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.510\nmanaging your subscriptions,\nit's also managing support tickets.\n\n123\n00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.590\nAnd I don't know what Healt is, but\nhere I'll try my spelling around.\n\n124\n00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.250\n[LAUGH] We'll try to spell that right.\n\n125\n00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.298\nAnd also monitor service health, right?\n\n126\n00:06:35.298 --> 00:06:40.610\nSo any cloud-based service like Intune is,\nyou wanna know, is the service healthy?\n\n127\n00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.510\nDo you have access?\n\n128\n00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.630\nIs it available?\n\n129\n00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.562\nSo they can do that.\n\n130\n00:06:43.562 --> 00:06:47.427\nSo don't just think at the billing\nadministrators only being about managing\n\n131\n00:06:47.427 --> 00:06:50.410\nsubscriptions and\nthen things like making purchases too.\n\n132\n00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.130\nKeep those other two in mind for the exam.\n\n133\n00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.110\nNow we've got a Password Administrator,\nnotice the Password Administrator,\n\n134\n00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.070\nimagine this can manage passwords.\n\n135\n00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.570\nThere again here's something to keep in\nmind, global administrators, like I said,\n\n136\n00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:08.060\nif I make Dan a Global Administrator,\nDan can reset passwords but\n\n137\n00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.280\nit can also manage other administrators,\ntoo.\n\n138\n00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.830\nAll right,\nwith the password administrator,\n\n139\n00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.540\ndon't let this catch you up on the exam,\nbecause yes, they can reset passwords but\n\n140\n00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.480\nit's only to standard users and\nother password administrators.\n\n141\n00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.590\nMight trick you up on the exam,\ndon't let it do that.\n\n142\n00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.470\nAnd then kinda like our other\nbilling administrator that can also\n\n143\n00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.420\nmanage service requests,\nand monitor service health.\n\n144\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.100\nNow, the next one that we have,\nwe got a couple more here,\n\n145\n00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.160\nthe next one that we have is\nthe User Management Administrator.\n\n146\n00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.578\nAnd user management administrator\nresetting passwords and\n\n147\n00:07:43.578 --> 00:07:47.410\nit's not just contingent\non a single user there.\n\n148\n00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.385\nMonitoring service health and\nthis is what sets them a little bit apart\n\n149\n00:07:52.385 --> 00:07:54.850\nfrom the password\n>> Password.\n\n150\n00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:55.384\nI almost forgot.\n\n151\n00:07:55.384 --> 00:07:59.871\nPassword administrator, is because, like\nDan said, delegation of those privileges\n\n152\n00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:03.809\nthat you can do inside of Intune, this\ngives them a little bit more cuz they can\n\n153\n00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:07.130\nalso manage the user accounts and\nthe groups themselves.\n\n154\n00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.700\nAnd then, as well,\nyou can see managing service requests.\n\n155\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.350\nHere's one of the things that\nI'll give you a tip for the exam.\n\n156\n00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.900\nYou might get questions about\nthe administrative roles and\n\n157\n00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:17.730\nwhat they can perform.\n\n158\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.150\nAnd it might be a multiple choice.\n\n159\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.000\nFor instance, you've seen so\nfar that we've got a couple\n\n160\n00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.190\nthat can manage service requests and\nmonitor health, right?\n\n161\n00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.180\nOur billing administrator\ncan monitor health.\n\n162\n00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.750\nOur password administrator\ncan monitor service health.\n\n163\n00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.940\nAnd also, our user management\nadministrator can monitor health.\n\n164\n00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.570\nSo, they might give you\na question that says you need to,\n\n165\n00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.990\nyou've set up your administrative roles,\nright?\n\n166\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.530\nYou've got multiple administrative roles.\n\n167\n00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.730\nWhich of these administrators\ncan monitor service health?\n\n168\n00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.040\nBe aware of that just so, again,\nyou'll get those right on the exam.\n\n169\n00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.240\nSo, the next one that we have here is\nthe service support administrator.\n\n170\n00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.180\nAnd the service support administrator\nis really one of the ones that\n\n171\n00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.360\nhas just about the most\nrestrictive access.\n\n172\n00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.270\nIt's really managing support tickets and\nmonitoring service health, but\n\n173\n00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.370\nthere is another one in there.\n\n174\n00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.820\nThey can view the organizational and\nthe user information.\n\n175\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.300\nCan't modify it, so\nit's more like a read-only.\n\n176\n00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.400\nBut they can do that.\n\n177\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.540\nPrimarily, you might use a service support\nadministrator for just support tickets and\n\n178\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.890\njust monitoring service help.\n\n179\n00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.410\nSo, few different roles that we have, Dan.\n\n180\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:24.310\nI would say for the exam, definitely\nbe aware of those administrative roles.\n\n181\n00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.570\nBe aware of what you can,\nlike Dan said, delegate out to them.\n\n182\n00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.800\nAnd then, know that some of those roles\nthey can do the same thing, right?\n\n183\n00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.810\nJust in case they give you a multiple\nchoice question asking you\n\n184\n00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.700\nwhich one of these administrators\ncan perform x, y and z.\n\n185\n00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.570\nChoose two,\nyou'll have both of those ready for you.\n\n186\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.570\n>> Awesome stuff with that.\n\n187\n00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.432\nTake Russell's advice,\nhe's totally right on that.\n\n188\n00:09:44.432 --> 00:09:47.710\nYou wanna make sure that you know\nevery different type of administrative\n\n189\n00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.380\naccount that they have that's\ninherent to an Intune environment.\n\n190\n00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.560\nNow, talking about things where you\ncan inherit to Intune environments,\n\n191\n00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.920\nthat's gonna be policies.\n\n192\n00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.680\nThey love to create a policy,\na policy for this, make a policy for\n\n193\n00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.480\nyou to get up in the morning if you\ncould do it, to be honest with you.\n\n194\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.925\nSo that brings us in to, and I guess we\nshould start with configuration policies.\n\n195\n00:10:03.925 --> 00:10:05.405\nProbably a really good area to start,\nright?\n\n196\n00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:08.075\n>> Dan, configuration policies\nare a good place to start.\n\n197\n00:10:08.075 --> 00:10:10.505\nSo, let's go ahead and\nrather than just talk about it,\n\n198\n00:10:10.505 --> 00:10:14.797\nlet's dive in to the Windows Intune, there\nI go again, Microsoft Intune interface,\n\n199\n00:10:14.797 --> 00:10:17.137\nand let's look at those policies.\n\n200\n00:10:17.137 --> 00:10:19.787\nAll right.\nNow, in the Intune interface,\n\n201\n00:10:19.787 --> 00:10:22.557\nyou'll see here that we have\nthe dashboard, the series of icons,\n\n202\n00:10:22.557 --> 00:10:24.237\nlike they've gone through\nin past episodes.\n\n203\n00:10:24.237 --> 00:10:27.190\nBut the one that we're really going\nto be focusing on today, really,\n\n204\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.880\nit's just the compliance policies.\n\n205\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.920\nAnd you'll see that there,\nthe policies in general I should say,\n\n206\n00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.560\nyou can see that there\nare series of policies, right?\n\n207\n00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.590\nAnd the one, first one on the list,\nis configuration policies.\n\n208\n00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:42.548\nNow, a configuration policy, and you can\nsee that we've got some already set up for\n\n209\n00:10:42.548 --> 00:10:44.468\nus, let's kinda look at what we can do.\n\n210\n00:10:44.468 --> 00:10:48.625\nAnd with the configuration policies here,\n\n211\n00:10:48.625 --> 00:10:53.130\nyou get a couple of different options,\nright?\n\n212\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.780\nAnd one of the biggest\noptions here that we have is,\n\n213\n00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.050\nwell, what operating systems do we want?\n\n214\n00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.160\nWhat devices do we wanna support,\nall right?\n\n215\n00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.688\nYou can see that there's Android devices.\n\n216\n00:11:01.688 --> 00:11:02.668\nYou can see iOS.\n\n217\n00:11:02.668 --> 00:11:06.060\nYou can see Mac OS X and Windows.\n\n218\n00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.630\nNow, be very careful when you're in\nhere and you're deploying a policy.\n\n219\n00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.560\nAll right?\nBecause they will tell you, for\n\n220\n00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.430\nthe most part,\nwith Android it's 4.0 and higher.\n\n221\n00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.470\nThey do have, some of the things,\nkeep in mind,\n\n222\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.930\nwith KNOX the Android\nbased security solution,\n\n223\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:27.200\nmake sure that if you're deploying\na policy that KNOX is on the device.\n\n224\n00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.390\nWhen it comes to your iIOS devices,\nyou're talking about your 7.1 and later.\n\n225\n00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.450\nAnd you can see that, depending on,\n\n226\n00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.964\nwell, pretty much with iOS it's all 7.1 or\nlater.\n\n227\n00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:41.810\nNow, it does get a little tricky\nwhen you get into Windows.\n\n228\n00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:46.010\nMac OS, you're gonna see,\nis 10.9 and higher, right, for\n\n229\n00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.680\nall of the configuration\npolicies that you can do with it.\n\n230\n00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.810\nThe next one we have, and this is where it\ndoes get a little tricky, interestingly\n\n231\n00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:57.150\nenough, is that Windows supports multiple\nversions of the operating system, but\n\n232\n00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.470\nthey do have some that\nare specific to Windows 10.\n\n233\n00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:05.010\nAnd you certainly don't have to know every\npolicy in this list to pass the exam.\n\n234\n00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:08.970\nBut one of the big takeaways\nthat I would say is be careful,\n\n235\n00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:13.160\nright, know what devices you're supporting\nand make sure the configuration policy\n\n236\n00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.900\nthat you do configure and deploy that\nit's supported by the operating system.\n\n237\n00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.700\nSo, since this is a Windows 10 show,\nI'll tell you what, we'll go ahead and\n\n238\n00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.650\nwe'll do Windows, desktop and\nmobile and later.\n\n239\n00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.990\nI don't know if there's anything\nlater than Windows 10 right now.\n\n240\n00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.330\nI don't really think so.\n\n241\n00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.380\nBut we'll go ahead and create the policy.\n\n242\n00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.520\nNow, let's go ahead and\nlook at this real quick.\n\n243\n00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.060\nSome of the policies come with templates\nthat say we've taken all the common\n\n244\n00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.160\nsettings that are in this policy as\nthe template and we configure it for you.\n\n245\n00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.752\nYou don't have to configure it.\n\n246\n00:12:43.752 --> 00:12:45.260\nHowever, well, that would be too easy and\n\n247\n00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.410\nthe show would be a little\nshorter if we went by templates.\n\n248\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:52.430\nBut you can see is that not every single\npolicy gets its own template, right?\n\n249\n00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.870\nIt's gonna mean you're gonna have to go in\nthere and manually define the settings,\n\n250\n00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.090\nand that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n251\n00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.070\nIn fact, that's what we're gonna do\npretty much for all of our policies here.\n\n252\n00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.882\nWe'll create the policy, all right?\n\n253\n00:13:03.882 --> 00:13:09.590\nAnd we'll look more at policy creation and\nthe settings here coming up.\n\n254\n00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.570\nOne of the things that I wanna look at\nmore than anything, let me go ahead.\n\n255\n00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.820\nI tell you what, I wanna get one that's\na little bit more generalized there.\n\n256\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.610\nLet me go back to my\nConfiguration Policies, and choose Add.\n\n257\n00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.690\nI'm gonna go with one that's\nWindows 8.1 or higher,\n\n258\n00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:29.150\ncuz keep in mind that that also\naffects our Windows 10 desktops.\n\n259\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.410\nAnd I want you to see some\nof the basic settings here.\n\n260\n00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:37.460\nAnd when you look, there we go, there's\none that has more of the common settings.\n\n261\n00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.290\nWe can see that we can configure\nthings like passwords,\n\n262\n00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.150\nencryption, malware types here.\n\n263\n00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.380\nWe can do systems, as far as updates.\n\n264\n00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.390\nCloud information, right?\n\n265\n00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.260\nCloud integration, right?\n\n266\n00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.340\nIf you're using work folders.\n\n267\n00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.840\nWe've got an episode of work folders,\n\n268\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.450\nyou don't know what work folders is,\ngo check out the work folders episode.\n\n269\n00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.270\nBut we can also configure some of those\nsettings here in the InTune console.\n\n270\n00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.940\nSame thing that goes\nwith your email settings,\n\n271\n00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.175\napplications, all\ndifferent kind of things.\n\n272\n00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:04.430\nPop-up blocker.\n\n273\n00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:08.190\nAre we gonna require somebody to\nhave the pop-up blocker turned on?\n\n274\n00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.070\nYou have things down in here\nlike Smartscreen Filter as well,\n\n275\n00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.110\ndevice capabilities here.\n\n276\n00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.930\nCellular.\n\n277\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.550\nWe have the ability to,\nwe're not gonna allow data roaming, right?\n\n278\n00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.620\nMaybe we've got a company that is managing\nall of their own mobile phones, and\n\n279\n00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.620\nobviously they've got data plans, and\nthey don't want these devices roaming and\n\n280\n00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.430\nchewing through all of\nthe data in the data plan.\n\n281\n00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.330\nWell, how about we just disable that?\n\n282\n00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.890\n>> Yeah.\nWes, this reminds me a lot of the network\n\n283\n00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:34.720\naccess protection.\n\n284\n00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.590\nOr more generally, they call it network\naccess control, where you have to\n\n285\n00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:43.620\nmeet a specific set of rules before\nyou get to do anything on our network.\n\n286\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.150\n>> That's right.\n\n287\n00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.260\nAnd you can couple that, too.\n\n288\n00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.850\nAnd it's not really something that\nyou need to worry about for the exam.\n\n289\n00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:52.520\nBut you can couple it with\nthings like health, what is it,\n\n290\n00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.050\nwhere it connects and it says here's what\nmy configurations are, which is a lot like\n\n291\n00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.860\nnetwork access protection inside of\nWindows, which is network access control.\n\n292\n00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.670\nSo, yeah.\nWe\n\n293\n00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:06.700\ndo have the ability to control these\nsettings, and If the device or\n\n294\n00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.050\nthe desktop or mobile device isn't\nin compliance, well, guess what?\n\n295\n00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.470\nThey don't get to join to the network or\njoin to those resources.\n\n296\n00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.000\nNow, let me make sure when I say network,\nwhen we say network access control,\n\n297\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.910\nwe're talking about joining\nyour company network, right?\n\n298\n00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.670\nSame thing, almost considered almost like\nyour resource access control, right?\n\n299\n00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.260\nBecause it's out there on the Cloud,\nstill the same concept.\n\n300\n00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.190\nBut where is that information residing?\n\n301\n00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:31.510\nIn this case, it's the Cloud.\n\n302\n00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.700\nBut the concept is identical, all right.\n\n303\n00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.460\nSo, configuration policies, as you can\nsee quite a few different settings\n\n304\n00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.370\nthat we can configure and\nwe can deploy out to our endpoints.\n\n305\n00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.380\n>> All right.\nWell, Wes,\n\n306\n00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.677\nwhat else do we need to know when it\ncomes to policies inside of InTune?\n\n307\n00:15:45.677 --> 00:15:46.290\n>> We got a bunch, I can tell you.\n\n308\n00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.386\n[LAUGH]\n>> But wait, there's more, right?\n\n309\n00:15:47.386 --> 00:15:48.548\n>> Wait, there's more.\n\n310\n00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:51.431\n[LAUGH] If you buy now-\n>> Ginsu knives.\n\n311\n00:15:51.431 --> 00:15:52.544\nThat's right.\n\n312\n00:15:52.544 --> 00:15:57.730\nWe've got also compliance policies that\nI kind of want to talk about some too.\n\n313\n00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:59.700\nBecause they're also important here.\n\n314\n00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:04.520\nAnd if you look, compliant policies,\nyou might notice a difference right away.\n\n315\n00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.250\nWhen I chose add, because for the most\npart the interface looks the same,\n\n316\n00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:12.140\nyou might notice that there is something\nthat I don't get the option to do here.\n\n317\n00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.510\nMy heads kinda covered it up here but\nif you look, let me go ahead and\n\n318\n00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.070\nget out of this there.\n\n319\n00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:23.560\nIf you look here, we don't get the option\nto pick and choose what devices.\n\n320\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.800\nYou might say, well wait a second Wes, if\nI don't get to pick and choose, you told\n\n321\n00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.000\nme on the configuration policies that you\nhave to be very careful in the devices\n\n322\n00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.760\nthat you implement these policies on\nbecause they might not even affect them.\n\n323\n00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.940\nWell how would you know\nhere in compliance policy?\n\n324\n00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.920\nWell it's a little easier inside of the\ncompliance policies and let me show you.\n\n325\n00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.110\nYou really can't see it if any\nof these settings in here,\n\n326\n00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.620\nthey aren't turned on but\nthe moment I turn these on.\n\n327\n00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.900\nLet's say I decide I\nwant a password policy.\n\n328\n00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.920\nNotice what we have here.\n\n329\n00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.220\nNotice that if I zoom in here\nit is telling me exactly\n\n330\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.700\nwhat devices this supports before\nI even deploy the setting.\n\n331\n00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.570\nWhere the policies that you create with a\nconfiguration policy is a global suite of\n\n332\n00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:10.870\nsettings that apply to this specific\nmodel, these are granular and\n\n333\n00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:12.020\nthey're individual.\n\n334\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.140\nYou can do them on a settings\nby settings basis.\n\n335\n00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.440\nSo I might come here and say,\n\n336\n00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.050\nyou know what, I've got some\nWindows RT tabs that I wanna define.\n\n337\n00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:23.398\nAnd there's a couple in here that\naren't supported by NT or RT excuse me.\n\n338\n00:17:23.398 --> 00:17:26.576\nDefinitely not supported by NT,\nthat went out what, 30, 40 years ago.\n\n339\n00:17:26.576 --> 00:17:27.134\n>> Yeah.\n\n340\n00:17:27.134 --> 00:17:29.754\n>> But you will see that there\nare some of these policies.\n\n341\n00:17:29.754 --> 00:17:33.746\nI'm trying to find a couple of\nthem that it says right way,\n\n342\n00:17:33.746 --> 00:17:36.277\nnot supported on Windows 8.1 RT.\n\n343\n00:17:36.277 --> 00:17:40.195\nSo that is one of the great things if you\nare configuring and let me be careful with\n\n344\n00:17:40.195 --> 00:17:44.150\nthat, configuring a compliance policy,\nboy that would get confusing.\n\n345\n00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.100\nIf you are trying to decide what\nsettings in here you want to deploy out\n\n346\n00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.490\nto your devices you just have to do it on\na settings by settings basis making sure\n\n347\n00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:56.850\nthat those settings are available and\nagain, one of the great things.\n\n348\n00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.860\nLook at all these little\ninformation markers here.\n\n349\n00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.340\nAll of them.\n\n350\n00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.030\nThere we go.\nThere's one, right there Dan.\n\n351\n00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.690\nI knew there was a few of\nthem in here you could see.\n\n352\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:09.310\nLook at that.\nIt says, not available on Windows RT tab.\n\n353\n00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.790\nSo I know that if I am\nmanaging Windows RT tabs,\n\n354\n00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.880\nthis setting isn't gonna be available.\n\n355\n00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.410\nYou say, well wait a second.\n\n356\n00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.390\nWhy would you be doing that?\n\n357\n00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.290\nWhy would you even care?\n\n358\n00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.540\nWell Windows are t-tabs they,\ncan't join a corporate domain.\n\n359\n00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.410\nThere's no way for\n\n360\n00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:28.020\nme to control them through the traditional\nmanagement techniques like group policy.\n\n361\n00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.890\nYou join a domain, group policy is applied\nand all of the configurations that\n\n362\n00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:36.980\nthe administrator has defined get applied\nto the computer or the user in that case.\n\n363\n00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.330\nWindows RT,\nI can't join it to the network.\n\n364\n00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.610\nSo how do I manage it?\n\n365\n00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.970\nIf my company decides we\njust brought a 100 RT tabs.\n\n366\n00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.960\nWell that's where Intune comes in.\n\n367\n00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.150\nBut then you also have to pay attention,\nit's almost like a double negative.\n\n368\n00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.220\nYou've got to be careful because then\nyou got to turn around and find that\n\n369\n00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.780\nthe settings that you want to manage\nthese Windows RT tabs aren't available.\n\n370\n00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.250\nSo just Just be careful with\nwhat settings you do apply.\n\n371\n00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.530\nI'm gonna go ahead and cancel this here.\n\n372\n00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:05.280\nSo just be careful with the settings\nthat you do apply inside of your\n\n373\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.550\ncompliance policies.\n\n374\n00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:11.790\nRemember that they are a settings by\nsettings basis rather than a global suite\n\n375\n00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.780\nof settings and\nconfigurations if you will,\n\n376\n00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.210\nthat apply to a specific type of device.\n\n377\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.850\n>> Wow, obviously you gotta\npay a little attention there.\n\n378\n00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.140\nYou can't just willy\nnilly be jumping around.\n\n379\n00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.280\nYou want to use this as a fine tuning,\nright, Wes?\n\n380\n00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.270\nMake sure that all the little settings\nthat you have that you want to go through\n\n381\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:28.970\nis what you want.\n\n382\n00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.635\nOtherwise, you can keep people\nfrom getting on your network.\n\n383\n00:19:31.635 --> 00:19:34.260\n[LAUGH] Then you got an angry person\non the end of the phone going,\n\n384\n00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.240\nI can't connect.\n\n385\n00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.485\nAnd you're like, well are you running\nthis, are you running that and\n\n386\n00:19:37.485 --> 00:19:38.780\nI gotta check the setting there.\n\n387\n00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.500\n>> That's one of the good\nthings though cuz in this,\n\n388\n00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.350\nwe're probably gonna have a couple of\nepisodes I could tell you that but\n\n389\n00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.140\nwe are gonna show you how to at\nleast set some support information.\n\n390\n00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.140\nSo if you don't do what Dan said and\nbe careful here\n\n391\n00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.470\nat least you can give them some support\ninformation to call your help desk.\n\n392\n00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.310\n>> Yeah, that's always a helpful thing.\n\n393\n00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:56.820\nGive you that information there.\n\n394\n00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.560\nWell Wes,\nwe've gone through a lot of policies.\n\n395\n00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.540\nIs there anything else, other policies\nthat we need to discuss before\n\n396\n00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.970\nour show is starting to\nwrap down on the time?\n\n397\n00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:04.490\n>> Definitely.\n\n398\n00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:08.350\nThere are a hand full of other ones\nthat I just kinda wanna show you.\n\n399\n00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.390\nI wouldn't worry about them too\nmuch on the exam except for\n\n400\n00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.300\none thing that we'll talk about here.\n\n401\n00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.070\nThese are conditional access policies.\n\n402\n00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:22.000\nAnd with the conditional access policies\nthere's a couple that might confuse you.\n\n403\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.460\nNotice that Exchange Online Policy,\nConditional Access policy and\n\n404\n00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.110\nit says you have to set up\nyour Exchange Connector.\n\n405\n00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.950\nThat connects it to your Exchange server,\nyour accounts.\n\n406\n00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.040\nI want you to be aware of that setting\nup the Exchange Connector for the exam.\n\n407\n00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:36.640\nThat's a big one.\n\n408\n00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.190\nSo if they ask you, you need to connect\nand you need to use Exchange Online,\n\n409\n00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.910\nhow do you control access to that,\ngive conditional access to that?\n\n410\n00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.740\nThrough one of these policies after\nyou set up the Exchange Connector.\n\n411\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:52.010\nAnd then there are a series of other\npolicies, SharePoint online, Skype for\n\n412\n00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.840\nBusiness online.\n\n413\n00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.870\nKeep in mind that really\nthe old way of managing Intune\n\n414\n00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:00.000\nin things like Windows 8 and\n8.1 has really gone away.\n\n415\n00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.630\nThey taken the Intune console and\nthey've integrated it into Office 365 and\n\n416\n00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:09.190\nthat's why you see a lot of these\nOffice 365 services online here.\n\n417\n00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:14.310\nNow be careful here because one of\nthe things that's a little bit different\n\n418\n00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.920\nis Exchange ActiveSync.\n\n419\n00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:22.400\nOkay, Exchange ActiveSync, you still have\nto set up the Exchange Connector but\n\n420\n00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.870\nkeep in mind that this is gonna be managed\non premise, so do keep that in mind and\n\n421\n00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.810\nthen there are a couple of other\nones there that you've got.\n\n422\n00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.800\nYou've got your corporate device\nenrollments but the ones that I would\n\n423\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.260\nreally pay attention to are the ones\nthat Dan and I have been focused in on.\n\n424\n00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.040\nDefinitely pay attention to the\nconfiguration and the compliance policies.\n\n425\n00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.640\nWhen it comes to\nthe conditional access policies,\n\n426\n00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.920\njust really know that you should,\nif you're talking about exchange,\n\n427\n00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.980\nyou should be setting up\nan exchange connector.\n\n428\n00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:51.220\nAnd again, just connecting Intune to\nyour exchange server on your network and\n\n429\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.640\nthen from there you can control\nthings like your access.\n\n430\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.270\n>> All right.\n\n431\n00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:58.220\nWell, Wes, we've gone over a lot of ground\nhere when it comes to the old Intune.\n\n432\n00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.840\nSo if this is your first foray\ninto Intune environment,\n\n433\n00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.990\nmake sure that you go over\nthese concepts a few times.\n\n434\n00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:05.720\nPlay with it a little bit.\n\n435\n00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.340\nI do believe that they will give you\na free, you can sign up for free.\n\n436\n00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.110\nAnd try it out before you buy it.\n\n437\n00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.500\nSo do that and go play with it.\n\n438\n00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.410\nSee what you can find out.\n\n439\n00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.980\nMaybe create some of these policies,\nconnect some devices.\n\n440\n00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.630\nAnd we're actually gonna be doing\nsome of that in an upcoming episode.\n\n441\n00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:19.620\nCorrect, Chris?\n>> Absolutely.\n\n442\n00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.550\nWe've got a lot more to go but\nLike Dan said,\n\n443\n00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.520\napparently I talked a lot in this one.\n\n444\n00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.720\n>> He's a talker, this one.\n\n445\n00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.210\nBut it's all good talk,\nso we appreciate it.\n\n446\n00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.950\nThanks for stopping by Wes,\nwe look forward to seeing you in, well,\n\n447\n00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.620\nanother episode on Intune\nto be honest with you.\n\n448\n00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.010\nWe hope to see you guys there as well.\n\n449\n00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.570\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off though.\n\n450\n00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:37.740\nFor IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n451\n00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.668\n>> And I'm Wes Brian, and\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n452\n00:22:40.668 --> 00:22:48.280\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:19.334\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:22.210\nwe are continuing on with\nmore Windows 10 content.\n\n6\n00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.170\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to help us out with that very,\n\n7\n00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.720\nvery topic, is our good friend,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.780\nWes, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.310\nHow's it going?\n>> It's going great, Dan.\n\n10\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.940\nAlways good to be here in\nthe studios with ITProTV, and\n\n11\n00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.820\nthat's right,\nwe are coming back with a part two.\n\n12\n00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.520\nYes, this is gonna be\nsupporting Microsoft Intune,\n\n13\n00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.320\nthe sequel, as I definitely talked\na lot in the first episode.\n\n14\n00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.870\nAnd let's kind of recap,\nif you're joining us,\n\n15\n00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.760\njust joining us, you might wanna\ngo back and look at part one and\n\n16\n00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.390\nthen come back and\ncheck the second part of this out.\n\n17\n00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.666\nIn the first part we talked about\nthe administrative roles and\n\n18\n00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.879\nsome of the privileges that you\ncould delegate out to them and\n\n19\n00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.680\nthe different things that\nthe administrator themselves can do.\n\n20\n00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.570\nWe also looked at some of the policies.\n\n21\n00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.840\nRemember the configuration,\ncompliance policies and\n\n22\n00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.300\nmentioned a little bit about that\nconditional access policies but.\n\n23\n00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.240\nHere in this episode,\nwe're not gonna talk about them.\n\n24\n00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.570\nWe're gonna show you how to\nconfigure them and deploy them.\n\n25\n00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.900\nSo, tell you what, let's go and\n\n26\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.010\njump right in and we're gonna\nconfigure some configuration policies.\n\n27\n00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.680\nConfiguring, configuring.\n\n28\n00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.450\nAnd I am logged into\nthe Microsoft Intune here, and\n\n29\n00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.200\none of the things that I would say for the\nexam is, be aware of the icons themselves.\n\n30\n00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.470\nCuz they might ask you, where do you\nconfigure policies, and you might say,\n\n31\n00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.870\nwell, right there where it says Policy,\nWes.\n\n32\n00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.540\nRight?\n\n33\n00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.190\nThey won't probably have them labeled.\n\n34\n00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.990\nSo they just wanna, again, test,\nhave you even been into the interface?\n\n35\n00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.330\nSo we're gonna go to Policies down here,\nand\n\n36\n00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.140\nwe're gonna be selecting first here,\nthe Configuration Policies.\n\n37\n00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.593\nAll right, and remember, one of the things\nthat we talked about in the first episode\n\n38\n00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:58.919\nis that when you add a policy, you have to\nbe careful as to which operating system,\n\n39\n00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:02.200\nor device, if you will,\nthat you're gonna support.\n\n40\n00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.560\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ndeploy a configuration policy, and\n\n41\n00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.010\nwhat we're gonna do here is,\nwe'll take one of these that's for, say,\n\n42\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.800\nWindows 8.1 and later, and look down\nthrough here and find a good one.\n\n43\n00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.100\nThere we go.\nWe'll do General Configuration Policy.\n\n44\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.150\nNow, with the policies themselves,\n\n45\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.130\nremember how we told\nyou in the first part,\n\n46\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.860\nsome of these have templates that you\ndefine the recommended settings for you.\n\n47\n00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.920\nOthers of them do not.\n\n48\n00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.670\nThis is one that you can\nsee that it's grayed out.\n\n49\n00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.350\nIf it's grayed out,\nobviously that option isn't available.\n\n50\n00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.150\nSo pay attention to that when\nyou are making your policies.\n\n51\n00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.980\nNow, with your policies,\nyour naming convention is up to you.\n\n52\n00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.750\nJust like in some of the episodes\nthat we talked about.\n\n53\n00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.290\nFor instance, like firewall rules.\n\n54\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.690\nIf you're making custom firewall rules\nyou're going to label them what you want.\n\n55\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.400\nHere's one of the things\nthat I would recommend,\n\n56\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.080\nmake sure they are easily identifiable.\n\n57\n00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.520\nBecause as you get more and more devices,\n\n58\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.090\nmaybe some of those devices support users\nthat have different roles in your company.\n\n59\n00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.150\nYou might not have\na one-size-fits-all type of policy.\n\n60\n00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.290\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead here.\n\n61\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.120\nSince this is a configuration policy,\nI'm gonna just, we'll type just config_,\n\n62\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.440\nI'll say, mobile device management.\n\n63\n00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.840\nAnd we'll say policy 2,\n\n64\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.840\nall right and descriptions.\n\n65\n00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.210\nNow, here something that I do with the\npolicies and I'm gonna use a description,\n\n66\n00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.170\nI'm not really gonna do it right here,\nyou'll see some of the other policies.\n\n67\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.550\nI typically, if I only have a hand\nfull of settings in the policy,\n\n68\n00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.010\nit's a small policy it's\njust got some password,\n\n69\n00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.260\nI define the settings right\nhere in the description.\n\n70\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.180\nWell, why is that so important for me?\n\n71\n00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.580\nWell, let me cancel this\npolicy out real quick, and\n\n72\n00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.300\nI'll show you based on some of\nthe policies that I already have.\n\n73\n00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.950\nHere you can see that I have a MDM\npolicy already in place, right?\n\n74\n00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.140\nAnd if I select on that, well, I won't\nhave to open it up to see the details,\n\n75\n00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.070\nto know what this policy is doing for\nme, right?\n\n76\n00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.410\nBut if you'll notice down here,\nlook what I have.\n\n77\n00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.030\nIn the description I can say, we know it's\na configuration policy because that's\n\n78\n00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.690\nwhere you're starting with it, but notice\nthat I can see require password to unlock,\n\n79\n00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.320\nyes, and then some of the characteristics.\n\n80\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.740\nNow, some of these policies can\ndefine a lot of settings and\n\n81\n00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.380\nyou certainly wouldn't want to\nput that in the description.\n\n82\n00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.310\nCuz you'd be scrolling through it,\nand you might as well, at that point,\n\n83\n00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.880\njust open it up.\n\n84\n00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.010\nBut if it's a base policy like this,\nmaybe just a password policy,\n\n85\n00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.550\nyou can put it in the description.\n\n86\n00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.330\nMakes it easily identifiable.\n\n87\n00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.680\nSo let me go ahead back here and\nadd that policy again, and\n\n88\n00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.090\nwe'll do our, in the list here somewhere.\n\n89\n00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.680\nThere we go, general configuration,\nno template available, or\n\n90\n00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.090\nno recommended settings available.\n\n91\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.560\nAnd we'll just kinda get\nback to where we were.\n\n92\n00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.240\nI call this config_ MDM.\n\n93\n00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.985\nI'll call it policy 1.\n\n94\n00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.690\nDescription, I'm just going to leave\nthe description off on this one,\n\n95\n00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.465\nand do we want to apply all\nconfigurations to Windows 10?\n\n96\n00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:04.965\nSo that's one of the good things about\nthis policy that we're gonna put into\n\n97\n00:05:04.965 --> 00:05:09.305\nplace is because, yes, it supports\nWindows 8.1 but it's and later too.\n\n98\n00:05:09.305 --> 00:05:11.665\nSo we could say, hey yeah, you know\nwe're gonna define these settings for\n\n99\n00:05:11.665 --> 00:05:14.475\nthe Windows 10 operating system as well.\n\n100\n00:05:14.475 --> 00:05:18.495\nNow, when we configure our policy,\nour configuration policy here,\n\n101\n00:05:18.495 --> 00:05:20.915\nwe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nset a couple of things up, right?\n\n102\n00:05:20.915 --> 00:05:25.080\nRequire a password type, all right, well,\nmaybe I don't wanna require a password.\n\n103\n00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.410\nWell, for security purposes\nthat's not really a good idea.\n\n104\n00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.600\nSo we're going to require a password.\n\n105\n00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.560\nWe're going to leave it just alphanumeric.\n\n106\n00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.450\nI'll tell you what.\n\n107\n00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.220\nWe're going to do numeric.\n\n108\n00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.110\nCan we do alphanumeric?\n\n109\n00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.390\nYeah, I can do alphanumeric.\n\n110\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.220\nI'm just going to leave\na single character set.\n\n111\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.270\nNow password length,\nmy password length on this one,\n\n112\n00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.440\nwe're gonna call this\n10 character password.\n\n113\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.100\nI'm gonna be really,\nreally brutal on our users here.\n\n114\n00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.540\nWe'll probably get a lot\nof help desk tickets.\n\n115\n00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.200\nPassword lifetime, right?\n\n116\n00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.090\nPassword expiration.\n\n117\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.320\nI'm gonna go ahead and set that,\nand I'll set this one to 20 days.\n\n118\n00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.500\nI guess I don't need the days in there.\n\n119\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.246\n>> That love just turned to hatred.\n\n120\n00:06:02.246 --> 00:06:03.262\n[LAUGH]\n>> It did!\n\n121\n00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:04.870\n[LAUGH] That's right, that's right.\n\n122\n00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.980\nNow, make sure that if you have any other\nsettings in here, just kind of scroll\n\n123\n00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.970\ndown and make sure that there aren't\nany other settings that are turned on.\n\n124\n00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.060\nIn case you get one of these\nsettings that maybe was turned on.\n\n125\n00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.850\nAnd that's very important too, when they\nsay, deploy the recommended settings.\n\n126\n00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.810\nEven though it's a recommended suite\nof configuration, there might be\n\n127\n00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.070\none setting in that recommendation\nthat doesn't apply to your users, so\n\n128\n00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.270\ngo ahead and\njust make sure that you disable it.\n\n129\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.940\nAll right, now,\n\n130\n00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.050\nfairly easy, straight-forward,\nwe're gonna save the policy.\n\n131\n00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.630\nNow, it does give me the option,\ndo you wanna deploy this policy now?\n\n132\n00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.580\nNow, I'm gonna say no on this one,\nwe will get back to deploying policies.\n\n133\n00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.325\nBut what if Dan,\nas the senior administrator,\n\n134\n00:06:45.325 --> 00:06:47.260\ntasked me with making a policy.\n\n135\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.010\nConfigure the settings, right?\n\n136\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.350\nWell, what if we have\na policy in place that says,\n\n137\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.900\nthe senior administrator must\nreview those settings and\n\n138\n00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.060\nmake sure they're according to whatever\nsecurity compliance that we have?\n\n139\n00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.350\nWell, I might not want to deploy\nit out to 50 end users right away,\n\n140\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.490\nuntil somebody like Dan can come over,\ninspect it,\n\n141\n00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.170\nand make sure that those settings\nare appropriately configured.\n\n142\n00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.020\nThat's up to you.\n\n143\n00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.390\nJust keep in mind when you deploy it and\nit doesn't necessarily go out to anybody,\n\n144\n00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.260\nthere's some other things\nthat we have to do.\n\n145\n00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.008\n>> Yeah, Wes, and that might be a really\neasy way to deploy these policies, but\n\n146\n00:07:18.008 --> 00:07:21.520\njumping on Wes' coattails there,\n\n147\n00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.750\nis you might not have the environment\nready for that policy.\n\n148\n00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.550\nSo you might not want to deploy\nit at that point in time,\n\n149\n00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.110\neven if it is ready to go and all eyes\nhave seen it and you know it's right,\n\n150\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.050\nyou just might not have your\nenvironment ready for prime-time.\n\n151\n00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.080\nSo another reason you\njust may wanna hold off.\n\n152\n00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.890\n>> Yeah, definitely,\ncuz once you apply it,\n\n153\n00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.310\nyou gotta keep in mind that you could\npotentially be provisioning settings to\n\n154\n00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.460\nusers that aren't even prepared for\nthem yet.\n\n155\n00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.960\nSo again, keep that in mind.\n\n156\n00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.320\nNow, that's a configuration policy.\n\n157\n00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.010\nWhen it comes down to\nthe configuration policy,\n\n158\n00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.210\nyou notice that it wasn't\nreally too hard to configure.\n\n159\n00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.019\nYou just have to be a couple of things,\nkeep in mind.\n\n160\n00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:59.920\nRemember what operating systems you're\ngonna be supporting, all right.\n\n161\n00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.780\nMake sure that if you're defining\nsettings, those settings are available for\n\n162\n00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.792\nThe operating system and\nthe settings that you want to apply.\n\n163\n00:08:06.792 --> 00:08:10.590\nNow we've got, some other policies that\nwe have to look at as well, right?\n\n164\n00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.120\nThe next one that we're gonna look at\nis a compliance policy, all right.\n\n165\n00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.350\nNow the compliance policies,\n\n166\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:21.260\nif you'll remember from our first episode,\nfirst part of this, I should say.\n\n167\n00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:27.100\nYou didn't have the ability to choose\nwhich operating system ahead of time,\n\n168\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.350\nnotice that it jumps me right\ninto naming it, all right?\n\n169\n00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.410\nRemember that that is one of the\ndifferences in the compliance policies.\n\n170\n00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.910\nThe compliance policies applied their\nsettings on a settings by settings basis\n\n171\n00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:41.430\nand it is up to you to do\nyour research and finding out\n\n172\n00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.340\ndoes that setting apply to the operating\nsystem that I want to deploy it too.\n\n173\n00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.730\nAnd I will show you here,\nyou can find that out relatively easy,\n\n174\n00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.400\neven though it is a settings\nby settings basis.\n\n175\n00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.770\nAnd we will call this,\nI will just call this comp, for\n\n176\n00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.430\ncompliance policy, mdm and\njust put policy 2.\n\n177\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.350\nJust to make sure I don't have\nany conflicting settings here.\n\n178\n00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.170\nDescription I would do the same thing\nif the generalized policy that's not\n\n179\n00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.380\ntoo eccentric, if you will, detailed.\n\n180\n00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.690\nThen you'd of probably just put all\nyour settings there in the description.\n\n181\n00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.160\nMakes it easy for another administrator\nthat's looking, coming by,\n\n182\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.840\nsaying well what did Wes configure, right?\n\n183\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.340\nDid he have his\n\n184\n00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.970\nglasses on that day because if he didn't\nhe probably didn't get the settings right.\n\n185\n00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.110\nWell I can see it in the description.\n\n186\n00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.620\nSo, you certainly don't have to do that.\n\n187\n00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.270\nAll right, now,\ndo I want to configure all these settings?\n\n188\n00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:33.280\nI didn't really mention this button\non the configuration side either.\n\n189\n00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.380\nAnd it's available in both.\n\n190\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.900\nBut you have to be careful, you give\nyourself more work than you really want.\n\n191\n00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.700\nBecause what it does, imagine like\nthe old dip switches that have up and\n\n192\n00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.450\ndown, one or zero, and you just took the\nwhole entire thing and slid it on, right?\n\n193\n00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.310\nWell, that's what we just did when we said\nhey, we wanna define all these settings.\n\n194\n00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.930\nAnd there are, as you can see,\na bunch of them.\n\n195\n00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.890\nSo I'm actually gonna just disable that.\n\n196\n00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.780\nBut I did want to make mention of that.\n\n197\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.000\nNow, we're gonna define here\nin our compliance policy,\n\n198\n00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.020\nwe're gonna define some settings as well.\n\n199\n00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.230\nAll right, we're gonna.\n\n200\n00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.060\n>> Real quickly.\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n201\n00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.210\n>> I just have a quick thought,\nit went through my mind.\n\n202\n00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.470\nWes, we did enable that feature,\nbecause we don't wanna go through and\n\n203\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.710\nsettle those settings.\n\n204\n00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:16.150\nBut once we get done doing this and\nsay we need to, you know what?\n\n205\n00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.550\nWe should have turned that one or\nwe didn't,\n\n206\n00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.990\nor that does not need to be on at all,\nI need to turn it off.\n\n207\n00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.067\nCan we go back later and\nchange those settings?\n\n208\n00:10:22.067 --> 00:10:23.332\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n209\n00:10:23.332 --> 00:10:26.890\nIn fact, that's a good idea,\nI didn't actually plan for it.\n\n210\n00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.870\nBut we'll show you exactly\nhow to edit a policy.\n\n211\n00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.050\nIn fact, both of the policies\nthat we're gonna create.\n\n212\n00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.990\nLet's say Wes didn't have his spectacles\non when he was defining these policies,\n\n213\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.360\nand Dan comes back and says, man,\n\n214\n00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:41.790\non that configuration policy you\napplied a ten character password.\n\n215\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.880\nAre you trying to kill me on Monday\nmorning with all these password resets I\n\n216\n00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.710\nnow have to do?\n\n217\n00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.260\nCan you move that down a little bit?\n\n218\n00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.730\nSo we'll show you exactly how to do that.\n\n219\n00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.190\nAll right now are we gonna require\na password for our devices?\n\n220\n00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.420\nI am gonna say yes, and here's where\nagain, keep in mind that you get to see\n\n221\n00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.490\nexactly on an operating system\nby operating system basis,\n\n222\n00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.340\nsettings by settings.\n\n223\n00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.390\nIs it supported?\n\n224\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:10.050\nNow if that's not enough for you, you can\ngo a little bit further than that, right?\n\n225\n00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.280\nOne of the things that they have\nis the option to use this little\n\n226\n00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.670\nexclamation point.\n\n227\n00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.900\nNow when you use the exclamation point,\nnotice what we get here.\n\n228\n00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.910\nWe get the settings specified,\n\n229\n00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.740\nspecifies whether to require\nuser to enter a password.\n\n230\n00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.920\nSo if you're, maybe some of you guys out\nthere are seeing group policy, right?\n\n231\n00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.570\nWhen I go to a setting in group\npolicy that has an Explain tab on it,\n\n232\n00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.650\nlets me know what the setting\ndoes if I define it or\n\n233\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.640\ndon't define it, well,\nthat's kinda what you get here.\n\n234\n00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.770\nAnd be careful.\n\n235\n00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.920\nOne of the things that\nyou might have missed,\n\n236\n00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.090\nnotice what it says as far the operating\nsystem that are supported.\n\n237\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:50.076\nNotice here that we have,\nthis is supported on Windows 8 plus phone,\n\n238\n00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:51.088\nif you will, right?\n\n239\n00:11:51.088 --> 00:11:54.190\nAnd then we've got some\nAndroid stuff here as well but\n\n240\n00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.719\nit doesn't tell you, wait a second,\nare these the only devices?\n\n241\n00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.210\nLook at, and I know my head's\nkinda covering this one up,\n\n242\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:07.720\nwhere it says right here,\nthis is not available on Windows RT.\n\n243\n00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.160\nAgain, keep that in mind.\n\n244\n00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:15.190\nWe did explain that a little bit in\nthe first portion of this episode here.\n\n245\n00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.120\nAll right so Dan, what are some other\nsettings we're gonna define here?\n\n246\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.230\nWe're gonna require a password to unlock.\n\n247\n00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:25.100\nWe're gonna go ahead and, maximum pounds\nword length, we'll go ahead and set.\n\n248\n00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.840\nAnd, with this one, being a compliance\npolicy, I'm gonna go ahead and, I tell\n\n249\n00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.160\nyou what, I'll do an eight character\npassword length on this one here.\n\n250\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.460\nAll right, now,\n\n251\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.990\nnext one that we're gonna configure\nin here is the password expiration.\n\n252\n00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.880\nSo we're keeping some of these,\n\n253\n00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.930\nwe're keeping some of them\nbasic on purpose here.\n\n254\n00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.960\nWe just want some of\nthe basic settings here.\n\n255\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.410\nRemember, you can configure these\nas intricately as you want.\n\n256\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.430\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna take this password expiration.\n\n257\n00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:59.981\nAnd I'm gonna back that down\nto about 15 days, all right.\n\n258\n00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:05.800\nAnd again, make sure you go\nthrough these and make sure that\n\n259\n00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.200\nthere aren't any other unexpected settings\nthat are gonna apply to your devices.\n\n260\n00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.904\nAnd again,\ninstead of helping your company,\n\n261\n00:13:10.904 --> 00:13:12.400\nnow you're gonna be troubleshooting.\n\n262\n00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.820\nCuz you gotta figure out why\npeople can't do certain things.\n\n263\n00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.200\nAnd we'll go ahead and save this policy.\n\n264\n00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.940\nAnd again,\nit asks us do we want to deploy it.\n\n265\n00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.450\nAll right, good question because well wait\na second Wes, we need to go back in and\n\n266\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.080\nwe need to edit a policy.\n\n267\n00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.590\nLet's jump all the way back over\nto that configuration policy.\n\n268\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.490\nThe first one that we configured,\nall right.\n\n269\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:35.750\nAnd that was the mobile MDM policy\none there, configuration policy.\n\n270\n00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.200\nAnd I'm going to just select that.\n\n271\n00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.120\nAnd, Dan, to answer your\nquestion a little more directly.\n\n272\n00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.660\nNotice there's an Edit button right here,\nor a hyperlink if you will.\n\n273\n00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.970\nIf I click that, it takes me right\nout to the base page, right?\n\n274\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.540\nSame page we started with, right?\n\n275\n00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.065\nAnd Dan says, well wait a second, Wes.\n\n276\n00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:54.800\nTen-character password,\nthat's just crazy, man.\n\n277\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.360\nCould you make a little easier?\n\n278\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.904\nI say, okay, 20.\n\n279\n00:13:57.904 --> 00:14:00.948\n[LAUGH]\n>> I was just gonna say I'll make it nine.\n\n280\n00:14:00.948 --> 00:14:03.120\n>> [LAUGH] So I'll reduce it by one.\n\n281\n00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.450\nNow I turn around and I save this policy.\n\n282\n00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:10.660\nAnd here's the other thing too,\nkeep in mind they have a very\n\n283\n00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:15.600\nvery strict, I think it's with\nyour session cookies here.\n\n284\n00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.680\nThey expire very quick.\n\n285\n00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.890\nThey don't want you just walking\naway from this interface,\n\n286\n00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.280\nso I'm gonna have to reauthenticate.\n\n287\n00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.340\nAnd one of the good things I do like,\nit remembers exactly where I was, right?\n\n288\n00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:30.130\nI didn't see that sign that lets me know,\nhey, do I wanna deploy it now?\n\n289\n00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.020\nRight, now again,\nI might want to deploy this right now, but\n\n290\n00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:38.370\nwe're gonna go ahead and we'll look at\ndeploying it here a little bit later.\n\n291\n00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.920\nYou know Dan, for a second here,\n\n292\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.850\nI'm gonna kinda go off the beaten path\nhere cuz there are a couple of policies\n\n293\n00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.910\nthat I didn't talk about in the first\none we are mentioning them.\n\n294\n00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.910\nThat are honorable mentions\nbecause of the exam.\n\n295\n00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:53.860\nI just have a couple other configuration\npolicies that I just thought about\n\n296\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.790\nthat I just wanna explain here.\n\n297\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.630\nWe're not actually going to configure\nthem but that's the computer\n\n298\n00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.115\nmanagement policies, I wanna just take\na quick second and explain these.\n\n299\n00:15:02.115 --> 00:15:04.220\nThese could come up on the exam,\nall right,\n\n300\n00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.419\nbecause if you say Intune Agent Settings\nwhat are we configuring?\n\n301\n00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.610\nI have no clue.\n\n302\n00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.150\nIntune Agent, right?\n\n303\n00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.580\nThis is where your endpoint\nprotection comes in.\n\n304\n00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.000\nSo I'm just gonna take a second here and\nI'd like to show you,\n\n305\n00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.280\nbecause this is also one of those\nones that it's not grayed out.\n\n306\n00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.620\nCommon settings, right?\n\n307\n00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.780\nSo we're not gonna deploy this or\nanything, but I wanna show you that with\n\n308\n00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:30.560\nthe InTune agent settings,\nit's not what you might think it is.\n\n309\n00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.080\nNotice that it's endpoint\nprotection services.\n\n310\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.200\nDo I wanna install anti-virus software?\n\n311\n00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.250\nDo I wanna require the anti-virus\nsoftware to be installed\n\n312\n00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.420\neven if there's third party software?\n\n313\n00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.730\nHow are we gonna manage things like\nour domain profiles and our updates?\n\n314\n00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:45.570\nKeep that in mind.\n\n315\n00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.530\nThat's what the Agent Intune Setting\npolicy does,\n\n316\n00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.020\nor Intune Agent Settings policy does.\n\n317\n00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.343\nAnd it could be something\nthat trips you up, right?\n\n318\n00:15:54.343 --> 00:16:00.180\nOne more, a couple more that I want to\nmention is the Intune Center settings.\n\n319\n00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.037\nAll right, Intune Center,\nwhat are we configuring here?\n\n320\n00:16:03.037 --> 00:16:05.080\nThe center.\n\n321\n00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.960\nWell, again, don't let it trick you up.\n\n322\n00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.823\nThis one doesn't have a template that you\ncan provide recommended settings, and that\n\n323\n00:16:12.823 --> 00:16:17.880\nis because the Intune Center settings,\nthat's you're support information.\n\n324\n00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.550\nThat's all that is.\n\n325\n00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.230\nThat means, if I launch the Intune Center,\n\n326\n00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.360\nwhat information do I give my users\nif they need to get a hold of me?\n\n327\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.430\nSo I do wanna make mention of that.\n\n328\n00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.540\nThe last one here and\nwe'll go ahead and cancel this one out.\n\n329\n00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.970\nThe last one here that I\ndid forget mention and\n\n330\n00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.390\nI do wanna make sure that\nyou guys are aware of it\n\n331\n00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:39.330\nare the Intune firewall settings and\nthose are obvious guys right?\n\n332\n00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.480\nThis is where you can\nmanage the communication.\n\n333\n00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.072\nYou can define, have you ever had somebody\nthat maybe has a device that had firewall\n\n334\n00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:47.701\non it, something wasn't working,\nwhat do they like to do?\n\n335\n00:16:47.701 --> 00:16:49.230\nThey just turn the firewall off, right?\n\n336\n00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:52.569\nThat makes everything work and\nmakes my company 100% secure.\n\n337\n00:16:52.569 --> 00:16:54.190\nYou know I'm kidding out there.\n\n338\n00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.080\nThis defines those settings and it'll\nmake sure that if they're enrolling their\n\n339\n00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.200\ndevices in your MDM platform, Microsoft\nIntune platform here They are gonna be\n\n340\n00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.780\nrequired to do whatever it is that you say\nbased on this policy with the firewall.\n\n341\n00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.674\nSo Dan I kinda went off the beaten path\nthere, but it was an honorable mention.\n\n342\n00:17:08.674 --> 00:17:12.300\nAnd I was looking at it back there when\nwere editing those configuration policies.\n\n343\n00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:16.860\n>> Well you had our users best interests\nin mind, so that's always a good thing.\n\n344\n00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.720\nAnytime you do that, you'll go well\noff that beaten path, my friend.\n\n345\n00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.954\n>> All right, very good.\n\n346\n00:17:21.954 --> 00:17:24.150\nSo that's our compliance policies.\n\n347\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.650\nThat's our configuration policies.\n\n348\n00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:29.420\nSo why don't we talk\nabout deploying a policy.\n\n349\n00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.941\nNow, if you're deploying to Windows 8,\n8.1,\n\n350\n00:17:32.941 --> 00:17:38.473\nyou're deploying to Windows 10 desktops,\nit is a relatively easy thing to do.\n\n351\n00:17:38.473 --> 00:17:42.231\nOne of the things that you will have\nto do and we look at our screen here,\n\n352\n00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:44.460\na couple of things that\nyou have to set up,\n\n353\n00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.860\nyou have to download the client\nitself from Intune here.\n\n354\n00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.870\nSo, if you go down to the admin, now,\n\n355\n00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:54.410\nwe're going all the way down to\nadmin here and when this loads up,\n\n356\n00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:59.890\nyou'll see in this column here\nunder administrative management,\n\n357\n00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:03.510\nwe'll move that down just a little bit,\nyou see client software download, right?\n\n358\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:09.480\nAnd it's again something that's fairly\neasy, you choose Download Client Software\n\n359\n00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.230\nand then you can deploy this to\nyour end points if you want.\n\n360\n00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.290\nNow, how do we deploy it to our endpoints?\n\n361\n00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.800\nWell, it's different with\ndifferent devices, right?\n\n362\n00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.720\nIf I have GPO, if I have a domain\nbased device that I decide I want\n\n363\n00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.370\nto deploy Intunes to,\nI just deploy it through a GPO.\n\n364\n00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.418\nRemember one of the benefits of Intune,\n\n365\n00:18:26.418 --> 00:18:28.898\nis you can't manage these\ndevices with Intune.\n\n366\n00:18:28.898 --> 00:18:34.940\nIf I have a Windows Home Edition doesn't\nhave the domain join capabilities.\n\n367\n00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.750\nYou might say well, Wes,\n\n368\n00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:39.820\nwhy would you want to even think\nabout putting that on your network?\n\n369\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.610\nWhat if I got a lady\nthat's working in a house?\n\n370\n00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.300\nMaybe she has to take care of her kids or\nsomething for some reason.\n\n371\n00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.990\nAnd she's connecting from home and we've\ngot it set up so she can connect there.\n\n372\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:53.560\nWell, we can't manage her computer through\nthe traditional management functions.\n\n373\n00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.983\nBut I can if I've got\nit attached to Intune.\n\n374\n00:18:55.983 --> 00:18:57.935\nSo there are good purposes for\n\n375\n00:18:57.935 --> 00:19:02.790\nmanaging devices' desktops that\notherwise couldn't join the domain.\n\n376\n00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.840\nNow, rather than take the time waiting for\nthat to download,\n\n377\n00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.240\nand for the most part it's a relatively\neasy download, let's go ahead.\n\n378\n00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.980\nI've already got one ready to go here.\n\n379\n00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:19.640\nSo here's what it does it\ndownloads this zip file.\n\n380\n00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.450\nThere are two things in this file\nI'm gonna challenge myself here.\n\n381\n00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.900\nThere are two things in this zip folder.\n\n382\n00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.300\nShould be the client installer and\nit should be a CER or a certificate right?\n\n383\n00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.500\nA certificate that says this is Intune and\n\n384\n00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.450\nwhen we go to install this software,\nwe want you to trust Intune.\n\n385\n00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:39.020\nWe want you to trust the software\ninstallation process.\n\n386\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.360\nSo if I look in here,\nnotice I have a ACCOUNTCERT file and\n\n387\n00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.660\nwe're gonna need to have those.\n\n388\n00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:50.130\nSo let me go ahead real quick, and\nwe will just pull that to the desktop,\n\n389\n00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.940\nand we'll go ahead and\njust extract it real quick.\n\n390\n00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.970\nNow you're gonna see, we don't have\nto do quite the same thing on some of\n\n391\n00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:02.420\nthe other mobile devices, but\nthis is definitely what we have to do when\n\n392\n00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.290\nwe're setting this up\non a Windows desktop.\n\n393\n00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.400\nAnd it just through\nthe Intune setup process,\n\n394\n00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.780\nyou're gonna see we're just gonna Next,\nNext, Next.\n\n395\n00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.570\nAll right, notice, what do we have here?\n\n396\n00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.070\nWe've got a User Account Control.\n\n397\n00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.670\nNow Dan, do you think a standard user,\nI'm gonna throw a curve ball at you.\n\n398\n00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.054\nYou think a standard user\ncan install this software?\n\n399\n00:20:19.054 --> 00:20:21.408\n>> Absolutely, positively yes.\n\n400\n00:20:21.408 --> 00:20:24.582\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we know that he's joking.\n\n401\n00:20:24.582 --> 00:20:25.094\nWhy?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n402\n00:20:25.094 --> 00:20:25.930\n>> User Account\n\n403\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.134\nControl.\n>> That's right.\n\n404\n00:20:27.134 --> 00:20:28.964\n>> Anytime a User Account Control comes up\n\n405\n00:20:28.964 --> 00:20:30.524\nwith just a prompt that says go ahead and\n\n406\n00:20:30.524 --> 00:20:34.390\njust continue this, you know that\nperson is an administrative user.\n\n407\n00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.260\nIf they were to get challenged here,\n\n408\n00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.980\nif they were a standard user what they\nwould get is the little dialogue box with\n\n409\n00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.510\nan authentication screen that says you\nhave to log in as an administrator.\n\n410\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:44.910\n>> Now Wes that does beg the question,\n\n411\n00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:49.210\nif I am deploying this out to a standard\nuser and they need to install it.\n\n412\n00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.386\nHow is it are they going to do that?\n\n413\n00:20:51.386 --> 00:20:54.330\n>> Well and that's gonna be one thing\nthat you're gonna provision the devices\n\n414\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.280\nbeforehand.\n\n415\n00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.340\nSo again,\nif it happens to be a domain join device,\n\n416\n00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.420\nyou can provision it through GPOs, but\n\n417\n00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.770\nthen at that point you're probably already\ntraditionally managing them anyways.\n\n418\n00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.650\nThe only benefit would be what happens\nwhen your device isn't connected to\n\n419\n00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.550\nthe network, and\nit can't pull down group policies.\n\n420\n00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:16.030\nMaybe you're traveling, maybe you got\na user that's roaming around the country\n\n421\n00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.230\nhere, well,\nthe moment it connects to the internet,\n\n422\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:23.380\nIntune deploys its compliance policies,\nor its compliance checks.\n\n423\n00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.500\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nchoose Finish on this, and\n\n424\n00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.289\nyou're gonna notice that.\n\n425\n00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.040\nAnd that's all it was.\n\n426\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.662\nNow it's taken a second down here and\n\n427\n00:21:30.662 --> 00:21:32.814\nI know our head's probably\ncovering it up here.\n\n428\n00:21:32.814 --> 00:21:35.984\nBut if I get down all the way down\nhere at the bottom of the screen here,\n\n429\n00:21:35.984 --> 00:21:39.940\nyou're gonna see that there's\na little Installing Microsoft Intune.\n\n430\n00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.655\nIt'll take a little bit.\n\n431\n00:21:41.655 --> 00:21:44.890\nYou'll see the Company Portal and\nwe're gonna look at that Company Portal.\n\n432\n00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:48.850\nAnd remember when I told you about\nthe Microsoft Intune Center?\n\n433\n00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.560\nThat's essentially what we're looking at.\n\n434\n00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.190\nSo, once we're done with that, this is\ndeploying the software to the client,\n\n435\n00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.440\nwe'll be able to configure the poliicies,\nand\n\n436\n00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:03.750\nwe'll see how they work, once our clients\nhave been installed on these machines.\n\n437\n00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.670\nNow the next thing that we're gonna do is,\n\n438\n00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.770\nwe've got a couple of mobile\ndevices that we're gonna deploy to.\n\n439\n00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:12.250\nThe first one we're gonna start with,\nis our Android devices.\n\n440\n00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.662\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlet's take the time to get\n\n441\n00:22:15.662 --> 00:22:20.227\nthe Android device software installed and\nsee what it looks like.\n\n442\n00:22:20.227 --> 00:22:23.903\nOne of the first things we have to do in\norder to get our Android device setup is\n\n443\n00:22:23.903 --> 00:22:27.920\nto make sure that we install from\nGoogle Play in the Intune Company Portal.\n\n444\n00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.790\nNow, I've gone ahead and\nI've installed it already, so\n\n445\n00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.600\nall I have to do is open it here.\n\n446\n00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.100\nNow the first thing it's gonna do\nis it's gonna ask you to sign in.\n\n447\n00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.350\nSo no social engineering out there guys.\n\n448\n00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:40.240\nYou can't see my password cuz I\ncertainly don't want you logging in to\n\n449\n00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.670\nmy Intune platform in the back.\n\n450\n00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.670\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna log in as a user here.\n\n451\n00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.890\nOne of the things I want you to keep in\nmind though, is that you have to have\n\n452\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:55.650\nthe user provisioned in Intune prior\nto the device being able to enroll.\n\n453\n00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.020\nThat is an important step\nin our process here and\n\n454\n00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:03.570\nit can't be forgotten or you're\nessentially not gonna be able to log in.\n\n455\n00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:07.210\nNow you can see that it is signing into\nthe company portal as we speak right now.\n\n456\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.838\nAnd what we're gonna have to do is we're\ngonna have to set this device up for\n\n457\n00:23:10.838 --> 00:23:13.489\nenrollment and\nwe're gonna have to set the device up,\n\n458\n00:23:13.489 --> 00:23:16.907\nwell the device compliance is gonna\ncome soon once we get it enrolled.\n\n459\n00:23:16.907 --> 00:23:20.065\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nbegin that process.\n\n460\n00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:23.484\nAnd it's gonna ask us, it's gonna send\nus through a couple of things and\n\n461\n00:23:23.484 --> 00:23:25.054\nsay hey your privacy is secure but\n\n462\n00:23:25.054 --> 00:23:28.670\nif your do this your IT Admin is\ngonna be able to control your device.\n\n463\n00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:32.430\nAnd go as far as doing things like\nremote wipes of your device and\n\n464\n00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.970\nthat's why it is important.\n\n465\n00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:39.970\nNow, the next thing we are gonna do is\ntap right here to enroll the device.\n\n466\n00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.360\nAnd now what it's gonna do is it's\njust gonna let us know that hey\n\n467\n00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.920\nthis is some of the things that can\nhappen if you enroll your device.\n\n468\n00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.226\nRemember, BYOD, bring your own device,\n\n469\n00:23:49.226 --> 00:23:52.118\nthat means they could erase\nall the data on the phone.\n\n470\n00:23:52.118 --> 00:23:54.094\nSo we'll go ahead and activate this.\n\n471\n00:23:54.094 --> 00:23:56.618\n>> That's always one of the biggest\ncomplaints I get when I was supporting\n\n472\n00:23:56.618 --> 00:23:59.434\na network, people would bring in their\ndevice and say, I wanna connect it and\n\n473\n00:23:59.434 --> 00:24:00.460\nget my email and do all this.\n\n474\n00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.120\nI'm like.\n\n475\n00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.285\nOkay, and then I get to the screen\nthat says something like,\n\n476\n00:24:04.285 --> 00:24:08.091\nadministrators will have the privilege\nto remote wipe and remove data.\n\n477\n00:24:08.091 --> 00:24:12.005\nAnd they said hold on, and well,\nif you wanna jump in the game,\n\n478\n00:24:12.005 --> 00:24:13.460\nyou got to pay the paper.\n\n479\n00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.340\n>> That's exactly right, and\none of the things you'll also have to do\n\n480\n00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.290\nhere to make sure that\nthe device trusts the portal.\n\n481\n00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.120\nRemember one of the things that we did\nis we had a certificate on the Windows\n\n482\n00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.110\ndevice that went and\ndid the client download, right?\n\n483\n00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:29.210\nIt had the executable for\nthe Intune account setup, but\n\n484\n00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.670\nit also had that certificate here.\n\n485\n00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.170\nHere, it's telling me the same thing.\n\n486\n00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.658\nWe're gonna give one user certificate and\nit's gonna go into the certificate store\n\n487\n00:24:35.658 --> 00:24:38.567\nof this Android device, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and we'll say okay.\n\n488\n00:24:38.567 --> 00:24:42.180\nAnd then that's gonna provision that\ncertificate that's gonna be one of\n\n489\n00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.325\nthe ways that we identify ourselves\nwhen we finally do connect to\n\n490\n00:24:45.325 --> 00:24:46.630\nthe Intune portal.\n\n491\n00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:51.440\nIt really doesn't take that long\nwhen it comes to getting set up.\n\n492\n00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.321\nIt's just the communication between\nyour device ad the management platform.\n\n493\n00:24:56.321 --> 00:25:01.469\nAnd after a bid here, what we should see\nis inside of the Intune admin console,\n\n494\n00:25:01.469 --> 00:25:05.683\nwhere we've been managing all\nof our devices and our policies,\n\n495\n00:25:05.683 --> 00:25:10.207\nwe should now see that the device\nthat whoever was the user that logged\n\n496\n00:25:10.207 --> 00:25:13.070\nin is going to be linked to that user.\n\n497\n00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:17.520\nAll right, now you can see that we have\nour NJO N2 interface, notice that it says\n\n498\n00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.170\ncompany device enrollments and\ndevice compliance is set up.\n\n499\n00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:24.855\nAll right, and we're just going to go\nahead and finish the process here and\n\n500\n00:25:24.855 --> 00:25:28.074\nit's gonna tell us if we have any apps,\nif i've deployed apps and\n\n501\n00:25:28.074 --> 00:25:30.262\nthey're available I would find them here.\n\n502\n00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:35.144\nWe don't have any apps because again, this\nis more about the policies but now I have\n\n503\n00:25:35.144 --> 00:25:39.880\naccess to the Intune console, or\nat least to the resources that I should.\n\n504\n00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.200\nFor instance,\nif I decide that I go over here, and\n\n505\n00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.010\nI want support information,\nI can contact IT.\n\n506\n00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.845\nIt tells me who our IT department is and\n\n507\n00:25:47.845 --> 00:25:52.035\nsome of the issues that this\nguy likes to describe here.\n\n508\n00:25:52.035 --> 00:25:54.364\nYou can see we've got our ID10T and\nLayer 8 Issues.\n\n509\n00:25:54.364 --> 00:25:55.039\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n510\n00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:57.345\n>> We also have support documentation.\n\n511\n00:25:57.345 --> 00:25:59.794\nWe can give him support documentation, and\n\n512\n00:25:59.794 --> 00:26:03.645\nwe could always lead them over to\nour support website if we have them.\n\n513\n00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:06.725\nNow, what I've done in the background is\njust link this directly to TechNet, but\n\n514\n00:26:06.725 --> 00:26:10.593\nit would be no different if you\nput a URL to your own internal\n\n515\n00:26:10.593 --> 00:26:12.830\nintranet-based web server.\n\n516\n00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.590\nYou could do that likewise too and\n\n517\n00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.550\nyou could point people right\nover to your support staff.\n\n518\n00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:22.210\nSo when you look at the Android devices,\nit really isn't too difficult.\n\n519\n00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:27.818\nNow let's go ahead and let's see if\nwe can now associate this device.\n\n520\n00:26:27.818 --> 00:26:31.864\nLet me scroll through some of these\nhere and get back to our Intune console.\n\n521\n00:26:31.864 --> 00:26:35.138\nAnd there again, very,\nvery strict on their timeout policy, so\n\n522\n00:26:35.138 --> 00:26:39.064\nI do apologize ahead of time, but let's\ngo ahead and get logged back in here and\n\n523\n00:26:39.064 --> 00:26:41.639\nlet's see if that device has shown up,\nall right.\n\n524\n00:26:45.093 --> 00:26:50.242\nNow we're gonna go back\nover here to groups.\n\n525\n00:26:50.242 --> 00:26:51.178\nAll right, and\n\n526\n00:26:51.178 --> 00:26:56.080\nthen sometimes, this could take a little\nbit before it shows up in your console.\n\n527\n00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.929\nOne of the things that I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go to Mobile Devices, all right and\n\n528\n00:27:00.929 --> 00:27:03.506\ndoesn't look like they've showed up yet.\n\n529\n00:27:03.506 --> 00:27:06.314\nAgain like I said,\nit takes a little bit for\n\n530\n00:27:06.314 --> 00:27:09.670\nthese devices to enter\ninto the Intune interface.\n\n531\n00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.639\nSo it's still being provisioned in\nthe background unlike some of the Cloud\n\n532\n00:27:13.639 --> 00:27:17.734\nservices here, but we should see in a bit\nhere that we will have a device in here\n\n533\n00:27:17.734 --> 00:27:21.137\nthat is, it's kind of interesting\nhow they assign it, right?\n\n534\n00:27:21.137 --> 00:27:25.003\nEven though it's an Android device, one of\nthe things that you'll see is that it's\n\n535\n00:27:25.003 --> 00:27:28.433\ngoing to apply the user's name to\nthe Android device so that it looks like,\n\n536\n00:27:28.433 --> 00:27:31.047\nwell, there's our desktop,\nour window's client, so\n\n537\n00:27:31.047 --> 00:27:34.477\nwe can go ahead and while we're waiting\nfor that Android device to show up,\n\n538\n00:27:34.477 --> 00:27:37.330\nwe can kind of view\nthe properties of this device.\n\n539\n00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:40.580\nAll right, and\nI can see what the operating system is,\n\n540\n00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.650\nI can see what\nthe management status is and\n\n541\n00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.860\nI can also see some of\nthe endpoint protection status.\n\n542\n00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.890\nSo, you get a heads up as to\nwhat's going on with the client.\n\n543\n00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:51.300\nLike I said,\nwe'll come back here in a bit.\n\n544\n00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.260\nIt looks like the device\nactually showed up finally.\n\n545\n00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.440\nThere we go, you can see it on\nthe right hand side there and there we,\n\n546\n00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.690\nlet's go ahead and\nview the properties of this device here.\n\n547\n00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.114\nAnd what I really like about this is,\nlet's see,\n\n548\n00:28:02.114 --> 00:28:05.116\ndoes it say the hardware I believe\nit does right here yes well,\n\n549\n00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:08.142\nit gives me a little bit of\ninformation on the hardware there.\n\n550\n00:28:08.142 --> 00:28:13.120\nBut it should show me the operating system\nand what the device is here maybe a little\n\n551\n00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.529\nbit longer and\nit'll give me that information as well.\n\n552\n00:28:16.529 --> 00:28:20.774\nSo I can see that, yes, this is an Android\ndevice it has been enrolled and\n\n553\n00:28:20.774 --> 00:28:21.678\nif I wanted to,\n\n554\n00:28:21.678 --> 00:28:26.150\nI could now deploy policies to this\ndevice, and I could start to control it.\n\n555\n00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.570\nSo the Android setup is fairly easy.\n\n556\n00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:32.140\nA couple more steps, if you will,\nthan just the client download,\n\n557\n00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.900\nbut all in all, it isn't very difficult.\n\n558\n00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.670\nNow, we could go a little\nbit farther than this, too.\n\n559\n00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:39.480\nHow about a Windows 8.1 mobile device?\n\n560\n00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.390\nMaybe you want to deploy\npolicies to a Windows 8.1 device.\n\n561\n00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:45.560\nLet's go ahead and\n\n562\n00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.430\nlet's set up our Windows 8.1 mobile\nphone and show you what that looks like.\n\n563\n00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.850\nAll right, so we got our Windows 8.1\nphone set up and we went ahead and\n\n564\n00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:57.275\nwe downloaded the company portal first,\nso that we can get this going.\n\n565\n00:28:57.275 --> 00:29:01.580\nNow we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nsign in, it does cache credentials and\n\n566\n00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:05.650\nthat is a good thing, especially for\nme and I can't type credentials here.\n\n567\n00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:09.640\nAnd what it's gonna do is it's going\nto reach out over the network or\n\n568\n00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.630\nthe internet really and it's gonna\nconnect to the Windows Intune or\n\n569\n00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.000\nthe Microsoft Intune platform.\n\n570\n00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.851\nNow, one of the things that's really cool\nis you can see that it already notices\n\n571\n00:29:19.851 --> 00:29:22.857\nthat other device, right,\nour Samsung device that we have.\n\n572\n00:29:22.857 --> 00:29:27.769\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna hit\nthe tap to enroll and we'll go ahead and\n\n573\n00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:31.130\nwhat we're gonna do is\nwe will add our account.\n\n574\n00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:35.086\nNow it's gonna ask for the email\naddress and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n575\n00:29:35.086 --> 00:29:36.864\njust sign in here real quick.\n\n576\n00:29:39.824 --> 00:29:44.693\nAnd just make sure kinda like the Android\ndevice that we talked about, really any\n\n577\n00:29:44.693 --> 00:29:49.203\ndevice for that matter, when you are\nlogging in, it has to be a user that has\n\n578\n00:29:49.203 --> 00:29:54.460\nbeen provisioned in your Intune beforehand\nor they won't be able to connect, right.\n\n579\n00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:59.600\nNo, you don't have user access if\nthe user doesn't exist inside of Intune,\n\n580\n00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.020\nso we'll go a head and click this.\n\n581\n00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:05.090\nIt's gonna see am I valid a user,\nand then it should take\n\n582\n00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:10.100\nus over to the Microsoft login page for\nour, you might notice a Windows Live ID,\n\n583\n00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:14.910\nthe Microsoft account where we usually\nlog in to other services, right?\n\n584\n00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:18.820\nAnd there we go, so we're at the Intune\npage here, and let me kind of just show\n\n585\n00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.600\nyou these guys here cuz a couple\ndifferent locations there.\n\n586\n00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.190\nYou could see that we're actually\non the Intune site here and\n\n587\n00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:27.860\nnow you don't get to see my password.\n\n588\n00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.650\nApparently, it wasn't cached, so\nwe'll go ahead and login here real quick.\n\n589\n00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.596\n>> I'm shoulder surfing\nWes's password right now.\n\n590\n00:30:35.596 --> 00:30:37.151\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n591\n00:30:37.151 --> 00:30:38.041\n>> It's I heart bacon.\n\n592\n00:30:38.041 --> 00:30:41.204\n[LAUGH]\n>> Shh now I gotta go change it.\n\n593\n00:30:41.204 --> 00:30:42.547\n>> To I heart bacon.\n\n594\n00:30:42.547 --> 00:30:45.297\n>> All right, now what we're\ngonna find out here [LAUGH] is,\n\n595\n00:30:45.297 --> 00:30:47.432\nwell whether Wes typed his password or\nnot.\n\n596\n00:30:47.432 --> 00:30:53.340\nIt says your email address has been\nsaved and it's looking for the settings.\n\n597\n00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.585\nIt's gonna find out do we have any\npolicies applying to this machine or\n\n598\n00:30:56.585 --> 00:30:57.253\nthis device.\n\n599\n00:30:57.253 --> 00:31:00.985\nRemember we're talking about compliance,\ncould take a little bit,\n\n600\n00:31:00.985 --> 00:31:05.362\nbut once it's all set up and done, what we\nshould see is that the account is added.\n\n601\n00:31:05.362 --> 00:31:08.560\nWe can choose Next and\nthe device is now enrolled, and\n\n602\n00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.535\nwe should have access to not only the apps\nthat have been provisioned in Intune, but\n\n603\n00:31:13.535 --> 00:31:18.329\nif we have policies, which we will see\nthose policies actually deployed here.\n\n604\n00:31:18.329 --> 00:31:23.517\nBut Dan, I'm sure we're coming to the end,\nso we might have to do another episode,\n\n605\n00:31:23.517 --> 00:31:28.341\nyes a part three because I wanna show you\nApple devices, iOS devices as well and\n\n606\n00:31:28.341 --> 00:31:32.460\neven potentially, we'll look at\nmaybe even the Windows RT tabs.\n\n607\n00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.980\nBut we definitely have to\nlook at the iOS devices,\n\n608\n00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:39.190\nyou gotta see that and, there's quite a\nfew steps I have to say Dan, in that one.\n\n609\n00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:42.940\n>> Yeah, from what Wes has told me,\ngetting the iOS devices and\n\n610\n00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:46.135\nremember it's an Apple\ntrying to work with Windows.\n\n611\n00:31:46.135 --> 00:31:49.440\nSo it's a little bit involved as it were.\n\n612\n00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.830\nWe're not trying to say anything\ndetrimental towards any of these devices.\n\n613\n00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:54.738\nIt's cool, they all work together, and\n\n614\n00:31:54.738 --> 00:31:57.748\nultimately you can have Apple\ndevices in a Windows environment.\n\n615\n00:31:57.748 --> 00:32:01.825\nYou can have Windows devices in an Apple\nenvironment and that's what we like,\n\n616\n00:32:01.825 --> 00:32:05.591\nthat ubiquity across platform but\nwe will need to do a part three on that,\n\n617\n00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:08.080\nwe're woefully out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n618\n00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.520\nWes thank you though, thanks for\n\n619\n00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.500\nstopping by,\nwe look forward to see you in part three.\n\n620\n00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.461\nWe look forward to seeing you\nguys in part three as well,\n\n621\n00:32:13.461 --> 00:32:14.725\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n622\n00:32:14.725 --> 00:32:16.826\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n623\n00:32:16.826 --> 00:32:17.942\n>> And I am Wes Bryan.\n\n624\n00:32:17.942 --> 00:32:19.161\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n625\n00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:28.040\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:18.246\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.246 --> 00:00:20.987\nAnd in today's episode we're continuing\non with our Windows 10 series.\n\n6\n00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.502\nJoining us back in the studio\nagain today to help us out,\n\n7\n00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:26.446\nactually there's a little mini\nseries we've got going on here,\n\n8\n00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:30.110\nwith supporting Intune inside of Windows\n10 is our good friend Mr. Wes Brian.\n\n9\n00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.620\nWes, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.960\n>> Hey, it's good to be here Dan.\n\n11\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.425\nI can tell you that and yes,\nwe are writing a Stephen King novel.\n\n12\n00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:39.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's the Intune series Coming back\n\n13\n00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.940\nwith a part three because we've\ngot some additional topics that we\n\n14\n00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.220\nwant to talk about today.\n\n15\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.830\nOne of the first things that\nwe are going to show you,\n\n16\n00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.860\nwe left off in the last\nportion of this series.\n\n17\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.800\nWe had configured Windows device,\n\n18\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.340\nwe configured a Windows mobile\ndevice as well as Android.\n\n19\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.110\nWell, we left one out here, and\n\n20\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.590\nwe want to show you how to deploy,\nIntune to IOS devices.\n\n21\n00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.020\nSo, that's what we're going to\nbe doing here in this episode.\n\n22\n00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.510\nSo let's go ahead and jump right in,\n\n23\n00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.680\nand let's take you right\nto the Intune interface.\n\n24\n00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.010\nA couple of things that you have to do,\nto get iOS devices set up, and\n\n25\n00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.190\nit all starts around what is known as an\napplication push notification certificate,\n\n26\n00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.940\nI know that's a mouthful, for sure.\n\n27\n00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.360\nSo, we're gonna all the way down to\nthe bottom here the admin console, and\n\n28\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.200\nyou'll see in your administration list\nover here towards the bottom you'll see\n\n29\n00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.280\niOS devices, and let me see if we\ncan make that a little bit bigger so\n\n30\n00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.660\nyou can see what we're talking about here,\nall right and\n\n31\n00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.820\nwhat we're looking at is this\nupload an APN certificate.\n\n32\n00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.530\nNow that's Apple push\nnotification certificate.\n\n33\n00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.410\nNow, there's a couple of things you\nhave to do prior to being able to,\n\n34\n00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.270\nactually uploading one\nof these certificates.\n\n35\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.960\nWe have to create what is known as a CSR,\nand that's a certificate signing request.\n\n36\n00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.840\nThis is way the iOS devices, when we\nget this process done trust the Intune\n\n37\n00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.120\nmobile device management platform,\nokay because by default they don't.\n\n38\n00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.490\nSo, pretty straight forward if you\nknow a few other steps to go through.\n\n39\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.300\nFirst thing that we have to is\nright here we have to download\n\n40\n00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.150\nan APN certificate request.\n\n41\n00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.230\nJust a CRS file or CSR file, excuse me,\nthat we're going to turn around.\n\n42\n00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.030\nAnd we're going to, we're actually\ngoing to navigate back to Apple.\n\n43\n00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.450\nAnd we're going to upload this, so\nthat we can get a certificate here.\n\n44\n00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.170\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and\ndownload this CRS file.\n\n45\n00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.920\nAnd we're going to call this our NJOX,\nunderscore.\n\n46\n00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.952\nAnd we'll just call it an APN request.\n\n47\n00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.925\nNow, the name of the file other than\nthe extension, I definitely don't\n\n48\n00:02:36.925 --> 00:02:42.150\n[LAUGH] modify any extensions on this,\nbut you won't really notice anything.\n\n49\n00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.530\nWhat happened here?\n\n50\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.760\nWell, you have to go down to the desktop.\n\n51\n00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.250\nAnd, when you rifle down to the desktop,\n\n52\n00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.520\nyou can see here that we\nnow have our CSR file.\n\n53\n00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.890\nNow the CSR file, we've got a couple\nmore things that we're going to do.\n\n54\n00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.230\nWe're going to jump over to Apple's site.\n\n55\n00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.830\nNow Apple's site, this is called\nthe Apple Push Certificates portal.\n\n56\n00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.490\nYou have to sign in with your Live ID.\n\n57\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.110\nSo, if you don't have a Live ID,\nyou're going to have to create one.\n\n58\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.690\nThey need to know who you are.\n\n59\n00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.270\nAnd then what you're going to do is,\n\n60\n00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.350\nyou're actually going to\ncreate a certificate here.\n\n61\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.160\nNow, you can see I've got some\ncertificates already active\n\n62\n00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.190\nthat are ready to go in my mobile\ndevice management solution.\n\n63\n00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.645\nSo that, for the sake of time and\nwaiting for the certificate to be created,\n\n64\n00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:31.776\nbecause it could take a little bit to\nprovision the certificate for you here.\n\n65\n00:03:31.776 --> 00:03:35.940\nSo, we're going to go ahead and choose\ncreate, and you're going to have to accept\n\n66\n00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.400\nthe EULA and apparently I've done\nthat a lot over this series.\n\n67\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.260\nWho knows what I've agreed to?\n\n68\n00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.120\nSo, once you sign in to the, or\n\n69\n00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.810\nI should say agree to the EULA here,\nyou can choose accept.\n\n70\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.770\nNow, we're going to create\na new push certificate.\n\n71\n00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.242\nSo what we have to do,\nyou'll see here that we have to,\n\n72\n00:03:55.242 --> 00:04:00.480\nwe need a vendor-signed Certificate\nSigning Request, that's CSR file.\n\n73\n00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.700\nNow, it really isn't just Microsoft\nCorporation that you can get these from,\n\n74\n00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.310\nbut you just have to remember you got\nto go to your third party to do that.\n\n75\n00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.448\nNow, we're going to go ahead and\nbrowse, and you'll notice, remember,\n\n76\n00:04:12.448 --> 00:04:13.919\nI put that right on the desktop, and\n\n77\n00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.510\nwe're going to choose Open, and\nthen we're going to choose Upload.\n\n78\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.060\nNow, when we choose upload, it's going\nto ask us to download this file,\n\n79\n00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.040\nthis JSON file here.\n\n80\n00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.630\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\nsay we'll download it, and there we go.\n\n81\n00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.660\nWe're not going to open that.\n\n82\n00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.390\nNow, once that gets uploaded for\n\n83\n00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.840\na bit here it could take just a little\nbit to get the certificate provision.\n\n84\n00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.590\nWhat I'm going to go ahead and\ndo is I'm going to back\n\n85\n00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.940\nto where I've already got some\ncertificates that are provisioned for us.\n\n86\n00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.730\nSo we can speed up the process here.\n\n87\n00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.445\nNow, once you have the certificate\nhas been provisioned,\n\n88\n00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:56.122\nyou will see,\nyou'll actually get an email,\n\n89\n00:04:56.122 --> 00:05:00.850\njoined or that's attached to\nyour Apple iTunes account.\n\n90\n00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.770\nAnd they'll let you know\nthat hey you've got an Apple\n\n91\n00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.000\npush notification certificate\nthat's been provisioned to you.\n\n92\n00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.010\nSo, you will be aware of it,\n\n93\n00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.400\nit's not something that they\njust won't make you aware of.\n\n94\n00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.640\nYou just have to keep an eye on that.\n\n95\n00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.312\nNow, once you have that,\n\n96\n00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:17.380\nwhat we're going to do is we're going\nto just download the certificate.\n\n97\n00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.840\nIt's really just\na traditional certificate.\n\n98\n00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.310\nIt's a PM extension if I remember right.\n\n99\n00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.505\nAnd, we're gonna click download.\n\n100\n00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:27.045\nAnd, there it is you\ncan see the pin there.\n\n101\n00:05:27.045 --> 00:05:32.560\nAnd, we're going to go ahead and\nsave this and I'll save it to the desktop.\n\n102\n00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.590\nNow, that is the first step right?\n\n103\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.700\nSo, if we go back to the InTune\nmanagement portal, you'll see we've\n\n104\n00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.890\ndownloaded the APN certificate request\nnow we got to upload an APN certificate.\n\n105\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.680\nNow, when you do this, again,\n\n106\n00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.416\nyou'll notice that we've already\ndownloaded the certificate.\n\n107\n00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:54.940\nNow I'm going to tell you right now,\nI already have the certificate\n\n108\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.690\ninstalled in my,\nin the Intune account here.\n\n109\n00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.957\nSo, what it's going to ask us,\nIt's basically going to tell me you really\n\n110\n00:06:02.957 --> 00:06:06.140\nshouldn't be trying to\nupload a new certificate.\n\n111\n00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.400\nYou should just try to renew the one\nthat you have that's existing.\n\n112\n00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.610\nBut, still good to see\nthe process as well,\n\n113\n00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.690\njust in case they were to ask you on\nthe exam how do we go about doing this.\n\n114\n00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.320\nNow, I'm going to let you know.\n\n115\n00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.290\nAnd of course the session times out.\n\n116\n00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:27.083\nThey're very strict when it comes\nto keeping that session alive.\n\n117\n00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:29.234\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and\nget logged in here real quick.\n\n118\n00:06:29.234 --> 00:06:30.990\nHere we go.\n\n119\n00:06:34.506 --> 00:06:38.270\nRight now, because I already have\na certificate here it's going to\n\n120\n00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.440\ntell me there's little bit a mismatch and\nthat's okay.\n\n121\n00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.320\nIf it's the first time you've loaded it\nup, It loads up and it makes your mobile\n\n122\n00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.170\ndevice management solution here in\nIntune ready to provision iOS devices.\n\n123\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.480\nWell, how can we tell that?\n\n124\n00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.250\nIf we go back to I believe the Overview,\n\n125\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.290\nI might have that a little bit wrong,\nit might be the Dashboard.\n\n126\n00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.790\nYou will see that your devices\nare ready to be provisioned.\n\n127\n00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.170\nAll your the mobile devices,\n\n128\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.320\ndirect management devices and one thing\nthat's kind of cool, I caught this one,\n\n129\n00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.060\nremember we were talking about\ncompliance policies yesterday.\n\n130\n00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.590\nI didn't realize and\ndid not know this that the Android device\n\n131\n00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.482\nthat we uploaded, or\nthat we enrolled, it's jail broken.\n\n132\n00:07:19.482 --> 00:07:20.333\nRight?\nOr rooted,\n\n133\n00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:22.370\nexcuse me because it's an android device.\n\n134\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.630\nSo, it lets me know that right away that,\nhey, there's\n\n135\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.500\nsomething wrong with your compliance\nbecause you've got a rooted device\n\n136\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.860\nthat's now attached to your mdm solution\nso I thought that was kind of interesting.\n\n137\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:38.200\nNow, once that's done we are, really\nwe're set to deploy to iOS devices and\n\n138\n00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:43.570\nwhat we end up having to do now\nIs get the iOS device, the iPad.\n\n139\n00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.240\nIn this case, we're going to go ahead and\ndeploy to an iPad.\n\n140\n00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.622\nWe're going to have to get that ready.\n\n141\n00:07:47.622 --> 00:07:52.278\nSo, we're going to go ahead and we're\ngoing to set up our iPad next, and we'll\n\n142\n00:07:52.278 --> 00:07:57.004\nshow you exactly what it looks like once\nyou deploy things like the company portal\n\n143\n00:07:57.004 --> 00:08:01.890\nto the iPad and you now configure it to be\nmanaged by the Microsoft Intune Platform.\n\n144\n00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.296\nNow Dan, just like on the Android\ndevices and the Windows devices,\n\n145\n00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:09.479\nI went ahead and I downloaded the company\nportal, cuz just like the other devices,\n\n146\n00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:13.006\nany store that's associated,\nthe mobile app store, for instance,\n\n147\n00:08:13.006 --> 00:08:15.460\nin iOS devices,\nis gonna be at the app store.\n\n148\n00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.280\nJust type in company portal, and\njust like the other mobile markets,\n\n149\n00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:19.970\nyou should see it.\n\n150\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.790\nIt should be the first one on the list.\n\n151\n00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.130\nNow, we're gonna go ahead and launch\nthis up, and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n152\n00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.360\nget signed in.\n\n153\n00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.450\nNo social engineering here, I'm not gonna\nallow you to see the password cuz I don't\n\n154\n00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.000\nwant you attaching your device to\nmy mobile management solution here.\n\n155\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.640\n>> That's okay, Wes.\n\n156\n00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.820\nGo right ahead, and yeah,\ntype that down for us, would you?\n\n157\n00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.490\n>> Well, thank you, Dan.\n\n158\n00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.580\nI appreciate it.\n\n159\n00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.681\n>> I'll put this in the show notes.\n\n160\n00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:42.380\n[LAUGH]\n>> Very good.\n\n161\n00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.570\nNow, the good thing is the first\ntime you write it down,\n\n162\n00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.245\nit's probably not the right password\ncuz you have seen how I type.\n\n163\n00:08:48.245 --> 00:08:50.750\n[LAUGH]\n>> You always get one wrong.\n\n164\n00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.760\n>> Yes.\n\n165\n00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.180\n>> Then, you get another one wrong.\n\n166\n00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.908\n>> Yes, wow, you've definitely seen\nme type before that's for sure.\n\n167\n00:08:56.908 --> 00:09:00.680\n>> It's like watching a new born\nbull try to take it's first steps.\n\n168\n00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.750\nIt's funny.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.960\nThat one would be good.\n\n170\n00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.085\n>> All shaky and unsure of himself.\n\n171\n00:09:07.085 --> 00:09:10.400\n[LAUGH]\n>> All I gotta do is remember how to\n\n172\n00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.830\nuse the iPad,\nsee when I quit playing video games,\n\n173\n00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.970\nI completely forgot what these\nare used for, all right.\n\n174\n00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:21.570\nNow, when this gets signed back in there's\nstill another step we got to do, and that\n\n175\n00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:27.920\nis setting the iOs device itself, in this\ncase, the iPad app for mobile management.\n\n176\n00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.900\nOne of the first things\nyou're gonna notice is,\n\n177\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.320\nthat it says device enrollment and\ndevice compliant.\n\n178\n00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.530\nThese are really the same interfaces\nthat we seen in the Android device and\n\n179\n00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.160\nthe Windows mobile device, too.\n\n180\n00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.585\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\njust say begin here, and\n\n181\n00:09:41.585 --> 00:09:45.215\nyou can already see in the background\nthe company portal, it's open.\n\n182\n00:09:45.215 --> 00:09:47.915\nAnd it walks us through\na couple of things that say,\n\n183\n00:09:47.915 --> 00:09:49.215\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n184\n00:09:49.215 --> 00:09:50.285\nRemember, it's BYOD.\n\n185\n00:09:50.285 --> 00:09:53.095\nYou're bring your own device into the\ncompany, and they're essentially giving\n\n186\n00:09:53.095 --> 00:09:56.595\nyou some privacy information and\nsaying, are you want to do this?\n\n187\n00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:59.685\nCuz your Administrators gonna have\ncomplete control including erasing\n\n188\n00:09:59.685 --> 00:10:01.145\ndata from a remote location.\n\n189\n00:10:01.145 --> 00:10:04.490\nSo, just be sure this is what you wanna\ndo here, and we'll choose continue.\n\n190\n00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.230\nAnd this is where it says,\nwe care about your privacy.\n\n191\n00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.680\nWe'll choose continue, and\n\n192\n00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.690\nhere's where the other thing comes in,\nall right, the other part of this.\n\n193\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.500\nInstalling a management profile.\n\n194\n00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.660\nNow, how do we install\nthe management profile?\n\n195\n00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.410\nJust simple as pushing and roll.\n\n196\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.230\nWhen we push and roll,\nit's gonna reach out to any tune, and\n\n197\n00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.690\nit's going to download that\ncertificate that we've got provision.\n\n198\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.280\nRemember, it's got to be able to trust\n\n199\n00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.065\nthe in-tune platform\nbefore it can ever enroll.\n\n200\n00:10:31.065 --> 00:10:35.840\nNo, it's gonna switch me over here, and\nthen in a second, we should see that it\n\n201\n00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:41.530\nwant the iOS interface brings up\nthe device Management Profile.\n\n202\n00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.540\nNow, it's gonna ask us\nif we want to install.\n\n203\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.980\nIt's been verified, it looked at that\nsigning certificate, the APN, right?\n\n204\n00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.470\nThe Apple Push Notification\ncertificate that we've uploaded.\n\n205\n00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.430\nAnd we'll choose install.\n\n206\n00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.930\nNothing like hitting a button twice there.\n\n207\n00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.710\nI guess, I did wanna install it,\nthey just wanted to make sure.\n\n208\n00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.140\n[LAUGH] And it's gonna generate a key, and\n\n209\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:06.770\nthat key is gonna be how the iPad is\nseen to the mobile management solution.\n\n210\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.840\nNow, again,\n\n211\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.300\nit's warning you on this one because\nyou're doing a certificate installation.\n\n212\n00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.660\nAnd remember, don't take certificate\ninstallations lightly, right?\n\n213\n00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.090\nIf you don't trust where it's coming from,\n\n214\n00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.900\nyou could severely hinder\nthe security of your device.\n\n215\n00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.930\nAnd we'll go ahead and choose install,\nand we are going to trust it.\n\n216\n00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:29.520\nAnd then, what it's going to do?, it's\ngoing to verify that it is a good profile,\n\n217\n00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.540\nthat the certificate's good.\n\n218\n00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.800\nIt's going to generate the key for us.\n\n219\n00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.680\nAnd then, what we should see here\nin just a few seconds is that\n\n220\n00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.720\nthis device will be ready.\n\n221\n00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.850\nWe should be at least enrolled.\n\n222\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.980\nNow, we still have a couple other\nthings that we have to do, and\n\n223\n00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.880\nthat's the compliance.\n\n224\n00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.060\nAnd remember,\nthat when you're going for compliance,\n\n225\n00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.720\nthe compliance could take a bit.\n\n226\n00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.300\nSo, we're gonna choose open and\nit's gonna resign us in, and\n\n227\n00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.670\nit's gonna present that certificate\nout there to the Microsoft Intune,\n\n228\n00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.740\nand what we should see is a successful\n\n229\n00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.850\ndevice enrollment of this iOS\ndevice to the Windows InTune.\n\n230\n00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.020\nAnd you can see that right there.\n\n231\n00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.800\nWe got a green check mark next to it,\ndevice enrollment, it's successful.\n\n232\n00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.360\nThe next thing is device compliance.\n\n233\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.970\nRemember, we have the policies and\nwhen your device first connects,\n\n234\n00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.070\nthe policies aren't being enforced.\n\n235\n00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.940\nAll right, so what we have to do, is we\nhave to continue with device compliance.\n\n236\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.910\nAnd now,\nit's going to check compliance for us.\n\n237\n00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.260\nAnd if there are any policies that are,\nand\n\n238\n00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.100\nit said, you must set,\nwhat does it say, password requirement.\n\n239\n00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.920\nAnd you must set and\niPad unlock pass code within 60 minutes.\n\n240\n00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.620\nNow, that was one of the policies that we\nconfigured in the previous episode that\n\n241\n00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.380\nsaying, now that we're in\ncontrol of your device,\n\n242\n00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.700\nyou will comply with the compliance\npolicy, or you're not gonna connect.\n\n243\n00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.010\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead and do this.\n\n244\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.330\nWe'll do this later,\nwe'll do continue, and then done.\n\n245\n00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.720\nAnd sure enough here, and\nI'm not gonna rate the app right now.\n\n246\n00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.460\nSure enough, we're ready to go.\n\n247\n00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.140\nNow Dan, one of the things that I\nreally like about this interface is,\n\n248\n00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.460\nyou can see in the left hand\nside of that blue square,\n\n249\n00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.010\nI know it's kinda hard to see there,\nthat's the iPad.\n\n250\n00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:09.320\nThe one next to it,\nthat's the android device that A Simmons,\n\n251\n00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.940\nwhich was the account I used,\nassociated with himself as well.\n\n252\n00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.240\nAnd then, also, the windows phone.\n\n253\n00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:21.100\nSo I can, if I wanted to from this iPad\nnow, let me go ahead and cancel that.\n\n254\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:26.400\nI can pick up that Android device, and\nI can see some information about it.\n\n255\n00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.660\nI can remove it, I could choose done,\nI can go over here to the Windows phone if\n\n256\n00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.290\nI want, I can see that it's in compliance,\nwhat the model number is,\n\n257\n00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:37.590\nthe operating system and the name\nassociated with the device inside of\n\n258\n00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.450\nWindows Intune, all from a single\ninterface now, which is kind of cool.\n\n259\n00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.200\nI really like this, apparently,\nit really does want me to send some\n\n260\n00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.050\ndiagnostic information, so\nwe'll go ahead and say done to that.\n\n261\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.150\nYou can see that we have\nour support information.\n\n262\n00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.060\nIf you remember, we've had some support\ninformation that we put inside of\n\n263\n00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.360\nthe intune interface, and if I want to\ngo to my support documentation, and\n\n264\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.490\nclick that icon, well check it out.\n\n265\n00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:02.470\nIt takes us right to\nthe Microsoft's TechNet,\n\n266\n00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.220\njust like it did in the other devices\nwhen we needed support information.\n\n267\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:11.690\nSo, notice that there is a consistency in\nthese devices across all of the mobile\n\n268\n00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.460\noperating systems, including even\nthe Windows 10 desktop that we deployed.\n\n269\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.390\nSo, that's one of the great things.\n\n270\n00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:23.500\nYou really don't have to worry\nabout a compatibility issue.\n\n271\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.570\nNow, that being said as long\nas you're only uploading or\n\n272\n00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:32.454\nenrolling devices that if we remember,\nthat have the Android 4.0,\n\n273\n00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:37.820\niOS 7.1 I believe and above, and then,\n\n274\n00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:44.250\nwhen it comes to, once you have all of\nthe right operating system ready to go.\n\n275\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.250\nNotice, that it was just\na simple as in enrolling them,\n\n276\n00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.830\ncouple of steps that you have to do.\n\n277\n00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.860\nAnd now, you can even see all of those\ndevices from a single interface.\n\n278\n00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.240\nSo, very good unified or\n\n279\n00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.510\nsimplified user access in a consistency\nacross all the devices data.\n\n280\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.933\nTell you what It really\nis a decent platform.\n\n281\n00:14:59.933 --> 00:15:01.575\n>> Yeah, it wasn't too difficult,\n\n282\n00:15:01.575 --> 00:15:04.840\nI mean, I know we had to deal with the\ncertificates and things of that nature,\n\n283\n00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.310\nbut it really wasn't that hard and kinda\nheld your hand through just about everyone\n\n284\n00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.915\nof those steps to be honest with you and\nnow, I, most, a lot of people love iPads.\n\n285\n00:15:12.915 --> 00:15:15.655\nIt's a nice platform and\nfrom which to work from.\n\n286\n00:15:15.655 --> 00:15:20.015\nSo, just because you have an iOS-enabled\ndevice doesn't mean that you are out in\n\n287\n00:15:20.015 --> 00:15:23.790\nthe cold as it were, as a mobile\nuser inside of a Windows network.\n\n288\n00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:28.490\nWe can just use Intune to integrate\nthose pieces of technology together.\n\n289\n00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.600\nEven though, they kinda end up\nbeing a little like oil and water.\n\n290\n00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.621\nAt least, when they talk to each other.\n\n291\n00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:36.481\n[LAUGH] I always like to make the joke,\nit's like the middle east peace talks.\n\n292\n00:15:36.481 --> 00:15:40.760\n[LAUGH] Everyone's there, shaking hands,\nbut, there's still a little like,\n\n293\n00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.014\nleery intention happening.\n\n294\n00:15:42.014 --> 00:15:43.160\n>> [LAUGH] That's right,\n\n295\n00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.270\nyou don't know if everything's\ngonna go off the way you planned.\n\n296\n00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.339\nAnd hopefully,\nthere's consistency across the board.\n\n297\n00:15:47.339 --> 00:15:51.601\nNow, Dan I did mention one thing that\nI didn't actually show you guys that\n\n298\n00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:55.612\nyou can come back, and you can see\nthe overall management platform.\n\n299\n00:15:55.612 --> 00:15:59.750\nAre you consistent?, are you ready\nto Manage these mobile devices.\n\n300\n00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:03.112\nAnd Dan, here's what I was talking about,\nI found it now here,\n\n301\n00:16:03.112 --> 00:16:06.490\nit was just up here towards the top,\nMobile Device Management.\n\n302\n00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:11.450\nAnd look what it says as far as what\nmobile platforms can we support?\n\n303\n00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.000\nWell, the Windows phone.\n\n304\n00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.980\nNow, I didn't install the company portal.\n\n305\n00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:19.450\nI actually unenrolled,\nI guess you would say?\n\n306\n00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:23.200\nCan't say, unenroll this device so,\nyou could say that yes, it's ready for\n\n307\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:23.700\nenrollment.\n\n308\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.540\nSo the platform supports it,\nyou can see iOS Mac OS X.\n\n309\n00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.240\nNow that we've uploaded those\ncertificates, even Mac OS 10,\n\n310\n00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.920\nwe can deploy and start to control\nthrough the, Intune interface.\n\n311\n00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.350\nYou can see Android,\nremember Exchange isn't ready.\n\n312\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.670\nWhy isn't Exchange ready?\n\n313\n00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.780\nWe didn't run that Exchange connector.\n\n314\n00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.850\nSo that's again,\nsomething to keep up on the exam three.\n\n315\n00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.220\n>> All right, well Wes that, I guess,\nleaves us with just a few more options\n\n316\n00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.241\nthat we have to cover,\nand that's basically,\n\n317\n00:16:51.241 --> 00:16:54.390\nwe're kinda jumping back into\nconfiguration and compliance policies.\n\n318\n00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.370\nA few more things you said you had\nto go over when it comes to that.\n\n319\n00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.500\n>> Definitely because, in talking about\nthe policies, the one that, we just kinda\n\n320\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.240\ntalked about the policy, showing you\nsome of the things that you configure.\n\n321\n00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.400\nBut we haven't talked about something\nknown as policy processing.\n\n322\n00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.200\nAnd this could be something that\ncomes up on the exam, right?\n\n323\n00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.710\nYou remember Dan and I, what did we do?\n\n324\n00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:18.960\nWe configured a configuration policy,\nwe configured a compliance policy.\n\n325\n00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.010\nAnd we had different settings on then\nwell if I deploy this out to the mobile\n\n326\n00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.640\nwhich settings are gonna be what\nwe call like in active directory.\n\n327\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.540\nWe call a resultant set\nof policy an RSoP right?\n\n328\n00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.170\nYou still have to find out what is\nyour resultant set of policy or\n\n329\n00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.710\nwhat are the settings that\nare gonna be applied to the device.\n\n330\n00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:38.370\nSo let's take a look at this,\nI got a little diagram open here and\n\n331\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:42.450\nwith the Intune policy processing.\n\n332\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.270\nIt's important to understand\nthat the compliance policies\n\n333\n00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.928\nhave the highest precedence value.\n\n334\n00:17:47.928 --> 00:17:54.150\nAll right, if I create and deploy\na compliance policy and it has a setting\n\n335\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.940\nthat differs from a configuration policy,\ndoesn't matter restrictive,\n\n336\n00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:03.017\nless restrictive, the compliance\npolicy always wins out, all right.\n\n337\n00:18:03.017 --> 00:18:09.590\nConfiguration policies that goes by\nassociation have a lower precedence then.\n\n338\n00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.360\nYeah than the compliance policy,\ngot a typo there.\n\n339\n00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.310\nThe other thing to also\nunderstand is that a one to one,\n\n340\n00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.490\nif I have two compliance policies and\n\n341\n00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:23.762\nthey have conflicting settings, whatever\nthe most restrictive policy setting is.\n\n342\n00:18:23.762 --> 00:18:27.980\nAll right, and so when you're going one to\none, when each one of these head off, or\n\n343\n00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.890\nsquare off, right?\n\n344\n00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.270\nIf I have a compliance policy and\na compliance policy go with the most\n\n345\n00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.222\nrestrictive setting on the exam,\nthat's gonna be the one that's applied.\n\n346\n00:18:35.222 --> 00:18:39.540\nAll right,\nif I have a configuration policy and\n\n347\n00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.210\na configuration policy and\nthey have conflicting settings.\n\n348\n00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.940\nIt's always the most restrictive.\n\n349\n00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.360\nIt's really easy, you only have to\nremember really a couple of things for\n\n350\n00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.440\nthe exam, if you're gonna go in there,\nso you can get these questions right.\n\n351\n00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.370\nRemember, compliance over\nconfiguration when you're comparing\n\n352\n00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.750\neach of like policies,\nit's always the more restrictive setting.\n\n353\n00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.800\nSo, to give you an idea about that, we've\ngot a couple of policies here, right?\n\n354\n00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.160\nWe've got a Compliance Policy 1 and\nthe Configuration Policy.\n\n355\n00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.020\nNow, there are some of\nthese settings that match,\n\n356\n00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.580\nthere are some of these settings\nthat don't match, right?\n\n357\n00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.350\nSo notice that require to unlock\na password is yes on both\n\n358\n00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.900\nthe compliance at the top and\nthe configuration at the bottom.\n\n359\n00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.750\nBut notice that we have a minimum\npassword length of six and\n\n360\n00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.400\na minimum password length of ten,\nall right?\n\n361\n00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.670\nSix is the compliance policy,\nten is more restrictive, but\n\n362\n00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.278\nthat's the configuration policy.\n\n363\n00:19:32.278 --> 00:19:40.170\nSo what is our RSOP gonna be when it\ncomes to what are the applied settings?\n\n364\n00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:48.762\nWell if I go over to Minimum password\nlength, I can almost assume,\n\n365\n00:19:48.762 --> 00:19:54.390\nand you can do this on the exam, that\nthe applied setting is going to be six.\n\n366\n00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.760\nAnd let's review why.\n\n367\n00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.540\nWhy is the applied policy\nsetting gonna be six?\n\n368\n00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.190\nWell, It's because the compliance\npolicy always overwrites\n\n369\n00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.650\nthe configuration policy.\n\n370\n00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.450\nDon't worry about more restrictive,\nless restrictive.\n\n371\n00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.290\nIf it's compliance policy,\nit's setting takes precedence.\n\n372\n00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.150\nYou don't even have to care,\n\n373\n00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:15.050\nyou don't even worry about\nwhat the other setting is.\n\n374\n00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:15.710\nNow look here,\n\n375\n00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:22.130\nwe've got a password lifetime of\n20 days on our compliance policy.\n\n376\n00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.320\nOur configuration policy has 15 days.\n\n377\n00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.680\nThere again, don't worry about less\nrestrictive, more or less restrictive cuz\n\n378\n00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.930\nthe password lifetime is going to be\nwhat's defined in the compliance policy.\n\n379\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:37.560\nSo as we can see here our password\n\n380\n00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.240\nlifetime in the compliance policy,\n20 days.\n\n381\n00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.230\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\n382\n00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.980\nWe don't have to worry about\nless restrictive or not.\n\n383\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.750\nIt's got to be a 20 day\nsetting that's applied.\n\n384\n00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.592\nNow the last two, they agree right?\n\n385\n00:20:49.592 --> 00:20:52.350\nSo the configuration policy,\nthe compliance policy, they agree so\n\n386\n00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.380\nthere is no conflict and\n\n387\n00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.220\nit wouldn't matter anyways because we\ndon't worry about conflicts, right?\n\n388\n00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.760\nBut since they're the same,\nthat means that\n\n389\n00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.080\nthe next setting that we're gonna\nhave is allow simple passwords of no.\n\n390\n00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:09.060\nAll right, couple more example there Dan\nhopefully to help our viewers out there.\n\n391\n00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:13.425\nWhat if we got configuration policies and\nnone of them are great, right?\n\n392\n00:21:13.425 --> 00:21:14.010\nNone of them are great.\n\n393\n00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.910\nIn fact, we had a situation\nscenario that Dan threw at me.\n\n394\n00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:20.260\nHe said, Wes, what happens if you go\nin there and you configure a policy and\n\n395\n00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.540\nyou don't do it right?\n\n396\n00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.600\nCould we go back in there and edit?\n\n397\n00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.050\nWe said, yeah you can go in there and\nedit it.\n\n398\n00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.090\nSo this situation might come up if\nyou have two global administrators,\n\n399\n00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.410\nmaybe they are defined in different\nsettings, maybe not talking together.\n\n400\n00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:35.780\nSo all I have to do is go through this and\nfind out what are the most restrictive.\n\n401\n00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:40.590\nRemember, it's a configuration policy\nagainst the configuration policy.\n\n402\n00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.850\nSo it says require password to unlock.\n\n403\n00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.080\nOne says yes the other says no.\n\n404\n00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:49.960\nWell that's really simple that\nmeans our result and set up policy,\n\n405\n00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:57.050\nmost restrictive is gonna be no we\ndo not allow, or we do require.\n\n406\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.500\nHold on now I'm getting\nmyself confused here.\n\n407\n00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.180\nLet's try that again,\n\n408\n00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.680\nyes we do require a password to unlock\ncuz that's the most restrictive.\n\n409\n00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.180\nNotice we have a minimum\npassword length of six\n\n410\n00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.300\nversus a minimum password length of ten.\n\n411\n00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:13.530\nWell now ten, configuration\npolicy two is more strict, right?\n\n412\n00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:18.640\nSo that's gonna become our result and\nsetup policy for the next setting, right?\n\n413\n00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.226\nMinimum password length of ten.\n\n414\n00:22:24.574 --> 00:22:29.750\nAll right, now the next thing\nwe have is password life.\n\n415\n00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.910\nWhat's the maximum password age?\n\n416\n00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:33.680\nWell, we got 20 days and 15 days.\n\n417\n00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.740\n15 days is more restrictive cuz it\nmeans the end of 15 days you have\n\n418\n00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.030\nto change it, 20 is not.\n\n419\n00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:45.876\nSo what we're gonna do here is\nthe result and set of policy becomes 20.\n\n420\n00:22:45.876 --> 00:22:50.330\nLast but not the least,\nthese policies couldn't agree at all.\n\n421\n00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.850\nAll the way down the list there, Dan, so\nwe gotta allow a simple password, yes.\n\n422\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:56.390\nAnd allow simple passwords, no.\n\n423\n00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:00.410\nMost restrictive is we don't\nwanna allow simple passwords.\n\n424\n00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:05.090\nSo again,\nthat becomes your result in set of policy.\n\n425\n00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.570\nNow this is again, important on the exam,\nbecause they might set you up with\n\n426\n00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:15.050\na scenario, that you're given a suite\nof settings, a series of settings.\n\n427\n00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:16.830\nAnd you're gonna have to know which one.\n\n428\n00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.730\nNow, the same things applies, I will\ntell you, to the compliance policies.\n\n429\n00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.230\nNotice that we have,\n\n430\n00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.990\nwe're comparing compliance policy\none to compliance policy two.\n\n431\n00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.760\nThey're, they're the same, remember.\n\n432\n00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.690\nSo it's always the most restrictive.\n\n433\n00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:35.220\nI can look down through here and very\neasily see that a minimum password length\n\n434\n00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.390\nof nine,\nversus a minimum password length of eight.\n\n435\n00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:43.123\nNine is gonna override it, right,\nit is the more restrictive setting.\n\n436\n00:23:43.123 --> 00:23:47.410\nPassword lifetime of 30 days,\npassword lifetime of 15 days.\n\n437\n00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:52.170\n15 days is more restrictive,\nit becomes the result instead of policy.\n\n438\n00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:55.560\nLast but not least,\none says to allow simple passwords,\n\n439\n00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.880\nthe other one says do not\nallow simple passwords.\n\n440\n00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.440\nBecause the compliance appliance\npolicy number two is more restrictive,\n\n441\n00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.860\nthat becomes the result instead of policy.\n\n442\n00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:10.617\nAgain as a real quick recap,\njust remember when you have compliance\n\n443\n00:24:10.617 --> 00:24:14.886\nover configuration; compliance\nalways wins, all right?\n\n444\n00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:17.490\nWhen you're talking\nabout comparing the same\n\n445\n00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:22.260\ntype of policy compliance to compliance or\nconfiguration to configuration,\n\n446\n00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.670\nit's always the most restrictive\npolicy that wins out.\n\n447\n00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:29.100\nIf you can remember that going into\nthe exam booth you should be doing\n\n448\n00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.091\nvery very good for just about\nany question that they give you.\n\n449\n00:24:32.091 --> 00:24:34.130\n>> All right, makes it easy for\n\n450\n00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.040\nus right if we've got apples\nversus oranges, apples wins.\n\n451\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.120\nIf it's apples versus apples,\nmost restrictive apple wins.\n\n452\n00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.340\nOranges versus oranges,\nmost restrictive orange wins.\n\n453\n00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:47.950\nAnd, that's the Dan level of, [LAUGH]\nof remembering these types of things.\n\n454\n00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.370\nWell Wes, we've covered a lot of ground.\n\n455\n00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:53.780\nAnd when it comes to Intune, I feel\nlike I'm ready to tackle that beast, and\n\n456\n00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.650\nuse it to my advantage.\n\n457\n00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.000\nIf, hopefully our viewers are as well.\n\n458\n00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.430\nYou've done a great job\nof walking us through it.\n\n459\n00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.740\nI know it took us a little bit of time but\nwe wanted to be thorough,\n\n460\n00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.890\nwe wanted to make sure that whatever\ntype of device you're using,\n\n461\n00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:08.370\nwhen you wanna add that to your Intune\nenvironment, you were able to do so.\n\n462\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:12.720\nWe thank you Wes so much for arduously\nstretching through every little bit cuz to\n\n463\n00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.420\nset those labs up was very difficult for\nus and we appreciate that.\n\n464\n00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.390\nHopefully you guys have\nenjoyed this episode, but\n\n465\n00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:20.450\nit is time for us to call it a day.\n\n466\n00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.310\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n467\n00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.080\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n468\n00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.180\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n469\n00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.595\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n470\n00:25:27.595 --> 00:25:29.080\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.900\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is the famous Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.900\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.670\n>> I don't know about how famous.\n\n7\n00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.950\nI do know that we are here to\ntake a look at Windows 10,\n\n8\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.080\nespecially configuring Windows 10 devices.\n\n9\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.320\nAnd today, we're jumping into\nthe realm of networking.\n\n10\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.080\nAt least the very beginnings of it,\nwhich is really configuring IP settings.\n\n11\n00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.790\nAnd that's something we really want to at\nleast make sure that we as technicians\n\n12\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.850\ncan do.\n\n13\n00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.445\nAnd so\nwhen we take a look at IP addresses,\n\n14\n00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:45.540\nwe wanna make sure that we understand\nthat without at least the IP addresses,\n\n15\n00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.680\nwe can't communicate to any\nother device on the network.\n\n16\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.110\nSo we wanna make sure that we\nunderstand where we configure them and\n\n17\n00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.682\nalso some of the different settings\nthat are actually involved.\n\n18\n00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:56.960\nNow Mike, when I talk about this,\nI've been doing it for\n\n19\n00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.910\nso long, I hate to say it,\nit's almost like it's second nature.\n\n20\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.995\nI don't even think about it.\n\n21\n00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:05.480\n>> Yeah Ronnie, when we connect to\nresources on the network, typically we're\n\n22\n00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.130\ntyping in names, not IP addresses, because\nwho can remember all those IP addresses?\n\n23\n00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.940\nIt's kind of like with our phones right,\nwithout my contact list and\n\n24\n00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.330\nmy phone,\nI wouldn't be able to call my own father.\n\n25\n00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.600\nI can't remember all those phone numbers,\nbut I can remember my dad's name.\n\n26\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.380\nIt's the same way when you go out to the\ninternet, you can connect to Newegg.com or\n\n27\n00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.340\nBest Buy, or what have you,\nbecause you can remember those names,\n\n28\n00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.800\nnames are really easy for\nhumans to remember.\n\n29\n00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.350\nThey mean something to us.\n\n30\n00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.950\nA random string of numbers\nis difficult to remember.\n\n31\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.060\nBut computers can only connect to IP\naddresses, they cannot connect to names.\n\n32\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.240\nWhen they make a socket,\nyou have a protocol, an IP address, and\n\n33\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.030\na port number that they need.\n\n34\n00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.240\nSo when you type a name into your browser,\nsome magic is happening in the background\n\n35\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.650\nthat's taking that name\nthat you've typed in, and\n\n36\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.400\nturning it into an IP address\nthat the computer can use\n\n37\n00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.660\nto establish that connection, and\nthat's known as name resolution.\n\n38\n00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.170\n>> Right, and when we take\na look at the name resolution,\n\n39\n00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.270\nit's very important that\nwe understand something.\n\n40\n00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.380\nAt one time, right, really if you knew\nwhat the IP address was going to be,\n\n41\n00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.010\nyou could get anywhere.\n\n42\n00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.745\nAnd you can still do that today.\n\n43\n00:02:05.745 --> 00:02:10.235\nJust like Mike said, the very fact is,\nwe don't network that way anymore right?\n\n44\n00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:11.765\nIf you go to a website you don't say,\n\n45\n00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:14.215\nI wonder what the IP address\nof that website actually is?\n\n46\n00:02:14.215 --> 00:02:18.505\nYou just simply type in the name and we're\nright there, and we can get access to it.\n\n47\n00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:22.135\nThe reason why that's important is because\neven though that's intuitive to you and\n\n48\n00:02:22.135 --> 00:02:26.325\nme, my Windows 10 machine, as much as it's\nthe brand new operating system that's out\n\n49\n00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:30.670\nthere, it's still not smart enough to go,\noh yeah, that name actually goes to that.\n\n50\n00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.840\nAnd so, that means we have to know where\nto actually set that up inside of computer\n\n51\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.870\nto ensure that it can actually\ndo name resolution as well.\n\n52\n00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.890\nAnd so, when we start talking about it,\ntoday, name resolution is so\n\n53\n00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.250\nimportant- inside of\nan active directory domain,\n\n54\n00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.010\nwithout it, it's hard to\nactually even get around anymore.\n\n55\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.740\nSo even though at times it\nused to be almost treated like\n\n56\n00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.660\nit's an optional feature almost, but\nas active directory started coming out,\n\n57\n00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.640\nwe started seeing what it's\nactually really tied in and\n\n58\n00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.640\nintegrated in with name resolution,\nthat we can call it\n\n59\n00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.850\nactually part of a mandatory type of\nsetting that we really need to have.\n\n60\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.930\nSo, Mike, on my computer,\nright, if I want to do that,\n\n61\n00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.190\nif I want to make sure that\nname resolution should occur,\n\n62\n00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.170\nwhat we normally have then is I know I\ncan set an IP address, I know I have to\n\n63\n00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.230\nset some other things here, but let's take\na look at where to go and do that and\n\n64\n00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.040\nlet's take a look at some of\nthe options that are involved there.\n\n65\n00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.110\nSo on my computer, I wanna go ahead and\ntake a look at where we'd normally set up\n\n66\n00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.670\nsome of our IP settings,\nI'm gonna say it wrong, our IP settings.\n\n67\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.270\nAnd then,\ntake a look at the name resolution, and\n\n68\n00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.160\nwhat I was saying a little\nbit earlier is true.\n\n69\n00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.270\nWhen we take a look here, is that you'll\nsee that it seems easy enough, but\n\n70\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.000\nthen there's also more.\n\n71\n00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.130\nAnd that's actually where\nwe wanna get to as well.\n\n72\n00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.040\nSo you can actually get to, of course,\n\n73\n00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.800\nthose TCIP property\nsettings fairly easily.\n\n74\n00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.390\nI'm going to click on the Start button,\nand I can try and find it from here.\n\n75\n00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.780\nI can go to Settings,\n\n76\n00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.190\nwhich is the newer style in the way\nthat they of course want you to do this.\n\n77\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.460\nAnd then go to Network and\nInternet, and then in here,\n\n78\n00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.470\nI can select Ethernet, which is gonna\nbe my physical network adapter.\n\n79\n00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.250\nFrom there underneath this,\nyou can go to Change Adapter Options.\n\n80\n00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.810\nAnd then, once again,\n\n81\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.330\nyou're actually right where you'd normally\nsee in previous editions of Windows.\n\n82\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.190\nSo wow Mike, just trying to\nfigure that out was just insane.\n\n83\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.409\nIt really took a long time for\nus to get there.\n\n84\n00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:23.547\nBut remember that if all that fails, you\ndo what I do, you fail back to what you\n\n85\n00:04:23.547 --> 00:04:27.428\nknow and you go down to right click on\nthe Start button and then I go to the,\n\n86\n00:04:27.428 --> 00:04:30.441\noh I can't find it,\noh there it is, the Control Panel.\n\n87\n00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:35.306\nSee, that's my eyesight, and Mike keeps\nlaughing at me, you can't see, and\n\n88\n00:04:35.306 --> 00:04:36.260\nso there it is.\n\n89\n00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.530\nSo I'm going to go to Control Panel\n> Network and Sharing Center.\n\n90\n00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.540\nAnd then I can click on\nthe Ethernet0 over here.\n\n91\n00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.650\nOr I can go here to the left hand side,\nand you see the same verbiage over here.\n\n92\n00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.510\nChange Adapter Settings, and it's in here.\n\n93\n00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.289\nI wanna right click on that adapter,\nand then go to Properties.\n\n94\n00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.910\nAnd here it is.\n\n95\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.610\nHere's the ethernet properties, and\nthen I'm looking for, right how,\n\n96\n00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.060\nwhat I call TCP IP properties,\nversion four.\n\n97\n00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.740\nAnd I can click on Properties, and\n\n98\n00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.930\nit's right here at the beginning\nthat we actually set up.\n\n99\n00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.280\nNow when we start taking a look,\n\n100\n00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.720\nwe know that we can configure\na whole bunch of things right away.\n\n101\n00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.600\nBut we're really focusing in\non just the DNS right now,\n\n102\n00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.930\nwhat we call the name\nresolution services itself.\n\n103\n00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.290\nAnd so you can see where it's actually set\nup what we call in a dynamic configuration\n\n104\n00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.390\nright now, where it tells us to\nobtain an IP address automatically.\n\n105\n00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.390\nThat means it's gonna go out and\n\n106\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.030\nget an IP address from someone,\nwhich is gonna be a DHCP server.\n\n107\n00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.790\nAnd of course obtain DNS sever\naddress automatically as well.\n\n108\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.400\nNow, what I was saying was this\nis how I always used to do it.\n\n109\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.280\nIf I needed to, I could actually come in\nhere and set these things statically.\n\n110\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.080\nAnd then I'd just set a IP address for\nthat DNS server and I'm done, Mike.\n\n111\n00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.560\nAnd it works fine.\n\n112\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.430\nIt seemed like it actually works.\n\n113\n00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.490\nBut there can be more to that,\ncan't there be, Mike?\n\n114\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.250\n>> Absolutely.\n\n115\n00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.210\nOne of the problems is, again, we really\ncan't do anything without a DNS, right?\n\n116\n00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.720\nBecause we need that name resolution.\n\n117\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.550\nSo if you put an IP\naddress of a DNS server,\n\n118\n00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.340\nyou're gonna be able to resolve names,\n\n119\n00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.440\neverything's gonna work beautifully,\nuntil that DNS server is unavailable.\n\n120\n00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.870\nWhat if that guy goes down?\n\n121\n00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.460\nNow you have no DNS resolution.\n\n122\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.860\nYou're not gonna be able\nto connect to anything.\n\n123\n00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.390\nSo somewhere in there, Ronnie, we've gotta\nbe able to configure more than one, right?\n\n124\n00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.440\n>> We do, when we start talking about\nconfiguring more than one, well Mike,\n\n125\n00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.140\nit looks like that it gives\nme an alternate DNS server.\n\n126\n00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.520\nI could configure it right there.\n\n127\n00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.030\nAnd it looks like that that's all\nI need to do and I'm up and going.\n\n128\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.580\nBut you're telling me that it's\nprobably more complex than that.\n\n129\n00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.160\n>> There is.\nYou could do two and typically,\n\n130\n00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.400\ntwo is probably enough, in most cases.\n\n131\n00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.150\nYou put your primary,\nyou put your alternate, you're good to go.\n\n132\n00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.800\nIf the primary goes down, it switches to\nthat alternate address and tries that and\n\n133\n00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.080\nyou should be okay.\n\n134\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.230\nNow if both of them are down,\n\n135\n00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.280\nwhich hopefully the odds\nagainst that are pretty low.\n\n136\n00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.610\nBut if you want more fall tolerance,\n\n137\n00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.280\nif you need more than that,\nyou can actually add more.\n\n138\n00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.990\nWe can go into our advanced options.\n\n139\n00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.430\nAnd we can list five, ten, 20,\nyou can list as many as you want.\n\n140\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.720\nAnd again, it'll just go through the list\nuntil it finds one that's up and running.\n\n141\n00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.440\n>> Now this is what I was talking\nabout earlier when sometimes you go,\n\n142\n00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.360\noh I know exactly where to set DNS up and\neverything will work just fine.\n\n143\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.730\nBut the scenario that Mike just gave\nus is a real scenario that can happen,\n\n144\n00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.640\nwhere the DNS servers just go down,\nor they become unresponsive for\n\n145\n00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.690\none reason or another.\n\n146\n00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.270\nSomebody like Ronnie might have\naccidentally unplugged the switch for\n\n147\n00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.450\none reason or another.\n\n148\n00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.970\nOr I know I've misconfigured stuff,\nwhere now, all of the sudden, if they were\n\n149\n00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.220\nvirtual machines, I've just disconnected\nthe actually virtual network adapters too.\n\n150\n00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.560\nAnd now everybody on the network,\n\n151\n00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.080\nthe name resolution is not happening\nin the way that they need.\n\n152\n00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.500\n>> I see in some corporate environments\nsometimes where both of them, the primary\n\n153\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.770\nand the alternate might be DNS servers\nthat we're running, right, for my company.\n\n154\n00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.310\nOne of them fails, the other one kicks in,\nand I can still resolve names internally.\n\n155\n00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:48.100\nWhat if my, both of my DNS servers, or all\nmy DNS servers on the network are down?\n\n156\n00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.599\nI can go into that advanced configuration,\nand\n\n157\n00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:53.042\nI could list some public\nDNS servers in there.\n\n158\n00:07:53.042 --> 00:07:56.408\nAnd that way, I wouldn't be able to\nresolve internal organizational names, but\n\n159\n00:07:56.408 --> 00:07:59.256\nI could still go get, maybe,\ninternet access and things like that.\n\n160\n00:07:59.256 --> 00:08:02.476\nSo Definitely different reasons you\nmight want to list more than two.\n\n161\n00:08:02.476 --> 00:08:04.718\n>> Right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that configuration and\n\n162\n00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:06.540\nsee what Mike's talking about here.\n\n163\n00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.430\nSo even though we have this basic on the\ngeneral tab and just being about to set up\n\n164\n00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:16.190\nprimary or a deferred and\nalternate DNS server, this advance button.\n\n165\n00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.970\nAnd this is the first time that, I\nremember several years ago, the first time\n\n166\n00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.560\nI looked at it I was like, I hate to say\nit, I didn't even know that they existed.\n\n167\n00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.610\nWhy, because DNS was set up so solidly a\nlot of times that really it's a set it and\n\n168\n00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.790\nforget it thing until you need something\nto work and it's just not working.\n\n169\n00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.390\nPlus right here that what we can do on\nthis individual machine is notice that\n\n170\n00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:42.220\nthere's three tabs up here, IP Settings,\nDNS Settings and also WINS.\n\n171\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.650\nI'm not so\nworried about WINS today too much,\n\n172\n00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.630\nbut what we're worried about\nright here is the DNS.\n\n173\n00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:51.553\nThe Domain Name Server system\nservice is what we're worried about.\n\n174\n00:08:51.553 --> 00:08:56.400\nAnd right away you can see that when I\nput in that preferred and alternate.\n\n175\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.150\nI went in and listed the DNS\nserver addresses in orders of use.\n\n176\n00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.400\nMike, is this what you were talking about?\n\n177\n00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.660\nListing the IP addresses?\n\n178\n00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.190\n>> Exactly.\n\n179\n00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.566\nWe can go in there and we can click\nAdd and we can add additional ones,\n\n180\n00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:10.298\nin like a scenario I was giving you\nearlier, I might be at a branch office and\n\n181\n00:09:10.298 --> 00:09:13.794\nit's a small office and so all of\nthe G&S servers actually reside back\n\n182\n00:09:13.794 --> 00:09:16.780\nat the corporate office and\nI have two of them listed there.\n\n183\n00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.516\nBut that remote access to my way and link\nback to the corporate office has failed\n\n184\n00:09:21.516 --> 00:09:24.950\nand I can't contact any of\nthe servers over there.\n\n185\n00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.170\nBut I got more listed here and\nI can still get Internet access and\n\n186\n00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.168\nmaybe still work until they got that way\nlink back to the corporate office back up.\n\n187\n00:09:32.168 --> 00:09:35.030\nI think Ronnie, probably the key to\nremember here, and one thing I wanna make\n\n188\n00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.580\nsure everybody's aware of, cuz there's a\nlittle bit of a misconception about this,\n\n189\n00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.200\nis that when you list multiple DNS\nservers, if it connects to the first one,\n\n190\n00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.020\nand the first one doesn't\ngive you the answer you want.\n\n191\n00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.830\nMaybe it says, name not found, then\nit'll jump to the second one and try it.\n\n192\n00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:51.810\nAnd that's not the case.\n\n193\n00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.680\nThe way DNS is set up, and we'll learn\nall about it in our server classes, or\n\n194\n00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.350\nlater in this class maybe but the way\nDNS works, that's not gonna happen.\n\n195\n00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.780\nWhat's gonna happen is that if\nthe first one responds, and\n\n196\n00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.920\ngives you not the answer you're looking\nfor, well, you're kinda stuck with that.\n\n197\n00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The only reason it'll ever move to\n\n198\n00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.750\nthe second one, is if the first\none doesn't respond at all.\n\n199\n00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.660\n>> Oh.\nSo it's not a matter of failure,\n\n200\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.140\nit's just a matter of, or\nit is a matter of failure?\n\n201\n00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.450\n>> It is a matter of failure.\n>> It is a matter of failure.\n\n202\n00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.070\nSee I was about to say\nit wrong anyways Mike,\n\n203\n00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.730\nso I'm glad you corrected me because I\nwould've absolutely flubbed that one.\n\n204\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:28.130\nBut overall though on this DNS servers, it\ngives us the option to actually have these\n\n205\n00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.270\ngreen arrows over here on the side, Mike.\n\n206\n00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.524\nAnd so, what I can do then is I\nthought that the first one was\n\n207\n00:10:33.524 --> 00:10:37.392\nactually not working or maybe\nsomething was actually wrong with it.\n\n208\n00:10:37.392 --> 00:10:41.050\nI can simply select, let's say that first\none and just simply move it down the list.\n\n209\n00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.350\nAnd that just changes what that\npreference or that priority.\n\n210\n00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.320\n>> That priority, that exactly.\n\n211\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.140\nThe order that it's gonna try them in.\n\n212\n00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.690\nAgain, go back to\nthe branch office scenario.\n\n213\n00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.880\nI'm out at the branch office,\nI've got two DNS servers listed in there.\n\n214\n00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.700\nBoth of them are back at\nthe corporate office.\n\n215\n00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.810\nThey've recently added a DNS\nserver at the branch office.\n\n216\n00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.810\nSo I go in here, I click Add,\nI type in the IP\n\n217\n00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.130\naddress of the DNS server at the branch\noffice, and now I've got three in there.\n\n218\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.000\nBut the one at the branch office\nis at the bottom of the list,\n\n219\n00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000\ncuz it's the last one I added.\n\n220\n00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.940\nI really wanna try the one\nthat's closest to me first, and\n\n221\n00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.830\nthen only if that doesn't work do I\nbounce over to the corporate office.\n\n222\n00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.880\nSo now,\nwe can move that last one up in the list,\n\n223\n00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.850\nchange the order that it's\nusing those DNS servers.\n\n224\n00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.800\n>> So that's a great option when DHCP\nhands out those options and it says, hey,\n\n225\n00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.560\nhere's the preferential treatment.\n\n226\n00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.750\nAnd then, your at your branch office then\nyou go, well, yeah, that's was okay if I\n\n227\n00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:38.230\nwas in the headquarters office but here I\nreally need to change that order around.\n\n228\n00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.510\nSo what we can do is to simply select\nthat third one, and then move it on up\n\n229\n00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:46.250\nthe list, and that way we are fine,\nand we're now doing our DNS resolution\n\n230\n00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.290\nlocally instead, so that's a great\nidea and a great example for us, too.\n\n231\n00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.100\nNow, Mike, I'm actually seeing some other\nthings that are actually defaultly marked\n\n232\n00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.190\nhere, as well.\n\n233\n00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.580\nIt says the following three settings\nare applied to all connections\n\n234\n00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:05.140\nwith TCPIP enabled for\nresolution of unqualified name.\n\n235\n00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.150\nNow, Mike,\nlet's talk about that for a moment.\n\n236\n00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.020\nUnqualified name and DNS working together?\n\n237\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.100\nHow does that work?\n\n238\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.090\n>> Yeah.\nOne of the things we'll learn about DNS\n\n239\n00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.900\nas we go through our server class\nis mostly that DNS works with\n\n240\n00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.930\nfully qualified domain names.\n\n241\n00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:23.540\nWe're used to thinking about\nmy machine is maybe Laptop01.\n\n242\n00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.520\nBut when I belong to a domain,\nthere's more to my name than that,\n\n243\n00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:32.480\nit's laptop01.lab.net, for\nexample, or .Microsoft.com.\n\n244\n00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.250\nThat whole thing is my fully\nqualified domain name, and\n\n245\n00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:40.450\nthe DNS servers are structured, they\nhandle certain portions of the name space.\n\n246\n00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.930\nThere's one DNS server that handles\nnames that end in Microsoft.com.\n\n247\n00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:49.086\nThere's another one that handles\nnames that end in itpro.tv.\n\n248\n00:12:49.086 --> 00:12:52.890\nAnd if I'm gonna resolve a name,\nI have to know the full name.\n\n249\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.233\nI need to know what DNS server to talk to.\n\n250\n00:12:54.233 --> 00:12:58.620\nAnd if I just tell my computer,\nhey, I wanna connect to Laptop01.\n\n251\n00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.920\nIs it laptop01.itpro.tv?\n\n252\n00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.860\nIs it laptop01.microsoft.com?\n\n253\n00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.270\nHow does it know and\nit has to make some assumptions.\n\n254\n00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.040\n>> It really does, when we start taking\na look at how those assumption are made,\n\n255\n00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.250\nlet's kinda try and\ngive an example to make that work.\n\n256\n00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.510\nSo on my computer what I've done is\nI've brought up the command prompt and\n\n257\n00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.960\nI've got DNS working, at least I think\nI have it working we'll see here.\n\n258\n00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.660\nMike will actually go no, no, no, that's\nwrong Ronnie, that's not how it works.\n\n259\n00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.722\nBut remember that what he just told us.\n\n260\n00:13:27.722 --> 00:13:30.210\nBy default, if you're part of\n\n261\n00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.990\nan Active Directory you have your host\nname and you have your domain name and\n\n262\n00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:40.610\nnormally that's put together to form\nour fully qualified domain name.\n\n263\n00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.140\nThat's how DNS works,\nits based off of that.\n\n264\n00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.050\nBut what if I just simply ping,\nlet's say my DC.\n\n265\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:47.761\nDC01.\nWell,\n\n266\n00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:51.570\nthat is an example of an unqualified name.\n\n267\n00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.752\n>> Exactly, you didn't give\nit the last part of the name.\n\n268\n00:13:53.752 --> 00:13:56.484\n>> Yeah, so without giving it\nin the last part of the name,\n\n269\n00:13:56.484 --> 00:14:00.555\nwhat this setting is actually telling us\nthat should happen, at least I think, and\n\n270\n00:14:00.555 --> 00:14:03.368\nMike, you'll correct me if\nI'm wrong on this, right?\n\n271\n00:14:03.368 --> 00:14:05.784\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is that it says a pen primary and\n\n272\n00:14:05.784 --> 00:14:07.879\nconnection specific DNS,\n\n273\n00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:13.523\nspecific pen parent suffixes of\nthe primary DNS suffix I think they should\n\n274\n00:14:13.523 --> 00:14:16.375\nuse suffix more often in [CROSSTALK]\n>> Three\n\n275\n00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:17.615\nmore times in that paragraph there.\n\n276\n00:14:17.615 --> 00:14:19.799\n>> [LAUGH] So if I ping right now,\n\n277\n00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:25.623\nwhat is actually happening is it's\ngoing to return that connection for me.\n\n278\n00:14:25.623 --> 00:14:26.200\nNow, Mike,\n\n279\n00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.516\nI think this is what you're talking\nabout is right here where it says ping.\n\n280\n00:14:29.516 --> 00:14:32.769\nAnd notice that even though I pinged DC01,\n\n281\n00:14:32.769 --> 00:14:39.140\nyou can see that what it returned is this,\nthe appending that we're talking about.\n\n282\n00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.840\n>> Exactly what's gonna happen there,\nRonnie.\n\n283\n00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.566\nWhat it's doing is saying,\nall right, look.\n\n284\n00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:44.946\nYou belong to what is yours?\n\n285\n00:14:44.946 --> 00:14:46.408\nLab.itpro.tv.\n\n286\n00:14:46.408 --> 00:14:47.024\n>> Very good.\n\n287\n00:14:47.024 --> 00:14:48.616\n[LAUGH]\n>> I didn't think I could see that\n\n288\n00:14:48.616 --> 00:14:50.150\nup there, I have these old eyes.\n\n289\n00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:54.282\nWhat it's gonna do, it says look nine\ntimes out of ten if you are part\n\n290\n00:14:54.282 --> 00:14:59.410\nof a domain, the resources that you\nare connected to are in the same domain.\n\n291\n00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:04.348\nSo it's most likely that any resource you\ntry to connect to has the same DNS suffix\n\n292\n00:15:04.348 --> 00:15:05.520\nas your computer.\n\n293\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.458\nSo it says if you use an unqualified\nname I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n294\n00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:13.855\nappend your primary DNS suffix\nthe domain belong to that name.\n\n295\n00:15:13.855 --> 00:15:17.165\nI'm gonna assume that you're talking about\nsomething in the same domain as you,\n\n296\n00:15:17.165 --> 00:15:19.905\nand nine times out of ten Ronnie,\nthat's gonna work.\n\n297\n00:15:19.905 --> 00:15:22.865\n>> Yeah, so if it does work,\nwe're perfectly fine and\n\n298\n00:15:22.865 --> 00:15:24.930\nwe are glad that it happens, too.\n\n299\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:30.380\nBut sometimes it may not work and it just\ncontinues to then go on to that next part,\n\n300\n00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.740\nwhich is the append parent suffixes, then.\n\n301\n00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.470\nSo when we talk about that,\nwhat's the difference between that and\n\n302\n00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:37.500\nwhat I see right here?\n\n303\n00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.139\n>> What it's gonna do is it goes through\na process called devolving the name.\n\n304\n00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:46.361\nBasically, if we think about that\nstructure, looking at his domain name,\n\n305\n00:15:46.361 --> 00:15:51.756\nthere is DNS suffix, with that is a child\ndomain of a domain called ITPro.TV.\n\n306\n00:15:51.756 --> 00:15:55.788\nThis computer belongs to lab,\nthat domain, that child domain.\n\n307\n00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:59.051\nAnd it says, all right,\nwe'll if it's not in the domain that your\n\n308\n00:15:59.051 --> 00:16:02.340\nin maybe it's in that parent name,\nthat parent domain.\n\n309\n00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:07.860\nI'll just go ahead and drop off lab and\nI'll try dc01.itpro.tv.\n\n310\n00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.760\nWe're devolving the name, we're shortening\nit up, one domain component at a time.\n\n311\n00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.780\n>> So, why would that really be\nhelpful in a situation that we're in?\n\n312\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.510\nIs there a reason for\ndoing something like that?\n\n313\n00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.280\n>> Because in a forest, if the resource\nis not in the domain you're in,\n\n314\n00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.640\nthere's a good chance it's in one of\nthe other domains in your forest.\n\n315\n00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.510\nAnd that's just an easy\nway to work through it,\n\n316\n00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:32.870\nat least work through the tree,\nthe domain tree that you're in there.\n\n317\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.740\nSo just work its way through,\nbecause it already has that information.\n\n318\n00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.400\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n319\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.250\nAnd so it might as well try it.\n\n320\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.750\n>> Now, there's another setting here\nthat's not set by default, though, Mike.\n\n321\n00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.890\nIt says, and\nI can see it's actually unchecked.\n\n322\n00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.900\nIt says append these DNS suffixes.\n\n323\n00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.860\nSo, you mean I can actually just\ntake any name that I want to and\n\n324\n00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.850\njust add it in there at the end,\nand it'll do the same thing?\n\n325\n00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.970\n>> Exactly, so, what the deal is there,\n\n326\n00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:59.870\nis my domain tree might be something\nlike the parent domain is itpro.tv,\n\n327\n00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:06.030\nthe child domain is lab.itpro.tv Remember,\nin a domain, in a forest, I could have\n\n328\n00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:11.740\nother trees that have a separate or\na not contiguous DNS namespace.\n\n329\n00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:17.910\nSo maybe another domain in my\nforest is named contoso.com, right?\n\n330\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.060\nWell, by devolving the name,\ndrop off the lab.\n\n331\n00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.720\nI'm left with ITProTV.\n\n332\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.230\nI never tried Contoso.com.\n\n333\n00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.420\nSo if we wanna add\nadditional DNS suffixes for\n\n334\n00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.520\nit to try when you use those unqualified\nnames, we can just add them there.\n\n335\n00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.690\nAnd we can type in Contoso.com and\nnow it'll do that process.\n\n336\n00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.180\nBut, though if you read that carefully,\nright,\n\n337\n00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.600\nread that one more time to everybody.\n\n338\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.823\n>> It says append these DNS suffixes and\n\n339\n00:17:40.823 --> 00:17:43.986\nthen in parentheses it says\nin order is what it says.\n\n340\n00:17:43.986 --> 00:17:46.980\n>> And so it's a radio button right?\n\n341\n00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.290\nAs soon as you select that option,\n\n342\n00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:55.520\nthe other option to append primary and\nconnection specific, goes away.\n\n343\n00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.020\nSo guess what it's gonna do.\n\n344\n00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.050\n>> It shouldn't actually\ngo to the ITlab.itprotv,\n\n345\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.390\nit should automatically just go here.\n\n346\n00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.980\nAnd so any of the domain\nnames that I set here, then I\n\n347\n00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.630\nwould actually do like dc01.contoso.com or\nanything else like that.\n\n348\n00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.610\n>> It's no longer gonna try your\nprimary connection specifics.\n\n349\n00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:15.798\nSo the thing to remember there is\nif you want to add additional DNS\n\n350\n00:18:15.798 --> 00:18:16.868\nsuffixes, you can.\n\n351\n00:18:16.868 --> 00:18:24.228\nBut you need to still include in your\nlist manually now lab.itpro.tv, Itpro.tv.\n\n352\n00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:26.307\nYou have to go through that process and\nlist them all.\n\n353\n00:18:26.307 --> 00:18:29.821\n>> Wow, that sounds like a pretty\nintensive thing if I'm doing it\n\n354\n00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:31.560\ncomputer by computer.\n\n355\n00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.630\nBut at least we understand that if we\ndo need to do so we have that option.\n\n356\n00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.330\nBut remember what Mike just said,\n\n357\n00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:41.410\nthat if you select this it's not adding\nit in addition to those default settings.\n\n358\n00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:42.470\nIt literally changed it.\n\n359\n00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.200\nSo notice that the option\nis gone up here and so\n\n360\n00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.810\nnow we're only really using\nthis system down here as well.\n\n361\n00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:54.060\nNow Mike, right here where it says DNS\nsuffix for disconnection and it's blank,\n\n362\n00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:59.710\nbut if I have a domain joined computer,\ndoes it really matter if this is blank?\n\n363\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.090\n>> It doesn't,\nreally where this comes into play, Ronnie,\n\n364\n00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.940\nis if you've got multiple\nnetwork adapters and\n\n365\n00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.400\nyou've got one network adapter connected\nmaybe to your normal domain and\n\n366\n00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.150\nanother network adapter that's going\nthrough a different to a different domain.\n\n367\n00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:16.210\nRemember, it's gonna assume normally,\nit's gonna take your unqualified name and\n\n368\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.890\ntack on your DNS suffix.\n\n369\n00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.990\nWell if you've got a second adapter that's\nconnected to a different domain, you can\n\n370\n00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:26.790\nadd a connection specific DNS suffix for\nthat particular network adapter.\n\n371\n00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.910\nAnd it'll go ahead and\nthat way if it has a resource,\n\n372\n00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.690\nif you try to type in a name, it says, oh,\n\n373\n00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.540\nit's a Contosa.com name, I can use that\nnetwork adapter and I can go that way.\n\n374\n00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.210\n>> That sounds like a great idea when\nwe actually do need something like\n\n375\n00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.190\nthat to happen.\n\n376\n00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.870\nSometimes we just automatically assume\nthat there's no way to get done the things\n\n377\n00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:48.640\nthat we need to get done in our networking\nand just by seeing what we've seen so\n\n378\n00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.110\nfar, you can see where there's a lot\nthat can be accomplished by using these\n\n379\n00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.890\nadvanced TCP IP settings,\nespecially on this DNS tab as well.\n\n380\n00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.660\nNow there's still a couple\nof more by default.\n\n381\n00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.900\nThis one says register this\nconnection's address in DNS.\n\n382\n00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.240\nIs it not already registered?\n\n383\n00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.162\nIf you uncheck that now.\n\n384\n00:20:06.162 --> 00:20:07.638\n>> Okay, [LAUGH].\n\n385\n00:20:07.638 --> 00:20:09.640\n>> So what's the goal?\n\n386\n00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:14.230\n>> There are some settings that\nyour admins can do with DHCP, and\n\n387\n00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:17.150\nthey can say, all right, any time\na computer gets an IP address from DHCP,\n\n388\n00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.850\ngo ahead and make a record for it in DNS,\nor we can have the client do it.\n\n389\n00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.900\nAnd if you ever change that DNS suffix, if\nyou do a connection specific DNS suffix,\n\n390\n00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.810\nyou can say hey,\nI wanna include this when I register.\n\n391\n00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:32.540\nBasically, registering with DNS\nis like adding an entry for\n\n392\n00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.150\nyourself in the phone book.\n\n393\n00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.560\nIf If somebody else\nwants to connect to you,\n\n394\n00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.670\nthey have to be able to look up your\ncomputers name and return that IP address.\n\n395\n00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:41.810\nWell, you gotta tell your computer.\n\n396\n00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.280\nHey, make sure you go register and\ncreate a record so\n\n397\n00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.220\npeople can look you up and find you.\n\n398\n00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.810\nAnd if you start changing\nthose DNS suffixes,\n\n399\n00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.480\nyou might want it to list\nthose alternate names as well.\n\n400\n00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.300\n>> And that's where that second\ncheck box would come in.\n\n401\n00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:59.010\nUse this to connect DNS suffixes and so\nanything that we actually add in here.\n\n402\n00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.490\nThen we can also say,\nhey, let's go ahead and\n\n403\n00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.520\nregister those and that way they'll be\nfine and you'll be able to find out.\n\n404\n00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.690\n>> Not all the ones you can list up there,\njust the one you put for the connection\n\n405\n00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.440\n>> Okay, right here in that little box.\n\n406\n00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.630\nOkay, so there's a lot of settings\nhere inside of DNS that we do need\n\n407\n00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.200\nto at least know, because sometimes we are\nin those situations where we are in that\n\n408\n00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:23.160\nbranch office, and they're saying you have\nto be able to use the local DNS server but\n\n409\n00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.860\nyou're getting DHCP from the headquarters.\n\n410\n00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.930\nWell, how do you change that?\n\n411\n00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.790\nWell, we actually showed you\nhow to do that right here.\n\n412\n00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:34.110\nWhat if you need to look up not\nonly your own domain name, but\n\n413\n00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.800\nalso another domain name?\n\n414\n00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.080\nAnd as well, to append that.\n\n415\n00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.260\nWell we also showed you that option too.\n\n416\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.030\nAnd then of course down here at\nthe bottom about registering.\n\n417\n00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.810\nIf you know that you are going to be\nmaking sure that somebody else can\n\n418\n00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.040\nfind your computer this is\nhow you also do it too.\n\n419\n00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.460\nSo there's a lot that's set\nup just on this tab as much\n\n420\n00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:57.090\nas I thought that I knew DNS because I\nknew I could IP addresses right here or\n\n421\n00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:00.210\nthat DHCP would take care of it, so\nI didn't have to worry about it.\n\n422\n00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.570\nI'm starting to see that\nit's more powerful even for\n\n423\n00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.030\na single individual\ncomputer than I realized.\n\n424\n00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.330\n>> It is, in a lot of environments we\nreally never need to go to that tab,\n\n425\n00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:12.670\neverything's the automatic, the default\nsettings in a basic environment,\n\n426\n00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.610\nthey're gonna get you by just fine.\n\n427\n00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.920\nIt's when you start getting\nthis more advanced setups,\n\n428\n00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:22.370\nmore complexed forest infrastructures that\nsome of these settings can really help.\n\n429\n00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.140\n>> Yeah, we're gonna find out that\nthe very fact is and a domain, right?\n\n430\n00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.780\nAnd an active directory now becomes\nmore dynamic than we realize.\n\n431\n00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.770\nAnd that's why these things\nare actually put in there.\n\n432\n00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.500\nIf everything is static and\nremains the same,\n\n433\n00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.770\nwe probably don't ever\nhave to worry about it.\n\n434\n00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.070\nBut if your network is growing,\nand your company is also\n\n435\n00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.790\nmerging with other companies or\nconnecting with other companies.\n\n436\n00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.120\nYou're adding in branch offices.\n\n437\n00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.040\nYou're taking away branch offices.\n\n438\n00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.290\nAnd you still need to connect using names,\nor you can be like Mike and\n\n439\n00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:51.490\nbe like Rain Man, and memorize every\nsingle IP address you come across.\n\n440\n00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.990\nWell that's different, but most of us\ncan't, most of us still use names, and\n\n441\n00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:59.120\nso understanding at least the basics here,\nand a little bit on the advanced tabs,\n\n442\n00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.340\nare gonna help you out when you get\nready and prepared for the exam,\n\n443\n00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.800\nas well as in those scenarios that you\nmay run across in a growing network.\n\n444\n00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.930\n>> Very good.\nAll right, Ronnie,\n\n445\n00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.730\nanother great episode there.\n\n446\n00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.080\nAny parting thoughts on DNS for us?\n\n447\n00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.640\n>> Well when we start taking a look right,\n\n448\n00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.720\nremember it's not just about a single IP\naddress especially when getting ready for\n\n449\n00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.990\nthis exam you are gonna be\nexpected to know more than just,\n\n450\n00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.780\nI know where to set a DNS server address.\n\n451\n00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.550\nYou're going to have to know what\nsome of these settings are, so\n\n452\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:32.010\nmake sure you take time, take a look at\nthose settings, set up a little lab, and\n\n453\n00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.510\ndo some of the things that we just did\nto try to prove it and make it work.\n\n454\n00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.200\nThat's the only way you're gonna\nactually get used to it, and\n\n455\n00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.280\nunderstand what you're dealing with.\n\n456\n00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:39.870\n>> Very good.\n\n457\n00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.150\nAll right.\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n458\n00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:42.650\nwe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n459\n00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.800\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n460\n00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.850\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n461\n00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:49.437\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n462\n00:23:49.437 -->

00:00:20.540\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and with\nme today is the IP master, Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.460\nHow you doing Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.138\n>> I am doing well today,\nit's a great intro Mike,\n\n6\n00:00:25.138 --> 00:00:30.265\nI am not the IP master But I am very\nclose to being an IP master itself.\n\n7\n00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:32.623\nBut yes, we're actually here\ntaking a look at Windows 10 and\n\n8\n00:00:32.623 --> 00:00:34.015\nconfiguring Windows 10 devices.\n\n9\n00:00:34.015 --> 00:00:39.245\nAnd today we're diving into the realm of\nnetworking and specifically taking a look\n\n10\n00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:44.250\nat IP addressing itself, making sure that\nwe understand how to put IP addresses\n\n11\n00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.975\non a computer and as well as actually\nunderstand the IP addressing itself.\n\n12\n00:00:48.975 --> 00:00:51.740\nSo, we'll take a little bit\nof time in taking a look at\n\n13\n00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.850\nboth when we actually get them set up,\nis what we're doing.\n\n14\n00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.410\n>> Now Ronnie we know that in order for\na computer\n\n15\n00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.870\nto communicate on a TCP IP network,\nwe need certain information right?\n\n16\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.110\nSome of it required, some of it optional,\nsome of it very beneficial.\n\n17\n00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.310\nBut at the minimum, we need an IP\naddress that's unique on the network.\n\n18\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.200\nWe need a subnet mask so that it can\ntell what the network address is and\n\n19\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.760\nwhat part of that IP address\nis the node address.\n\n20\n00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.975\nWe'd love to have a default gateway\nif we want to get off of our subnet.\n\n21\n00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:25.620\nWe'd love to have a DNS server address, so\nwe can resolve names into IP addresses.\n\n22\n00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.590\nIf we're using wins on our network,\nwe're going need the IP address for that.\n\n23\n00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.300\nThere is a lot of TCP IP configuration\nthat my machine needs and\n\n24\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.870\nthere's really two different\nways that we can go about\n\n25\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.980\nconfiguring those settings on a machine,\nright Ronnie?\n\n26\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:39.780\n>> There's no doubt,\n\n27\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.020\nwhen we talk about those two different\nways that we can go about doing it.\n\n28\n00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.620\nOne way is what we call dynamically being\nable to do so using a service called DHCP,\n\n29\n00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.270\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n30\n00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.380\nThis is a server that we configure and\nwe set up to tell it to hand out\n\n31\n00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.560\nthe addresses that we want and\nthe options that Mike was talking about.\n\n32\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.650\nAnd that way,\nwhen a computer comes online,\n\n33\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.720\nit can talk to it and\nget all those settings assigned to it.\n\n34\n00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.570\nAnd that means something that's\nactually really good for\n\n35\n00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.750\nRonnie Wong, that means he\ndoesn't have to type anything.\n\n36\n00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.440\nRemember that if you've ever seen me type,\nit's a mess.\n\n37\n00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.820\nSo that's why it's also good.\n\n38\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.860\n>> Yeah,\nit's all taken care of automatically.\n\n39\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.870\nOnce that DHCP server is set up,\nIt takes care of everything.\n\n40\n00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.240\nWe don't have to go configure those\nsettings on each and every machine,\n\n41\n00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.350\nand that's huge.\n\n42\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.930\nBecause we might have hundreds or\nthousands of machines on our network, they\n\n43\n00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.960\nmight not even all be in the same building\nor same city or same country, right?\n\n44\n00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.560\nAnd so I don't want to run around from\nmachine to machine to machine and\n\n45\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.560\nconfigure these settings,\ncuz if I goof up, if I type in,\n\n46\n00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.130\nand as Ronnie said I'm the same way,\nwhat if I make a typo?\n\n47\n00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.630\nWhat if I duplicate an IP address, forget\nthat I've used it on one machine and\n\n48\n00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.940\nuse it on another machine?\n\n49\n00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.985\nNow I got two machines that\nhave the same IP address,\n\n50\n00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:50.200\nthey're probably both\ngonna lose communication.\n\n51\n00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.810\nIf I make a mistake on the subnet mask,\nthat's gonna cause big problems or\n\n52\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.570\nthe default gateway, or any of that.\n\n53\n00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.670\nSo by automating it, I can ensure that\nall those machines are getting the proper\n\n54\n00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.090\nsettings and I don't have to do\nanything and that's fantastic.\n\n55\n00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.860\nBut there are times Ronnie when I got\nto make the one thing about dynamic\n\n56\n00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.210\naddressing, it can change, right?\n\n57\n00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.580\nIf that computer comes back online, if\nit's rebooted or if it's powered off for\n\n58\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.140\na while and it comes back online,\nthe next time it gets an IP address,\n\n59\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.790\nit could very well get\na different IP address.\n\n60\n00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.020\nAs long as it's unique,\nwe probably don't care.\n\n61\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.780\nBut there are some machines and some\ntimes when we don't want that to happen.\n\n62\n00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.060\nWe want to make sure it always\nhas the same IP address.\n\n63\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.410\nAnd that's when our second\nmethod really comes into play.\n\n64\n00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.090\n>> Right, so the other method that\nwe're also talking about is statically\n\n65\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.010\nassigning them.\n\n66\n00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.420\nAnd this is where you and\nI would manually go in and configure\n\n67\n00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.065\nthe information that Mike was talking\nabout on those individual machines.\n\n68\n00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:42.875\nNow, it doesn't have to be for\nevery machine on your network.\n\n69\n00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:45.685\nAnd we can even use DHCP for\nevery machine if we wanted to, but\n\n70\n00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:49.195\nthe problem is what Mike was also\nsaying here, it's fairly simple,\n\n71\n00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:52.135\nis if that machine changes, remember\nif it's something that's essential for\n\n72\n00:03:52.135 --> 00:03:55.875\nmy network, well now everybody's\npointed to the old IP address.\n\n73\n00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:59.945\nWe have a new one was actually assigned to\nthat device, now nobody knows where to go.\n\n74\n00:03:59.945 --> 00:04:04.790\nSo when we talk about why we choose one\nover the other, normally with DHCP,\n\n75\n00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.640\nas long as the only thing that's\nreally needed is an IP address so\n\n76\n00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.080\nit can get connected to the network,\nDHCP is perfectly fine because it doesn't\n\n77\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.530\nmatter on my computer whether I had the\nsame IP address or not, I just need one.\n\n78\n00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.590\nThat's all that matters.\n\n79\n00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.110\nAnd then I can get connected to my network\nand all the resources that I need to.\n\n80\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.120\nBut, if there's a service that's running,\n\n81\n00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.690\nif there's a resource that's out there,\nand I know that regardless of whether or\n\n82\n00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.750\nnot my machine has the same one or not,\nthat it always needs to be available,\n\n83\n00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.160\nsetting static IP addresses\nare going to be what we need.\n\n84\n00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.520\nAnd we not only see that\ninside of our network, but\n\n85\n00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.700\nif you're out on the internet, you're\nactually going to have statically assigned\n\n86\n00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.610\nIP addresses for your devices that\nare facing the internet as well.\n\n87\n00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.850\nSo if you do have something\nlike a web server,\n\n88\n00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.390\nyou're actually gonna have\nsomething like that where you're\n\n89\n00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.650\nstatically assigning that.\n\n90\n00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.730\nInside of your own network,\nit's gonna be those essential services, so\n\n91\n00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.370\nthings like your domain controller, and\nactive directory, and your DNS servers,\n\n92\n00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.310\nand even your DHCP servers, all those\nthings that always have to be found and\n\n93\n00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.190\navailable, that's why I\nwould statically map them.\n\n94\n00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.952\n>> Now Ronnie,\n\n95\n00:05:01.952 --> 00:05:06.464\nI know that we can configure these IP\naddresses in a couple of different ways.\n\n96\n00:05:06.464 --> 00:05:07.323\nWhere can I go to do this?\n\n97\n00:05:07.323 --> 00:05:08.019\nWhere can I see this?\n\n98\n00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:11.558\nWhere can I find out if my machine\nis dynamically getting an address or\n\n99\n00:05:11.558 --> 00:05:13.210\nit's statically mapped?\n\n100\n00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.920\n>> Right, a couple of ways we can do this.\n\n101\n00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.490\nOne is fairly simple.\n\n102\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.340\nI can simply open up a command prompt,\nand let me go ahead and\n\n103\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.848\ndo that on my machine and\nthat way we'll actually be able to see it.\n\n104\n00:05:21.848 --> 00:05:27.110\nSo in the Search web and Windows here, I'm\ngonna go ahead and run the command prompt.\n\n105\n00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.720\nAnd then, from there, I'm going to\nuse a utility called IP config.\n\n106\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.230\nAnd there's a couple of different\noptions with IP config, but\n\n107\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.520\nif I need to find out if my computer is\nactually using an IP address, here it is.\n\n108\n00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.130\nIf it doesn't show up, then I know\nthat I don't have an IP address, or\n\n109\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.160\nif I get unusual information that\nI'm not expecting to see, I don't.\n\n110\n00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.255\nSo all this information that\nyou see listed right down here,\n\n111\n00:05:48.255 --> 00:05:49.840\nall that is actually working.\n\n112\n00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.810\nNow, if I wanted to actually\nsee this with the DHCP,\n\n113\n00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.750\nwell I can also do an ipconfig /all,\nwhich says,\n\n114\n00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.690\nhey, return more than just\na summary of the information.\n\n115\n00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.980\nShow everything.\n\n116\n00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.010\nAnd that way I can actually use this and\nnow you see it looks like it doubled,\n\n117\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.960\nif not tripled the amount of\ninformation that I handed over.\n\n118\n00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.730\nAnd right here it gives me a visual cue\nthat I am using DHCP when I see this.\n\n119\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.090\nRight here where it says DHCP enabled.\n\n120\n00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.870\nIf you're not able to see that,\nanother good reminder is what we call\n\n121\n00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.240\nLease Obtained and Lease Expired, letting\nyou know that this address is dynamically\n\n122\n00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.000\nconfigured and that means hey, I assigned\nit at a certain point in time and\n\n123\n00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.760\nafter a while I can also take\nit away as I need to as well.\n\n124\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.950\nSo we can get all that\ninformation just from there.\n\n125\n00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.950\nBut, if you happen to go,\n\n126\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.580\nI don't like that command prompt,\ncan I see it somewhere else?\n\n127\n00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.550\nYou'd better believe you can.\n\n128\n00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.580\n>> And I don't think we can change it\nthere, at least through that command,\n\n129\n00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.500\nwe can't change it either.\n\n130\n00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.150\nSo if we need to be able, if we're dynamic\nand we wanna configure it static or\n\n131\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.900\nvice versa, where can we go?\n\n132\n00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.710\n>> Yeah we'll have to actually go through\nthe actual GUI interface at this point for\n\n133\n00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.630\nus to do so, and\nthat's what we wanna show you now.\n\n134\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.640\nThe simplest way that I know how to get\nthere is through the Control Panel.\n\n135\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.880\nIf I right click on the Start button and\nthen I select Control Panel.\n\n136\n00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.370\nAnd of course there's no easy\none step way very quickly.\n\n137\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.410\nSo Control Panel and then Network and\nInternet > Network and Sharing Center.\n\n138\n00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.050\nAnd it's right over here on the right\nhand side where you see the network\n\n139\n00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.240\nadapter itself.\n\n140\n00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.370\n>> Can I show you a quicker way,\nreal quick?\n\n141\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:18.980\n>> Sure.\n\n142\n00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.200\n>> What if you right click\non that Start button?\n\n143\n00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.700\n>> Okay.\n\n144\n00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.270\n>> And choose Network Connections.\n\n145\n00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.500\nI know Windows loves-\n>> Oh yeah, that's right.\n\n146\n00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.010\nYeah.\n>> Windows loves to give you eight\n\n147\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.790\ndifferent ways to get there.\n\n148\n00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.570\nAnd they love to make you go-\n>> Oh there you go.\n\n149\n00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.210\n>> through all these\ndifferent hoops to get here.\n\n150\n00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.620\nBut in the end, if you wanna get to your\nTCIP, I think that's the fastest way.\n\n151\n00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.860\n>> Wow, that is the fastest way.\n\n152\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.360\nI didn't even know that one existed.\n\n153\n00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.870\nGreat job there, yeah.\n\n154\n00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.180\nSo and another thing that we can\nalso do is, from right clicking,\n\n155\n00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.260\nI can select Status at that point, and\nthen, we can take a look at the Details.\n\n156\n00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.910\nAnd it's right here where you can set up.\n\n157\n00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.890\nAnd see that same bit of information\nthat we saw with the IP config all.\n\n158\n00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.831\nAnd, so, if you want to see it right here,\nthat's what you're looking for,\n\n159\n00:07:55.831 --> 00:07:57.271\nif it's DHCP enabled, right there.\n\n160\n00:07:57.271 --> 00:08:00.638\nNow Mike also mentioned the idea\nof changing it if we needed to.\n\n161\n00:08:00.638 --> 00:08:02.333\nSo if this was a machine, and\n\n162\n00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:06.998\nnow all of sudden it became essential to\nmy network that Hey, this machine have\n\n163\n00:08:06.998 --> 00:08:11.328\nthe same IP address, this is where\nwe would instead go into properties.\n\n164\n00:08:11.328 --> 00:08:15.399\nAnd then what we're looking for is in this\nbox here that says the connection uses\n\n165\n00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:19.006\nthe following items and because\nwe're on a TCPIP Version 4 network.\n\n166\n00:08:19.006 --> 00:08:22.718\nAnd we'll talk about that in a moment\nhere that's what we're looking for,\n\n167\n00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:24.720\nthat's Internet Protocol version 4.\n\n168\n00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.650\nAnd then I can select Properties.\n\n169\n00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.760\nAnd it's right here where we can configure\nwhether or not this is dynamically set or\n\n170\n00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.070\nstatically set.\n\n171\n00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.960\nWhen you see that says,\nobtain an IP address automatically,\n\n172\n00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.660\nyou know that that means I'm\ngonna use a DHCP server.\n\n173\n00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.800\nThe same thing down here for\nyour DNS service.\n\n174\n00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.530\nIt says get the options from DHCP and\nassign them here.\n\n175\n00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.940\nBut I can also change that and\nmanually start to type.\n\n176\n00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.400\nIf I select the second radio button,\n\n177\n00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.390\nuse the following IP address then\nI can go on here and start typing.\n\n178\n00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:59.710\nAnd as long as I actually know what\nmy network is actually using, oops.\n\n179\n00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.384\nSee, that's where my typing skills,\nI tell you.\n\n180\n00:09:01.384 --> 00:09:04.124\n>> I see why DHCP is such a service.\n\n181\n00:09:04.124 --> 00:09:05.560\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n182\n00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.430\nSo, you'd actually end up\nassigning the subnet mask.\n\n183\n00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.800\nAs well as the default gateway,\nto be able to get out.\n\n184\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.624\nAnd so, from that point on,\nyou would just manually go ahead, and\n\n185\n00:09:17.624 --> 00:09:22.030\nbe able to put all of this\ninformation in there if you want to.\n\n186\n00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:27.280\nSo I'm even assigning another alternate\naddress that's out there, for DNS.\n\n187\n00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.110\nSo I can type that in there and\nwe're perfectly fine.\n\n188\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.000\nNow, I want you to notice something\nbecause this is something that kinda\n\n189\n00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.730\ntripped me up years ago\nthat I didn't realize,\n\n190\n00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.320\nthere were actually two\ntabs that were up here.\n\n191\n00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.029\nOne said obtain an IP address\nautomatically, but now I notice\n\n192\n00:09:41.029 --> 00:09:44.476\nthat there's one tab, and we'll get back\nto that second tab here in a moment.\n\n193\n00:09:44.476 --> 00:09:48.133\nLet me go ahead and click OK and\nthen now it's closed.\n\n194\n00:09:48.133 --> 00:09:51.677\nAnd so even though I switched the IP\naddress right in the middle of our show,\n\n195\n00:09:51.677 --> 00:09:55.280\nI still stayed connected because I really\ngave it the proper information and\n\n196\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.204\nwe were able to still keep that\nconnection that we needed to and\n\n197\n00:09:58.204 --> 00:10:02.160\neverything is actually up and good and\nyou can see where it's now static.\n\n198\n00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.390\nThis information,\nnow if we go back to the details.\n\n199\n00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.410\nNow notice that DHCP enabled is no,\nand that let's you know that, hey,\n\n200\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.350\nthis is no longer dynamically assigned.\n\n201\n00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.320\nNow, DHCP is not really\nworking on this machine.\n\n202\n00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.870\nAnd that means I've typed\nin all this information.\n\n203\n00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:19.550\n>> All right, Ronnie, so\n\n204\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.210\nI see the two different ways that\nwe could configure this IP address.\n\n205\n00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:25.640\nI can either do it statically, that means\nI know the information that I wanted to\n\n206\n00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.610\nuse, I typed it in, and that's what it's\ngonna use or I can choose to obtain an IP\n\n207\n00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.350\naddress automatically which\nit's gonna then do dynamically.\n\n208\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.810\nGonna connect to that DHCP server and\nretrieve that information.\n\n209\n00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.950\nMy question then, Ronnie, is what if I\nchoose to go with that dynamic route?\n\n210\n00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.780\nSo I've obtained an IP address and\na DNS server address automatically, but\n\n211\n00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.150\nthat server's not available.\n\n212\n00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.640\nNow what's gonna happen?\n\n213\n00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.600\n>> Well, there's a couple of things\nthat can end up happening here, and\n\n214\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.210\none of them is not really bad, but\ndoesn't let you stay connected.\n\n215\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.050\nThe other one is you can actually\nconfigure it to let you stay connected as\n\n216\n00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.690\nwell, as long as you have the information\nthat you need to make sure\n\n217\n00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.120\nthat you actually give\nthe proper information.\n\n218\n00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.910\nSo let me show you what\nMike's talking about.\n\n219\n00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.640\nIf I go ahead and\nclick back on properties again, and\n\n220\n00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:12.150\nthen select Internet Protocol version 4\nin properties, we can change this back.\n\n221\n00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.210\nAnd now, notice that that second\ntab ended up appearing right here\n\n222\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.940\nwhere it says Alternate Configuration.\n\n223\n00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.830\nLet me go ahead and click OK.\n\n224\n00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.860\nI get a little bit paranoid sometimes and\nI'm gonna open that one back up.\n\n225\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:28.610\nSo now I'm gonna use DHCP again and then\nI have this alternate configuration tab.\n\n226\n00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.580\nIf the DHCP service for one reason or\n\n227\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.910\nanother goes down,\nwell I could lose my IP address.\n\n228\n00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.920\nAnd if I lose my IP address\nwell I can't get connected.\n\n229\n00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.280\nSo what the machine gives us the ability\nto do is one of two things here.\n\n230\n00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.540\nWe can leave with this alternate\nconfiguration tab where we leave it\n\n231\n00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.440\nat it's default, and it gives us something\nthat we call automatic private IP address.\n\n232\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.570\nAnd that is a self-assigned\nIP address by the machine.\n\n233\n00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.720\nWhere it says, hey, you need an IP\naddress cuz you're on a network, so\n\n234\n00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.970\nlet me go ahead and give you one.\n\n235\n00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.360\nThe problem is that it gives you\nan address which only other devices which\n\n236\n00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.050\nare given that same range,\nare gonna be able to use.\n\n237\n00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.010\nAnd today,\n\n238\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.690\nmost devices don't have anything that's\nrunning in that particular address range.\n\n239\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.710\nSo even though it's an IP address,\nit's not really used for\n\n240\n00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.720\nanything that's super valuable in our\nnetwork, but at least for troubleshooting.\n\n241\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.711\nSo when we see this, it's called APIPA\na lot of times, and you can see why it's\n\n242\n00:12:18.711 --> 00:12:22.667\nactually kind of focused into\nan acronym here, A-P-I-P-A, for APIPA.\n\n243\n00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:27.487\nAnd that range is in 169.254\ndot anything dot anything.\n\n244\n00:12:27.487 --> 00:12:31.811\nAnd so, when a DHCP server goes down and\nthe server's seeing multiple computers,\n\n245\n00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:36.135\nwhat could end up happening is well, every\nsingle computer winds up in that address\n\n246\n00:12:36.135 --> 00:12:39.286\nrange, that 169.254, and\nthen they kinda argue and\n\n247\n00:12:39.286 --> 00:12:43.040\nfight about who's gonna get what\naddress remaining after that.\n\n248\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.490\nDon't get me wrong, there's plenty of\nthem that actually are available there.\n\n249\n00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.080\nThat they can argue over and\nbe able to assign themselves, but overall,\n\n250\n00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.300\nthat's what can happen.\n\n251\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.240\nNow from that point, they won't be\nable to connect out to the Internet,\n\n252\n00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.260\nthey won't be able to connect out to any\nresources in your network, but in a pinch\n\n253\n00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.670\nthey can actually talk to one another\nbecause they are on that same network.\n\n254\n00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.970\nBut there's really not a lot that gets\naccomplished with this type of addressing.\n\n255\n00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.876\n>> Yeah, more than anything it's\na great troubleshooting tip.\n\n256\n00:13:07.876 --> 00:13:10.810\nIf you ever have a machine that's\nnot connected to the network or\n\n257\n00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:14.737\ncan't connect to resources, you open up a\ncommand prompt and you run your IP config.\n\n258\n00:13:14.737 --> 00:13:19.966\nYou see an IP address that starts with\n169.254 dot something dot something,\n\n259\n00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.109\nyou immediately know two things.\n\n260\n00:13:22.109 --> 00:13:26.665\nOne, that this machine is configured to\nobtain an IP address automatically and\n\n261\n00:13:26.665 --> 00:13:28.576\ntwo, that it was unable to do so.\n\n262\n00:13:28.576 --> 00:13:32.505\nDoesn't tell you why it could be it's\nown network adapters or cables failed or\n\n263\n00:13:32.505 --> 00:13:35.437\nmaybe the server's unavailable or\nsomething like that.\n\n264\n00:13:35.437 --> 00:13:39.267\nBut for some reason or\nother it's unable to connect to DHCP and\n\n265\n00:13:39.267 --> 00:13:43.836\nretrieve an IP address so it's just\nused automatic private IP addressing\n\n266\n00:13:43.836 --> 00:13:48.866\nprotocol to generate its own IP address\nbut as Ronnie said it's pretty limited.\n\n267\n00:13:48.866 --> 00:13:52.579\nThe only thing it's really doing\nis giving you an IP address but\n\n268\n00:13:52.579 --> 00:13:56.026\nyou don't have a gateway set\nup on that particular range.\n\n269\n00:13:56.026 --> 00:13:58.078\nYou don't have DNS servers set\nup on that particular range.\n\n270\n00:13:58.078 --> 00:14:00.447\nYou don't have domain\ncontrollers set up so\n\n271\n00:14:00.447 --> 00:14:03.338\nit's really not gonna be\nable to do much of anything.\n\n272\n00:14:03.338 --> 00:14:06.856\nSo like I said, I think more than anything\nit's a great troubleshooting tip.\n\n273\n00:14:06.856 --> 00:14:09.680\n>> Yeah, you're probably not gonna\nsee a lot being used with that but\n\n274\n00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.100\neverybody just kinda sets it up.\n\n275\n00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.510\nBecause they kind of know\nthat if they get that,\n\n276\n00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.030\nthey know that something\nelse is in trouble.\n\n277\n00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.040\nSo they are gonna either\ntroubleshoot here or\n\n278\n00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.360\nthey are gonna troubleshoot\nat the DHCP server.\n\n279\n00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.190\nThe other option that you have is directly\nunderneath that with that radio button,\n\n280\n00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.980\nwhich is to use that\nuser configured instead.\n\n281\n00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.490\nSo while Mike was typing I went in and\n\n282\n00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.880\ntyped in some information that's\nvalid on this network as well.\n\n283\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.412\nAnd so\nremember the same thing will still apply.\n\n284\n00:14:33.412 --> 00:14:37.180\nThat APIPA address to one that we just\ntalked about will apply if one reason or\n\n285\n00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.630\nanother DHCP is no longer responding, or\n\n286\n00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.770\nmy computer's no longer accepting whatever\nthat the communication process is.\n\n287\n00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.440\nAnd then my computer says,\nI need an IP address.\n\n288\n00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.700\nThe first one will assign itself\nthat address in that pool or\n\n289\n00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.470\nwe can override it by selecting this one.\n\n290\n00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.530\nAnd then we can say, here are some\naddresses that we can use, and\n\n291\n00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.660\nstatically have that\nthere available to us.\n\n292\n00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.926\nThat if DHCP fails, here's\nthe information that we want instead and\n\n293\n00:15:01.926 --> 00:15:06.030\nyou may be wondering like, why in the\nworld would I ever do anything like that?\n\n294\n00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.160\nWell I used to do this back\nwhen I first got started here.\n\n295\n00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:15.110\nWhen I had a laptop that I was using on my\nwork network but then when I went home and\n\n296\n00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:19.230\nI didn't actually have DHCP\nturned on on the wireless router.\n\n297\n00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.490\nWell, it could actually say\nhey look i'm looking for\n\n298\n00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:26.070\nDHCP its not there I could either get\nAPIPA but I actually use this and\n\n299\n00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:30.010\nthen I was actually able to connect\nto my internal network inside By not\n\n300\n00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.080\nactually having to configure anything else\nit was actually able to get an address.\n\n301\n00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.370\nThe same address all the time\non my home network instead.\n\n302\n00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.510\nSo you can use it in that scenario as\nwell that way it does not matter, right?\n\n303\n00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.530\nWhether DHCP is working or not,\n\n304\n00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.780\nI still have a static connection inside\nof that network with valid IP addressing,\n\n305\n00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.360\nwith everything that I need,\nand still remain connected.\n\n306\n00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.740\n>> Yeah, way back in the day before\neverybody had those little wireless\n\n307\n00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.910\nbroadband routers at their house that they\nuse to share their Internet connection\n\n308\n00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:03.270\nwith all the computers in the house,\nwe weren't running DHCP at home, right?\n\n309\n00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.160\nIn fact, we had DSL connections.\n\n310\n00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.597\n>> Right.\n>> Where your phone company would give you\n\n311\n00:16:07.597 --> 00:16:11.619\nthe address that you had to use in order\nto get Internet access from your home.\n\n312\n00:16:11.619 --> 00:16:15.884\nBut when I took my computer to work,\nthat IP address was no good.\n\n313\n00:16:15.884 --> 00:16:19.772\nI needed to get an IP address from DHCP so\nI had to manually switch it back and\n\n314\n00:16:19.772 --> 00:16:21.950\nforth and that was no good either.\n\n315\n00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.370\nSo with that option..\n\n316\n00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:28.950\nI could be set to DHCP and if I'm at\nwork it's gonna find a DHCP server and\n\n317\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.430\nit's gonna use the address\nthe DHCP gives it.\n\n318\n00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.890\nWhen I go home it's gonna\ntry to find a DHCP server.\n\n319\n00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.260\nIt's not gonna be there.\n\n320\n00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.260\nAnd it's just gonna use that alternate\naddress that I've configured which is what\n\n321\n00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.780\nthe phone company told me that I needed-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.400\n>> For my DSL modem and\n\n323\n00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.470\nnow I've got Internet access at home.\n\n324\n00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:50.700\nNowadays though, even those little Linksys\nand D-Link routers are providing DHCP, so\n\n325\n00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:56.260\nwe can just be dynamic both at work and at\nhome and you don't see much use for that.\n\n326\n00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.570\nUnless, like Ronny, maybe for\n\n327\n00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:02.140\nsecurity reasons you've turned off\nDHCP at home or something like that.\n\n328\n00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.179\nYou don't see it used in\nthe corporate environment.\n\n329\n00:17:03.179 --> 00:17:04.120\n>> No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n330\n00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.761\n>> Because if you think about it,\n\n331\n00:17:05.761 --> 00:17:10.400\nif I've got to statically map an alternate\naddress for every machine at work.\n\n332\n00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:10.990\n>> Yeah.\n\n333\n00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.590\n>> Why don't I just go ahead and\nstatically map it in the first place and\n\n334\n00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:15.640\neliminate the issue altogether, right?\n\n335\n00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.500\nThere's really no need,\n\n336\n00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.210\nbecause you'll have to make\nsure that each one was unique.\n\n337\n00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.820\nYou have to say okay, I'm going to\nalternate address you this one.\n\n338\n00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:25.340\nThis one I'm gonna give you here and\nthis it would be.\n\n339\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.890\nIt would be just as much\nadministrative effort\n\n340\n00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:30.640\nas just statically mapping them all,\nin the first place.\n\n341\n00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.530\n>> It does let you know\nMicrosoft's unusual commitment to\n\n342\n00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:37.582\nkeeping the most antiquated settings\nthat we could keep on that machine.\n\n343\n00:17:37.582 --> 00:17:41.120\nEven though,it's about 15 years late than\nwhat we would normally be talking about\n\n344\n00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:41.920\nright now.\n\n345\n00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.340\nNow I'm joking a little bit, right?\n\n346\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.080\nThey do want you to actually\nbe able to do that.\n\n347\n00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.900\nSo they've not really removed these\ncentral networking features that a lot of\n\n348\n00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:54.150\npeople have grown up with even though\nit's again, like a decade later or so.\n\n349\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.620\nSo you just gotta realize that those are\nstill available options if you choose to,\n\n350\n00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.620\nbut most of the time we're\nprobably not gonna see it but\n\n351\n00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:05.048\nyou might see it on the exam so, you gotta\nactually make sure you take the look too.\n\n352\n00:18:05.048 --> 00:18:07.570\n>> All right, Ronnie, so now we know\nhow to assign these IP addresses.\n\n353\n00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.480\nWe can do it dynamically, we can do it\nstatically, we've got our alternate\n\n354\n00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.270\nconfigurations, we've got a PIPA that\nwe can use, lots of options there.\n\n355\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.030\nThose numbers you're typing in, though.\n\n356\n00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.120\nHow do I choose what\nnumbers I'm typing in, or\n\n357\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.080\ncan I just pick numbers and\nput them in there?\n\n358\n00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.200\n>> Well, you can, but\n\n359\n00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.610\nthe problem that you have at that point\nis somebody else may be upset at you.\n\n360\n00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:28.400\nIf you do something like that as well and\nthis is why we normally do leave it to\n\n361\n00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.650\nsomething like DHCP to assign because\nthat way that actually will be valid.\n\n362\n00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.510\nNow when we start talking\nabout it IP addressing I'm\n\n363\n00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.300\nnot gonna say it's the most\ncomplex topic in the world but\n\n364\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.210\nthere's actually more than there\nwas when we first started.\n\n365\n00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:42.582\nThere's two different versions of it.\n\n366\n00:18:42.582 --> 00:18:45.620\nWe wanna make sure that we at least\ncover a little bit of both, so\n\n367\n00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.000\nthat we understand here.\n\n368\n00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.780\nSo in the realm of what\nwe call IP Version 4,\n\n369\n00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.120\nwe've gotta remember that these\nare really 32-bit addresses.\n\n370\n00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.910\nBut when you and I take a look at them,\nit's really four sets of numbers.\n\n371\n00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.570\nThat's what it takes a look at.\n\n372\n00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.920\nAnd they're actually separated into\ndifferent ranges to help us out.\n\n373\n00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.250\nSo, let me show you a little table\nthat I made to kind of help us out so\n\n374\n00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.030\nthat we can see what we're talking about.\n\n375\n00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.110\nAt least I thought we could see it.\n\n376\n00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:14.080\nLet me see if I can bump up that font\njust one more point to help us out here.\n\n377\n00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.350\nSo, I know that doesn't maybe it does,\nokay?\n\n378\n00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:21.210\nSo, under IP Version 4, we normally have\ntwo different categories of addresses.\n\n379\n00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.880\nWe have public addresses and\n\n380\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.560\nthese are addresses that\nare a valid on the Internet, okay?\n\n381\n00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.480\nIn other words,\nthey can be used all across the Internet.\n\n382\n00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.260\nYou can use them as much\nas you possibly can.\n\n383\n00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.700\nIf you're actually assigned one.\n\n384\n00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.230\nThose are actually the ones\nthat are valid on the Internet.\n\n385\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.890\nThen you have private addresses\nthat are not valid on the Internet.\n\n386\n00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.560\nThey're not allowed out there and so\n\n387\n00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.360\nthey're technically one of those that\nif they get out, you're in trouble.\n\n388\n00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.240\nSo your ISPs don't actually allow those\naddresses to get out on the Internet.\n\n389\n00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.430\nSo by default,\n\n390\n00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:51.690\nthey separated them in the very\nbeginning into three different classes.\n\n391\n00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.070\nNow there's actually five\nclasses don't get me wrong and\n\n392\n00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:58.330\nI know that but, as far as for nodes\non the internet go, there's only three.\n\n393\n00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.240\nThere's Class A,\nthere's Class B and Class C.\n\n394\n00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.850\nAnd you can see the ranges right here.\n\n395\n00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:07.850\nAnd the key for us is to understand that\nif we're assigned these ranges that's\n\n396\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.170\nthe one you're gonna use,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n397\n00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:14.330\nSo, in other words if you\nwere assigned to Class A,\n\n398\n00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.650\nyou were actually expected to use that and\n\n399\n00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:22.600\nat one point you would have been expected\nto have to use that default subnet mask.\n\n400\n00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.360\nToday, a lot of that's actually\nall changed because we no longer\n\n401\n00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.310\nfollow the rules, per se, anymore.\n\n402\n00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.089\nBut just kinda realize that we have\nthese three different classes here.\n\n403\n00:20:31.089 --> 00:20:34.914\nAnd if you do see these, so\nif you work for a business and say,\n\n404\n00:20:34.914 --> 00:20:39.341\nhey my IP address is 129.0.10.35,\nwhatever it might be,\n\n405\n00:20:39.341 --> 00:20:44.066\nthen you kind of know that you have got\na Class B address if you have a Class C it\n\n406\n00:20:44.066 --> 00:20:47.836\nwill also be that way as well\nit will be within those ranges.\n\n407\n00:20:47.836 --> 00:20:49.903\nAnd that's what you end up seeing but\n\n408\n00:20:49.903 --> 00:20:54.171\nmost of the time on a Windows 10 computer\nyour probably not going to sign one\n\n409\n00:20:54.171 --> 00:20:57.440\nof these public IP addresses\nto this computer can you?\n\n410\n00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.990\nSure, you can do that all\nday long if you want to but\n\n411\n00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.000\nmost of the time these are actually gonna\nbe behind our router another words.\n\n412\n00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.810\nOn one side network and the Internet is\ngonna be on the other side so that means\n\n413\n00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:13.140\nwe need a bunch of addresses right that we\ncan use inside of our network instead and\n\n414\n00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.700\nthe reason why is that these addresses\nstarted running out very quickly.\n\n415\n00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.800\n>> And one thing I think is\nimportant to mention there,\n\n416\n00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.610\nthose public addresses because they're\nallowed to go out to the Internet.\n\n417\n00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.790\nRemember, IP addresses have to be unique.\n\n418\n00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:28.840\nIf I have more than one computer that\nhas the same IP address, I can no longer\n\n419\n00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.400\ndifferentiate between those computers\nwhen I'm trying to send data, right?\n\n420\n00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.200\nSo in order to use one of those public,\nyou can't just say oh,\n\n421\n00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.092\nI wanna put my web server out here.\n\n422\n00:21:39.092 --> 00:21:41.270\nI wanna put my Windows 10\ndirectly on the internet,\n\n423\n00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.680\nI'm just gonna pick one of\nthese public IP addresses.\n\n424\n00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.500\nThat's not gonna work.\n\n425\n00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.770\nThey have to be unique so\nthere's a process that you go through.\n\n426\n00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:52.910\nThey actually have to be assigned\nyour registered through what is it,\n\n427\n00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.300\nthe IANA, I believe at this point.\n\n428\n00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.170\nYou have to call them up and\nyou lease those addresses\n\n429\n00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.990\nfrom them because they have to keep\ntrack of whose been given what.\n\n430\n00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:07.660\nOkay, Microsoft has this Class or\nthis block of Class A addresses or\n\n431\n00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.880\nRonnie Wong's you to get this\nblock of Class C addresses.\n\n432\n00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.800\nThat he's allowed to use and nobody else\nwould be allowed to use those, right?\n\n433\n00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.600\nBecause we have to keep track\nof who's using which ones so\n\n434\n00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.440\nthat we can keep them unique.\n\n435\n00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.920\nThe private addresses, however, Ronnie,\nwe don't have that problem with.\n\n436\n00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.810\n>> No, you can actually use\nthose however you want to.\n\n437\n00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.520\nIt used to be just by convention, right?\n\n438\n00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.120\nIf you were assigned a class\nb address on the public side,\n\n439\n00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.900\nyou'd also come down here to\nwhere I show you on the private.\n\n440\n00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.210\nYou'd also use that\nClass B network as well.\n\n441\n00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.970\nBut you can use any of them that you\nwant to because behind your router,\n\n442\n00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:41.970\nbehind whatever faces the Internet, you\ncan treat your network however you want.\n\n443\n00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.570\nSo they went ahead and they made these\naddresses that are actually available and\n\n444\n00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:48.370\nthat's what you normally see running\non most Windows 10 computers\n\n445\n00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.220\nthat you're gonna encounter is\ngonna be these private addresses.\n\n446\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.980\nSo just realize that if\nyou have a private address\n\n447\n00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.280\nit's not gonna be\nroutable on the Internet.\n\n448\n00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.030\nIt's actually good inside your network.\n\n449\n00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.730\nBut then you can send information\nout through your router and\n\n450\n00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.660\nthen get routed on the Internet if you\nneed to and it's only those devices facing\n\n451\n00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.065\nthe Internet that really need\nthese public IP addresses as well.\n\n452\n00:23:06.065 --> 00:23:07.940\nNow we start taking a look at that,\n\n453\n00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:12.760\nthat is pretty much kind of the ones that\nwe need to at least be familiar with.\n\n454\n00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.810\nYou actually want more detail on it,\nright?\n\n455\n00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.970\nCheck out the A-plus and\nnetwork-plus shows, and\n\n456\n00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.100\nthat should get much\nmore familiar with it.\n\n457\n00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.550\nAt this point here, it's just\na review of these basic concepts.\n\n458\n00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.100\nYes, you do need to know them,\nyou'll still see them on the exam,\n\n459\n00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.100\nat least to verify.\n\n460\n00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.460\nRemember, that once you actually get\nall of that done, you're fine, but\n\n461\n00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.210\nknowing what goes in those\nboxes that we're typing in for\n\n462\n00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:37.320\nthe static IP addressing, that's what\nwe really want to get and get to.\n\n463\n00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.455\n>> And there are some other addresses\nwe should be familiar with as well.\n\n464\n00:23:40.455 --> 00:23:42.405\nWe got the special addresses.\n\n465\n00:23:42.405 --> 00:23:44.925\nThe reserved addresses with am IPV4,\nwe do.\n\n466\n00:23:44.925 --> 00:23:47.985\n>> There is a couple of them that we just\nneed to make sure we understand that we\n\n467\n00:23:47.985 --> 00:23:52.085\npay attention to and here on my list I\nwill also show that as well to try and\n\n468\n00:23:52.085 --> 00:23:53.045\nhelp us out.\n\n469\n00:23:53.045 --> 00:23:56.666\nSo you might see a loop back address,\n1270.0.1.\n\n470\n00:23:56.666 --> 00:23:59.035\nThat is for\ntesting more than anything else.\n\n471\n00:23:59.035 --> 00:24:01.250\nWhat we call the home\naddresses at some point.\n\n472\n00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.340\nAnd that allows you to verify that your\nnetwork adapter is actually working,\n\n473\n00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.030\nresponding, and\nbeing able to send information out.\n\n474\n00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:07.761\nSo that's a good one.\n\n475\n00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:10.234\nTo tell you the truth,\nanything in the 127 network will work.\n\n476\n00:24:10.234 --> 00:24:12.254\nYou don't always have to do the 0.0.1.\n\n477\n00:24:12.254 --> 00:24:14.134\nYou can type in any of those\nthat are actually valid.\n\n478\n00:24:14.134 --> 00:24:16.456\nNow There's something I just\nwant to make sure I mention now.\n\n479\n00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:22.310\nThe highest number that we can get\nin these blocks is going to be 255.\n\n480\n00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.320\nSo if you see one that says 127 256,\n\n481\n00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.030\nthat's not going to be valid\nanywhere because that doesn't work.\n\n482\n00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.210\nSo that's the highest number\nthat you can see there.\n\n483\n00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.161\nThe other one that we were talking about\nwas the APIPA, and anything in this range,\n\n484\n00:24:32.161 --> 00:24:35.243\nremember that when you're seeing that It's\nthe troubleshooting things that Mike was\n\n485\n00:24:35.243 --> 00:24:36.360\nactually mentioning before.\n\n486\n00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.670\nWhen you see that, you're not\ngonna be able to communicate with,\n\n487\n00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.900\nwell, any resource that's on your network.\n\n488\n00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.590\nAnd then today,\nit's actually even more important.\n\n489\n00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:48.130\nBecause we're really trying to move away\nfrom the realm of broadcast anymore.\n\n490\n00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.700\nYou can see what more and\nmore will call multicast traffic.\n\n491\n00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.150\nAnd so, if you do see addresses like\nthis floating around on your network.\n\n492\n00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.920\nAs you know, you actually have\nnetwork sniffers out there.\n\n493\n00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.240\nYou'll probably see a lot more in\nthis 224 range than anything else.\n\n494\n00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.840\nAnd so, those are special today\nthat we do have to worry about.\n\n495\n00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.460\nBut just kind of realized that these are\nthings and these will never be assigned\n\n496\n00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.850\ndirectly to an individual computer for\nvalid use on the network.\n\n497\n00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.606\nSomebody can't just say, hey,\n\n498\n00:25:14.606 --> 00:25:19.010\nI'm gonna use 127.127.127.1 as my\nIP address inside of my network.\n\n499\n00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.266\nIt's not gonna work for us.\n\n500\n00:25:20.266 --> 00:25:21.172\nAnd even the other ones,\n\n501\n00:25:21.172 --> 00:25:23.771\neven though you can assign them that way,\nit's not gonna work either.\n\n502\n00:25:23.771 --> 00:25:26.129\nSo those are some special\nIP version 4 addresses.\n\n503\n00:25:26.129 --> 00:25:29.339\n>> All right, well, Ronnie,\nwe've mentioned earlier and\n\n504\n00:25:29.339 --> 00:25:33.793\nI know a couple people, Rick and David in\nour chat room have started talking about\n\n505\n00:25:33.793 --> 00:25:37.918\nthe fact that IPv4 has been around for\na while and, in the very beginning,\n\n506\n00:25:37.918 --> 00:25:40.700\nyou know,\nthe internet wasn't what it is today.\n\n507\n00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.910\nSo, maybe it wasn't handled as\nefficiently as it could have been.\n\n508\n00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:48.870\nAnd the number of devices has simply\nexploded out there on the internet.\n\n509\n00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:53.880\nAnd so, while it's a pretty good range\nof numbers, it's limited to what,\n\n510\n00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.930\nI guess technically you could say\n4 point something billion, but\n\n511\n00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.390\na lot of those addresses are not\navailable for us to use.\n\n512\n00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.840\nThey're reserved, they're multicast,\nthings like that.\n\n513\n00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.410\nSo it's really not even\nclose to that many.\n\n514\n00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:09.680\nSo they've come out with a new\naddressing scheme to replace the IPv4\n\n515\n00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.480\nto kind of carry us into the next age.\n\n516\n00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.020\n>> Right, it's what we call IPv6 right.\n\n517\n00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.860\nSo in IPv4 the problem is fairly simple,\n\n518\n00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.690\nthere's no more left to\nassign out there anymore.\n\n519\n00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:21.460\nAll those that were kept\nin reserve are out there.\n\n520\n00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.280\nIt doesn't mean that we're\ncompletely empty of them,\n\n521\n00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.080\nbut it means nobody's going to actually\nassign you a new one any more.\n\n522\n00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.880\nSo unless somebody turns them back in and\nsays oh yeah I don't need them anymore.\n\n523\n00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.160\nWell, then there's probably not\ngoing to be any more to assign.\n\n524\n00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.500\nSo a little bit under 4.3\nbillion possibilities and\n\n525\n00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.750\nthen you subtract all the ones\nthat Mike was talking about.\n\n526\n00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.960\nThen he realizes that it's\na fairly smaller number than that.\n\n527\n00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.430\nSo, of course, IP version 6,\nwell, what they did is say,\n\n528\n00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.580\nlook, we can't run out of addresses again.\n\n529\n00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.360\nSo instead of 4.3 billion,\nthey now start talking about, well,\n\n530\n00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.820\neven terms that I don't understand.\n\n531\n00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.580\nUndiscillion is where we get this term.\n\n532\n00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.100\nNow, if you're trying to figure that out,\nit's so big, right,\n\n533\n00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:04.030\nthat even the analogies used to describe\nthe address space here are insane.\n\n534\n00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.710\nThey don't make sense.\n\n535\n00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:09.160\nSo when you start thinking about stuff\nlike that, if you ever follow, like,\n\n536\n00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:14.920\na blog out there on the internet called\nxkcd, which is a great little blog.\n\n537\n00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.930\nBut they talk about,\nif you were to make nanobots, right, and\n\n538\n00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:21.220\nassign the entire, in other words,\nmake each one, and make that number.\n\n539\n00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.300\nThat's actually the IP\nversion 6 address space.\n\n540\n00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.240\nIt would equal to 40%\nof the Earth's volume.\n\n541\n00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.560\nNow imagine,\nnanobots are the size of cells.\n\n542\n00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.200\nAnd they're saying if you make\nthat many that would be 40% of\n\n543\n00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.980\nthe volume of the planet Earth.\n\n544\n00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.910\nHow does that even make sense?\n\n545\n00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:36.570\n>> I'm with you.\n\n546\n00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:40.460\nIt's almost impossible to imagine\nhalf the Earth full of nanobots.\n\n547\n00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:44.590\nI've heard other analogies about\nif an IP address was a grain\n\n548\n00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.860\nof sand they could fill so\nmany Earths or weird stuff like that.\n\n549\n00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.280\nThe one I like to use is simply this.\n\n550\n00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.670\nTake a piece of paper out.\n\n551\n00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:56.540\nWrite the number one,comma, and\nthen zero,zero, zero, comma,\n\n552\n00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:01.780\nZero, zero, zero, comma, and\nkeep going until you have 12 zeros.\n\n553\n00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.372\nThat you're gonna run outta\npaper as you right that number.\n\n554\n00:28:04.372 --> 00:28:09.960\n[LAUGH] And with IPv6 that with 12 numbers\nbehind it, that's known as an undecillion.\n\n555\n00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.115\nAnd with IPV6 you don't\nget one undecillion.\n\n556\n00:28:13.115 --> 00:28:15.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You get 340 undecillion.\n\n557\n00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.390\nAnd so that's one of the ways one\nof the ways I like to look at it.\n\n558\n00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.110\n>> Yeah.\n>> But it's just a number that,\n\n559\n00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.990\nwe'll probably never,\nyou say probably never run out.\n\n560\n00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.910\n>> Right.\n\n561\n00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:29.620\nYeah and the other thing that we also have\nto realize about IPv6 is unlike IPv4,\n\n562\n00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.500\nwhich is you have one address,\n\n563\n00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:36.040\nreally, that makes you unique inside of\nyour network, in IPv6 you're gonna see\n\n564\n00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:41.100\nmultiple addresses assigned to really even\nthe same individual node or computer.\n\n565\n00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.580\n>> And so there are different types\nof addresses that will be used for\n\n566\n00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.330\ndifferent things.\n\n567\n00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:48.400\nSo let me show you an example of a small\nlist of what we're talking about, too.\n\n568\n00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.700\nSo, by default when you take a look at\nIPv6, you're really dealing with four,\n\n569\n00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.210\nnow there's a lot more than this.\n\n570\n00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:55.890\nBut these are the four major ones.\n\n571\n00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.500\nLink Local is what you\nalso end up seeing here.\n\n572\n00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.850\nAnd that begins with FE80, okay?\n\n573\n00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.370\nThat really does work like the\nself-assigned like the APIPA address does.\n\n574\n00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.540\nBut unlike APIPA, it's actually useful.\n\n575\n00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.790\nIt really is useful.\n\n576\n00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.930\nAnd it's kinda strange, but it allows for\npoint-to-point communication.\n\n577\n00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.680\nSo, when you actually\nare communicating and\n\n578\n00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.220\nsending traffic, the majority of it\nis actually over this Link Local.\n\n579\n00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.160\nNow that doesn't mean\nthat you can't do more.\n\n580\n00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.970\nBut notice that you also\nhave a global unique,\n\n581\n00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.010\nwhich work like public IP addresses.\n\n582\n00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:26.700\nAnd this is where we do our routing of\ndata from one location to another, and\n\n583\n00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.620\neven in that though.\n\n584\n00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.302\nOnce I actually get to that next device,\n\n585\n00:29:29.302 --> 00:29:31.182\nto actually sending over the link local,\nand\n\n586\n00:29:31.182 --> 00:29:34.710\nthen they're routing it with the global\nunique address that begins with 2000.\n\n587\n00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:36.092\nAnd they also have the 3.\n\n588\n00:29:36.092 --> 00:29:39.532\nNow, if you're looking at these numbers,\nand you're like, wow,\n\n589\n00:29:39.532 --> 00:29:43.508\nthose are weird numbers, the ten actually\nis actually indicating how many bits\n\n590\n00:29:43.508 --> 00:29:45.249\nare significant in that address.\n\n591\n00:29:45.249 --> 00:29:49.196\nSo the first ten bits of the FEA0,\nthe first three bits here of the two and\n\n592\n00:29:49.196 --> 00:29:51.683\nyour probably wandering\nwhat is this about?\n\n593\n00:29:51.683 --> 00:29:54.881\nWell these are normally reported\nin a hexidecimal number, but\n\n594\n00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:58.501\nthey actually still do these slash\nnotations with the binary bytes, so\n\n595\n00:29:58.501 --> 00:30:00.029\nthe first three binary bits.\n\n596\n00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:02.382\nAnd then multicast is FF00, and\n\n597\n00:30:02.382 --> 00:30:07.660\nthen there's also a private address\nhere that begins with FD00.\n\n598\n00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.160\nNow, this is kind of a weird one,\nbecause technically it begins with FC.\n\n599\n00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:16.030\nBut the way that it actually works out,\nyou actually have to begin with FD.\n\n600\n00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.230\nAgain, if you know hexadecimal\nbetter than I do, it makes sense.\n\n601\n00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.885\nBut if you're like me, like,\noh, I'll just trust it.\n\n602\n00:30:21.885 --> 00:30:23.890\n[LAUGH] That's what you do.\n\n603\n00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.900\nSo you'll see those numbers,\nand I'll tell you the truth,\n\n604\n00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.550\non my computer you can actually see\nsome of those numbers right now.\n\n605\n00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:34.870\nI've just flipped on over to my Windows\nmachine, and I click details right here,\n\n606\n00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.090\nI can see down I've got\nthat link local address.\n\n607\n00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.203\nAnd this is a little bit difficult to see,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n608\n00:30:41.203 --> 00:30:43.520\nbring up my command prompt again.\n\n609\n00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.800\nAnd do my IP config all.\n\n610\n00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.301\nAnd I believe I was actually seeing,\noh, there it is.\n\n611\n00:30:49.301 --> 00:30:52.710\nSo normally, right now, even though\nI'm actually really using IPv4,\n\n612\n00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:57.845\nwell Windows actually sends,\nI think XP has been able to support it.\n\n613\n00:30:57.845 --> 00:31:01.165\nNow XP wasn't turned on, but\nnow really beginning with Vista and\n\n614\n00:31:01.165 --> 00:31:05.245\neverything has been supporting it, and\nit's actually turned on in the background.\n\n615\n00:31:05.245 --> 00:31:08.685\nNow you can't remove it but you can\ndisable it if you're not using it, but\n\n616\n00:31:08.685 --> 00:31:11.315\na lot of times you just leave it as is.\n\n617\n00:31:11.315 --> 00:31:14.985\nWith Windows 10 computers and\nactually even Windows 8.1 computers, and\n\n618\n00:31:14.985 --> 00:31:17.365\nthey're on a network together\nyou just didn't notice but\n\n619\n00:31:17.365 --> 00:31:20.760\na lot of times in the background\nthat's what they were using as IPv6.\n\n620\n00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.090\nThey weren't really even using IPv4\nanymore cuz they've already move on but\n\n621\n00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:27.300\nthey still have it there\nbecause that's what we use.\n\n622\n00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.530\nSo you still see addresses like that.\n\n623\n00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:33.940\nAnd then what if you wanted to assign\nthose globally unique addresses?\n\n624\n00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:38.480\nWell this is where we get back to that\nstatus on that ethernet adapter, and\n\n625\n00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.630\nwe can click on properties.\n\n626\n00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:46.200\nAnd even though you actually see only\nTCP/IP version 4 If I scroll down here\n\n627\n00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.950\nI can select Internet protocol\nversion six in properties and\n\n628\n00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.180\nthen we can type those addresses.\n\n629\n00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.160\nI look at that box there, Mike.\n\n630\n00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.530\nIt let's me type it out, and\n\n631\n00:31:55.530 --> 00:32:00.770\nyou can if you want to, but\nthe neat thing about IPv6,\n\n632\n00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:05.140\na lot of it is dynamically generated if\nyou actually will allow it to happen.\n\n633\n00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:09.085\nSo you don't really actually need\nto set any of this stuff up.\n\n634\n00:32:09.085 --> 00:32:13.132\nIPv6 is actually designed to try and work\nalmost like the zero config type of stuff,\n\n635\n00:32:13.132 --> 00:32:17.122\nthat says, look, let's just set it on the\nrouter and let the router do it's work,\n\n636\n00:32:17.122 --> 00:32:20.428\nand do everything else that needs to But\nif you need to controller it,\n\n637\n00:32:20.428 --> 00:32:21.644\nyou can do it right here.\n\n638\n00:32:21.644 --> 00:32:25.061\n>> You can statically map them if\nyou wanna type out those 128 bits.\n\n639\n00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:26.432\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n640\n00:32:26.432 --> 00:32:27.335\n>> That's right, yeah, and\n\n641\n00:32:27.335 --> 00:32:29.618\nI don't know anybody that actually\nwants to do anything like that.\n\n642\n00:32:29.618 --> 00:32:32.995\nSo just kinda realize that there's\na lot that's actually available and\n\n643\n00:32:32.995 --> 00:32:34.440\nthere for you as well.\n\n644\n00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.953\n>> Now Ronnie, I know we're\ngetting a little bit low on time.\n\n645\n00:32:35.953 --> 00:32:39.427\nBut there's one more thing we've gotta\ntalk about before we get out of here,\n\n646\n00:32:39.427 --> 00:32:41.080\nwe'd be amiss if we didn't.\n\n647\n00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.010\nAnd that's talking about the firewall and\n\n648\n00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.550\nthe way that Windows deals\nwith the network profiles.\n\n649\n00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:48.715\n>> Right, so by default,\n\n650\n00:32:48.715 --> 00:32:52.375\nremember that what ends up happening here\nis that when you connect to a network,\n\n651\n00:32:52.375 --> 00:32:55.065\nthere's one of three different network\nprofiles that's gonna be assigned to you.\n\n652\n00:32:55.065 --> 00:32:58.145\nYou're either gonna see public,\nprivate, work or domain,\n\n653\n00:32:58.145 --> 00:33:01.005\ndepending on the context that\nyou're iniIs what you're gonna see.\n\n654\n00:33:01.005 --> 00:33:04.235\nAnd all that's really doing is\nmanipulating the firewall and saying hey,\n\n655\n00:33:04.235 --> 00:33:07.270\nif you're on a public network we're gonna\nmake the firewall super restrictive.\n\n656\n00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:09.730\nIf you're on a work network\nwe're gonna do less restrictive,\n\n657\n00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.580\nactually probably the least\nrestrictive of those three.\n\n658\n00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.380\nAnd then the one in the middle is home,\nthey're saying you're gonna provide\n\n659\n00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.460\nsecurity but I'm gonna be\na little more careful as well.\n\n660\n00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.760\nSo when you see those settings\nthis is actually pretty good for\n\n661\n00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.960\nus because they're on by default.\n\n662\n00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.120\n>> It's a really cool concept\nbecause back in the day,\n\n663\n00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.470\nbefore we had profiles like this, you had\na firewall and you had to configure what\n\n664\n00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:32.160\nports we know a firewall allows traffic\nto come through or blocks traffic.\n\n665\n00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.840\nAnd you had to configure what you wanted\nto allow and what you wanted to block.\n\n666\n00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.880\nAnd as you bounced between\ndifferent networks,\n\n667\n00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.290\nyou'd have to manually\nchange those settings.\n\n668\n00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:44.115\nI might want to allow Remote Desktop\nport 3389 while I'm here at work,\n\n669\n00:33:44.115 --> 00:33:47.370\nbecause that's what my help desk uses to\nfix my computer when there's a problem.\n\n670\n00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:51.240\nBut when I'm at Starbucks or the hotel,\nI don't want that port open.\n\n671\n00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.850\nSo I'd have to remember to close that port\nwhen I went to those types of networks.\n\n672\n00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:56.900\nWell now, with Windows and\n\n673\n00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:00.790\nthe profiles, I can create different\nsettings on those profiles.\n\n674\n00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:04.438\nI can say, at my work profile,\nallow port 3389,\n\n675\n00:34:04.438 --> 00:34:07.533\non my public profile, block port 3389.\n\n676\n00:34:07.533 --> 00:34:10.146\nAnd the first time you\nconnect to any network,\n\n677\n00:34:10.146 --> 00:34:13.240\nWindows is going to assign\none of those profiles to it.\n\n678\n00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:17.560\nIf it detects a domain controller on the\nnetwork, it'll apply the domain profile.\n\n679\n00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.230\nIf you connect at home or at Starbucks or\nat the hotel, it's gonna ask you,\n\n680\n00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:24.370\ndo you wanna call this a public network?\n\n681\n00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:27.390\nOr do you wanna call\nthis a private network?\n\n682\n00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:29.700\nAnd depending on what you pick,\nit'll remember that.\n\n683\n00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.310\nAnd now,\nevery time you go to that network,\n\n684\n00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:34.510\nit'll automatically apply,\nlet's say you chose public at Starbucks.\n\n685\n00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:37.884\nEvery time you go down there,\nit'll apply that public profile and\n\n686\n00:34:37.884 --> 00:34:39.100\nrestrict those ports.\n\n687\n00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.603\nBut when you get into work, it'll\nautomatically flop over the domain profile\n\n688\n00:34:42.603 --> 00:34:44.741\nand open up those ports\nI need when I'm at work.\n\n689\n00:34:44.741 --> 00:34:46.060\nIt's a fantastic idea.\n\n690\n00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.680\n>> It is an incredibly great idea,\n\n691\n00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.930\nuntil the point where you need to\nchange that profile sometimes.\n\n692\n00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:53.450\nAnd that's when it gets\na little bit more challenging.\n\n693\n00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:56.410\nBut, believe it or not, there's\nactually an easier way to do this, and\n\n694\n00:34:56.410 --> 00:34:59.060\nit's actually a recommended way,\neven from Microsoft.\n\n695\n00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.060\nAnd I was kind of surprised when I found\nthis out to be able to change it so-\n\n696\n00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.974\n>> And you're talking about here when\n\n697\n00:35:03.974 --> 00:35:08.590\nmaybe it doesn't detect that it's a domain\nprofile and miss-applies the profile.\n\n698\n00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:11.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or maybe you were at Starbucks and\n\n699\n00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.926\nyou picked private accidentally.\n\n700\n00:35:12.926 --> 00:35:16.260\nIt pops up and says, would you like to\nsee other computers on this network?\n\n701\n00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.850\nAnd you said yes.\n\n702\n00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:21.880\nAnd now it's gonna apply that private\nprofile which might be a little too\n\n703\n00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.860\nrelaxed, so you need to change it.\n\n704\n00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.530\n>> Right, so let's show you\nsomething else that we can do here.\n\n705\n00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:28.550\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna switch networks.\n\n706\n00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:31.447\nSo, just like I actually went\nfrom my work network to, well,\n\n707\n00:35:31.447 --> 00:35:32.797\nlet's say Starbucks here.\n\n708\n00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:36.644\nAnd what should end up happening is that\nin a moment here it's gonna identify, and\n\n709\n00:35:36.644 --> 00:35:38.862\nthere it is, there's the public network.\n\n710\n00:35:38.862 --> 00:35:40.910\nSo remember,\nit's the first time that you connect.\n\n711\n00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:44.680\nIf you go back, it's still gonna figure\nout what you actually want to connect to.\n\n712\n00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.500\nBut if this actually happened\nat your home, you got tired and\n\n713\n00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.830\ngo, just select it, remember that this is\nso restricted that you might not be able\n\n714\n00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:53.200\nto connect to other things that\nyou really wanna connect to.\n\n715\n00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.400\nAnd now, if you're like me, you're like,\nokay, so how do I change it?\n\n716\n00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:00.680\nWell, it's not easy to change this\nexcept by forgetting the network,\n\n717\n00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.230\nor changing it somehow where\nit's not gonna register.\n\n718\n00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:08.000\nBut one way that is recommended is that,\nif you go down to Home Group, right here.\n\n719\n00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:12.750\nAnd then, notice it says right here,\nTo create or join a home group,\n\n720\n00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.590\nyour computer's network location\nmust be set to Private.\n\n721\n00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:18.094\nSo if you're running on public, it says\nhey, I can change this to private for you.\n\n722\n00:36:18.094 --> 00:36:20.945\nI simply click on Change\nnetwork location and\n\n723\n00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:24.780\nthat will bring this little box up and\nwe'll click Yes.\n\n724\n00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.170\nNow it's actually looking for\nhome group, I don't have a home group.\n\n725\n00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:31.590\nBut the neat thing is, I don't have to,\nI can now just close that thing out.\n\n726\n00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:35.380\nAnd then if I go back\ninto my profile here,\n\n727\n00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.080\nlet me see if I can get access to it.\n\n728\n00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.340\nNetwork Connection, I'm gonna use the,\n\n729\n00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.440\nactually that doesn't get me\nwhere I need to, does it?\n\n730\n00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.630\nAw, man, see I went too fast that time.\n\n731\n00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:46.860\nAll right, so let me right-click and\ngo to Control Panel.\n\n732\n00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:51.070\nAnd then Network and\nInternet > Network and Sharing Center.\n\n733\n00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:54.470\nNow notice it changed it to private for\nus right away.\n\n734\n00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:55.830\nSo you can use that instead.\n\n735\n00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.220\nNow, there's other ways you can get to it.\n\n736\n00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:57.951\nYou can go in and\n\n737\n00:36:57.951 --> 00:37:01.840\nchange, inside of the Advanced Windows\nFirewall with Advanced Settings.\n\n738\n00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.450\nYou can go into your group policy and\nchange your network locations and\n\n739\n00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.930\nstuff, and give you that access to do it.\n\n740\n00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.430\nBut this is actually a trouble\nshooting recommended methodology\n\n741\n00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:12.430\nfrom Microsoft that allows you do this.\n\n742\n00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:16.186\n>> It's really just a quick and dirty\nway to get that side bar to slide out.\n\n743\n00:37:16.186 --> 00:37:16.869\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n744\n00:37:16.869 --> 00:37:20.540\ngive you a chance to pick the right one\nif you picked the wrong one last time.\n\n745\n00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.350\nEven if you're not looking\nto join a home group.\n\n746\n00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:24.285\nIt just happens to be where\nthey've hidden that link.\n\n747\n00:37:24.285 --> 00:37:25.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can get that thing to come out and\n\n748\n00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.740\nyou can say, okay, this time I'm gonna\npick Yes, and now you're good to go.\n\n749\n00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.570\nSo, pretty cool little trick, Ronnie.\n\n750\n00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:30.806\n>> It is a great little trick and\n\n751\n00:37:30.806 --> 00:37:33.847\nit's something that we definitely\nwanna make sure that we hang onto,\n\n752\n00:37:33.847 --> 00:37:36.780\nbecause you're gonna see that\nmore than once, I guarantee.\n\n753\n00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.648\nAs users bring their laptops back in like,\nyeah, I don't know why it's actually still\n\n754\n00:37:39.648 --> 00:37:41.525\nconnecting to public and\nI'm still here on the network.\n\n755\n00:37:41.525 --> 00:37:42.071\n>> Yep.\n\n756\n00:37:42.071 --> 00:37:44.596\n>> Yep, you might wanna make\nsure that you know that one.\n\n757\n00:37:44.596 --> 00:37:46.742\n>> All right, well Ronnie, I know we\nwent a little long-winded on that one.\n\n758\n00:37:46.742 --> 00:37:48.519\nBut that was a lot of great information,\nand\n\n759\n00:37:48.519 --> 00:37:51.315\ninformation you're gonna need to\nknow to be successful on the exam.\n\n760\n00:37:51.315 --> 00:37:54.762\nSo make sure you paid attention,\ngo back and watch it a couple of times.\n\n761\n00:37:54.762 --> 00:37:58.199\nBut for now we're out of time, so\nsigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n762\n00:37:58.199 --> 00:37:59.163\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n763\n00:37:59.163 --> 00:38:00.591\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n764\n00:38:00.591 -->

to\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.740\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nhere with me today is Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.830\nHow's it going today Mikey?\n\n6\n00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.330\n>> It's going great Daniel, I'm excited to\nbe here because today we're going to be\n\n7\n00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.810\ndiving into the world of Windows 10 and\nin particular, network security.\n\n8\n00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.270\nAlways a good time with network security,\nright?\n\n9\n00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.780\n>> Oh yeah, we love the network\nsecurity around here at ITProTV.\n\n10\n00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.820\nWe like to keep our viewers safe\nwhile they're out there in the wild.\n\n11\n00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.900\nToday specifically I think we're\ngoing to go over Windows firewall.\n\n12\n00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.690\nFirewalling is in.\n\n13\n00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.530\nWe're gonna introduce those topics and\nmake sure you understand them and\n\n14\n00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.910\nthen show how Windows\nhandles that situation.\n\n15\n00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.210\nWhat we can do to prevent network attacks,\nhow we can keep bad guys out of our\n\n16\n00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.045\nsystem, but still allow the actual\ntraffic that we want to allow\n\n17\n00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:59.165\nusing the firewall that's built into\nthe actual operating system itself.\n\n18\n00:00:59.165 --> 00:01:03.535\nNow Mike, I know that you are well\nadept at using the Windows firewall, so\n\n19\n00:01:03.535 --> 00:01:07.650\nI'm going to learn at the feet of\nthe master here and watch you work.\n\n20\n00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.540\nWhere should we begin?\n\n21\n00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.930\n>> I don't know about all that, but\nwe're going to talk about first,\n\n22\n00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.690\njust what a firewall is, because we need\nto make sure we've got that concept down.\n\n23\n00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.480\nAnd I'm sure most of you at this point\nin your career, if you're studying for\n\n24\n00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.080\nthis exam, you've already been through A+,\nand Net+, and possibly even Security+.\n\n25\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.620\nYou've got an idea of what a firewall is,\nbut\n\n26\n00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.860\nlet's make sure we're\nall on the same page.\n\n27\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.800\nA firewall is just a way that we can put\nup a barrier between a trusted network,\n\n28\n00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.310\nand in this case we're going to be\nlooking at the operating system level,\n\n29\n00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.110\nso a barrier between my PC and\nthe rest of the network.\n\n30\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.050\nAnd that firewall allows me to control\nwhat types of traffic are allowed to come\n\n31\n00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.440\ninto my PC as well as what types\nof traffic allowed to leave my PC.\n\n32\n00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.910\nBecause as you guys know,\nas we talk about a TCP/IP based network,\n\n33\n00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.380\nwhen we establish a socket basically,\n\n34\n00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.550\nor connection with another computer on\na TCP/IP network, we need three things.\n\n35\n00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.040\nWe need a protocol, we need an IP address,\nand we need a port number.\n\n36\n00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.130\nYou typically, TCP, for your protocol,\nyour IP address of course is the IP\n\n37\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.920\naddress of your machine or the destination\nthat you're trying to connect to and\n\n38\n00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.690\nthen that port number tells it what type\nof traffic this is, for the most part.\n\n39\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.350\nAnd so we can use those port numbers\nto control the types of traffic that\n\n40\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.250\nare allowed to come in or out.\n\n41\n00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.265\nSo for example,\nwhat if I'm running a web server,\n\n42\n00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:33.165\nthen I need to allow port 80\nbecause that's my HTTP port, right?\n\n43\n00:02:33.165 --> 00:02:35.165\nThat's what that protocol travels over.\n\n44\n00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:38.075\nI have to open up that\nhole in the firewall.\n\n45\n00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:40.780\nIf I don't,\nI can run my web server all day long,\n\n46\n00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.060\nbut nobody's gonna get to my webpage.\n\n47\n00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.180\n>> Yeah, it's gonna have a little hard\ntime cuz that's what the firewall does.\n\n48\n00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.590\nIt says, hey you know what,\nI'm just gonna block everything.\n\n49\n00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.110\nThis is a little something that\nwe like to call an implicit deny.\n\n50\n00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.890\nThat it just says, no matter what comes\nthrough here I'm just gonna deny it.\n\n51\n00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.620\nI'm just gonna drop that\ntraffic on the floor and\n\n52\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.080\nsay, it's not going through, it's my job\nI'm the superhero of the network here.\n\n53\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.450\nSo we have to say hey now, there\nare some exceptions we'd like to make.\n\n54\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.120\nAnd we do that using ACLs right?\n\n55\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.680\n>> Exactly.\n\n56\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.020\nAnd that's a really great system that\nthey've got set up there with that\n\n57\n00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.020\nimplicit deny that Daniel mentioned\nbecause know it doesn't start out wide\n\n58\n00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.140\nopen, and I have to really figure out\nwhat it is I need to block, instead,\n\n59\n00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.860\nwe're going to block everything and\njust allow what I want to allow.\n\n60\n00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.940\nWhen you're first setting up a machine\nsometimes that can be a troublesome,\n\n61\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.980\nbecause something won't work, and you\nrealize, oh I've got to open up a hole in\n\n62\n00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.060\nthe firewall, and\nthen something else doesn't work,\n\n63\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.220\nand oh I've got to open up\na hole in the firewall.\n\n64\n00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.200\nBut honestly a lot of applications\nwill actually help you through that,\n\n65\n00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.160\nthey'll say, hey do you want e to\nmake an exception for this, and\n\n66\n00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.420\nreally creating exceptions in\nthe firewall is not that difficult.\n\n67\n00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.750\nSo it's a lot easier, I think,\nto start out with everything closed and\n\n68\n00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.120\nonly allow what you want to allow.\n\n69\n00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.980\nSo that implicit deny that\nDan's referring to and\n\n70\n00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.210\nthat's the way these firewalls work.\n\n71\n00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.400\nNow firewalls are not new.\n\n72\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.761\nThey've been around all the way back\nto Windows X HP Service Pack 3.\n\n73\n00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:08.570\nThat's where we first got a firewall\nbuilt into the client operating system.\n\n74\n00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.070\nPrior to that,\nwe would have to download something.\n\n75\n00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.280\nI remember, Daniel,\nusing things like ZoneAlarm Pro and\n\n76\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.930\na couple of others and\nsome free software like that.\n\n77\n00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.015\n>> I used BlackIce.\n\n78\n00:04:18.015 --> 00:04:20.330\n>> BlackIce was a very popular one.\n\n79\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.680\nSo those were the kind of things we would\ndownload and we would put on our machine.\n\n80\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.680\nThen when Service Pack 3 came out, all of\na sudden you've got this Windows firewall.\n\n81\n00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.170\nFor a long time there,\npeople got really confused,\n\n82\n00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.570\nbecause then they'd be running two\nfirewalls and they wouldn't realize it.\n\n83\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.520\nThey had one that they had downloaded,\nmaybe paid for, and\n\n84\n00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.120\nXP had that one built into it.\n\n85\n00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.460\nYou can run two firewalls.\n\n86\n00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.750\nThere's nothing that says you cannot.\n\n87\n00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.990\nBut if you think about that you've got\ntwo walls that are blocking everything.\n\n88\n00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.840\nI can open up a hole in one, that doesn't\nopen up the hole in the other one, so\n\n89\n00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.460\nnow I've got to remember to open up\nthat hole and the second one as well.\n\n90\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.540\nIt's really overkill,\n\n91\n00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.930\nthere's no real reason to run\ntwo firewalls on the same PC.\n\n92\n00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.930\nNow in a corporate environment,\n\n93\n00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.130\nyou're gonna have firewalls that\nsit at the border of your network.\n\n94\n00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.720\nAnd those control the traffic that's\neven allowed to come into your network.\n\n95\n00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.150\nAnd then once that traffic gets o the\nnetwork the firewall at your host machine\n\n96\n00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.360\ngets a chance to filter it as well so\nyou kind of are running two there but, but\n\n97\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.140\nnot on the same machine.\n\n98\n00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.770\nSo a firewall and if we just look at my\nscreen here just a quick refresher again.\n\n99\n00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.190\nYou know a firewall is basically\nsit in between you and\n\n100\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.910\nan un-trusted portion of\nthe network typically.\n\n101\n00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.710\nA lot of times that's in\nthe case of that network firewall\n\n102\n00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.110\nthat's usually the internet.\n\n103\n00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.630\nIn a corporate environment though, this\nfirewall is running on my local machine.\n\n104\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.850\nAnd it's protecting me from traffic\non my corporate network, and\n\n105\n00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.820\nyou might think to yourself, well, why?\n\n106\n00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.030\nIt's your corporate network.\n\n107\n00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.580\nDon't you trust your corporate network?\n\n108\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.940\nTo a certain degree, I do, right?\n\n109\n00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.030\nBut what if one machine gets\ncompromised on my network?\n\n110\n00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.780\nBad guy somehow makes it through that\ncorporate firewall, my network firewall,\n\n111\n00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.510\nand compromises a machine on my network.\n\n112\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.330\nNow that bad guy's on the inside.\n\n113\n00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.580\nAnd if I don't have any firewalls\non the individual machines,\n\n114\n00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.550\nthat bad guy's got free\nreign on the network, right?\n\n115\n00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.330\nI lose that one layer of security, and\n\n116\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.540\nit's all about layers when\nit comes to security.\n\n117\n00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.950\nI want one layer after another,\n\n118\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.285\nafter another that they have to try\nto break through because the more\n\n119\n00:06:17.285 --> 00:06:22.015\nlayers they have to go through, the better\nchance I have of detecting that attack.\n\n120\n00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:25.925\nEither thwarting the attack altogether,\nbecause they're really good at one task,\n\n121\n00:06:25.925 --> 00:06:29.470\nbut they're not so good about getting\nthrough host based firewalls.\n\n122\n00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.580\nOr maybe they can get through that,\nbut it sets off an alarm.\n\n123\n00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.850\nI notice that something's\ngoing on with my firewall.\n\n124\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.240\nSo layer after layer.\n\n125\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.370\nThat's why just because you're running\na network based firewall to protect your\n\n126\n00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.170\ncorporate network, you still wanna\nrun firewalls on the individual host.\n\n127\n00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.250\nAnd you can see,\nas Daniel's drawn up here very nicely,\n\n128\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.560\nlike the green traffic is\nbeing allowed through.\n\n129\n00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.530\nSo my firewall has basically\nan access control list.\n\n130\n00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.460\nIt controls what type of traffic is\nallowed to come through and what cannot.\n\n131\n00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.451\nThe red traffic, I like your little\niris there, that's very nice.\n\n132\n00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:03.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is going to be blocked at the firewall.\n\n133\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.540\nSo we've chosen to block\nwhatever type of traffic that is.\n\n134\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.320\nNow it would be nice if we could make\na firewall rule that said, block viruses,\n\n135\n00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.050\nbut you can't do that.\n\n136\n00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.300\nFirewall rules are all\nbased on port numbers,\n\n137\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.270\nwhich is why we made you memorize all\nthose port numbers back in Network+.\n\n138\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.550\nBecause If you're going to\ncreate a firewall rule,\n\n139\n00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.170\nif your boss comes to you and says I need\nyou to set up a firewall rule that is\n\n140\n00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:31.890\ngoing to allow FTP traffic or\nis going to block ICMP, or what have you.\n\n141\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.880\nWhen you go to create that rule,\nyou need to know what port number that is.\n\n142\n00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.920\nOtherwise you're gonna have\na hard time creating that rule.\n\n143\n00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.400\nNow there are some wizards\nin there that can let you\n\n144\n00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.240\npick some protocols from a drop down,\nbut you still really should be familiar\n\n145\n00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.180\nwith those port numbers that are assigned\nto those different protocols.\n\n146\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.944\nAll right, so now that we've got a basic\nunderstanding of what a firewall is,\n\n147\n00:07:52.944 --> 00:07:56.634\nwhere it sits, again,\nit came out back in XP service back three.\n\n148\n00:07:56.634 --> 00:07:59.920\nDaniel, I tell you, I like the firewall\nthat's built into Windows.\n\n149\n00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.869\nIt does a good job.\n\n150\n00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:02.480\nIt's easy to configure.\n\n151\n00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.540\nI don't know, do you turn it off and\n\n152\n00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.350\nthen go back to a software,\nanother one that you've bought?\n\n153\n00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.550\nOr do you just use the one built in?\n\n154\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.540\n>> Yeah I tend to stick with\nthe one that's built in.\n\n155\n00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.360\nIt does a fine job of it.\n\n156\n00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.925\nEspecially when you get into the more\nadvanced areas of the Windows firewall,\n\n157\n00:08:14.925 --> 00:08:17.032\nit will do just everything\nyou need it to do, so\n\n158\n00:08:17.032 --> 00:08:20.830\nI haven't really needed to go to any kind\nof third party solution for firewalling.\n\n159\n00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.630\nBut I was in that corporate network again,\nyou're gonna have hardware firewalls, and\n\n160\n00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.720\nyou're gonna have software firewalls.\n\n161\n00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.910\nWhen you have a larger network,\n\n162\n00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.410\nyou probably are going to have those\nhardware firewalls that they're dedicated\n\n163\n00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.340\nto firewalling traffic that's going in and\nout of your network.\n\n164\n00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.380\nAnd that's so that your computers don't\nhave to handle that workload, let that\n\n165\n00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.330\npiece of hardware be dedicated to that\ntask, and then if it makes it past like\n\n166\n00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.680\nMike was saying, once we have that layered\nsecurity, those defenses are still up.\n\n167\n00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.938\nAnd we still have another defense, but\n\n168\n00:08:48.938 --> 00:08:51.180\nit's not doing a ton of\nthat in the backgrounds.\n\n169\n00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:56.190\nBut for just home uses and small home\noffice, those little firewalls built\n\n170\n00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.660\ninto the Windows Operating System,\nthey do a fine job.\n\n171\n00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.240\n>> All right, so what I'm gonna do,\nlet's take a look at some things we can\n\n172\n00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.960\ndo to look at our firewall settings,\nsee how we can go about configuring that.\n\n173\n00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.860\nFirst thing I wanna do is,\nlet's just look at it.\n\n174\n00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:16.154\nSo over here on my client, I'm going\nto do a quick search for firewall.\n\n175\n00:09:16.154 --> 00:09:19.181\nAnd I know there's 100 different\nways to get everywhere on Windows,\n\n176\n00:09:19.181 --> 00:09:21.076\nI find that search bar\njust to be the easiest.\n\n177\n00:09:21.076 --> 00:09:25.020\nYou should familiarize yourself with the\ncontrol panel, with the way you navigate\n\n178\n00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.131\naround in Windows 10, because on the exam,\nthey might have you going one way instead\n\n179\n00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:32.140\nof another, so make sure you\nfamiliarize yourself with that.\n\n180\n00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.595\nBut I'm just going to click\non Windows firewall, and\n\n181\n00:09:35.595 --> 00:09:37.885\nthat's gonna open up my basic firewall.\n\n182\n00:09:37.885 --> 00:09:40.835\nNow here's something that gets\na little bit confusing if\n\n183\n00:09:40.835 --> 00:09:43.295\nyou're first playing with\nthe firewall at Windows.\n\n184\n00:09:43.295 --> 00:09:45.555\nYou actually have two\ndifferent firewall consoles.\n\n185\n00:09:45.555 --> 00:09:48.367\nYou might have noticed when I searched for\nfirewall,\n\n186\n00:09:48.367 --> 00:09:51.930\nall right, I have a couple of options.\n\n187\n00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.799\nI've got the firewall up here and\nthen down below,\n\n188\n00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:57.810\nI've got Windows firewall\nwith advanced security.\n\n189\n00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.810\nKeep in mind, you only have one\nfirewall on your Windows machine,\n\n190\n00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.390\ntwo different consoles to interface or\n\n191\n00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:10.790\nto configure the firewall,\none a little more basic.\n\n192\n00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.000\nThis one here is the one we had,\nas I said,\n\n193\n00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.140\nall the way back to\nWindows XP Service Pack 3.\n\n194\n00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.455\nThe Windows firewall\nwith advanced security,\n\n195\n00:10:17.455 --> 00:10:21.670\nI wanna say it was Windows Vista,\nbut we don't really count Vista,\n\n196\n00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:26.330\nso we'll say Windows 7 circa\n2008 is when that came out.\n\n197\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.950\nBut remember, one firewall,\n\n198\n00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.640\njust two different consoles\nto manage the same firewall.\n\n199\n00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.220\nSo you don't have to do it in one,\ndo it in the other.\n\n200\n00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.630\nYou choose which console\nyou wanna open up.\n\n201\n00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.200\nIf you want the basic settings and\nthat's all you need, perfect.\n\n202\n00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.250\nThat's still there.\n\n203\n00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.190\nIf you want a little more control,\nI'm gonna show you in a little bit later\n\n204\n00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.340\nhow that Windows firewall with advanced\nsecurity can give us a little more\n\n205\n00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.910\ncontrol, granular control,\nover those firewall settings.\n\n206\n00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.020\nSo on my screen here, again, I've got my\nbasic Windows firewall up and running.\n\n207\n00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.320\nAnd if we look at,\nthe first thing we wanna notice is that\n\n208\n00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.015\nit's actually divided up into\nthree different profiles.\n\n209\n00:11:00.015 --> 00:11:04.961\nI've got my domain network, my private\nnetwork, and my guest, or public, network.\n\n210\n00:11:04.961 --> 00:11:09.787\nNow, when you first connect to a network,\nWindows has to make a decision on\n\n211\n00:11:09.787 --> 00:11:14.358\nwhat profile to apply to that\nparticular network connection.\n\n212\n00:11:14.358 --> 00:11:17.620\nIf you're at work, and it detects\nthat there is a domain controller\n\n213\n00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.940\non the network,\nit's automatically going to apply.\n\n214\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.470\nWell, supposed to.\n\n215\n00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:26.000\nAutomatically apply that domain profile\nbecause the domain profile assumes\n\n216\n00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.810\nthat you're on a pretty trusted\nnetwork at this point, and so,\n\n217\n00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:33.970\nit's a little more relaxed in our\nfirewall settings and things like that.\n\n218\n00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:38.670\nIf you're on a different network, if you\ngo to Starbucks or your friend's house or\n\n219\n00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.610\nthe hotel or the airport, the first time\nyou connect to that network, Windows is\n\n220\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:48.650\ngonna ask you, do you wanna classify this\nas a private network or a public network.\n\n221\n00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.950\nNow, Windows 10 phrases the question\na little bit differently at this point.\n\n222\n00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.900\nYou get a little sidebar that pops out,\nand it says, would you like to\n\n223\n00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.800\nenable sharing on this network and\nother computers to be able to find you?\n\n224\n00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.640\nSo, it doesn't specify private or public.\n\n225\n00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.950\nBut what you're choosing is private or\npublic.\n\n226\n00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:11.110\nIf you say yes, I do wanna find other\ncomputers and share things on this\n\n227\n00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.330\nnetwork, it's gonna classify that\nnetwork as a private network.\n\n228\n00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.595\nAnd it will remember that.\n\n229\n00:12:15.595 --> 00:12:18.550\nIf you connect back to that network\nin the future, it will say, oh,\n\n230\n00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.490\nthis was a private network, and\nit will apply that profile.\n\n231\n00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:26.670\nNow the private profile starts out\nvery similar to the domain profile.\n\n232\n00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:31.202\nIt's relatively relaxed because you're\nsaying, hey, I trust this network.\n\n233\n00:12:31.202 --> 00:12:34.040\nI wanna see other computers,\nI want them to see me.\n\n234\n00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.654\nThis is what you would set for your\nhome network, for your friend's network,\n\n235\n00:12:37.654 --> 00:12:39.366\nunless you're at Daniel's house.\n\n236\n00:12:39.366 --> 00:12:42.525\nAnd then you probably wanna go public cuz\nyou know what he's got running over there.\n\n237\n00:12:42.525 --> 00:12:45.643\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so this is, again,\n\n238\n00:12:45.643 --> 00:12:49.640\na more relaxed setting, not what I\nwould do at Starbucks, or the hotel, or\n\n239\n00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.030\nat the airport.\n\n240\n00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.220\nAt the hotel or airport,\nI'm gonna choose public network.\n\n241\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.930\nOr in other words, I choose no when\nthat sidebar slid out and said,\n\n242\n00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.650\ndo you wanna see other computers and\nshare things on this network?\n\n243\n00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:02.520\nI choose no, and\n\n244\n00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.630\nit's gonna say, all right, we're gonna\ncall this one a public network, and it's\n\n245\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:11.260\nvery restrictive because I don't trust the\nother machines that could be connecting.\n\n246\n00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.880\nIf I'm at Starbucks,\n\n247\n00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.000\nI don't know these other people\nthat are sitting at Starbucks.\n\n248\n00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.660\nI don't know what they're\ndoing on their computer.\n\n249\n00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.040\nWho knows, and\nI probably don't wanna know.\n\n250\n00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.600\nI definitely don't want them\nto be able to reach out and\n\n251\n00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.580\nsee things that I've shared,\nmy pictures and things like that,\n\n252\n00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.880\nthat when I'm at home, sure,\nI wanna share stuff between my devices,\n\n253\n00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.480\nso I can move files back and forth and\nmove pictures back and forth.\n\n254\n00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.930\nNot when I'm at the hotel,\nnot when I'm at the airport, right?\n\n255\n00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.250\nI don't know those people.\n\n256\n00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.680\nSo we choose that public network profile.\n\n257\n00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.540\nAnd this is pretty cool that\nWindows allows us to do this,\n\n258\n00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.220\nbecause in the past,\nI would've had to have changed my settings\n\n259\n00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.720\nevery time I moved from\none network to another.\n\n260\n00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.309\nAnd we know that's not gonna happen,\nright?\n\n261\n00:13:50.309 --> 00:13:50.859\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n262\n00:13:50.859 --> 00:13:54.026\nthat's highly unlikely that anybody's\ngonna go, oh, that's right,\n\n263\n00:13:54.026 --> 00:13:55.576\nI've moved to a separate network.\n\n264\n00:13:55.576 --> 00:13:58.720\nAnd this is in a more public network,\nso I need to lock those settings down,\n\n265\n00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.680\nI'm gonna go through there.\n\n266\n00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.213\nYou're not gonna do that.\n\n267\n00:14:00.213 --> 00:14:02.881\nYou're gonna just bounce in and\nout of networks and\n\n268\n00:14:02.881 --> 00:14:05.870\nlet the chips fall where they may,\nmost likely, right?\n\n269\n00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.560\n>> Exactly.\n\n270\n00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.540\nAnd there could be dozens or many,\nmany settings that you configure.\n\n271\n00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.840\nLike when I'm at work, I wanna allow\nPort 3389 because that's remote desktop,\n\n272\n00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.760\nand that's what my help desk\nuses to fix my computer.\n\n273\n00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.170\nWhen I'm at home, I wanna use that to\nconnect to my media player or something.\n\n274\n00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:25.290\nSo I've got all these ports open, on\npublic networks I've got them all closed.\n\n275\n00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:29.880\nAnd if I have to manually open and close\nthose ports every time I switch networks,\n\n276\n00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.160\nmost likely, they're all gonna end up\nopen, and I'm not gonna be closing them\n\n277\n00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.050\njust when I go to a different network,\nand so I'm gonna be much less secure.\n\n278\n00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.190\nSo we can create exceptions,\n\n279\n00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:44.190\nwhich means we can open up holes in\nthe firewall on a per profile basis.\n\n280\n00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.450\nThat way, it automatically does it for me.\n\n281\n00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.350\nWhen I get to work,\nhey, 3389 is opened up.\n\n282\n00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.460\nI don't have to do anything.\n\n283\n00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.690\nWhen I go to Starbucks, 3389 is closed.\n\n284\n00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.560\nI don't have to do anything extra.\n\n285\n00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.920\nSo that's the way these\nprofile systems work.\n\n286\n00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.910\nAnd when you make changes,\nthat's called the scope of the rule.\n\n287\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.070\nWe decide where we wanna\napply this exception or\n\n288\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.388\nthis rule that we're creating.\n\n289\n00:15:06.388 --> 00:15:08.530\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n290\n00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.220\nSo let's take a look at what we\ncan do through this basic console.\n\n291\n00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:17.230\nOver here on the left hand side, I've\ngot my turn Windows firewall on or off.\n\n292\n00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:21.230\nYou actually have a few, allow an app or\nfeature through Windows firewall,\n\n293\n00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:26.720\nchange notification settings, turn Windows\nfirewall on or off, restore defaults.\n\n294\n00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.260\nOf course the restore defaults\nis if you hose it up too bad or\n\n295\n00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.480\nyou're not sure what you did, you were\njust testing, configuring things, and\n\n296\n00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.530\nyou wanna go back to the original\nsettings, you can do that very easily.\n\n297\n00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:41.969\nThese three all basically open up\nthe same Customize Settings windows.\n\n298\n00:15:41.969 --> 00:15:46.566\nSo it really doesn't matter which one you\nchoose, that's just Microsoft saying, hey,\n\n299\n00:15:46.566 --> 00:15:49.347\nlet's put three links over there,\nmake it look busy,\n\n300\n00:15:49.347 --> 00:15:51.723\nmake it look like you've\ngot a lot of choices.\n\n301\n00:15:51.723 --> 00:15:55.518\nAll brings you to the same screen, because\nyou can do all that stuff From this\n\n302\n00:15:55.518 --> 00:16:00.103\none screen, you can see that it's divided\nup into profiles, domain, private, public.\n\n303\n00:16:00.103 --> 00:16:02.111\nAnd here's where I can turn them on or\noff.\n\n304\n00:16:02.111 --> 00:16:06.655\nSo if I want to turn the firewall off\nanytime I connect to a private network,\n\n305\n00:16:06.655 --> 00:16:07.532\nI can do that.\n\n306\n00:16:07.532 --> 00:16:11.283\nIt'll still be on when I connect to\na domain network or a public network.\n\n307\n00:16:11.283 --> 00:16:13.825\nSo, I can turn it on and\noff on a per-profile basis.\n\n308\n00:16:13.825 --> 00:16:16.692\nI also have the option to\nchange the notifications.\n\n309\n00:16:16.692 --> 00:16:20.218\nYou might wanna get that little pop-up\nbubble out of my system tray when\n\n310\n00:16:20.218 --> 00:16:24.096\nthe firewall blocks something, and\nyou can see by default, it's turned on,\n\n311\n00:16:24.096 --> 00:16:25.310\non all three.\n\n312\n00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.370\nI can also choose Block\nall incoming connections,\n\n313\n00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.082\nincluding those listed\nin the Allowed apps.\n\n314\n00:16:31.082 --> 00:16:34.100\nThis is useful sometimes for\ntesting things.\n\n315\n00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.702\nOr if something's going on in the network\nand you need to kinda isolate yourself,\n\n316\n00:16:38.702 --> 00:16:39.913\nyou can come in here.\n\n317\n00:16:39.913 --> 00:16:42.565\nI could have a whole bunch of\nexceptions for different programs.\n\n318\n00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:46.563\nLike on my private network,\nI've got my 3389.\n\n319\n00:16:46.563 --> 00:16:48.776\nI've got my media server port opened up.\n\n320\n00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:51.220\nI've got my World Warcraft\nupdate ports opened up.\n\n321\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.111\nIf I wanna temporarily\nturn all those off but\n\n322\n00:16:55.111 --> 00:17:00.486\nnot have to reconfigure everything,\nI can just check this.\n\n323\n00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:02.146\nThat'll block everything.\n\n324\n00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:03.807\nBut it won't undo all my settings, right?\n\n325\n00:17:03.807 --> 00:17:08.020\nI've still got those exceptions, it's just\nignoring the exceptions for right now.\n\n326\n00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.318\nSo I finish doing whatever test it is or\nwhatever crisis.\n\n327\n00:17:10.318 --> 00:17:15.110\nI come back in here, and I uncheck that,\nand all my rules are still in place.\n\n328\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:19.020\nThat's a lot better than having to go and\nmanually block everything again.\n\n329\n00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.744\nGet rid of all your exceptions, and\n\n330\n00:17:20.744 --> 00:17:23.940\nthen have to recreate them\nwhen the problems over, right?\n\n331\n00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.008\nSo this way,\nI can temporarily block everything and\n\n332\n00:17:27.008 --> 00:17:29.250\nnot have to redo all my rules, right?\n\n333\n00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:35.050\nSo in there, I can, again, turn my Windows\nFirewall on or off on a per profile basis.\n\n334\n00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.796\nI can block all connections\non a per profile basis, and\n\n335\n00:17:38.796 --> 00:17:43.208\nI can control the notification\nsettings on a per profile basis.\n\n336\n00:17:43.208 --> 00:17:48.971\n>> Yeah, Mikey, I've definitely used this\nquite often even just to turn it off or\n\n337\n00:17:48.971 --> 00:17:49.892\non\n>> You think, well,\n\n338\n00:17:49.892 --> 00:17:51.840\nhow can we test just by\nturning the thing off or on?\n\n339\n00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.780\nA lot of times,\nyou're having trouble with a program.\n\n340\n00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.309\nIt's not working correctly.\n\n341\n00:17:56.309 --> 00:17:58.814\nAnd if it has any kind of\nnetwork connectivity, well,\n\n342\n00:17:58.814 --> 00:18:02.626\nit might be the firewall that's blocking\nit from getting out to wherever it is it's\n\n343\n00:18:02.626 --> 00:18:03.290\ntrying to go.\n\n344\n00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.390\nI've dealt with this a lot\nin corporate environments.\n\n345\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:09.504\nWe download third party software,\ncorporate type software, and\n\n346\n00:18:09.504 --> 00:18:14.131\nit reaches out to the actual company\nthat makes it for things like updates or\n\n347\n00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:19.212\nmaybe just information specific to itself\n,and it's on a strange port, right?\n\n348\n00:18:19.212 --> 00:18:20.569\nA port we weren't aware of.\n\n349\n00:18:20.569 --> 00:18:23.781\nWell, if we don't know that's happening,\nif someone calls and says,\n\n350\n00:18:23.781 --> 00:18:27.466\nthis thing is complaining about not being\nable to update, first thing you do is just\n\n351\n00:18:27.466 --> 00:18:30.328\nturn the firewall off real quick and\nsee if it's able to update.\n\n352\n00:18:30.328 --> 00:18:32.580\nIf it is,\nyou know the firewall's blocking it.\n\n353\n00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.857\nIf it's not,\nyou know there's a different problem, and\n\n354\n00:18:34.857 --> 00:18:36.494\nyou can start working it from that angle.\n\n355\n00:18:36.494 --> 00:18:39.389\nA lot of times, it just comes down\nto the firewall's blocking it.\n\n356\n00:18:39.389 --> 00:18:43.047\nOnce you realize that's what's happening,\nthen you can make the exception for\n\n357\n00:18:43.047 --> 00:18:44.407\nthat program specifically.\n\n358\n00:18:44.407 --> 00:18:45.472\nAnd you're on your merry way.\n\n359\n00:18:45.472 --> 00:18:46.470\n>> Exactly.\n\n360\n00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:47.990\nVery easy to work with.\n\n361\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.492\nI like it.\n\n362\n00:18:49.492 --> 00:18:52.348\nAll right, so we'll go back out\nhere to the main screen, and\n\n363\n00:18:52.348 --> 00:18:55.820\nwhat I wanna do is show you guys how to\nmake some exceptions here as well as in\n\n364\n00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.456\nthat advanced firewall setting.\n\n365\n00:18:57.456 --> 00:19:03.104\nSo, in here, you can choose Allow an app\nor feature through Windows firewall,\n\n366\n00:19:03.104 --> 00:19:06.890\nand I get a list of all\nthe apps that are installed.\n\n367\n00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:07.684\nThey usually show up.\n\n368\n00:19:07.684 --> 00:19:09.370\nThere are some times, though,\n\n369\n00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:13.504\nthat an application doesn't show up in\nhere, and we can still work with that.\n\n370\n00:19:13.504 --> 00:19:17.550\nAnd you can see, it's a list of all these\ndifferent things like mail and calendar.\n\n371\n00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.117\nDo I want to allow that?\n\n372\n00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:24.159\nAlso notice the little check marks, three\ncolumns, domain, private, and public.\n\n373\n00:19:24.159 --> 00:19:27.036\nSo, if I want to allow file and\nprinter sharing but\n\n374\n00:19:27.036 --> 00:19:31.570\nonly when I'm on the domain on a private\nnetwork and not public, I can do that.\n\n375\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:36.059\nOr, if I want to only allow remote\nassistance, as you can see,\n\n376\n00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:39.048\nit's not enabled public, for example.\n\n377\n00:19:39.048 --> 00:19:41.748\nLet's say I don't want\nproximity sharing on public.\n\n378\n00:19:41.748 --> 00:19:43.166\nI can un-check that.\n\n379\n00:19:43.166 --> 00:19:45.889\nSo I'm changing the scope\nof that firewall rule.\n\n380\n00:19:45.889 --> 00:19:50.002\nI'm deciding, is this firewall rule\nturned on when I'm on the domain profile,\n\n381\n00:19:50.002 --> 00:19:54.210\nwhen I'm on that private profile,\nor when I'm on that public profile?\n\n382\n00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:58.967\nIf the application that you don't want,\nor you're trying to allow doesn't\n\n383\n00:19:58.967 --> 00:20:03.574\nshow up in this list, I can always go\nAllow Another App, and I can browse and\n\n384\n00:20:03.574 --> 00:20:06.823\nlook for that executable,\nand I can add it that way.\n\n385\n00:20:06.823 --> 00:20:11.790\nAnd I'll get another rule in here and\nI'll get the little check marks for it.\n\n386\n00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.748\nSo that's my basic firewall\nsettings that I can do in here,\n\n387\n00:20:14.748 --> 00:20:17.125\nand that might be all you ever need,\nall right.\n\n388\n00:20:17.125 --> 00:20:20.009\nBecause a lot of this stuff can be\ncontrolled through group policy.\n\n389\n00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:23.535\nThey might be pushing out firewall\nsettings on your domain, so you just\n\n390\n00:20:23.535 --> 00:20:27.260\nneed to deal with it when you take that\nlaptop home or you go out travelling.\n\n391\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.209\nAnd that might be all you need to do.\n\n392\n00:20:29.209 --> 00:20:32.108\nBut we also have the Windows\nfirewall with advanced security.\n\n393\n00:20:32.108 --> 00:20:33.990\nAnd let's take a peek at that one.\n\n394\n00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.890\nYou saw when I did my search\nthat I could have chosen that,\n\n395\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.240\nI can also launch it from right here,\nAdvanced Security Settings.\n\n396\n00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.200\nAnd this is my Windows firewall\nwith advanced security.\n\n397\n00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.436\nAgain, same firewall,,\njust more granular control.\n\n398\n00:20:48.436 --> 00:20:53.159\nNow, I have inbound rules versus\noutbound rules, all right.\n\n399\n00:20:53.159 --> 00:20:57.416\nAs I can actually allow traffic, maybe I\nwant to allow certain port if it's coming\n\n400\n00:20:57.416 --> 00:20:59.712\nin, but not if it's going out, all right.\n\n401\n00:20:59.712 --> 00:21:03.266\nInbound rules control traffic,\nthat's destined for your machine.\n\n402\n00:21:03.266 --> 00:21:07.240\nSo your IP address is\nthe destination on that traffic.\n\n403\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.919\nOutbound rules are controlling\ntraffic that's leaving your machine.\n\n404\n00:21:10.919 --> 00:21:15.758\nSo when your computer's IP is the source\nfor that traffic, and if you want to make\n\n405\n00:21:15.758 --> 00:21:19.760\na new rule in here, you've got\na whole bunch of pre-built rules.\n\n406\n00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.890\nYou can see a lot of them, the green\ncheck marks, are ones that are enabled.\n\n407\n00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.287\nAnd if I follow one across the way here,\nyou see profile all, right?\n\n408\n00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:31.573\nThat means that's public,\nprivate, and domain.\n\n409\n00:21:31.573 --> 00:21:34.364\nIt is enabled and the action is to allow.\n\n410\n00:21:34.364 --> 00:21:37.262\nNow let's take a peek,\nand what I'm gonna do,\n\n411\n00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:41.841\nI'm gonna flip over to this server and\nI'm gonna open up a command prompt.\n\n412\n00:21:44.441 --> 00:21:51.358\nAnd I'm gonna try to ping that client\nmachine, if I can remember its name.\n\n413\n00:21:51.358 --> 00:21:53.818\nAnd, it's going to reply just fine.\n\n414\n00:21:53.818 --> 00:21:56.036\nSo, I'm going to flip back over here and\ntake a look.\n\n415\n00:21:56.036 --> 00:22:02.255\nAnd, if we look at my firewall rules,\nright here, I can see a couple of rules.\n\n416\n00:22:02.255 --> 00:22:04.376\nLet me make that just a hair wider.\n\n417\n00:22:04.376 --> 00:22:10.317\nSo, I've got File and\nPrinter Sharing Echo Request ICMPv4-In.\n\n418\n00:22:10.317 --> 00:22:12.157\nNotice this one says, Private.\n\n419\n00:22:12.157 --> 00:22:16.382\nThere's also one for domain, and\nit's set to Yes, and the one for\n\n420\n00:22:16.382 --> 00:22:18.410\npublic is set to No.\n\n421\n00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.738\nWhat if I come over here and\nturn this guy off?\n\n422\n00:22:20.738 --> 00:22:23.760\nI'm just gonna right-click on it and\nchoose Disable Rule.\n\n423\n00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:32.196\nAnd now, if I go back over to that server\nand try to ping again, notice it failed.\n\n424\n00:22:32.196 --> 00:22:36.990\nIt's able to resolve the name into an IP\naddress, but the request times out.\n\n425\n00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.296\nSee if we can quit that here.\n\n426\n00:22:40.296 --> 00:22:41.491\nI could do that same thing.\n\n427\n00:22:45.369 --> 00:22:47.480\nJust let that thing run for a little bit.\n\n428\n00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.734\nSo you see, we're getting, request timed\nout, request timed out, request timed out.\n\n429\n00:22:51.734 --> 00:22:55.817\nIf I flip back over here and\nturn that back on for\n\n430\n00:22:55.817 --> 00:22:59.700\nthe domain profile, see how long it takes.\n\n431\n00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.756\nAnd there it goes, all of the sudden,\nI'm getting replies.\n\n432\n00:23:02.756 --> 00:23:06.085\nSo, as soon as I open that hole\nup in the firewall, it says, oh,\n\n433\n00:23:06.085 --> 00:23:09.322\nI can now allow ICMP traffic\nbecause I'm on a domain network.\n\n434\n00:23:09.322 --> 00:23:14.152\nSo the domain profile's being applied, and\nnow, there's an exception to allow that.\n\n435\n00:23:14.152 --> 00:23:16.387\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nallow that to come through.\n\n436\n00:23:16.387 --> 00:23:18.186\nSo, that's how that firewall works.\n\n437\n00:23:18.186 --> 00:23:21.527\nWe just go in there, and we make\nthe appropriate exceptions in here.\n\n438\n00:23:21.527 --> 00:23:25.289\nNow, the last thing I wanna show you\nabout with this Windows firewall advanced\n\n439\n00:23:25.289 --> 00:23:27.294\nsecurity is how you create a custom rule.\n\n440\n00:23:27.294 --> 00:23:31.004\nWe've got all these pre-built rules\nthat are pretty easy to work with.\n\n441\n00:23:31.004 --> 00:23:33.874\nIf I double-click on one\nof these pre-built rules,\n\n442\n00:23:33.874 --> 00:23:35.994\nyou can see you can always modify them.\n\n443\n00:23:35.994 --> 00:23:37.236\nYou're not stuck with them.\n\n444\n00:23:37.236 --> 00:23:39.242\nIf I want to allow it,\nallow it if it's secure.\n\n445\n00:23:39.242 --> 00:23:41.232\nWe're gonna talk about that later.\n\n446\n00:23:41.232 --> 00:23:46.413\nMeanwhile, I wanna show you\nhere is the Advance tab,\n\n447\n00:23:46.413 --> 00:23:50.684\nspecify profiles where this rule applies.\n\n448\n00:23:50.684 --> 00:23:52.471\nNotice Domain is selected, so\n\n449\n00:23:52.471 --> 00:23:56.870\nthat is how I can change that on\none of those pre-existing rules.\n\n450\n00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.640\nI wanna make a new rule.\n\n451\n00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.634\nSimply gonna right-click over here and\nchoose New Rule.\n\n452\n00:24:04.096 --> 00:24:06.850\nAnd then I'd get my handy dandy wizard.\n\n453\n00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:07.536\nNow I've got a few options.\n\n454\n00:24:07.536 --> 00:24:12.400\nI've got Program, which is gonna allow\nme to browse and find an executable.\n\n455\n00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.608\nI've downloaded something,\nI wanted to, it needs Internet access,\n\n456\n00:24:15.608 --> 00:24:18.343\nit's got return traffic,\nmaybe for updates or something.\n\n457\n00:24:18.343 --> 00:24:21.100\nI can allow that program through.\n\n458\n00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.890\nI can also do a port number rule,\n\n459\n00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.300\nwhich would be based on\nthe port number of the traffic.\n\n460\n00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.810\nI can do Predefined, and you can see\na whole bunch are prebuilt in here.\n\n461\n00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.710\nThese are very handy when you're\nsetting up things like branch cash.\n\n462\n00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.530\nCuz there's a lot of different\nports you need to open up.\n\n463\n00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.692\nSo they've got some nice pre-built rules.\n\n464\n00:24:37.692 --> 00:24:40.443\nA lot of this, though,\nmight be handled through group policy, so\n\n465\n00:24:40.443 --> 00:24:42.472\nwe might not be doing it\non the client end itself.\n\n466\n00:24:42.472 --> 00:24:45.630\nNow I do wanna talk about the difference\nbetween program and port.\n\n467\n00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.959\nCuz let's say you download a program, and\nit tells you in the instructions that\n\n468\n00:24:49.959 --> 00:24:54.105\nyou're gonna have to open up port 4000,\nwe will just make one up right.\n\n469\n00:24:54.105 --> 00:24:56.490\nWell, what do I choose?\n\n470\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.360\nDo I go to do program and say, alright,\n\n471\n00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.410\nthis program is allowed\nto go to the firewall?\n\n472\n00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.280\nOr do I go to Port and open up port 4000?\n\n473\n00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.056\nWhat's the difference, right?\n\n474\n00:25:04.056 --> 00:25:05.751\nCuz you think well it might be the same.\n\n475\n00:25:05.751 --> 00:25:08.395\nThere's actually a pretty\nbig difference there.\n\n476\n00:25:08.395 --> 00:25:12.335\nIf you do a program,\nif it changes port numbers,\n\n477\n00:25:12.335 --> 00:25:13.435\nthat program would still be allowed.\n\n478\n00:25:13.435 --> 00:25:14.334\nIt is looking at the executables.\n\n479\n00:25:14.334 --> 00:25:17.724\nIt says, all right, any time this runs,\nI am gonna allow that traffic.\n\n480\n00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:20.025\nIf it has returned traffic,\nI am gonna allow it.\n\n481\n00:25:20.025 --> 00:25:22.985\nSo if that program changes port numbers.\n\n482\n00:25:22.985 --> 00:25:25.929\nOr some programs might have\na main port number, but\n\n483\n00:25:25.929 --> 00:25:30.585\nthen to double up on their bandwidth or to\nspeed things up, they might open up some\n\n484\n00:25:30.585 --> 00:25:35.540\nof those high range dynamic ports to get\nthat traffic to come in faster, right?\n\n485\n00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.140\nWell if I do it by a program,\nthat's not gonna be a problem\n\n486\n00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.890\nbecause it says all right anything this\nprogram opens up I'm gonna allow through.\n\n487\n00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:46.610\nSo you better trust that application\nif you're gonna do it that way.\n\n488\n00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.000\nIf you do it by port number,\nit's that specific port.\n\n489\n00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.399\nSo if that program needs other ports,\nit won't be able to open them up.\n\n490\n00:25:53.399 --> 00:25:55.930\nYou're gonna have to open\nthose ports up yourself.\n\n491\n00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:00.131\nAlso if some other program uses\nthat same port, it'll be allowed,\n\n492\n00:26:00.131 --> 00:26:03.120\neven though you might\nnot have wanted it to.\n\n493\n00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.210\nSo when you do a port number,\nyou are saying, hey, port 4000 is open,\n\n494\n00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:07.841\nI don't care who's going through it.\n\n495\n00:26:07.841 --> 00:26:10.830\nThat could be a considered\na security risk.\n\n496\n00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.620\nSomething else could take advantage\nof the fact that that port's open.\n\n497\n00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.300\nIf you do it by program, the port's\nopen when that program needs it.\n\n498\n00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.517\nAnd when that program doesn't need\nit anymore, that port's closed.\n\n499\n00:26:19.517 --> 00:26:20.537\nNothing else is gonna be able to use it.\n\n500\n00:26:20.537 --> 00:26:24.840\nSo you actually get a little more security\nout of doing the program way, as well as\n\n501\n00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:29.640\nthe ability to handle those dynamic port\ngenerations that the program might need.\n\n502\n00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.685\n>> I guess that begs the question,\nMike, why would we ever use ports?\n\n503\n00:26:32.685 --> 00:26:35.680\n[LAUGH]\n>> Only if it's something\n\n504\n00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.180\nthat needs to be open for\ndifferent programs and\n\n505\n00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.890\nyou don't want to list them all out\nthere do you do the port number.\n\n506\n00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.367\nLike port 80, for web traffic.\n\n507\n00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:45.260\nOr 3389 remote desktop.\n\n508\n00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.802\nCuz that's remote desktop,\nremote assistance, and things like that.\n\n509\n00:26:47.802 --> 00:26:50.692\nSo it might be easier sometimes\nto do that port another way.\n\n510\n00:26:50.692 --> 00:26:52.230\n>> Gotcha, so kind of the reverse.\n\n511\n00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.770\nIf you have one port that a bunch of\nprograms are using, you open the port.\n\n512\n00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.529\nIf you have a bunch of programs,\nyeah, you get what I'm saying.\n\n513\n00:26:59.529 --> 00:27:00.183\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n514\n00:27:00.183 --> 00:27:01.564\nExactly.\n>> You get where I'm going with this.\n\n515\n00:27:01.564 --> 00:27:03.894\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, and\n\n516\n00:27:03.894 --> 00:27:05.990\nthen the last one is just Custom.\n\n517\n00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:09.860\nThis one will let you walk through\nall of the different options.\n\n518\n00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.493\nSo if I go, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick next here,\n\n519\n00:27:12.493 --> 00:27:16.710\ncuz I get to see all the options not\nprogram specific, not port specific.\n\n520\n00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.366\nAnd you can see all programs or\na specific program.\n\n521\n00:27:19.366 --> 00:27:21.290\nI'll leave it on all programs.\n\n522\n00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.784\nAnd then for my protocol,\nI get my drop-down list.\n\n523\n00:27:24.784 --> 00:27:29.367\nAnd I'm just going to repeat that ping\nfirewall rule just to make something here.\n\n524\n00:27:29.367 --> 00:27:33.629\nSo, I go to ICMPv4, and\nyou can customize this.\n\n525\n00:27:33.629 --> 00:27:38.093\nLike, if you want to do all ICMP types,\nor just echo requests,\n\n526\n00:27:38.093 --> 00:27:42.244\nnot like time sync or\nthings like that, we can click okay.\n\n527\n00:27:42.244 --> 00:27:43.869\nI'll click Next.\n\n528\n00:27:43.869 --> 00:27:47.851\nAnd then I can specify to or\nfrom IP addresses.\n\n529\n00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:49.330\nSo I could limit this.\n\n530\n00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:53.009\nI could say I wanna allow ping, but\nonly if it's coming from my subnet.\n\n531\n00:27:53.009 --> 00:27:55.280\nOr from a particular machine.\n\n532\n00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:55.924\nI'm gonna leave it wide open.\n\n533\n00:27:55.924 --> 00:27:58.090\nI'll click Next.\n\n534\n00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:00.391\nAnd then Allow, or Block,\nor Allow if secure.\n\n535\n00:28:00.391 --> 00:28:03.201\nWe're gonna talk about\nthe Allow if secure later on.\n\n536\n00:28:03.201 --> 00:28:04.767\nI'll click Next.\n\n537\n00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:07.785\nAnd then what profile do\nI wanna apply this to?\n\n538\n00:28:07.785 --> 00:28:10.898\nI don't want Public, but\nI do want Domain or Private.\n\n539\n00:28:10.898 --> 00:28:12.313\nI'll click Next.\n\n540\n00:28:12.313 --> 00:28:17.061\nI'll give it a name, ICMPv4 In.\n\n541\n00:28:17.061 --> 00:28:21.210\nThen I'll click Finish.\n\n542\n00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:25.880\nAnd now if I go back now,\nweird little glitch, does this every time.\n\n543\n00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.356\nWhen you create your rule, the firewall\nconsole, the advanced firewall,\n\n544\n00:28:29.356 --> 00:28:31.927\ndidn't close,\nit just hides behind everything else.\n\n545\n00:28:31.927 --> 00:28:33.205\nI'm just gonna bring it back to the front.\n\n546\n00:28:33.205 --> 00:28:36.605\nAnd if we scroll up to the top,\nthere's my new rule I created.\n\n547\n00:28:36.605 --> 00:28:38.172\nI can see it's turned on.\n\n548\n00:28:38.172 --> 00:28:44.775\nIf I go back down here and\nturn this one off, And this one off.\n\n549\n00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.574\nBut I've got this rule that's allowing it.\n\n550\n00:28:48.574 --> 00:28:50.176\nLet's prove that my rule is working.\n\n551\n00:28:50.176 --> 00:28:51.534\nI come back over here.\n\n552\n00:28:51.534 --> 00:28:52.684\nI do that ping again.\n\n553\n00:28:52.684 --> 00:28:57.094\nAnd everything's working just fine,\nbecause of the rule I created it says\n\n554\n00:28:57.094 --> 00:28:59.688\nallow this type of\ntraffic to come through.\n\n555\n00:28:59.688 --> 00:29:04.009\nAnd that is really working with\nthe basic firewall settings,\n\n556\n00:29:04.009 --> 00:29:07.760\nas well as that\nWindows Firewall Advanced Security.\n\n557\n00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.442\nWe got a few more things we\nneed to talk about though,\n\n558\n00:29:09.442 --> 00:29:11.714\nwe need to talk about connection\nsecurity rules and things like that.\n\n559\n00:29:11.714 --> 00:29:12.890\n>> Yeah, we do.\n\n560\n00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:17.000\nBut this was a great primer on the\nfirewall, especially the Windows firewall.\n\n561\n00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.170\nThat's something you're definitely\ngonna need to know for that exam.\n\n562\n00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.483\nThey're gonna ask you a question or\ntwo on it.\n\n563\n00:29:20.483 --> 00:29:21.770\nI guarantee it.\n\n564\n00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:23.512\nHopefully Mike has done a great job.\n\n565\n00:29:23.512 --> 00:29:26.338\nIt was fantastic demonstrations for\nus today.\n\n566\n00:29:26.338 --> 00:29:27.855\nWe are gonna have to make a part two for\nthis show,\n\n567\n00:29:27.855 --> 00:29:29.409\ncuz there's a little bit\nmore we need to discuss.\n\n568\n00:29:29.409 --> 00:29:31.162\nHopefully, we'll see you there.\n\n569\n00:29:31.162 --> 00:29:32.580\nThanks for watching.\n\n570\n00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.685\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lawry.\n\n571\n00:29:35.685 --> 00:29:36.869\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n572\n00:29:36.869 --> 00:29:37.610\n>> We'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.920\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.180\nHere with me today yet\nagain, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.010\nHow's it going Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.010\n>> Oh it's going great Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.000\nI am excited as always to be here because\nwe're doing our network security and\n\n8\n00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.400\nwe're gonna take it up a notch here.\n\n9\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.670\nWe're moving to that next level\nwhen it comes to network security.\n\n10\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.260\n>> That's right, we're looking at\nWindows 10, specifically because well,\n\n11\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.440\nWindows 10 is out.\n\n12\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.462\nI'm sure you guys are preparing for\nthe exam.\n\n13\n00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:41.000\nYou wanna get that certification in\nthe mail with your nice name on it.\n\n14\n00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.588\nAnd when looking at\nthe Windows Security here, well,\n\n15\n00:00:43.588 --> 00:00:47.247\nif you looked at our previous episode we\ntalked about the Windows Firewall and\n\n16\n00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:50.699\nbehold there are still some more\nsecurity settings for us to go through.\n\n17\n00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.645\nSo that's what we're gonna tackle today.\n\n18\n00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:54.500\nMike, where do we begin?\n\n19\n00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.290\n>> Well,\nwith this one what we're gonna do,\n\n20\n00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.510\nwe did talk about that firewall but, and\n\n21\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.840\nwe saw the firewall with advanced security\nand one thing I didn't say was, why?\n\n22\n00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.200\nWhy is it called\nthe Windows Firewall Advanced Security?\n\n23\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.750\nI think I mentioned that it\nhad more granular control, but\n\n24\n00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.230\nthere's really more to it than that.\n\n25\n00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.830\nLet's go ahead and open that guy up.\n\n26\n00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.719\nI'm gonna search for\nfirewall again this time,\n\n27\n00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.384\nI'm gonna launch the Windows Firewall\nAdvanced Security right off the Menu.\n\n28\n00:01:19.384 --> 00:01:23.257\nAnd when we open this guy up,\nwe're gonna see that, as we saw before,\n\n29\n00:01:23.257 --> 00:01:26.670\nI've got an inbound rules,\nI've got an outbound rules, but\n\n30\n00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.280\nI also have Connection Security Rules.\n\n31\n00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.940\nAnd that was the big change,\nthat's why the new console.\n\n32\n00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.230\nBecause prior to this,\nyou had your Windows Firewall settings,\n\n33\n00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.250\nthat basic console that we've seen,\nand we had our IPsec settings.\n\n34\n00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.650\nThis was a different console,\nit was a snap-in that you had to create.\n\n35\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.430\nAnd they were two separate tools, and\n\n36\n00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.680\nthis one combines them, because really\nthey need to be used together anyway.\n\n37\n00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.665\nIt makes sense that they kinda put it all\nin this one console, giving easy access\n\n38\n00:01:56.665 --> 00:02:01.015\nto both sets of configuration,\nyour firewall as well as your IPsec, and\n\n39\n00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:03.725\nthey just call it\nConnection Security Rules.\n\n40\n00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:06.135\nNow, let's talk about what that is there.\n\n41\n00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:10.405\nWe know at this point that a firewall\nis what controls the traffic,\n\n42\n00:02:10.405 --> 00:02:15.640\nallows it to come through or leave my\nmachine, I can block it if I need to.\n\n43\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.770\nConnection Security Rules talk\nabout whether that traffic\n\n44\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.550\nneeds to be authenticated,\nwhether it needs to be encrypted or not.\n\n45\n00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.940\nSo we're gonna protect that traffic\nas it's traveling across the network.\n\n46\n00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.460\nBut there still both need to be.\n\n47\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.610\nIn other words, if I open up a hole in the\nfirewall, that'll allow that particular\n\n48\n00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.160\ntype of traffic come through, but it won't\nauthenticate it and it won't encrypt it.\n\n49\n00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.580\nI can take my IPsec rules, my connection\nsecurity rules, and I can say,\n\n50\n00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.800\nanytime this type of traffic comes across,\nI wanna authenticate it and or encrypt it.\n\n51\n00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.090\nBut that doesn't allow\nit through the firewall.\n\n52\n00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.910\nYou could make that rule just fine.\n\n53\n00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.760\nBut if the firewall didn't\nhave an exception it's still\n\n54\n00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.280\nslamming into that firewall.\n\n55\n00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.180\nSo you have to do both.\n\n56\n00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.360\nYou have to open up the hole in\nthe firewall as well as decide whether or\n\n57\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.404\nnot you want to encrypt, or authenticate,\nor both that type of traffic.\n\n58\n00:03:06.404 --> 00:03:10.040\nSo it makes sense that they\nput it in the same console.\n\n59\n00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.100\nAnd let's see how it works.\n\n60\n00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.940\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nopen up a command prompt here, and\n\n61\n00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.460\nI'm going to ping my server.\n\n62\n00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.590\nI've got a guy rtr01 out\nthere on the network, and\n\n63\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.290\nfrom the client's perspective\nI can ping rtr, no problem.\n\n64\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.110\nEverything's working.\n\n65\n00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.190\nThat means the firewall exception's\nbeen made on that server.\n\n66\n00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.070\nAnd it's allowing those ICMP\npackets to come through.\n\n67\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.710\nIt's replying and they're coming back.\n\n68\n00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.005\nNow, what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna flip over here to my server.\n\n69\n00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:41.500\nAnd we're gonna change\nthings up a little bit.\n\n70\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.923\nI'm gonna open up my Windows Firewall\nwith advanced security.\n\n71\n00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:48.020\nAnd I'm gonna go to my\nconnection security rules.\n\n72\n00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.655\nI'm gonna make a new rule.\n\n73\n00:03:50.655 --> 00:03:55.170\nNow, as I go through this wizard,\nI've got a few different options here.\n\n74\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.450\nI've got my isolation.\n\n75\n00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.110\nRestrict connections based\non authentication criteria\n\n76\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.530\nsuch as domain membership or\nhealth status.\n\n77\n00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.960\nYou can use connection security\nrules to isolate your domain.\n\n78\n00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.800\nIn other words, what would\nhappen is if I turn this on, and\n\n79\n00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.900\nI set it to my domain is lab.net,\non these virtual machines.\n\n80\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.785\nIf I set that up,\nthen only computers that are part of\n\n81\n00:04:16.785 --> 00:04:19.440\nlab.net would be able to\ncommunicate with this server.\n\n82\n00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.040\nIt would isolate it from everybody else.\n\n83\n00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.430\nAnd you might do that to\nall your domain machines.\n\n84\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.340\nSo domain machines can communicate\nwith each other, no problem.\n\n85\n00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.050\nAnybody outside of the domain,\nthey're not gonna be able to.\n\n86\n00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.990\nLike vendors laptops that come into your\nnetwork and they plug into your network.\n\n87\n00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.119\nThey wouldn't be able to communicate\nwith anybody that had this rule applied.\n\n88\n00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:42.320\nYou also have authentication exemption,\nwe're gonna come back to that rule,\n\n89\n00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.200\nI'm gonna save that for the end.\n\n90\n00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.770\nI've got server-to-server.\n\n91\n00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.510\nYou might not want to authenticate or\nencrypt all traffic,\n\n92\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.170\nbut when these two servers communicate\nwith each other, I need to encrypt that.\n\n93\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.477\nDNS is an example where\nI've seen this used.\n\n94\n00:04:56.477 --> 00:05:01.400\nA little beyond the client scope, but when\nDNS servers replicate with each other,\n\n95\n00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.560\nthat traffic is unencrypted.\n\n96\n00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.550\nSo I might set up a server to server\nauthentication rule that requires\n\n97\n00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.290\nauthentication and or encryption when\nthose two servers talk to each other.\n\n98\n00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.580\nWhen anybody else talks to the server,\nI'm not worried about it.\n\n99\n00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.350\nBut when they're replicating that zone,\nmaybe I want to encrypt that traffic.\n\n100\n00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.140\nSo for any reason,\nserver-to-server type of communication.\n\n101\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.150\nTunnels, these are typically\ndone between two routers.\n\n102\n00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.820\nBetween a corporate office and\na branch office.\n\n103\n00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.190\nBut that's not always the case.\n\n104\n00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.280\nIt could be done internally.\n\n105\n00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.380\nYou might have a server that\ncontains healthcare information or\n\n106\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.130\ncustomer credit card numbers,\nand you wanna set up a nice,\n\n107\n00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.240\nsecure connection between your\ncomputer and that server, so\n\n108\n00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.680\nthat if anybody is sniffing traffic,\nthey wouldn't be able to intercept that.\n\n109\n00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.408\nOr again, we could do a custom rule,\nwhich basically gives me all the options\n\n110\n00:05:49.408 --> 00:05:52.269\nthat I want, I can pick and\nchoose what I need.\n\n111\n00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:54.021\nAnd that kinda makes me think, Daniel,\n\n112\n00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:57.280\nI don't know if I was clear on what\nthis connection security rule is doing.\n\n113\n00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.240\nRemember it will authenticate traffic.\n\n114\n00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.130\nIt can also encrypt traffic.\n\n115\n00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.961\nOr both.\n\n116\n00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:04.760\nAnd you might think, well,\nwhy would I ever want to do that.\n\n117\n00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.670\nWell, because I want to verify\nthe identity of somebody\n\n118\n00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.000\nthat's connecting to that server.\n\n119\n00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.180\nIf I require authentication for\nthat particular file server\n\n120\n00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.770\nthen anybody that tries to connect\nto it is gonna have to authenticate.\n\n121\n00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.440\nIf they can't authenticate they're not\ngonna get access to that file server,\n\n122\n00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.219\nits gonna block that traffic its not gonna\nallow them, so again when that stranger\n\n123\n00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:27.724\ncomes and plugs into your network they\nmight be able to get Internet access,\n\n124\n00:06:27.724 --> 00:06:30.714\nbut they're not gonna be able to\nget access to that file server.\n\n125\n00:06:30.714 --> 00:06:35.277\nOr for encryption you might think, well,\nwhy you're on a corporate network,\n\n126\n00:06:35.277 --> 00:06:36.580\nwhy encrypt traffic?\n\n127\n00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.600\nIt's inside my trusted network.\n\n128\n00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.900\nWell, to be honest with\nyou if you ever go and\n\n129\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.900\nlook at the types of security breaches\nwe have to deal with on networks,\n\n130\n00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.550\nthe vast majority of them come from\nwith what we call disgruntled employees.\n\n131\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.890\nThat means that person that just found\nout they're going to be terminated, or\n\n132\n00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.110\nthat the company's downsizing, or Daniel\nparked in their parking spot, they're mad.\n\n133\n00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.440\nThey're upset and\nthey're gonna try to do something.\n\n134\n00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.820\nThey can run a pack of caps utility\non the network, like wire shark or\n\n135\n00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.010\nsomething like that.\n\n136\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.620\nAnd they could intercept traffic,\n\n137\n00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.610\nwhich could give them access to data that\nthey shouldn't have access to normally.\n\n138\n00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.170\nThey wait for you to access the data,\n\n139\n00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.110\nand then they just capture\nthe traffic as it travel by.\n\n140\n00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.450\nWell, if it's encrypted,\n\n141\n00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.560\nthey can capture it all they want,\nthey're not gonna be able to read it.\n\n142\n00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.200\nSo it helped keep that\ndata safe even internally.\n\n143\n00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.710\n>> Yeah, Mike.\n\n144\n00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.160\nIt's all about that layered security\nthat we keep harping about.\n\n145\n00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.369\nIt's a very important factor when it\ncomes to network and data security.\n\n146\n00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:33.731\nYou wanna add as many obstacles for\nan attacker or\n\n147\n00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:38.578\nwhoever to get through before they're\nactually able to access data.\n\n148\n00:07:38.578 --> 00:07:42.324\nCuz the more you add, the more difficult\nit becomes, the more difficult it becomes,\n\n149\n00:07:42.324 --> 00:07:44.417\nthe more of a less likely\nof a target you become.\n\n150\n00:07:44.417 --> 00:07:48.993\nNow, it's not saying that you can never\nbe compromised even if you have multi,\n\n151\n00:07:48.993 --> 00:07:52.078\nmulti layers of security\ngoing through your system.\n\n152\n00:07:52.078 --> 00:07:56.595\nIt's still possible that someone is just\nbound and determined to get your data.\n\n153\n00:07:56.595 --> 00:08:01.839\nBut the more we make it un-enticing, the\nmore difficult it is to get at The more\n\n154\n00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:07.094\nthey're gonna go, you know what,\nI'm gonna grab some lower hanging fruit.\n\n155\n00:08:07.094 --> 00:08:09.610\nThis is a little too much work for me.\n\n156\n00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.680\n>> Absolutely.\nThe bad guys are typically lazy\n\n157\n00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.326\nlike we are, right?\n\n158\n00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:13.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And they want to go for\n\n159\n00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.322\nthe easy targets.\n\n160\n00:08:15.322 --> 00:08:17.320\n>> That's right.\n>> So, make yourself the difficult target,\n\n161\n00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.800\nand they'll move onto somebody else.\n\n162\n00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.900\nRight?\nThat's the idea anyway.\n\n163\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.090\nAll right.\nSo let's take a look at\n\n164\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:22.820\nhow we can do this.\n\n165\n00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.182\nI've got my new connection security\nrule wizard fired up here.\n\n166\n00:08:27.182 --> 00:08:29.530\nI'm gonna go ahead and do a custom rule.\n\n167\n00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.270\nAnd I'll click Next.\n\n168\n00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.310\nThat way, notice we get to see all\nthe options when I choose custom.\n\n169\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.100\nI'll click Next.\n\n170\n00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:41.500\nI can specify, if it's a particular\nIP address for source or destination,\n\n171\n00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.530\non this server what I wanna do is\nI wanna acquire security for ICMP.\n\n172\n00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.090\nNow, that's a silly rule, not something\nyou would probably do in the real world,\n\n173\n00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.245\nbut it's just a quick and easy example.\n\n174\n00:08:53.245 --> 00:08:55.365\nIt would work no matter\nwhat protocol I picked.\n\n175\n00:08:55.365 --> 00:08:57.035\nSame concepts are gonna apply, right?\n\n176\n00:08:57.035 --> 00:08:59.655\nI'm just gonna use ICMP,\ncuz it's easy to test.\n\n177\n00:08:59.655 --> 00:09:01.375\nAnd I'm gonna leave it open.\n\n178\n00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:04.027\nSo any computer to any computer,\nand I'm gonna click Next.\n\n179\n00:09:04.027 --> 00:09:07.607\nAnd then I wanna do\nrequire authentication.\n\n180\n00:09:07.607 --> 00:09:10.047\nBut let's talk about these\nthree options I've got here.\n\n181\n00:09:10.047 --> 00:09:15.047\nThat first one says request authentication\nfor inbound and outbound connections.\n\n182\n00:09:15.047 --> 00:09:19.837\nThat means any inbound traffic, it's gonna\nsay to the person sending that traffic,\n\n183\n00:09:19.837 --> 00:09:22.467\nhey, let's authenticate this traffic.\n\n184\n00:09:22.467 --> 00:09:23.847\nBut it's a request.\n\n185\n00:09:23.847 --> 00:09:26.237\nIf the other end says yes,\nI support that, and\n\n186\n00:09:26.237 --> 00:09:29.900\nwe can authenticate if you want,\nthen it'll say great, let's do it.\n\n187\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.660\nAnd they'll negotiate and\nthey'll authenticate traffic.\n\n188\n00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.245\nIf the other end says, neh, I don't\nunderstand what you're talking about or,\n\n189\n00:09:36.245 --> 00:09:41.075\nmm my policy doesn't support that,\nit says, okay, I tried.\n\n190\n00:09:41.075 --> 00:09:42.475\nYou can connect to me, anyway.\n\n191\n00:09:42.475 --> 00:09:44.545\nIt was just a request, right?\n\n192\n00:09:44.545 --> 00:09:47.036\nSo if the other end says no,\nhe says okay, you can connect, anyway.\n\n193\n00:09:47.036 --> 00:09:50.112\nAt least I tried, I did my due diligence.\n\n194\n00:09:50.112 --> 00:09:50.895\nAll right.\n\n195\n00:09:50.895 --> 00:09:53.245\nSame thing for outbound, it's a request.\n\n196\n00:09:53.245 --> 00:09:56.040\nThe second option,\nrequire authentication for\n\n197\n00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.180\ninbound, request authentication for\noutbound.\n\n198\n00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.760\nSame concept but this time the inbound\ntraffic it says, hey let's authenticate.\n\n199\n00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.950\nIf the other end says sure,\nthen we'll connect we're good to go.\n\n200\n00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.520\nIf the other end says naw,\nI don't do authentication like that,\n\n201\n00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.380\nthen my machine's gonna say,\nwell then you're not connecting to me.\n\n202\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.670\nI require authentication for\ninbound traffic.\n\n203\n00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:23.250\nIt's still a request for outbound traffic,\nbut inbound traffic is gonna require.\n\n204\n00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.850\nAnd then the last option, require for\nboth inbound and outbound.\n\n205\n00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.430\nAnd I think at this point you probably\nknow what's gonna happen, right?\n\n206\n00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.610\nIf that traffic's not authenticated,\nwhether it's coming in or\n\n207\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.250\nleaving, it's not gonna be allowed.\n\n208\n00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.680\nOr I can say do not authenticate.\n\n209\n00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.860\nIf I don't wanna do authentication,\nall right?\n\n210\n00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.910\nNow, where you use these rules\nreally depends on the scenario.\n\n211\n00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.460\nI will tell you that the most\ncommon use is that on servers.\n\n212\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.350\nIf I have a server that contains\nnothing but secure data,\n\n213\n00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:55.360\nthen on that server I might do require\nauthentication for inbound and outbound.\n\n214\n00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.000\nThat way the only traffic coming into that\nserver, has been authenticated, all right.\n\n215\n00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.080\nBut on my client, I probably don't wanna\ndo that, because my clients deal with\n\n216\n00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.840\na lot of traffic that doesn't\nneed to be authenticated, or\n\n217\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.880\nis not going to be or\ncannot be authenticated, right?\n\n218\n00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.600\nThey connect to the Internet.\n\n219\n00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.160\nThey connect to DHCP.\n\n220\n00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.350\nI mean, if I do require authentication,\n\n221\n00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.840\nthere's a lot of things all of\na sudden I've gotta think about.\n\n222\n00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.550\nDHCP traffic, log on traffic,\nall of that stuff.\n\n223\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.330\nDNS traffic.\n\n224\n00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.750\nI've gotta make sure that, that rule is\nnot gonna block that type of traffic, or\n\n225\n00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.190\nI'm gonna have a pretty\nuseless client at that point.\n\n226\n00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:34.090\nSo typically we'll do the require\ninbound and request outbound.\n\n227\n00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.940\nThat means that a client, anything\ncoming into it has to be authenticated.\n\n228\n00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.463\nBut when it's reaching out to public\nresources and non-secure resources, it'll\n\n229\n00:11:41.463 --> 00:11:46.316\nrequest it, but say eh, if you don't have\nit, or, I'm sorry, for the outbound, yep.\n\n230\n00:11:46.316 --> 00:11:50.678\nI request authentication outbound so that\nway if that other end doesn't support it,\n\n231\n00:11:50.678 --> 00:11:53.176\nI can still connect to it as a client,\nall right.\n\n232\n00:11:53.176 --> 00:11:56.810\nBecause clients, a lot of times,\nconnect to resources that aren't or\n\n233\n00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.835\ncan't be authenticated, all right.\n\n234\n00:11:58.835 --> 00:12:02.106\nBut that doesn't mean you have to, I mean,\nyou might set up where your entire network\n\n235\n00:12:02.106 --> 00:12:05.355\nrequires authentication for\nall traffic inbound and outbound, right.\n\n236\n00:12:05.355 --> 00:12:07.240\nIt just depends on what your needs are,\n\n237\n00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.810\nnice that Microsoft gives us\nthis easy flexibility here.\n\n238\n00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:11.522\nRight.\n\n239\n00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:15.570\nI'm gonna do just for this lab, I'm gonna\ndo require authentication for inbound.\n\n240\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.660\nRequest authentication for outbound.\n\n241\n00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.480\nI'll click Next.\n\n242\n00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.300\nAnd then how do I want to authenticate.\n\n243\n00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.540\nI got a couple of different options here.\n\n244\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.960\nI've got the default.\n\n245\n00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.710\nWhich is gonna be chosen,\n\n246\n00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:31.990\nwhich says use the IPSec policy to\ndetermine what you're gonna do.\n\n247\n00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.800\nOr I can choose Computer and\nuser, or just Computer.\n\n248\n00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.490\nOr I can do Advanced, where I can specify\nseveral different authentication methods,\n\n249\n00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.380\nand let them negotiate and pick.\n\n250\n00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.160\nThey'll start with the strongest one,\n\n251\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.200\nif the other end doesn't support that,\nthey can negotiate something else.\n\n252\n00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.600\nThey can work their way down through\ntheir list of available authentication,\n\n253\n00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.650\ntill they find one that both\nends can agree upon, and\n\n254\n00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.750\nthen they'll use that, all right.\n\n255\n00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.380\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ndo Kerberos authentication on this one.\n\n256\n00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.850\nWhich, now, either one of those,\nif I do computer and user, Kerberos V5, or\n\n257\n00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.960\ncomputer Kerberos V5, this can only be\ndone in a domain environment, right,\n\n258\n00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.690\nwhere we have Kerberos\nauthentication going on.\n\n259\n00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.570\nIf we're not using Kerberos, if we're\nconnecting to outside resources and\n\n260\n00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.780\nthey're connecting us, and\nwe're using web based authentication or\n\n261\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.020\nscripting or something like that,\nthat wouldn't work here, right?\n\n262\n00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.680\nKerberos can only be used\nwith domain based machines or\n\n263\n00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.645\nwhere you're running Kerberos,\nit has to be a trusted account.\n\n264\n00:13:25.645 --> 00:13:28.420\nSo that vendor might\ncome into your network,\n\n265\n00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.100\nhe wouldn't be able to connect cuz his\ncomputer is not part of my domain,\n\n266\n00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.330\nand he wouldn't be able to authenticate\nwith my domain controller.\n\n267\n00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.020\nSo I'll go ahead and do Kerberos on\nthis one just for the computer half.\n\n268\n00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.850\nWe'll click Next.\n\n269\n00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.819\nAnd then to which ports\ndoes this rule apply?\n\n270\n00:13:42.819 --> 00:13:45.512\nWell again to keep it simple,\nI'll do ICMP V4.\n\n271\n00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:48.878\nAnd I'll go ahead and click Next.\n\n272\n00:13:48.878 --> 00:13:50.790\nAnd then I wanna just leave this.\n\n273\n00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.890\nI'll leave it on all three profiles.\n\n274\n00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:53.560\nThen I'll click Next.\n\n275\n00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.580\nAnd you might think,\nwell why would you do it on public?\n\n276\n00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.010\nWell actually I'm securing it right?\n\n277\n00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.290\nI'm saying that this is gonna\nhave to be authenticated.\n\n278\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.400\nOut on the public network,\nit's probably not gonna succeed so\n\n279\n00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.310\nit wouldn't allow it, so.\n\n280\n00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.050\nI'll go ahead and click Next.\n\n281\n00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.030\nI'll give it a name.\n\n282\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.343\nLittle extra click there.\n\n283\n00:14:10.343 --> 00:14:17.725\nThen we'll say secure ICMP,\nand I'll click Finish.\n\n284\n00:14:17.725 --> 00:14:18.945\nAll right.\n\n285\n00:14:18.945 --> 00:14:22.700\nAnd now, again that firewall\nlikes to pop behind everything.\n\n286\n00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:27.140\nSo there's my rule that's saying,\nhey anything coming from any end points,\n\n287\n00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:32.190\nrequire inbound, request outbound,\nauthenticated using Kerberos.\n\n288\n00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.540\nSo if I switch back over here,\nremember I had my successful replies\n\n289\n00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.390\nfrom the client earlier,\nI'm gonna try to ping that server again.\n\n290\n00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.260\nAnd now, all of a sudden,\nI'm not gonna get any success.\n\n291\n00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.920\nIt's telling me request timed out.\n\n292\n00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.640\nNow we've come to another important\npart of these IPSec policies.\n\n293\n00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.320\nAnd that is, both ends have to agree.\n\n294\n00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.630\nRight.\nI put a policy on the server,\n\n295\n00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.490\nI didn't put a policy on the client.\n\n296\n00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.010\nSo he's not doing a request, right.\n\n297\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:03.950\nThe server's saying, I'm gonna require\nauthentication for inbound traffic.\n\n298\n00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.280\nThe client has no idea, he's like,\nI'm just trying to connect.\n\n299\n00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.840\nThere's no policy on him.\n\n300\n00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.910\nSo he's not even trying to authenticate.\n\n301\n00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.290\nAnd the server's saying,\ntoo bad for you, you can't connect.\n\n302\n00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:14.850\nAll right?\n\n303\n00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.460\nSo both ends have to have both\nends of the conversation,\n\n304\n00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.850\nhave to have a policy in place,\nand they have to match.\n\n305\n00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.380\nIf the server has a policy that says,\nI wanna do Kerberos authentication,\n\n306\n00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.510\nyou're using the computer account.\n\n307\n00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.200\nAnd the user did have a policy, or\nthe client did have a policy, but\n\n308\n00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.640\nit said do both computer and\nuser using Kerberos, well they\n\n309\n00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.850\ncan't agree on their authentication\nmethod, it's still not gonna work.\n\n310\n00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.880\nSo not only do you have to have policies\non both ends of the conversation,\n\n311\n00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.940\nthe policies have to match or\nthey have to agree, right.\n\n312\n00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.100\nSo let's see if we can fix it.\n\n313\n00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.770\nGonna come over here to my client, I'm\ngonna go to Connection Security Rules, and\n\n314\n00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.590\nwe'll make a new rule.\n\n315\n00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.780\nAnd I'm just going to basically\ngo through the exact same things.\n\n316\n00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.980\nI'll do it rather quickly.\n\n317\n00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.674\nCustom Rule from any IP address.\n\n318\n00:15:58.674 --> 00:16:01.994\nWe're gonna require\ninbound request outbound.\n\n319\n00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:06.394\nAnd we'll do Kerberos V5.\n\n320\n00:16:06.394 --> 00:16:09.942\nAnd again, we're just gonna\nlimit that to ping traffic, or\n\n321\n00:16:09.942 --> 00:16:11.693\nICMP traffic, I should say.\n\n322\n00:16:11.693 --> 00:16:13.629\nAll profiles.\n\n323\n00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:19.410\nI'll call it Secure ICMP.\n\n324\n00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.810\nThe names don't have to match, right?\n\n325\n00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.720\nThe names are just for\nyou to figure out which rules are which.\n\n326\n00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.390\nI'll click Finish.\n\n327\n00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:28.130\nAnd now, let's try to ping one more time.\n\n328\n00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.280\nYou see my success, my failure.\n\n329\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.390\nOnce I set the rule up on the server.\n\n330\n00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.660\nNow I've got the rule set\nup on the client as well.\n\n331\n00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.390\nAnd bata bing, I've got ping.\n\n332\n00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:43.140\nAnd you might've noticed there was a brief\ndelay before that first reply came back,\n\n333\n00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.190\nthat was the actual negotiation process.\n\n334\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.900\nIt happened so quick,\nit's really hard to see it.\n\n335\n00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.210\nBut that initial negotiation has to go on,\nwhere it says, hey,\n\n336\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.680\nI require authentication.\n\n337\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.930\nThe client said, oh,\nI can do authentication.\n\n338\n00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.450\nThe server says, well,\nwhat do you support for authentication?\n\n339\n00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.620\nThe client says, well, I can do\nKerberos for the computer account.\n\n340\n00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.340\nThe server says, yeah,\nI can do that, too, let's use that.\n\n341\n00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.390\nThey agree.\n\n342\n00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:12.590\nAnd then the ping packs start\nflowing back and forth, right?\n\n343\n00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:15.850\nNow, once I've got that\nconnection established,\n\n344\n00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.360\nI wanna show you one more thing, here.\n\n345\n00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.590\nWe've got a couple things, actually,\nwe need to look at, Daniel.\n\n346\n00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:26.390\nThere's a monitoring node in the advance\nsecurity console for my Windows firewall.\n\n347\n00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:31.120\nThis allows me to see what rules I have\nin place, for example, for the firewall,\n\n348\n00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.320\nwhat connection security rules I have,\nwhich for trouble shooting,\n\n349\n00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.490\nI might want to come in here and say,\nhey, do you even have the rule applied?\n\n350\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.690\nBecause this might be being passed out\nthrough group policy at the corporate\n\n351\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.160\nlevel, and I just need to make\nsure that policy's in place.\n\n352\n00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.270\nAnd then below that I've got\nmy Security associations.\n\n353\n00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:53.070\nAnd I've got what's called my main\nmode and my quick mode associations.\n\n354\n00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:57.020\nThe main mode is the initial negotiation\nthat my client and that server went\n\n355\n00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.220\nthrough, when they said, all right,\nwhat do you use for authentication?\n\n356\n00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.860\nLet's figure out what we can use for\nauthentication, for encryption, for\n\n357\n00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.410\nintegrity, and\nI didn't require encryption on here, but\n\n358\n00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.495\nthey did agree on a method, AES.\n\n359\n00:18:09.495 --> 00:18:13.930\nSHA-1 for signing the packets to make\nsure they haven't been modified.\n\n360\n00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.520\nThis is my Main Mode association.\n\n361\n00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.690\nThen below that I've got my Quick Mode.\n\n362\n00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.940\nAnd this is where they're talking about\nwhat protocol is being used, if it's gonna\n\n363\n00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:26.920\nbe allowed over the different ports, and\nif I wanna digitally sign those packets.\n\n364\n00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.760\nThe way this works,\nwhen they make that first negotiation,\n\n365\n00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.890\nthey set up a main mode association,\nis what it's called.\n\n366\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:37.570\nThey do their key exchange and\nthey get everything set up,\n\n367\n00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.290\nif they need to do a key exchange.\n\n368\n00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.160\nIf they're gonna do encryption,\n\n369\n00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.870\nyou can see I'm not encrypting,\nso key exchange is None.\n\n370\n00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.240\nOnce they've got that main mode\nestablished then they do a Quick Mode.\n\n371\n00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.330\nAnd they say, all right,\n\n372\n00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.240\nwhat type of traffic,\nwhat am I supposed to do with that?\n\n373\n00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.640\nBecause different types of traffic may\nrequire different levels of authentication\n\n374\n00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.800\nor authorization, or\nI'm sorry, encryption.\n\n375\n00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.520\nAnd they establish a quick mode,\n\n376\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.100\nwhere they say okay, we're gonna do\nICV4 and we're gonna sign in with SHA-1.\n\n377\n00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.720\nThe Quick Mode is what they use to\nactually transmit the data back and\n\n378\n00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.580\nforth, all right.\n\n379\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.980\nThe Main Mode is just the initial\nconnection between the two machines.\n\n380\n00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.390\nThe Quick Mode will go away.\n\n381\n00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:18.780\nIf we were to sit here long enough, it's\nabout five minutes or so, that'll go away.\n\n382\n00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.960\nBut the Main Mode will not.\n\n383\n00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.740\nBy default it has a lifetime\nof about eight hours, so\n\n384\n00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.770\nit's going to last all day.\n\n385\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.530\nSo the next time,\nif I disconnect from that machine and\n\n386\n00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:30.180\nI connect to that server again, they don't\nhave to do the Main Mode all over again.\n\n387\n00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.180\nThey've already done that negotiation.\n\n388\n00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.150\nAll they have to do is fire up that Quick\nMode, so it speeds that process up, right?\n\n389\n00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.270\nNow, tomorrow I come in, I'm gonna have\nto do that main mode association all over\n\n390\n00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.630\nagain, and then once it's established,\nI do my quick mode.\n\n391\n00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.660\nSo that's the way these IP sec work.\n\n392\n00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:50.000\nThey've got a main mode association that\nthey do their initial security association\n\n393\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.570\nor negotiation with.\n\n394\n00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.910\nAnd then any time they need\nto send data back and forth,\n\n395\n00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:58.880\nthey can just fire up that\nquick mode if it's timed out.\n\n396\n00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.070\nNow what I want to do, and\nI know I've been going on forever here.\n\n397\n00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.470\nLet's go back over to the client.\n\n398\n00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.420\nI'm sorry, to the server, and\nlet's fire up a command prompt.\n\n399\n00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:09.460\nAnd let's ping the client.\n\n400\n00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.820\nIf I could spell ping.\n\n401\n00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.089\n>> Ping is not a proper command, Michael.\n\n402\n00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:14.590\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's not?\n\n403\n00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.195\nWait, I see it on that bench everywhere.\n\n404\n00:20:16.195 --> 00:20:17.800\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n405\n00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.010\n>> Client 100 and\nI'm gonna try to ping it.\n\n406\n00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.590\nOh, it doesn't work.\n\n407\n00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:29.160\nWait a second Daniel, I've got that setup,\nthey both match on either end.\n\n408\n00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.513\n>> It's obvious you just\ndon't know what you're doing.\n\n409\n00:20:32.513 --> 00:20:35.302\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n410\n00:20:35.302 --> 00:20:38.200\nNo, this goes back to the point\nI talked about initially,\n\n411\n00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:43.660\nis that the connection security rules, and\nthe firewall rules are independent, right?\n\n412\n00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.940\nYes, both sides of this conversation have\nconnection security rules, and they match.\n\n413\n00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.540\nAnd the client can ping the server,\n\n414\n00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.720\nbecause the server has an exception\nin the firewall for ICMP traffic.\n\n415\n00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.060\nBut the client does not.\n\n416\n00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.230\nSo even though they could\nnegotiate security,\n\n417\n00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.210\nthe firewall's still blocking the traffic.\n\n418\n00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:06.480\nSo I need to come back over to here and\nsay inbound rules and find my ICMP.\n\n419\n00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.500\nAnd let me do that on the domain\nnetwork since that's what we're on.\n\n420\n00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.430\nBack over to the server.\n\n421\n00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.930\nTry that again.\n\n422\n00:21:16.022 --> 00:21:18.350\nAnd now everything works again, right?\n\n423\n00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.810\nSo again, stressing to you\nguys that those are separate.\n\n424\n00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:24.120\nJust because you go through the trouble\nof making the connection security rule,\n\n425\n00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.760\nthat does not allow the traffic\nthrough the firewall.\n\n426\n00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.320\nYou still have to do that.\n\n427\n00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.620\nIf you allow the traffic through the\nfirewall, that does not secure the data.\n\n428\n00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.660\nYou have to make\na connection security rule.\n\n429\n00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.200\nTwo different things that we've got\nto accomplish there, if we need to.\n\n430\n00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.220\nJust keep that in mind, and it's nice\nthat they're now all in that one console,\n\n431\n00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.470\nthat Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security.\n\n432\n00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:47.590\n>> Yeah a very important topic right\nthere, or a concept that you definitely\n\n433\n00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.780\nneed to understand, cuz that'll almost\nguarantee they're probably gonna ask\n\n434\n00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.490\nyou something along those lines in\nthe form of a question that exam.\n\n435\n00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.650\nThey love to try,\nbecause it can be tricky, you don't tend\n\n436\n00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.890\nto put the two things together, think,\noh I made that exception in the firewall,\n\n437\n00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:04.590\nI should be good to go but\nit's not being authenticated, right?\n\n438\n00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.540\nBecause you didn't set\nup the authentication.\n\n439\n00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.870\nIf they're asking you\nabout authentication,\n\n440\n00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.710\nyou gotta make sure authentication\nis what you've done.\n\n441\n00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.260\nYou got to keep those things\nstraight in your brain or\n\n442\n00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.010\nyou'll get tripped up on\na question really, really quickly.\n\n443\n00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:19.100\nSo make sure that when you're going\nthrough the process always have that\n\n444\n00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.830\nlogical order in which you\nneed to get things done so\n\n445\n00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.800\nthat you don't mess up when\nit comes to that stuff.\n\n446\n00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.770\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n447\n00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:28.280\nAll right, last think I want to show you\nguys here is gonna be something called\n\n448\n00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.040\nnetwork discovery.\n\n449\n00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.890\nThey called this out in the same\nset of objectives on the exam,\n\n450\n00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.330\nso let's take a look at that.\n\n451\n00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:38.860\nNetwork discovery is what allows you\nto find other computers on the network,\n\n452\n00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.345\nas well as allow them to find you.\n\n453\n00:22:41.345 --> 00:22:45.355\nIf you've got shares available and\nyou wanna share something out with your\n\n454\n00:22:45.355 --> 00:22:50.805\ncoworkers, or even if you wanna be able to\nfind shares on your file servers, when you\n\n455\n00:22:50.805 --> 00:22:55.225\nturn off network discovery, not only can\nthey not find you, you can't find them.\n\n456\n00:22:55.225 --> 00:22:57.155\nSo we need to be able to turn that on.\n\n457\n00:22:57.155 --> 00:23:00.815\nAnd a lot of times, again, this is handled\nthrough something called group policy,\n\n458\n00:23:00.815 --> 00:23:03.940\nwhich means it's done by\nmy system administrator.\n\n459\n00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.080\nAnd if they just apply the setting to\nall the client machines out there, and\n\n460\n00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.370\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n461\n00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.980\nBut it is important if we're\ntrouble shooting that we can verify\n\n462\n00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.010\nthese settings.\n\n463\n00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.740\nOr maybe we're not in a domain\nenvironment, we're in a SOHO or\n\n464\n00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.930\nsomething like that where I need to\nwork with these settings manually.\n\n465\n00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:19.720\nSo lets take a look at it.\n\n466\n00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.120\nThe first thing you'll notice\nif I open up File Explorer.\n\n467\n00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.405\nIf Windows wants to play along.\n\n468\n00:23:25.405 --> 00:23:27.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll come in here and\n\n469\n00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.060\nI'm gonna go to Network.\n\n470\n00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.000\nAnd I'll see it says this is empty.\n\n471\n00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.080\nAnd Network discovery and\nfile sharing are turned off.\n\n472\n00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.100\nNetwork computers and\ndevices are not visible.\n\n473\n00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.490\nSo nobody can see me.\n\n474\n00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.660\nI see nobody else, all right?\n\n475\n00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.990\nNow we did say this is a domain network,\nright?\n\n476\n00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:46.090\nAnd the same thing would be true for\nyour private based networks.\n\n477\n00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.160\nYou're saying, yes, I wanna see them.\n\n478\n00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.570\nBut you still have to come in, and\nenable this network discovery.\n\n479\n00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.360\nSo, I could do it from right here.\n\n480\n00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.877\nI could click on this bar, and just Turn\non Network discovery and file sharing.\n\n481\n00:23:56.877 --> 00:23:58.458\nBut I wanna show you where it is.\n\n482\n00:23:58.458 --> 00:24:00.790\nSo I'm gonna open up the Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n483\n00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:03.978\nNow you guys know you can also get\nthrough to your control panel,\n\n484\n00:24:03.978 --> 00:24:07.890\nyou can do your search from the start\nmenu, you can get to these same settings.\n\n485\n00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:13.110\nAnd then I'm gonna click on\nChange Advanced Sharing Settings.\n\n486\n00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.355\nNow we'll make this a little bit bigger so\n\n487\n00:24:14.355 --> 00:24:19.455\nwe can see it, and just like my firewall,\nit's handled on a per profile basis.\n\n488\n00:24:19.455 --> 00:24:21.015\nDomain is my current profile,\n\n489\n00:24:21.015 --> 00:24:24.855\nbecause there's a domain controller on\nthis network, so let's apply that profile.\n\n490\n00:24:24.855 --> 00:24:26.254\nSo that's the one that's expanded out.\n\n491\n00:24:26.254 --> 00:24:31.015\nBut I have the same settings for\nPublic as well as Private.\n\n492\n00:24:31.015 --> 00:24:34.755\nSo I can control this on a per\nprofile basis, keep that in mind.\n\n493\n00:24:34.755 --> 00:24:38.810\nI don't want you thinking, okay,\nI turned it on on my domain profile.\n\n494\n00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.410\nHow come when I get home it's not working?\n\n495\n00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:41.680\nRight?\nYou gotta do it on\n\n496\n00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.530\neach profile if you wanna do that.\n\n497\n00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:46.080\nAnd I've got two options,\nNetwork Discovery, and\n\n498\n00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.510\nyou can see whenever network discovery\nis on, this computer can see\n\n499\n00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:55.000\nother network computers and devices and\nis visible to other network computers.\n\n500\n00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.142\nOr I can do File and Printer Sharing.\n\n501\n00:24:57.142 --> 00:25:00.550\nI wanna share files, do if I've got\na printer hooked up to my machine, and\n\n502\n00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.180\nI want other people to be able to use\nthat printer, I need to share it out.\n\n503\n00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.165\nI need to turn this on or\nthey won't be able to see it.\n\n504\n00:25:07.165 --> 00:25:09.040\nRight?\nSo I'm just simply gonna turn it on,\n\n505\n00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.530\nturn on network discover,\nturn on file and printer sharing.\n\n506\n00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:15.890\nAnd I'll choose Save Changes and\n\n507\n00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:19.480\nnow let's see what happens when\nI go back to my file explorer.\n\n508\n00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.325\nAnd I go to network and\n\n509\n00:25:22.325 --> 00:25:25.940\nnotice I see all the other machines\nnow that are on the network.\n\n510\n00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.980\nI have to go over to RTR,\nthere's a shared folder on that network.\n\n511\n00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.170\nI can connect to it because I happen\nto have permissions over that share,\n\n512\n00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:34.800\nthat's another episode.\n\n513\n00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.482\nBut now I can see it,\nI can find it on the network.\n\n514\n00:25:37.482 --> 00:25:38.570\nAll right?\n\n515\n00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.420\nNow, without that,\nif I had known the UNC path,\n\n516\n00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:46.050\nwhich I do, we could have actually type\nin the UNC path and connected to it.\n\n517\n00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:46.890\nRight?\nSo\n\n518\n00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.480\nbecause we did say this\nwas a domain network.\n\n519\n00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.800\nPrivate networks are the same way, they're\ngonna allow that type of traffic but\n\n520\n00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.740\nyou won't be able to browse\nthe network and just see all shares.\n\n521\n00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:01.208\nLike now I can double-click on\na machine and any shares it has I'm\n\n522\n00:26:01.208 --> 00:26:05.580\ngonna at least see if I have permissions\nand if I do have permissions like read and\n\n523\n00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.660\nwrite I can double-click on it and\nconnect.\n\n524\n00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.520\nWithout the network sharing or without\nturning that on I would have to know\n\n525\n00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.250\nthe UNC path to get to it,\nI couldn't browse the network and find it.\n\n526\n00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.720\n>> Yeah, I think Microsoft\nhas done a really good job of\n\n527\n00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.130\nusing words like discovery.\n\n528\n00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.790\nRight?\n\n529\n00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.500\nThat is exactly what you're doing.\n\n530\n00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:26.040\nOr Explorer, you are exploring and\ndiscovering, looking for certain things.\n\n531\n00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.090\nHere specifically we're\ntalking about networks.\n\n532\n00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.872\nI go to that network area\nof the Windows Explorer or\n\n533\n00:26:30.872 --> 00:26:33.268\nI guess they call it\nthe File Explorer now.\n\n534\n00:26:33.268 --> 00:26:34.475\nThat's right don't mess that up anymore.\n\n535\n00:26:34.475 --> 00:26:36.435\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is the File Explorer.\n\n536\n00:26:36.435 --> 00:26:38.275\nWindows Explorer is old and dead and\n\n537\n00:26:38.275 --> 00:26:42.395\nthe new hotness is File Explorer, and then\nwe have Network and we can go there and\n\n538\n00:26:42.395 --> 00:26:46.500\nsee all the things we might not even know\nabout that are there as a resource for us.\n\n539\n00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.880\nSo that's a nice thing for us.\n\n540\n00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.490\nNow if we're a little more pointed,\nwe're a little more maybe\n\n541\n00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.340\non the admin side of things,\nlike Mike said we can use the UNC pass.\n\n542\n00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.768\nI can do slash slash server name slash\nshare name cuz I know where it is,\n\n543\n00:26:56.768 --> 00:26:57.766\nI know what it does.\n\n544\n00:26:57.766 --> 00:27:00.483\nHeck, I probably set it\nup myself as an admin.\n\n545\n00:27:00.483 --> 00:27:03.501\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if you're in a network that you're\n\n546\n00:27:03.501 --> 00:27:08.850\nnot 100% familiar with, using that network\ndiscovery can be very, very helpful.\n\n547\n00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.156\nAnd so\nyou gotta remember to turn it on, and\n\n548\n00:27:11.156 --> 00:27:13.730\nthen don't forget they\nare profile specific.\n\n549\n00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.720\nSo I've seen that plenty of times,\nI'm like this should be working,\n\n550\n00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.020\nI turned it on,\neverything was working fine.\n\n551\n00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.850\nYou don't realize, oh,\nI've turned it on for the wrong profile.\n\n552\n00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.408\nSo make sure you get that right as well.\n\n553\n00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:23.970\n>> Yeah, and\n\n554\n00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:28.167\nthat's a great point because sometimes\nthe profile might not apply properly.\n\n555\n00:27:28.167 --> 00:27:31.673\nSo when you're doing that troubleshooting,\ngo check and see what profiles we implied.\n\n556\n00:27:31.673 --> 00:27:35.233\nRight?\nI showed you or you probably saw in there,\n\n557\n00:27:35.233 --> 00:27:40.510\nwhen I had that domain profile\nopen up it says Current Profile.\n\n558\n00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.010\nThat's telling me that it\ndetected a domain controller,\n\n559\n00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.750\nthis is the profile it applied.\n\n560\n00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.030\nIf I go in there and I see public is\nbeing applied, something is wrong.\n\n561\n00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.618\nIt didn't detect the domain controller,\nit didn't apply that profile properly.\n\n562\n00:27:51.618 --> 00:27:53.047\nA lot of times disabling and\n\n563\n00:27:53.047 --> 00:27:56.413\nenabling a network adaptor can\nget you through a mess like that.\n\n564\n00:27:56.413 --> 00:28:00.779\nSometimes you have to dive in and\ntry to re-categorize that network.\n\n565\n00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:03.590\nSo a couple things to think about\nwhen you're troubleshooting.\n\n566\n00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:04.402\n>> That's right.\n\n567\n00:28:04.402 --> 00:28:07.690\nAll right Mike we've gone through a lot of\nnetwork security stuff here in this new\n\n568\n00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:08.740\nWindows 10 operating system.\n\n569\n00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.630\nHave we missed anything for\nthis objective?\n\n570\n00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:11.268\n>> I don't think so.\n\n571\n00:28:11.268 --> 00:28:11.909\n>> All right.\n\n572\n00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:12.522\n>> I think we've covered them all.\n\n573\n00:28:12.522 --> 00:28:14.540\n>> Well hopefully you guys\nhave enjoyed this episode.\n\n574\n00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.890\nThank you for watching.\n\n575\n00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.750\nSigning off for ITProTv,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n576\n00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.266\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n577\n00:28:19.266 --> 00:28:20.449\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n578\n00:28:20.449 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.870\nI'm your host Daniel Larry.\n\n4\n00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.750\nHere with me today, well guess what?\n\n5\n00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.700\nIt's Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.530\nHow's it going Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.680\n>> Oh, it's going great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.900\nI'm excited to be here cuz we've got\nour Windows 10 content coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.349\nAnd in this episode we're going to\ntake a little look at troubleshooting,\n\n10\n00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:31.673\nsomething we all love to do.\n\n11\n00:00:31.673 --> 00:00:35.131\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's something that we're gonna have to\n\n12\n00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:35.866\ndo all the time.\n\n13\n00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.869\nAnd so,\nwe're gonna look at troubleshooting, and\n\n14\n00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:40.940\nspecifically troubleshooting\nsome permission issues.\n\n15\n00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.090\n>> Yes, the dreaded permissions.\n\n16\n00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.398\nWhat do I do when someone calls up and\nsays, hey you know, I've been working in\n\n17\n00:00:47.398 --> 00:00:51.379\nHR for a while, I'm starting to do\na little more over here in research and\n\n18\n00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.020\ndevelopment, so\nI need access to their stuff?\n\n19\n00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.180\nOh, okay.\n\n20\n00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.890\nWell, that's gonna be an issue because\nthey are specifically delegated to only\n\n21\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.770\nreasearch and developement, so I'm gonna\nhave to add you to the permissions group.\n\n22\n00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.880\nI'm gonna have to go into NTFS and say,\nhey there's some permissions in here.\n\n23\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.290\nHow is it that I need to set these things\nso that this new person has access?\n\n24\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.775\nMaybe you got a new person, roles change,\nnew people come in, people leave out,\n\n25\n00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:19.830\nyou gotta revoke and add and\ndo all sorts of hunky, weird stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.827\nBut it's all about making sure that\nthe right people have the right access and\n\n27\n00:01:23.827 --> 00:01:27.763\nthe wrong people don't have the access,\nthe access of release privilege,\n\n28\n00:01:27.763 --> 00:01:28.947\nI think it's called?\n\n29\n00:01:28.947 --> 00:01:29.974\n>> Principal of Least?\n\n30\n00:01:29.974 --> 00:01:31.470\n>> Yes, Principle of Least Privilege,\nthat's it.\n\n31\n00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.900\nThat's what we're looking at today.\n\n32\n00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.470\nHow can we set these things up correctly\nso that that actually applies?\n\n33\n00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.150\nMike, you're gonna help us\nout with that today, right?\n\n34\n00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.200\n>> I sure am gonna try.\n\n35\n00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.640\nYou know, when it comes to managing\npermissions, as Daniel said,\n\n36\n00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.610\nit can be a very complex thing.\n\n37\n00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.770\nIt takes a lot of planning and\nit's something that gets,\n\n38\n00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.130\nusually in an enterprise environment,\ngets developed over time here.\n\n39\n00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.450\nWe've come up with a plan, a strategy, and\n\n40\n00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.640\nwe're gonna follow Microsoft's\nbest practices more than likely.\n\n41\n00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.300\nAnd that means following\nsomething known as a AGDLP,\n\n42\n00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.680\nwhich is where we put our\naccounts into our global groups,\n\n43\n00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.500\nwhich go into domain local groups,\nwhich are given access to the resource.\n\n44\n00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.040\nFor this exam,\nI think we did talk about that,\n\n45\n00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.790\nin some of our other episodes\nwhere we went over permissions.\n\n46\n00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.260\nReally, we covered that pretty\ngood in the server level classes.\n\n47\n00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.560\nBut it's all about assigning permissions,\nand really, what I want to stress here is\n\n48\n00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.170\nthat we're typically assigning permissions\nto groups, not to individual users.\n\n49\n00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.150\nSo when were troubleshooting,\nwe're doing a couple things.\n\n50\n00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.750\nOne, we're making sure that the user\nis in the appropriate group, right?\n\n51\n00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.610\nBecause, we've had HR people for\nyears, since the business was opened.\n\n52\n00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.690\nThe HR people have access to that folder,\nfor example,\n\n53\n00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.140\nthat they're supposed to have access to.\n\n54\n00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.420\nWe hire a new HR person,\nthey can't get access.\n\n55\n00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.970\nWell, what could be the problem?\n\n56\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.196\nWell, most likely if all the other\nHR people can still access it and\n\n57\n00:02:49.196 --> 00:02:50.349\nthe new person can't,\n\n58\n00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.053\nthat means that they haven't been put\ninto the correct groups yet, right?\n\n59\n00:02:54.053 --> 00:02:57.449\nThey haven't been added to the group\nthat gives them the permissions over\n\n60\n00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:58.560\nthe resource.\n\n61\n00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.680\nSo that's how a lot of the troubleshooting\nis verifying group membership\n\n62\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.932\non a user account.\n\n63\n00:03:03.932 --> 00:03:07.990\nAnd a simple command you can do like,\nlet's take look at my screen here.\n\n64\n00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.099\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open\nup a Windows Explorer and we'll just\n\n65\n00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.840\nkinda walk through some of the steps I\nwould use if I was troubleshooting access.\n\n66\n00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.704\nSo, I'm logged on I believe\nhere as Danielsan, and I am.\n\n67\n00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:24.740\nThere we go.\n\n68\n00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.255\nCuz he shared his password with me.\n\n69\n00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:28.130\n[LAUGH]\n>> I leave it underneath my keyboard\n\n70\n00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.890\non a sticky note,\nthat way I don't forget it.\n\n71\n00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.962\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly, I try to teach\nthese guys but they don't listen.\n\n72\n00:03:34.962 --> 00:03:37.054\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n73\n00:03:37.054 --> 00:03:42.425\nI'm gonna connect over to SBR01/docs,\nall right.\n\n74\n00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:47.040\nAnd oh no, I get the dreaded\ncannot access the resource, right?\n\n75\n00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.060\nContact your network\nadministrator to request access.\n\n76\n00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.800\n>> Now, Mike, this could be just\na straight up network issue, right?\n\n77\n00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.690\n>> Yes.\n>> If the network is busted and\n\n78\n00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.645\nthey're not able to access\nit through the network,\n\n79\n00:03:56.645 --> 00:03:58.140\nthey're gonna get the same kind of error.\n\n80\n00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.110\nBut if you do take a look at that and\nyou realize the network's humming and\n\n81\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.140\ndrumming, then we're\nmoving into permissions.\n\n82\n00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.680\n>> Absolutely.\n\n83\n00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.550\nWhat we could do if we thought it was\na network error, one of the first things\n\n84\n00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.910\nwe might do is pop open a Command Prompt\nand see if we couldn't ping svr01.\n\n85\n00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.010\nAnd I believe this firewall is\nactually not gonna allow pings, but\n\n86\n00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.890\nI'll get a request timed out instead of\na general failure or something like that.\n\n87\n00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.340\nSo that's a good indication that there's\nprobably a firewall blocking those pings,\n\n88\n00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.840\nbut I am talking to it.\n\n89\n00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.235\nAnd in most corporate environments,\nPing is usually turned on so\n\n90\n00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:33.240\nthat I can do that network\nconnectivity test.\n\n91\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.400\nSo that'd be a great first step,\nmake sure the server is reachable.\n\n92\n00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.720\nAfter that what I might to do,\ncuz I'm going across the network\n\n93\n00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.210\nto gain access to this resource,\nI'm using a UNC path.\n\n94\n00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.720\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nlet's go over to the server itself and\n\n95\n00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.270\nsee what's going on here.\n\n96\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.855\nIf I open up File Explorer and\nI find that Docs folder,\n\n97\n00:04:53.855 --> 00:04:58.040\nthen I can pull up its Properties,\nand go over to the Sharing tab.\n\n98\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.490\nAnd I can see that it is shared out,\n\n99\n00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.803\nso that's a good sign, you know, at least\nit should be available to the network.\n\n100\n00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:09.050\nIf I click on Advanced Sharing, and then\nPermissions, I'll see that the Executives\n\n101\n00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.680\ngroup has permissions, but I don't believe\nDaniel is in the Executives group.\n\n102\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.920\nLet's go check and see.\n\n103\n00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.690\nA command that we should be familiar with,\nif I open up another Command Prompt,\n\n104\n00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.506\nI can type in whoamI/groups.\n\n105\n00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:29.300\nAnd if I look through this, I'll see\nthat Daniel is in the Host group, but\n\n106\n00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.870\nnowhere in here is it gonna show\nthat he's in the Executives group.\n\n107\n00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.960\nSo that's my first problem, right?\n\n108\n00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.060\nDaniel's not in that list or any of the\ngroups that he belongs to is in that list.\n\n109\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.020\nSo let's see if we can fix that.\n\n110\n00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.005\nWe'll flip back over here to\nthe resource and I'll click Add.\n\n111\n00:05:45.005 --> 00:05:48.710\nAnd somehow, you know, maybe something\ngot removed accidentally, or\n\n112\n00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.990\nthis is a new folder that got created and\nshared, and\n\n113\n00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.650\nthey forgot to add the Host group to it,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n114\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.670\nWe'll add the Host group,\nand we'll go ahead and\n\n115\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.700\ngive him full control,\nbecause we like our host.\n\n116\n00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.262\nWe trust our hosts around here.\n\n117\n00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:02.827\n>> Stupid.\n\n118\n00:06:02.827 --> 00:06:04.260\n>> Silly, silly.\n\n119\n00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.970\n>> That guy's crazy.\n\n120\n00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.200\n>> All right, so now it's shared out and\nthe hosts have permission, so\n\n121\n00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.968\nwe're gonna flip back over here to\nDaniel's screen and we're gonna type\n\n122\n00:06:12.968 --> 00:06:17.860\nin \\\\svr01\\docs.\n\n123\n00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.670\nWell, son of a gun, still no access.\n\n124\n00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.342\nWhat the heck?\n\n125\n00:06:21.342 --> 00:06:24.642\n>> Well now, Mike,\nwe just saw you put in the correct group.\n\n126\n00:06:24.642 --> 00:06:27.958\nTo say even full control over this,\nover the share permissions,\n\n127\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.130\namd accessing it through a share.\n\n128\n00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.580\nThe hack is the problem?\n\n129\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.014\n>> Yeah, well, we're gonna have\nto go find out, aren't we?\n\n130\n00:06:33.014 --> 00:06:33.520\n>> We are.\n\n131\n00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.460\n>> Let's go see what's going on.\n\n132\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.160\nIf we flip back over here to the resource,\nand we pull up its permissions,\n\n133\n00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.877\nthere's a couple of ways you could go\nabout trying to troubleshoot this.\n\n134\n00:06:42.877 --> 00:06:47.533\nI, personally, I'm a little old school,\nso I might go directly over here to\n\n135\n00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:51.850\nthese tabs and like we just did,\nlook at those share permissions.\n\n136\n00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.210\nBecause if you don't have share\npermissions you can't reach out and\n\n137\n00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.330\nget to the network or\nget to the resource across the network.\n\n138\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.710\nWell I can see Host has access,\nfull control, as Daniel said.\n\n139\n00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.060\nAnd he's in that Host group so\nwe should be good to go there.\n\n140\n00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.660\nThe next thing I might do is go\nover to the Security tab and\n\n141\n00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.820\nlook at my NTFS permissions.\n\n142\n00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.620\nAnd, lo and behold, Creator,\nOwner, System, Administrators.\n\n143\n00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.620\nNone of which Daniel belongs to, right?\n\n144\n00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.510\nAnd, this is a key point.\n\n145\n00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.910\nWhen we look at accessing\nresources across the network, yes,\n\n146\n00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.160\nyou need share permissions to\nreach out to that UNC path.\n\n147\n00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.270\nYou still need the appropriate\nNTFS permissions\n\n148\n00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.760\nto be able to connect to the resource.\n\n149\n00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.460\nRemember, share permissions are only\nchecked when you access the resource\n\n150\n00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.400\nas a share.\n\n151\n00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.664\nIn other words, when I use a UNC path or\na map network drive,\n\n152\n00:07:37.664 --> 00:07:40.325\nwhen I'm going across the network.\n\n153\n00:07:40.325 --> 00:07:44.458\nNTFS permissions are always checked,\nwhether I'm going across the network or\n\n154\n00:07:44.458 --> 00:07:48.469\nwhether I'm actually sitting at the\nmachine and interactively logged on and\n\n155\n00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:52.435\nopening up File Explorer and\ndouble-clicking on it that way.\n\n156\n00:07:52.435 --> 00:07:54.702\nNTFS permissions are always checked so\n\n157\n00:07:54.702 --> 00:07:59.107\nyou can't get away without having NTFS\npermission to access the resource.\n\n158\n00:07:59.107 --> 00:08:01.891\nNow another tool I could\nuse here at this point.\n\n159\n00:08:01.891 --> 00:08:06.695\nIf I go into Advanced, there's my good,\nold Effective access tab, all right?\n\n160\n00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:10.170\nAnd so let's do that one more time to\nmake sure you guys saw where I went.\n\n161\n00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:14.130\nI'm on the properties of the resource,\nI'm on that Security tab, and\n\n162\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.620\nI click Advanced.\n\n163\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.260\nAnd then I'm gonna click\non Effective Access.\n\n164\n00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.863\nAnd all I'm gonna do\nis select Daniel here.\n\n165\n00:08:21.778 --> 00:08:24.880\nAll right,\nsee what kind of permissions he has.\n\n166\n00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.230\nAnd I'll look at View effective access.\n\n167\n00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.410\nAnd sure enough,\nhe does not have any access.\n\n168\n00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.620\nNow something we've gotta remember\nabout this particular dialog box.\n\n169\n00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.290\nThis is working with my NTFS permissions.\n\n170\n00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.990\nIt will look at all the groups\nthat Daniel belongs to.\n\n171\n00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.112\nIt'll add them all up,\nit'll take the denies into effect if there\n\n172\n00:08:42.112 --> 00:08:45.110\nare any assigned to those groups and\nall that good stuff.\n\n173\n00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.440\nIt will not troubleshoot your\nshare permissions, all right?\n\n174\n00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.170\nThis only looks at the NTFS permissions,\nso you might come in here\n\n175\n00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.570\nIf the situation were reversed, and\nwe had fixed the NTFS first, and\n\n176\n00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:01.110\nit looked green here, and then the user\nsays, I still can't access that resource.\n\n177\n00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.090\nWell, I need to go back and\ntroubleshoot share permissions.\n\n178\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.510\nThey're not gonna show up here.\n\n179\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.680\nReally kind of got to manually check\nthose share permissions, all right?\n\n180\n00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.920\nYou can also add a group here as well.\n\n181\n00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.370\nI think it'll let me do a group.\n\n182\n00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.010\nLet's double check before\nI steer you wrong.\n\n183\n00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.790\nYeah, so we could do a group and\nI could see Hosts has no access.\n\n184\n00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.700\nSo even though Daniel's in that group,\nno access to that resource.\n\n185\n00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.050\nSo let's fix it.\n\n186\n00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.630\nWe'll go over to our Security tab,\nwe'll click Edit, and we'll click Add.\n\n187\n00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.880\nWe'll find that host group.\n\n188\n00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.220\nAnd I'll go ahead and give them,\nsay, modify permissions over that.\n\n189\n00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.560\nWe'll click OK and Close.\n\n190\n00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.040\nAnd we'll test it one more time.\n\n191\n00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:46.374\nIf we go back over here and\nwe do a \\\\svr01\\docs and\n\n192\n00:09:46.374 --> 00:09:49.980\nsure enough, now I'm in.\n\n193\n00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.950\nSo we had to check those share permissions\nto make sure I could reach out\n\n194\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.360\nacross the network and\nget access to the resource.\n\n195\n00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.540\nWe also had to check the NTFS permissions\nto make sure that it was allowing me\n\n196\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.610\naccess to that resource, and\nnow at this point, Daniel can come in, and\n\n197\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.972\nhe can make some new show notes here.\n\n198\n00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:11.620\nHe can modify an existing file\nsince he has permissions,\n\n199\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.159\nwe'll say NTFS troubleshooting.\n\n200\n00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:20.890\nYeah, just so we can see we can make a\nchange, and everything's good to go there.\n\n201\n00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.180\nSo, at this point we've really fixed\nour problem with the share and\n\n202\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.650\nthe NTFS permissions.\n\n203\n00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.770\nIf we come back over here, and\n\n204\n00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.235\nwe double check on it just to\nshow you how this would look now.\n\n205\n00:10:30.235 --> 00:10:35.080\nI go back into that same\nEffective access tab, and\n\n206\n00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.528\nI grab hosts, or Daniel,\nit wouldn't really matter.\n\n207\n00:10:37.528 --> 00:10:42.690\nView effective access, and sure enough,\n\n208\n00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.720\nhe has modified permission, so\nat this point, everything is looking good.\n\n209\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.640\n>> Now, Mike, I'm sitting here,\nlooking at this, and\n\n210\n00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.570\nI know because we talked about when\nwe went over the NTFS permissions,\n\n211\n00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:57.710\nthat the most restrictive is\nwhat works with share and NTFS.\n\n212\n00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.340\nIt's not like it is if it's just\nthe NTFS where the least restrictive is-\n\n213\n00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.770\n>> That's absolutely right.\n\n214\n00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.960\nNTFS permissions are cumulative.\n\n215\n00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.940\nIf I belong to two different groups,\n\n216\n00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.810\nI get to add up all the permissions\nthat I get from those groups.\n\n217\n00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:18.120\nIn other words, if I was in Hosts and they\nhad read permission, and I was also in\n\n218\n00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.280\nProducers, and they had write permission,\nsince I'm in both groups,\n\n219\n00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.350\nI get to add up all the permissions and\nI would get read and write at that case.\n\n220\n00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.880\nWhen you combine share and NTFS, though,\nwhen you go across the network to get\n\n221\n00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.020\nthe resource, it's whichever\none is the most restrictive.\n\n222\n00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:38.690\nSo if I had share read, right,\nbut I had NTFS full control,\n\n223\n00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.970\nwell, if I go across the network to get\nto that resource, I'm gonna end up with\n\n224\n00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.660\nread permission because read is\nmore restrictive than full control.\n\n225\n00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.390\nBut if I run over to the machine,\nsit down,\n\n226\n00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:51.310\nand log on, and double-click on\nthat folder interactively, share\n\n227\n00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.720\npermissions aren't being checked because\nI'm not accessing it across the network.\n\n228\n00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.600\nSo now I'd have full control\nif I was interactive, but\n\n229\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.310\nread if I was reaching\nout across the network.\n\n230\n00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.530\n>> Yeah, that's a really good point.\n\n231\n00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.100\nThat's something that you\nneed to understand because\n\n232\n00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.170\nI almost guarantee you they're gonna\ntest you on that type of knowledge.\n\n233\n00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.434\nSo make sure that you get those two\nstraight in your head that when you\n\n234\n00:12:10.434 --> 00:12:12.565\nhave just NTFS, it's least restrictive.\n\n235\n00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:16.830\nIf you're going across a network\nit's what's most restrictive.\n\n236\n00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.810\nDon actually gave me a nice\nlittle tip on that for\n\n237\n00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.440\nwhen you're actually setting\nthis up in real life.\n\n238\n00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.080\nThe best thing to do is just give full\ncontrol over those share permissions, and\n\n239\n00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:30.120\nthen use NTFS to fine-tune the permissions\nto what you actually need it to be.\n\n240\n00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.420\nThat way you're not trying to get\nconfused, or oh, is this gonna trump that,\n\n241\n00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.021\nand this, that, and the other, and then\nof course that effective permissions tab,\n\n242\n00:12:37.021 --> 00:12:39.950\nvery, very helpful because sometimes\nyou're looking at a group.\n\n243\n00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.470\nMaybe Mike's looking at\na group that I'm in and\n\n244\n00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.470\nlooking at the effective permissions, but\nI'm still not able to access a resource.\n\n245\n00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.680\nWell, I might be running\ninto that share versus NTFS.\n\n246\n00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.950\nMaybe I'm in a group that's restricting,\n\n247\n00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.550\nanother group that's\nrestricting my access.\n\n248\n00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:59.640\nYou can use that effective permissions to\nsee wow, you're not getting access there.\n\n249\n00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.950\nI need to troubleshoot your groups and\nsee where the problem is coming from.\n\n250\n00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.260\nIt can be very, very helpful.\n\n251\n00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.370\n>> Absolutely.\n\n252\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.610\nAnother thing that we might be doing,\nlike in that case we were troubleshooting\n\n253\n00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:12.600\nthe fact that Daniel didn't have the\npermissions that he was supposed to have.\n\n254\n00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.960\nThe opposite can be true as well.\n\n255\n00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.140\nLike what if somebody's\ngetting too many permissions?\n\n256\n00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.290\nWe need to figure out how we can prevent\nthat or how we can fix that problem.\n\n257\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.410\nFor example, I'm okay with\nDaniel going into Show Notes and\n\n258\n00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.480\nbeing able to make new files,\nnew folders, or whatever it is.\n\n259\n00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.565\nSo if you can see Daniel coming here, 698\nmaybe or something, and he can obviously\n\n260\n00:13:33.565 --> 00:13:37.560\nwrite and make new files, we gave him\nmodified permissions, that makes sense.\n\n261\n00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.670\nWe're going back out here to Docs and\ninto Policies and\n\n262\n00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.420\nthese are some of my company policies.\n\n263\n00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.240\nSo I want Daniel to be able\nto get access to them, but\n\n264\n00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:50.410\nI don't need him being able to go in\nhere and make changes to them, right?\n\n265\n00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:54.780\nBut because we assigned those\npermissions at the Docs folder level,\n\n266\n00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.160\nthey're inheriting down to both\nof these folders inside there and\n\n267\n00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.970\ntherefore all of the full\nfiles inside those folders.\n\n268\n00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.460\nSo what we need to do in a case like this,\nwe come back over to the resource,\n\n269\n00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:10.690\nwe can look at that Policies folder for\nexample, then go to Properties,\n\n270\n00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:16.280\nand I go into Security, and I can see sure\nenough, the hosts have modify permission.\n\n271\n00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.375\nAll right,\nwell let's take that away from them.\n\n272\n00:14:18.375 --> 00:14:22.495\nI click Edit, I go to Host,\nand I try to uncheck it.\n\n273\n00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:24.125\nAnd I cannot, right?\n\n274\n00:14:24.125 --> 00:14:24.695\nBecause remember,\n\n275\n00:14:24.695 --> 00:14:28.995\nthese are inherited permissions,\nI cannot modify the inherited permissions.\n\n276\n00:14:28.995 --> 00:14:32.620\nI have to go to the source where\nthey're being inherited from, and\n\n277\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.070\nmake the change there.\n\n278\n00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.600\nBut if I do that, then it's gonna affect\nthe show notes folder as well, right?\n\n279\n00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.700\nBecause the permissions were set at\nthe top level of the Docs folder, and\n\n280\n00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.260\nthey're going to inherit down\nto both Policies and Show Notes.\n\n281\n00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.850\nAnd I don't want to change his permissions\non Show Notes, just on Policies.\n\n282\n00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.480\nSo I've got a couple of options.\n\n283\n00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.870\nI could just assign him\nthe opposite permission, right?\n\n284\n00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:59.280\nBut the problem is the way that\npermissions build, if I try to take away\n\n285\n00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:04.420\nhis modify permission, that's gonna\ntake away read as well, right?\n\n286\n00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:09.110\nRemember, modify builds, and\ndenies are going to override my allows.\n\n287\n00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.420\nYou've denied everything at this point,\nand that's not what I want to do.\n\n288\n00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.260\nSo let me uncheck that.\n\n289\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.210\nAnd let's find a better way to do this.\n\n290\n00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:22.890\nSo I'll just cancel that out of that,\nmake sure those changes don't take effect.\n\n291\n00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:26.190\nSo what we're gonna do is I'm\ngonna click Advanced, and\n\n292\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:31.030\nI can see that the hosts are getting\nmodify permission from the parent object,\n\n293\n00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.340\nall right, but I don't wanna change\nthem there because of what I just said.\n\n294\n00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.980\nSo we're gonna disable inheritance.\n\n295\n00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.500\nWe're gonna say, look, don't inherit\nfrom the parent object anymore.\n\n296\n00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.650\nEasy enough, disable inheritance.\n\n297\n00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:42.740\nNow when I do that,\n\n298\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.790\nwhat do I wanna do with the currently\ninherited permissions, right?\n\n299\n00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:50.610\nCuz all these permissions here were\ninherited from the parent object that I'm\n\n300\n00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.610\ngetting ready to turn off inheritance.\n\n301\n00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.710\nSo say well look,\nI've already inherited these permissions.\n\n302\n00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:57.360\nThat's a property of NTFS.\n\n303\n00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.708\nI mean, as soon as I made that folder,\nit inherited those permissions.\n\n304\n00:16:00.708 --> 00:16:03.354\nSo it wasn't like I could hurry up and\nblock it, right, or\n\n305\n00:16:03.354 --> 00:16:04.821\nanything before it inherited.\n\n306\n00:16:04.821 --> 00:16:05.898\nI mean, that's instant.\n\n307\n00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:07.503\nSo, it gives me a choice.\n\n308\n00:16:07.503 --> 00:16:08.182\nIt says, well.\n\n309\n00:16:08.182 --> 00:16:08.994\nWhat do you want to do?\n\n310\n00:16:08.994 --> 00:16:11.400\nConvert those into explicit permissions.\n\n311\n00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.880\nExplicit permissions would\nbe the black check mark.\n\n312\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.580\nI could make changes to them.\n\n313\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.940\nOr remove everything and\nstart with a clean slate.\n\n314\n00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.870\nWhen I look at this list,\n\n315\n00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:23.765\nI see things like system administrators,\ncreator, owner.\n\n316\n00:16:23.765 --> 00:16:26.125\nI don't necessarily want to\ntake away those permissions.\n\n317\n00:16:26.125 --> 00:16:28.645\nThat could effect\nthe functionality of my machine or\n\n318\n00:16:28.645 --> 00:16:32.915\nsome program, or other groups that were\nsupposed to have those permissions, right,\n\n319\n00:16:32.915 --> 00:16:34.410\nif there were other groups in there.\n\n320\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.370\nSo, a lot of times that's\nnot the best choice.\n\n321\n00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.340\nUsually, the safest one to do,\nis just to convert them.\n\n322\n00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.490\nNow look, they're no longer\nbeing inherited from anywhere.\n\n323\n00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.060\nThe system still has its permissions.\n\n324\n00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.330\nI didn't mess up the applications, or the\noperating system or anything like that.\n\n325\n00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.730\nI click okay, and\nnow they're black check marks.\n\n326\n00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.060\nSo, I can click edit, and\nI can go to host, and\n\n327\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.160\nI can take away that modify permission,\nand I can take away that write permission.\n\n328\n00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.690\nThen I can click OK.\n\n329\n00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.950\nSo now they just have read,\nlist, read, and execute.\n\n330\n00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.230\nThen I click OK, and\nthat's gonna inherit down.\n\n331\n00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.179\nJust cuz I blocked inheritance\nat the policies level, so\n\n332\n00:17:11.179 --> 00:17:15.482\nnothing from above policies is inheriting\ndown, but that doesn't change the fact\n\n333\n00:17:15.482 --> 00:17:19.054\nthat these two files inside there,\nare getting those permissions.\n\n334\n00:17:19.054 --> 00:17:22.277\nLike, if we go to the properties of hosts,\n\n335\n00:17:22.277 --> 00:17:26.495\nI can see that hosts have just read and\nexecute, right.\n\n336\n00:17:26.495 --> 00:17:28.353\nSo, it doesn't stop inheritance.\n\n337\n00:17:28.353 --> 00:17:33.150\nNow that I've changed the inheritance\nproperty on the policies folder itself,\n\n338\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:37.243\nthat doesn't stop inheritance\nfrom occurring below that, right,\n\n339\n00:17:37.243 --> 00:17:39.530\nas I set those permissions.\n\n340\n00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:40.070\nNow, I could.\n\n341\n00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:43.060\nI mean, I could block inheritance\non an individual file, as well.\n\n342\n00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:48.130\nIf I wanted Daniel to be able to\nnot change anything except for\n\n343\n00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.490\nthe host policy, I could go to the host\npolicy, block inheritance, and\n\n344\n00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.145\ngive him modified permission\nover that individual file.\n\n345\n00:17:55.145 --> 00:17:57.140\nSo, being able to work\nwith these permissions,\n\n346\n00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.730\nunderstanding the way inheritance works.\n\n347\n00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.620\nWhat happens when I block inheritance?\n\n348\n00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.165\nWhat happens when I convert those\nover to explicit permissions, and\n\n349\n00:18:05.165 --> 00:18:06.205\nmake those changes.\n\n350\n00:18:06.205 --> 00:18:09.565\nAnd the fact that inheritance still\noccurs at that level and below,\n\n351\n00:18:09.565 --> 00:18:13.150\nthose are all things we can really use\nwhen we're troubleshooting permissions.\n\n352\n00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:13.885\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now, Mike,\n\n353\n00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:17.725\nI know it's really really tempting to\nstart doing exactly what you're doing\n\n354\n00:18:17.725 --> 00:18:20.910\non a lot of files, but\nit's really not the best practice.\n\n355\n00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.330\nThis is something for special occasions.\n\n356\n00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.796\nI can't really move\nthese files out of here.\n\n357\n00:18:25.796 --> 00:18:29.081\nI need to change those permissions,\nblock that inheritance, do that.\n\n358\n00:18:29.081 --> 00:18:33.210\nBut as a rule, we try to stay away\nfrom doing it that way, right?\n\n359\n00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.100\n>> We really do.\n\n360\n00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.210\nWe don't want to do that\nall over the place.\n\n361\n00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:40.750\nIf anything, you can make upper level\nfolders that contain everything\n\n362\n00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.720\nthat you need to make those changes to.\n\n363\n00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.300\nThere's nothing wrong with it.\n\n364\n00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.760\nIt'll still work fine, but\nwhen it comes to troubleshooting, and\n\n365\n00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.200\nyou've got inheritance block here and\nthere and scattered around,\n\n366\n00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.820\nit can be really difficult to figure\nout what the heck is going on.\n\n367\n00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.810\nSo, have a good game plan coming into it,\nI think is the biggest thing.\n\n368\n00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.830\nAnd use that effective access tab,\n\n369\n00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.480\nthat showed me whether the permissions\nwere being inherited or not.\n\n370\n00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.472\nAnd that's a great starting\npoint to figure out,\n\n371\n00:19:07.472 --> 00:19:10.660\nwell, do I need to go back up to\nthat parent object to make changes?\n\n372\n00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.730\nWhat other folders is that gonna effect,\nthings like that.\n\n373\n00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.050\nSo using the tools that\nMicrosoft gives us,\n\n374\n00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.020\nwe can do a pretty good job of\ntroubleshooting permissions.\n\n375\n00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.475\n>> Yeah, you don't wanna waste your time\nspending hours on end trying to figure\n\n376\n00:19:21.475 --> 00:19:25.060\nout what the heck is going wrong, and\nyou just accidentally forgot to look\n\n377\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.730\nat that as effective permissions area, cuz\nI don't know anyone that's ever done that.\n\n378\n00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:29.778\nI sure as heck haven't, Mike.\n\n379\n00:19:29.778 --> 00:19:30.710\n>> No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n380\n00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:31.980\n>> [LAUGH] It is.\n\n381\n00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.730\nIt's super easy to do.\n\n382\n00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.750\nYou forget that the thing even exists.\n\n383\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.700\nAnd you're going why isn't this working?\n\n384\n00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.670\nAll you had to do was check\nthe affected permission.\n\n385\n00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.270\nCheck whether or\nnot you're blocking inheritance.\n\n386\n00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.840\nOh yeah, I totally forgot I did that.\n\n387\n00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.340\nSo if you are gonna do that kind of stuff,\ngood idea to keep good documentation of\n\n388\n00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.640\nthat or, like Mike said,\njust have a really good game plan and\n\n389\n00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.248\nbe as organized as possible when\nit comes to these structures.\n\n390\n00:19:54.248 --> 00:19:56.530\n>> And, that whoami command, I think,\n\n391\n00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.810\nis another one that get's\noverlooked a lot of times.\n\n392\n00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:02.020\nEven when you look at\nMicrosoft documentation they\n\n393\n00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.620\nteach you to figure out what\ngroups Daniel belongs to.\n\n394\n00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.529\nI can go into his user account properties,\nand I can click on member of, and\n\n395\n00:20:08.529 --> 00:20:12.270\nI can see what he belongs to, but\nthen there's nested groups, right?\n\n396\n00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.845\nSo, I gotta double click on each one\nof those groups, and go in there and\n\n397\n00:20:15.845 --> 00:20:19.975\nsee what they're nested in, to really\nfigure out what groups Daniel belongs to.\n\n398\n00:20:19.975 --> 00:20:22.903\nThere's not a really easy way to do that,\nsometimes,\n\n399\n00:20:22.903 --> 00:20:26.726\nwhen we follow our strategies,\nand we use those nested groups.\n\n400\n00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:30.058\nSo, that whoami/groups is a great command,\n\n401\n00:20:30.058 --> 00:20:33.560\nI think, that should be in your belt of\ntools you can use, cuz it's quick and\n\n402\n00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.140\neasy, right there from the command prompt,\nand you're good to go.\n\n403\n00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.080\n>> That's right.\n\n404\n00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.930\nExcellent words of wisdom by Mr.\nMike Roderick.\n\n405\n00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.985\nFollow him, tattoo him on\nyour forehead if you have to.\n\n406\n00:20:41.985 --> 00:20:44.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz it will keep you out of the weeds.\n\n407\n00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.645\n>> As long as you do it backwards so\nyou can see them in the mirror.\n\n408\n00:20:47.645 --> 00:20:48.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right Mike,\n\n409\n00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.100\nwhat else do we need to know about access?\n\n410\n00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.430\n>> The next thing I want to take a look\nat is actually a pretty cool policy, and\n\n411\n00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:58.570\nit's one that I see being implemented\nmore and more in a corporate environment,\n\n412\n00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:02.090\nand that is trying to\ncontrol removable media.\n\n413\n00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:06.650\nBecause we've heard all the horror\nstories about people stealing data,\n\n414\n00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:10.240\ncertain people within the government,\nor things like that.\n\n415\n00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.350\nAnyway, we need tighter control over that,\n\n416\n00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.080\nespecially if you're in a regulated\nindustry where you've got\n\n417\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.080\nto follow HIPAA or the payment card\nindustry, PCI, and things like that.\n\n418\n00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.260\nReally have to have tight control.\n\n419\n00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.800\nI don't want somebody coming in,\n\n420\n00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.140\nit's too easy to keep one of these\nlittle tiny thumb drives in my pocket.\n\n421\n00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.620\nBring it in, slap it in a computer, copy\ndata over, put it back in my pocket and\n\n422\n00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.560\nwalk out the door, and\nyou're none the wiser, right?\n\n423\n00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.520\nOr just users not realizing.\n\n424\n00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.290\nLike, I wanna work at this stuff at home,\nso\n\n425\n00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.980\nI'm just gonna copy it to a thumb\ndrive and take it with me.\n\n426\n00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:44.210\nAnd I go home and I can work on it,\nviolating every one of our policies,\n\n427\n00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.420\ncausing, that could be huge fines\nfrom HIPAA or other organizations.\n\n428\n00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.976\n>> You say this like it's a bad thing,\nMike.\n\n429\n00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:52.298\n>> [LAUGH] I know, right?\n>> [LAUGH] Well the user's not paying\n\n430\n00:21:52.298 --> 00:21:53.075\nit, right?\n\n431\n00:21:53.075 --> 00:21:53.575\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] They don't care.\n\n432\n00:21:53.575 --> 00:21:54.420\n>> [LAUGH] They're all right.\n\n433\n00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.180\nThey might get fired but\n\n434\n00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.705\nthey'll go get a job somewhere else.\n[LAUGH]\n\n435\n00:21:56.705 --> 00:21:58.195\n>> Until they're putting the bracelets\n\n436\n00:21:58.195 --> 00:21:58.885\non you, and\n\n437\n00:21:58.885 --> 00:22:00.645\nthey're going to the county hotel [LAUGH].\n>> Yeah.\n\n438\n00:22:00.645 --> 00:22:02.855\nSo, we really need to be able to block\n\n439\n00:22:02.855 --> 00:22:05.630\nthat.\nI know this is a client exam, so\n\n440\n00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.430\nwe really don't wanna dive too deep\ninto the group policy side of things.\n\n441\n00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:14.050\nBut I do wanna show you, at least,\nhow it looks at the user end,\n\n442\n00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.780\nand we'll take a look at the policies\nanyway, just to show you what's going on.\n\n443\n00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.920\nSo, what I've got here, again, I've got\nmy laptop opened up and I'm logged in.\n\n444\n00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.580\nLet's verify.\n\n445\n00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.450\nWe'll log in as Danielsan again, and\n\n446\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:29.360\nI've got my little thumb drive that I'm\njust gonna plug into my system here.\n\n447\n00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.300\nAnd well,\nlet me preface that with at this point,\n\n448\n00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.390\nwe should have access to the thumb drive,\nbut\n\n449\n00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:40.770\nI don't want Daniel to have right access\nto the thumb drive, or executable access.\n\n450\n00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.030\nIf you put something on there\nthat could be executed or run,\n\n451\n00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.670\nI don't want him doing that either.\n\n452\n00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.570\nHe should be able to read, and that's it.\n\n453\n00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:47.240\nSo let's find out.\n\n454\n00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.100\nWe're gonna plug this thumb drive in.\n\n455\n00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.730\nWe'll let Windows figure it out.\n\n456\n00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.240\nThere we go, it's recognized it.\n\n457\n00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.560\nIf I go into files here, sure enough\nDaniel can open up some stuff, and\n\n458\n00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.340\nhe can read it.\n\n459\n00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.739\nAnd somehow Edge is my default for pdf's.\n\n460\n00:22:59.739 --> 00:23:02.209\nI mean, [LAUGH] that's a great pdf reader.\n\n461\n00:23:02.209 --> 00:23:02.910\n>> [LAUGH] Oh yeah.\n\n462\n00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.230\n>> Sorry, Microsoft, my favorite.\n\n463\n00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.580\nLet's see if the ISO reads great.\n\n464\n00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.655\nWhat about writing?\n\n465\n00:23:07.655 --> 00:23:09.270\nUh-oh.\n\n466\n00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.800\nThat's no bueno, right?\n\n467\n00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.920\nHe is actually writing\nto this thumb drive.\n\n468\n00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:18.090\nIf I go back out here,\nthis is an executable, and\n\n469\n00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.940\nit sure looks like it's running.\n\n470\n00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.460\nThat's not good, either.\n\n471\n00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.140\nAll right?\n\n472\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:27.460\nSo, we'll just cancel that out, and we'll\ngo and troubleshoot what's going on here.\n\n473\n00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.285\n>> Don't block me, bro.\n\n474\n00:23:28.285 --> 00:23:29.935\n>> [LAUGH] Don't block me, bro.\n\n475\n00:23:29.935 --> 00:23:36.720\n[LAUGH] Alright, So where would I start if\nI was a help desk or a tier one support?\n\n476\n00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.950\nWell, I probably have good\ninformation from my second tier or\n\n477\n00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:42.440\nfrom my system admins that\nthere are policies in place,\n\n478\n00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.720\nthat are supposed to be\nblocking this type of access.\n\n479\n00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.560\nSo, the first thing I really need to do,\n\n480\n00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.930\nis verify that the policy's in place,\nright?\n\n481\n00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:50.270\nMake sure that they're not lying to me.\n\n482\n00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.120\nNo, they wouldn't lie to me, but\nmake sure nothing has gone wrong.\n\n483\n00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.238\nSo, I'm gonna open up a command prompt,\non this system here.\n\n484\n00:23:57.238 --> 00:24:00.224\nAnd you know what, I really don't\nneed administrative access, and\n\n485\n00:24:00.224 --> 00:24:01.417\nI don't feel like typing.\n\n486\n00:24:01.417 --> 00:24:03.488\nWe'll just open up a standard\ncommand prompt, and\n\n487\n00:24:03.488 --> 00:24:05.857\nlet me make this a little bit bigger for\nyou guys out there.\n\n488\n00:24:05.857 --> 00:24:08.013\nSo that we can see what\nthe heck's going on,\n\n489\n00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:10.440\ncuz I want you to see these results here.\n\n490\n00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.730\nSo I'll bump this up just a hair.\n\n491\n00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.141\nGive it a little,\nshould we go hacker green with this guy?\n\n492\n00:24:16.141 --> 00:24:17.168\n>> Hacker green's always my favorite.\n\n493\n00:24:17.168 --> 00:24:20.290\n>> All right, we'll go hacker green,\nsee how that shows up on screen there.\n\n494\n00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:21.560\nThere we go.\n\n495\n00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.937\nSo, what I'm going to do is\na command we should all be\n\n496\n00:24:25.937 --> 00:24:30.225\nfamiliar with at this point\nis gpresult space /r.\n\n497\n00:24:30.225 --> 00:24:31.408\nThat's gonna go ahead and\n\n498\n00:24:31.408 --> 00:24:34.510\ntake a look at what group\npolicies are being applied to me.\n\n499\n00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:39.360\nAnd if I take a look here, as far as my,\nand I've only got user setting.\n\n500\n00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.398\nSo, I really did need that\nadministrative prompt [LAUGH] And\n\n501\n00:24:42.398 --> 00:24:44.780\nI'm just gonna have to go back and\ndo that now.\n\n502\n00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.090\nSo let's do that.\n\n503\n00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:49.790\nRemember when you run gpresult as a user,\n\n504\n00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.830\nyou're only seeing policies applied\nto the user, not to the computer.\n\n505\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:59.327\nSo if you wanna see, both halves, the\ncomputer half and the user half of GPOs,\n\n506\n00:24:59.327 --> 00:25:02.339\nyou do need administrative\naccess on that machine.\n\n507\n00:25:02.339 --> 00:25:05.230\nSo let me open up that\nadministrative command prompt.\n\n508\n00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.860\nBump that up one more time so\nyou guys can see that a little bit better.\n\n509\n00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.010\nChange a little bit of color just so\nwe can be cool like Daniel.\n\n510\n00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.477\nDid my font size not go up?\n\n511\n00:25:16.477 --> 00:25:17.969\nMy old eyes are having\ntrouble seeing that Daniel.\n\n512\n00:25:17.969 --> 00:25:20.018\n>> [LAUGH] Well if you can't see it.\n\n513\n00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:23.507\n>> Yeah, there we go,\nI didn't change my font itself.\n\n514\n00:25:23.507 --> 00:25:24.349\nThere we go.\n\n515\n00:25:24.349 --> 00:25:28.972\nSo we'll do another gpresult /r, and\n\n516\n00:25:28.972 --> 00:25:32.061\nsee what we get this time.\n\n517\n00:25:32.061 --> 00:25:35.942\nAnd again I am not really worried\nabout the user half in this place,\n\n518\n00:25:35.942 --> 00:25:37.133\nin this situation.\n\n519\n00:25:37.133 --> 00:25:38.920\nIt's going to be a computer setting.\n\n520\n00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.790\nAnd I know, this is again something\nyou would have to know as an employee.\n\n521\n00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:44.990\nThey would have to teach you this.\n\n522\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.500\nYou would have a list of policies\nto double check and what have you.\n\n523\n00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.950\nAnd I know there should be a policy\nright here called removable media, and\n\n524\n00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.300\nit's not there.\n\n525\n00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:58.020\nSo that's why Daniel's able\nto write to this drive,\n\n526\n00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:02.380\nand execute from this drive,\nbecause the GPO itself is not in place.\n\n527\n00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.639\nI can also see here,\nlast time it was applied was 1:32:05.\n\n528\n00:26:06.639 --> 00:26:10.260\nIf I wanted to test,\nthen I could do a GP update.\n\n529\n00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:17.700\n/ force, and just go back and\nreapply policy.\n\n530\n00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.560\nTell it to, hey, go back and\napply policy again.\n\n531\n00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.460\nAnd what I'm gonna be looking for\nis that time and date.\n\n532\n00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:31.852\nSo if I look here, last was 9/25 at,\nwhere'd we go, 1:32:05.\n\n533\n00:26:31.852 --> 00:26:34.810\nAnd now, 9/25 at 1:12:52.\n\n534\n00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.336\nSo, know policy is being applied.\n\n535\n00:26:37.336 --> 00:26:39.320\nSo that just doing that little thing,\n\n536\n00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.140\nI've tested my network connectivity\nto the domain controller,\n\n537\n00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.770\nI know that it's retrieving policy,\nI know that it's applying policy.\n\n538\n00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.400\nI'm not seeing any errors.\n\n539\n00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.740\nComputer policy updated successfully.\n\n540\n00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.290\nUser policy updated successfully.\n\n541\n00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.590\nAnd in fact, let's do another gpresult.\n\n542\n00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.972\nI think I was actually looking\nat the old results there.\n\n543\n00:26:56.972 --> 00:27:05.330\ngpresults /r, and there we'll take a look\nat that time stamp and now we're at 2:06.\n\n544\n00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.580\nSo we can see they are being applied,\neverything is good.\n\n545\n00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.078\nAgain, if you get the success messages\nyou know everything's good there.\n\n546\n00:27:12.078 --> 00:27:13.203\nSo the problem isn't on the client end.\n\n547\n00:27:13.203 --> 00:27:16.370\nThe problem isn't on\nthe network connectivity part.\n\n548\n00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.280\nThat means we need to jump\nover to the domain controller.\n\n549\n00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.083\nWe need to check out group policy.\n\n550\n00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:24.163\nThis might be the point where you\nescalate it up to the next level, or\n\n551\n00:27:24.163 --> 00:27:28.240\nyou might be all of IT and\nyou've got to do the whole thing.\n\n552\n00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.040\nSo let's go check it out here.\n\n553\n00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.320\n>> Now, Mike, with this group policy,\n\n554\n00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.290\nis it the same in the local\ngroup policy as well?\n\n555\n00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.111\nSo if you have a stand alone kiosk in\nthe lobby, or something like that,\n\n556\n00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:38.280\nyou can set this as well?\n\n557\n00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.079\nYou know, that's a good question.\n\n558\n00:27:39.079 --> 00:27:42.081\nAs far as the policy goes, yes,\nyou have a local policy that\n\n559\n00:27:42.081 --> 00:27:46.430\naffects that one machine whether it's\na kiosk or a workgroup or what have you.\n\n560\n00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:47.930\nThe settings, we'll have to verify this.\n\n561\n00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:48.520\nThat's a good question.\n\n562\n00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.690\nWe'll go in and look.\n\n563\n00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:53.080\nAs soon as we get done here we'll make\nsure the same setting is available\n\n564\n00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.930\nin that local policy if you wanted\nto do this on a one-off machine.\n\n565\n00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:01.800\nSo what I'm looking at here\nis my group policy objects.\n\n566\n00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.840\nAnd I can see.\n\n567\n00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.420\nWhat's a good way to show you this?\n\n568\n00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:12.310\nRemoval media is linked to the contractors\nOU, but not linked to the employees OU.\n\n569\n00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:13.966\nAnd I know that Daniel's employee.\n\n570\n00:28:13.966 --> 00:28:16.600\nHis user account's in that employee's OU,\nso\n\n571\n00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.050\ntherefore it's not going to be affecting,\nor it's not going to be in place.\n\n572\n00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:22.510\nSo we're going to link\nthat policy real quick.\n\n573\n00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:26.568\nAnd again, like I said, this might be\nsomething that you're not able to do.\n\n574\n00:28:26.568 --> 00:28:29.660\nIt's a good kind of quick peak\nat what group policy is like.\n\n575\n00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.220\nYou might have to go to the admin and say,\n\n576\n00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.270\nhey, can you verify that\nthe policy is there?\n\n577\n00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.620\nYou've already done what you could do.\n\n578\n00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.930\nYou ran gpresult and\nyou saw the policy wasn't listed there.\n\n579\n00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:40.080\nSo that's what we would do.\n\n580\n00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.650\nSo now I'm gonna go back over to,\nI've made that change and\n\n581\n00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.170\nI've linked that policy.\n\n582\n00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.870\nWe'll flip back over to the client,\nand I do need to refresh it.\n\n583\n00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:54.400\nAnd so we're gonna do a gpupdate /force.\n\n584\n00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.890\nAnd this is something you should\ndefinitely know as a tech.\n\n585\n00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:59.200\nYou need to know when\ngroup policy applies.\n\n586\n00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.550\nThe computer settings apply when\nthe computer starts up, the user settings\n\n587\n00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:08.610\napply when the user logs on, and then\nthey're refreshed every 90 to 120 minutes.\n\n588\n00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.980\nSo if I call the admin or\nescalated up, and he says, oh, yeah,\n\n589\n00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:12.790\nwe've fixed the policy.\n\n590\n00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.430\nIt should be linked, try it now.\n\n591\n00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:18.180\nWell, if I go back the machine and\ntry it, it's still not going to happen,\n\n592\n00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.160\nbecause they just made\na change to the policy.\n\n593\n00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.350\nUnless I have to reboot the machine or\nif it's a user setting, log off and\n\n594\n00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.560\nlog back on.\n\n595\n00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.520\nOr do it manually like I just here,\ngpupdate /force.\n\n596\n00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.880\nAnd it says go retrieve policy right now.\n\n597\n00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.020\nDon't wait right 90 minutes,\ndo it right now so I can test.\n\n598\n00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.903\nAnd then we look at gpresult, /r.\n\n599\n00:29:36.903 --> 00:29:44.664\nAnd we take a look,\nwe've got apply group policy objects.\n\n600\n00:29:44.664 --> 00:29:45.870\nApply group policy objects.\n\n601\n00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:48.913\nYou know and I don't see my policy,\nDaniel, and it's not showing up.\n\n602\n00:29:48.913 --> 00:29:53.295\nIsn't that interesting.\n\n603\n00:29:53.295 --> 00:29:54.875\nSo let's-\n>> Worse comes to worse with group policy,\n\n604\n00:29:54.875 --> 00:29:56.079\nyou always reboot the guy, right?\n\n605\n00:29:56.079 --> 00:29:56.693\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly,\n\n606\n00:29:56.693 --> 00:29:58.642\nthat's what we are going to do here.\n\n607\n00:29:58.642 --> 00:30:02.018\nWe're going to restart this machine, and\n\n608\n00:30:02.018 --> 00:30:06.153\ngive it a swift kick in the butt,\nand see if it works.\n\n609\n00:30:06.153 --> 00:30:09.430\nAnd I'm gonna yank that thumb drive,\nwell, I'll leave it.\n\n610\n00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.490\nSo we'll let this reboot and see.\n\n611\n00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.340\nAnd while that's rebooting\nI'll come back over here and\n\n612\n00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:16.260\njust make sure I did\nsuccessfully link it to that OU.\n\n613\n00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.717\nSo I go to employees, I can see\nremovable media is linked there, so\n\n614\n00:30:20.717 --> 00:30:22.399\nI'm good to go that way.\n\n615\n00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:27.033\nAnother thing that I might check\nif I had this level of access,\n\n616\n00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:31.322\nwould be to make to sure\nDaniel's account was in that OU.\n\n617\n00:30:31.322 --> 00:30:32.840\n>> Just do some double checking?\n\n618\n00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.322\n>> Actually, I just thought of,\n\n619\n00:30:34.322 --> 00:30:38.150\nDaniel, I can't remember if I did this\nas a computer setting or a user setting?\n\n620\n00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.502\nSo let's double-check that as well.\n\n621\n00:30:39.502 --> 00:30:41.783\nI mean,\nwhen we say when we're gonna troubleshoot,\n\n622\n00:30:41.783 --> 00:30:44.010\nwe are going to troubleshoot.\n\n623\n00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:47.250\nSo, what I'm gonna do is\ntake a look at that policy.\n\n624\n00:30:50.223 --> 00:30:51.440\nAnd we'll look at the settings.\n\n625\n00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.023\nAnd of course we trust at Microsoft.\n\n626\n00:30:56.023 --> 00:30:57.230\n>> We trust our own servers.\n\n627\n00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:58.304\n>> It is you, exactly.\n\n628\n00:30:58.304 --> 00:31:02.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that is a computer setting.\n\n629\n00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.270\nSo in this case, I actually linked\nthe policy to the wrong OU.\n\n630\n00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:08.680\nIt needed to be linked on the OU\nthat has the computer account in it,\n\n631\n00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.960\nnot the user account.\n\n632\n00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.600\nSo let me fix that real quick.\n\n633\n00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.652\nWe'll go back over to server manager.\n\n634\n00:31:13.652 --> 00:31:15.794\nTools, but again, great troubleshooting.\n\n635\n00:31:15.794 --> 00:31:19.084\nI used gpresult,\nI saw that the policy still wasn't there,\n\n636\n00:31:19.084 --> 00:31:23.160\nsends me right back to the same place,\nand we try it again.\n\n637\n00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.613\nSo we open up Group Policy Management,\nor actually I'm sorry.\n\n638\n00:31:26.613 --> 00:31:29.450\nLet's find out, let's verify where that\ncomputer account is in Active Directory.\n\n639\n00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:31.677\nI believe it's still in Computers.\n\n640\n00:31:31.677 --> 00:31:33.942\nSo we're just going to link\nit back up to the domain,\n\n641\n00:31:33.942 --> 00:31:35.491\nsince I can't link a policy there.\n\n642\n00:31:35.491 --> 00:31:40.187\nOr what I could do is move\nthat computer into that OU.\n\n643\n00:31:40.187 --> 00:31:40.810\nHow about that?\n\n644\n00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:41.891\nWe'll just do it that way.\n\n645\n00:31:41.891 --> 00:31:43.866\n>> More than one way to skin a cat, right?\n\n646\n00:31:43.866 --> 00:31:48.170\n>> Exactly so now we're just going to,\nsince I've already logged off with\n\n647\n00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.710\nclient operating systems, I do not\nhave to log in to reboot a machine.\n\n648\n00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.280\nSo I'll make it just nice and quick.\n\n649\n00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.060\nAnd we'll restart that guy, and then we'll\ndo our troubleshooting one more time.\n\n650\n00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.910\nAnd that's really what\ntroubleshooting is about.\n\n651\n00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:03.548\nLook at it, see what your results are,\ntry the easiest approach first.\n\n652\n00:32:03.548 --> 00:32:08.368\nIf that doesn't work, you just go\nthrough your troubleshooting steps so\n\n653\n00:32:08.368 --> 00:32:12.035\nyou have some kind of Logical\norder that you go through.\n\n654\n00:32:12.035 --> 00:32:13.055\nThis is mine.\n\n655\n00:32:13.055 --> 00:32:17.008\nI start at the client end,\nI like my GP result, I like my GP update.\n\n656\n00:32:17.008 --> 00:32:20.537\nIf that doesn't give me what I need, then\nI might move over to that server side or\n\n657\n00:32:20.537 --> 00:32:22.710\nescalate it up to the next\nlevel of tech support.\n\n658\n00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.760\nSo hopefully Daniel,\nwe'll get this thing to kick in.\n\n659\n00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.821\nWe'll log on real quick.\n\n660\n00:32:31.162 --> 00:32:35.883\nAnd then we'll fire up a command prompt,\nverify that the policy is being applied.\n\n661\n00:32:35.883 --> 00:32:39.410\nCuz again,\nthat's just the way I like to do things.\n\n662\n00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:43.592\nI could just take the thumb drive,\nand check it and see if it worked, but\n\n663\n00:32:43.592 --> 00:32:46.617\nI want to verify that\nthe policy's in place first.\n\n664\n00:32:50.276 --> 00:32:51.280\nSo we'll log on.\n\n665\n00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:57.549\nWe're gonna do a gpresult /r and\nsee what we've got.\n\n666\n00:32:57.549 --> 00:33:01.140\nAnd now, there is my removal media policy.\n\n667\n00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.069\nSo I can see that that policy is in\nplace so that's a good first step.\n\n668\n00:33:05.069 --> 00:33:08.998\nNow, I'm gonna go test it and\nsee if the policy's actually working,\n\n669\n00:33:08.998 --> 00:33:10.870\ndoing what it's supposed to do.\n\n670\n00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:17.928\nSo let me eject that guy real quick.\n\n671\n00:33:17.928 --> 00:33:20.520\nI've got to do that safe removal, right?\n\n672\n00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.530\n>> Good boy, Mikey, good boy.\n\n673\n00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:23.627\n>> All right,\nwe'll plug that thumb drive back in.\n\n674\n00:33:26.692 --> 00:33:28.630\nWindows is thinking about it.\n\n675\n00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:32.780\nIt's really not happy that I unplugged\nit and plugged it back in so quickly.\n\n676\n00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.390\nAnd there we go.\n\n677\n00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.650\nWe'll go into files and\nwe'll see that, Daniel,\n\n678\n00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.310\nsure enough can still read in documents.\n\n679\n00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:45.753\nSo let's see if he can,\nwhat was I, and what about rights?\n\n680\n00:33:45.753 --> 00:33:49.903\nNew > Text document, and access is denied.\n\n681\n00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:51.860\nWhat about executing?\n\n682\n00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.420\nWe'll go back over here and\nwe'll run that.\n\n683\n00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.110\nAnd sure enough,\n\n684\n00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:58.530\nyou might not have the appropriate\npermissions to access this item.\n\n685\n00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:01.320\nSo now my policy is in place.\n\n686\n00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.580\nAgain, that's something that is right\non that verge of, I always think,\n\n687\n00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.160\nDaniel, that this kind of\ninformation could go in this exam.\n\n688\n00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.700\nIt could also go in that server exam,\nso we might as well learn at this point.\n\n689\n00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.300\nWe might not have that experience\nwith group policy yet but\n\n690\n00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.510\nyou will as you move up.\n\n691\n00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:20.510\nAnd sometimes trouble shooting takes\nus beyond what we're able to do and\n\n692\n00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:23.240\nwe have to know at least\nthat starting point.\n\n693\n00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.970\nI can look at the computer and I can say,\nlook the policy is not being applied.\n\n694\n00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:29.370\nI hand that off to the next\nlevel of tech support,\n\n695\n00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:31.120\nthey don't have to start at the beginning,\nright?\n\n696\n00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.860\nThey already know that okay,\nthis person has gone through this.\n\n697\n00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.220\nI know the policy is not being applied,\nnow they can start that next level of\n\n698\n00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.730\ntroubleshooting it, not have to start\nall over again, and that's a big help.\n\n699\n00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:42.680\nAnd once you move up to tier two,\n\n700\n00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.300\nyou'll be really thankful that those\ntier one guys are doing that for you.\n\n701\n00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.510\n>> Oh, yeah.\nDefinitely.\n\n702\n00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.862\nI've been there where my tier one guys,\nhorrible at documentation.\n\n703\n00:34:49.862 --> 00:34:51.015\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've been down that road.\n\n704\n00:34:51.015 --> 00:34:52.025\nAnd you have to teach them.\n\n705\n00:34:52.025 --> 00:34:53.941\nGuys, you got to tell me what you've done.\n\n706\n00:34:53.941 --> 00:34:56.790\nWhat happened,\nwhat were the the results of that?\n\n707\n00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:00.080\nAnd then when it escalates to me,\nI don't have to redo a bunch of work.\n\n708\n00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.650\nAnd now, Mike, just because I'm super\ncurious we've got to see wether or\n\n709\n00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.140\nnot the local group policy does this.\n\n710\n00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.796\nI-\n>> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely,\n\n711\n00:35:05.796 --> 00:35:06.363\nlet's do that.\n\n712\n00:35:06.363 --> 00:35:10.599\nAll right, so\nwe're going to do a little gpedit.msc.\n\n713\n00:35:14.384 --> 00:35:16.130\nAnd if it wants to launch there.\n\n714\n00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:19.770\nAnd while that's launching, let's verify\nwhere that setting is cuz there are so\n\n715\n00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.950\nmany I wanna make sure we\ngo to the right place.\n\n716\n00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:24.130\nSo we go back over here.\n\n717\n00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.920\n>> There's a group policy object or two.\n\n718\n00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.200\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n719\n00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.200\nThere's a few settings in there.\n\n720\n00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.030\nAnd that was under administrative\ntemplates and then system and\n\n721\n00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.080\nremovable storage.\n\n722\n00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:38.730\nSo we'll take a look at,\nwell, close all tabs.\n\n723\n00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:40.580\nI did type that in correctly.\n\n724\n00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.979\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n725\n00:35:42.979 --> 00:35:44.820\nMy Win10 box is freaking out on me here.\n\n726\n00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.000\nLet's do, oh you know what,\nyou're not an admin on this machine.\n\n727\n00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.670\nLet's log you out and log back on as\nadmin and verify that setting there.\n\n728\n00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:00.840\nAll right, so we'll do other user and\n\n729\n00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:06.900\nwe'll login as that domain admin cuz why\nnot if you know the password, right?\n\n730\n00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:07.571\n>> That's right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n731\n00:36:07.571 --> 00:36:08.553\n>> Wield the power if you got it,\n\n732\n00:36:08.553 --> 00:36:09.520\nright, Mikey?\n\n733\n00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.550\n>> Exactly.\n\n734\n00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.050\n>> Big stick, hit someone with it.\n\n735\n00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:16.120\n>> All right so we-\n>> Not someone, computers, those are fine.\n\n736\n00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:22.220\n>> All right, so here we go, we're\nlogged in as the admin again gpedit.msc\n\n737\n00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.470\n>> That's a little better, Microsoft.\n\n738\n00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:26.547\nThat's the local group policy editor or\n\n739\n00:36:26.547 --> 00:36:28.997\none way to get to the local\ngroup policy editor.\n\n740\n00:36:28.997 --> 00:36:34.577\nAnd that was a computer setting,\nadministrative templates, system and\n\n741\n00:36:34.577 --> 00:36:40.725\nthen removable media, removable storage\naccess, and sure enough there it is.\n\n742\n00:36:40.725 --> 00:36:45.120\nSo the one I was using\nwas deny write access and\n\n743\n00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.530\ndeny execute access to removable discs.\n\n744\n00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:51.770\nYou'll see there's also policies for\nlike cd's and dvd's.\n\n745\n00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:53.380\nFloppy drives,\nbecause I know that is still\n\n746\n00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.250\na very common-\n>> I've got tons of them.\n\n747\n00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:58.127\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] Swimming in those things, Mike.\n\n748\n00:36:58.127 --> 00:37:02.157\n>> Tape drives cuz that's something\nI carry around in my backpack,\n\n749\n00:37:02.157 --> 00:37:03.640\nthose kinds of things.\n\n750\n00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.810\nYou can also do custom classes,\n\n751\n00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:08.550\nif you ever have a need to\nblock a particular type.\n\n752\n00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:12.520\nMaybe you've got authorized\nthumbdrives that do encryption or\n\n753\n00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.110\nsomething like that and you issue those\nto your employees but you don't want them\n\n754\n00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.840\nbringing in a thumbdrive that\nthey bought down at the local\n\n755\n00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.010\nelectronics store because\nit doesn't do encryption.\n\n756\n00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:23.790\nYou can actually get the GUID or\nthe globally unique identifiers for\n\n757\n00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:29.010\nthese devices or the UUIDs and you can\nmake policies specific to a device.\n\n758\n00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.250\nSo a lot of cool options in there.\n\n759\n00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:31.520\nPlay around, look at it.\n\n760\n00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.970\nAnd since it's on your local policy too,\nheck you can try it on your home machine\n\n761\n00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:36.267\nand really check your children or\nyour spouses.\n\n762\n00:37:36.267 --> 00:37:36.943\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n763\n00:37:36.943 --> 00:37:38.970\nHave some fun with that one, right?\n\n764\n00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:39.541\nAll right, Mike.\n\n765\n00:37:39.541 --> 00:37:42.500\nWell, it looks like we've come to the end\nof another great episode here at ITProTV.\n\n766\n00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.240\nLet's go ahead and sign off.\n\n767\n00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.700\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n768\n00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.370\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n769\n00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:48.676\n>> And we'll see

welcome\nto another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.628 --> 00:00:20.410\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry, and joining\nme on the show today is none other than,\n\n5\n00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.342\nMr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:21.342 --> 00:00:22.528\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:22.528 --> 00:00:23.694\n>> It's going great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:23.694 --> 00:00:25.096\nAnd I'm excited as always.\n\n9\n00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:27.961\nWe've got more of our Windows\n10 content coming your way.\n\n10\n00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.475\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at permissions and specifically,\n\n11\n00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:33.292\ntroubleshooting permissions, right?\n\n12\n00:00:33.292 --> 00:00:35.780\nAt this point we should have\ngood idea about permissions.\n\n13\n00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.723\nNTFS permissions, share permissions,\nhow they interact, how they work together,\n\n14\n00:00:40.723 --> 00:00:43.918\ndynamic access control,\nwe got to throw that in there.\n\n15\n00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:45.210\nBut what happens when things go wrong?\n\n16\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.210\n>> Yeah that's exactly right.\n\n17\n00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.135\nAnd this is really the best\npart of instruction right?\n\n18\n00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:51.670\nOh, okay, its great you show me NTFS,\n\n19\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.960\nI see that, this is how it's supposed to\nwork, but that's normally not what they\n\n20\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.450\nask you about when it comes to an exam and\ndefinitely not how it works in real life.\n\n21\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.610\nNormally things are already set up,\nyou come in.\n\n22\n00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.435\nOr maybe you are setting them up so\nit's good to know that information,\n\n23\n00:01:06.435 --> 00:01:08.109\nbut usually it's gone wrong.\n\n24\n00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.230\nThings are crumbling down around us.\n\n25\n00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.957\nThere's dogs and cat living together.\n\n26\n00:01:11.957 --> 00:01:13.521\nIt's total anarchy.\n\n27\n00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:14.903\nWhat do I do?\n\n28\n00:01:14.903 --> 00:01:16.589\nAnd that's what todays show's about.\n\n29\n00:01:16.589 --> 00:01:21.201\nKind of giving you some of that practical\nhow to stuff when it comes to permissions.\n\n30\n00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:22.990\nBecause they can be\nthe bane of our existence.\n\n31\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.230\n>> They really can and\nit's a huge part of what we do every day,\n\n32\n00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.630\nespecially at tier one or\nat that help desk.\n\n33\n00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.440\nWhere if you are the only person there and\nit's your shop that you have to manage,\n\n34\n00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.590\na big part of your day is spent making\nsure that my users can access what\n\n35\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.750\nthey need to do their job and\ndo it securely.\n\n36\n00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.540\nThat means that they\nhave to authenticate and\n\n37\n00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.550\nthey can only get to what they\nare authorized to see, and\n\n38\n00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.710\nif their, if it is above their pay grade,\nthey don't get access to it right?\n\n39\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.880\nBut if they are supposed to have access\nto it, they should get access to it.\n\n40\n00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.819\nAnd what we're gonna talk about today is\nwhat happens when that doesn't work that\n\n41\n00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.355\nway, when they come to you and they\nsay hey, I'm supposed to get access to\n\n42\n00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:01.978\nthis resource, I know everybody else\nin sales gets it, how come I don't?\n\n43\n00:02:01.978 --> 00:02:04.770\nWe've got to go try to figure\nout what the problem is.\n\n44\n00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.929\nSo, let's start with some\nsimple troubleshooting here.\n\n45\n00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.480\nYou know what?\nI think I won't even tell you what\n\n46\n00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.955\nwe're gonna be troubleshooting at first,\nwe'll just see what happens right?\n\n47\n00:02:12.955 --> 00:02:13.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n48\n00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.216\nwhat I've got here on my screen is\nI'm logged on as a user named Peter.\n\n49\n00:02:18.216 --> 00:02:19.341\nSo we take a look there.\n\n50\n00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:21.007\nI'm logged on as Peter.\n\n51\n00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.372\nAnd on my computer, or\non Peter's computer.\n\n52\n00:02:23.372 --> 00:02:25.078\nI'll pretend I'm Peter.\n\n53\n00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.260\nOn my computer I've got\na folder [CROSSTALK]\n\n54\n00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.649\n>> Peter, what's happening?\n\n55\n00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:29.510\n>> [LAUGH] Not much.\n\n56\n00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.168\nHow's it going Daniel?\n\n57\n00:02:30.168 --> 00:02:30.806\nNice to meet you.\n\n58\n00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:33.772\n[LAUGH] So\nI've got a folder in here called Shared.\n\n59\n00:02:33.772 --> 00:02:35.090\nI've got a couple documents in here.\n\n60\n00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.120\nAnd this is where I'm keeping\nmy customer contact information.\n\n61\n00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.850\nSo I can come in here and\nI can say Jane Dow and\n\n62\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.860\nI can add a little phone number there.\n\n63\n00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.940\nI know,\na different way to spell Dow, right?\n\n64\n00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.702\nGotta be unusual.\n\n65\n00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:52.479\nAnd looks like I should be able to\nmake changes to it, I can save it,\n\n66\n00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:53.360\nI can close it.\n\n67\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.180\nNo problem there, right?\n\n68\n00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.810\nUntil Peter goes to another machine.\n\n69\n00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.617\nAnd then Peter tries\nto access that folder.\n\n70\n00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:03.353\nNow I shared out that folder or\nPeter shared out that folder so\n\n71\n00:03:03.353 --> 00:03:06.100\nhe could get to it from other locations.\n\n72\n00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.785\nSo he's going to go back over to this\nsecond machine and try to connect.\n\n73\n00:03:09.785 --> 00:03:13.350\nClient01\\Shared.\n\n74\n00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.430\nThere's my folder.\n\n75\n00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.810\nLooks like Peter did\na good job sharing it out.\n\n76\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.114\nI can see my files in there,\neverything looks good.\n\n77\n00:03:20.114 --> 00:03:24.279\nI'm gonna open up my customer contacts,\nand I misspelled Jane's name there.\n\n78\n00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:26.730\nSo I'm need to go back in and change that.\n\n79\n00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.680\nThere we go.\n\n80\n00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.220\nNow Jane's happy.\n\n81\n00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.187\nI'm gonna close it, I 'm going to save it.\n\n82\n00:03:33.187 --> 00:03:34.360\nAnd It's already looking\na little different.\n\n83\n00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.770\nIt didn't just go, it didn't just save it.\n\n84\n00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.493\nIt wanted to give it a name, ok.\n\n85\n00:03:38.493 --> 00:03:41.077\nI'll give,\nI don't want it just replaced, right?\n\n86\n00:03:41.077 --> 00:03:42.629\nSo, we'll click save again,\nor already exists.\n\n87\n00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.506\nYes, I want to replace it,\nwhat's wrong, oh,\n\n88\n00:03:45.506 --> 00:03:48.399\naccess is denied,\nsomething's going on here.\n\n89\n00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.630\nIt's not going to let me,\nmodify this file, right?\n\n90\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.480\nIt will let me save it as\na completely new file, it looks like.\n\n91\n00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.825\nLet's see if I can Contacts2.\n\n92\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.996\nOh, I don't have permission\nto do that either!\n\n93\n00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:02.040\nWhat's going on?\n\n94\n00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.900\nNot going to let me.\n\n95\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.230\nPeter, created that folder ,Peter\nshared it out, he can access it but,\n\n96\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.430\nsomething is wrong.\n\n97\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.824\nSo, let's go take a look.\nI am going to have to say,\n\n98\n00:04:09.824 --> 00:04:11.148\ndon't save on that document.\n\n99\n00:04:11.148 --> 00:04:13.835\nI'll close my connection.\n\n100\n00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:16.490\nWe're going to flip back over\nto his first machine, and\n\n101\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.130\ntake a look at what we got here.\n\n102\n00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.550\nSo, we'll open up that folder.\n\n103\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.880\nThat was on my C drive and I'm gonna\npull up the properties here of Shared.\n\n104\n00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.340\nAnd let's take a look.\n\n105\n00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.130\nSo go to security tab.\n\n106\n00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.870\n>> Now Mike, the good thing is\nthat when we get an access denied\n\n107\n00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.230\nerror message it's almost usually some\nsort of permissions issue, correct?\n\n108\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.440\n>> It is.\nAnd we just have to keep in mind, right.\n\n109\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.653\nRemember what you learned back with\nNTFS permissions and share permissions.\n\n110\n00:04:41.653 --> 00:04:44.400\nNTFS permissions always check.\n\n111\n00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.190\nThey are always in effect.\n\n112\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.060\nBut when you go across the network, now\nI've gotta worry about NTFS permissions,\n\n113\n00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.390\nas well as share permissions.\n\n114\n00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.430\nAnd really, Daniel, that's our first\ntip is as to what the problem is.\n\n115\n00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.913\nBecause it worked when I\nwas accessing it locally,\n\n116\n00:04:57.913 --> 00:05:01.157\nit didn't work when I\nwent across the network.\n\n117\n00:05:01.157 --> 00:05:02.440\nWhat's different?\nNTFS permissions were\n\n118\n00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.070\nchecked when I accessed it locally, and\n\n119\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.320\nwhen I went across the network, so\nmost likely that's not the problem.\n\n120\n00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.880\nShare permissions were only checked\nwhen I went across the network.\n\n121\n00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.945\nThat's when I had the issue.\n\n122\n00:05:14.945 --> 00:05:16.728\nThat's most likely the problem, right.\n\n123\n00:05:16.728 --> 00:05:19.844\nBut to be thorough,\nlet's come in here and look and\n\n124\n00:05:19.844 --> 00:05:24.712\nI can see that authenticated users have\nmodified permission over this folder.\n\n125\n00:05:24.712 --> 00:05:28.595\nSo everything should be good there.\n\n126\n00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:32.710\nNTFS wise, if I go over to the sharing tab\nand I take a look at my permissions here.\n\n127\n00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.380\nAnd Peter is not an administrator so\nlets give him some,\n\n128\n00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.040\nhe's got his alternate\naccount that he uses right?\n\n129\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.240\nHis run adds.\n>> Good security.\n\n130\n00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.952\n[LAUGH]\n>> That is right.\n\n131\n00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:47.000\nAll right, and\nI take a look at permissions, and\n\n132\n00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.005\nI see everyone,\n,everyone only has read permission.\n\n133\n00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:56.340\nRemember, when you combine NTFS and share\nlike when you go across a network, when\n\n134\n00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.340\nyou use a UNC path, a map number drive,\nit's the most restrictive of the two, so\n\n135\n00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.980\nwhen I am accessing it locally,\nNTFS says I have modify.\n\n136\n00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.970\nBut, when I go across the network,\nNTFS modify share read,\n\n137\n00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.550\nread is the most restrictive of the two.\n\n138\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.140\nAll I get is read.\n\n139\n00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.146\nSo, let's change that,\nlets give everyone full control and\n\n140\n00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:21.661\nclick OK, and OK, and close.\n\n141\n00:06:21.661 --> 00:06:25.724\nAll right, and now we will go back\nover to Peter's second machine,\n\n142\n00:06:25.724 --> 00:06:27.878\ntry to connect back to that folder.\n\n143\n00:06:31.961 --> 00:06:37.467\nOpen up that Contacts and\nsee if I can fix Jane's name here.\n\n144\n00:06:37.467 --> 00:06:41.652\nAnd we'll save it, and\nthat looks much better, right?\n\n145\n00:06:41.652 --> 00:06:44.578\nNo dialogue box, no prompt,\nnothing like that.\n\n146\n00:06:44.578 --> 00:06:46.203\nI can save it and I close it.\n\n147\n00:06:46.203 --> 00:06:47.328\nAnd everything works.\n\n148\n00:06:47.328 --> 00:06:50.502\nAnd remember, you might think, well Mike,\nyou gave everybody full control and\n\n149\n00:06:50.502 --> 00:06:52.611\nthat's kind of silly,\nthat's not a good practice.\n\n150\n00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:57.314\nWell that's Microsoft's recommendation\nnow a days is to share permission,\n\n151\n00:06:57.314 --> 00:06:58.889\neverybody full control.\n\n152\n00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:03.021\nUse your NTFS permissions, and\nyour dynamic access control, to actually\n\n153\n00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:07.361\ncontrol what level of access they have\nbecause we know NTFS says always check.\n\n154\n00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:09.935\nAnd if I give share full\ncontrol to everyone,\n\n155\n00:07:09.935 --> 00:07:12.920\nI can eliminate that as a problem source,\nright.\n\n156\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.120\nNow me, personally I like to\nuse the Authenticated Users,\n\n157\n00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.168\nnot the Everyone group, typically.\n\n158\n00:07:18.168 --> 00:07:21.790\nBut it really depends on you and your\ncompany's best practices and procedures.\n\n159\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.190\nAll right, so let's take a look at share\npermissions and troubleshooting those.\n\n160\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.830\nRemember the key to remember there,\n\n161\n00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.860\nshare permissions are only checked\nwhen you're going across the network,\n\n162\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.070\nwhen you're using a UNC path, when you're\nmapping a network drive, and it's always\n\n163\n00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.570\ngoing to be the most restrictive of\nthe two when you combine share NTFS.\n\n164\n00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:45.109\n>> Yeah Mike, another thing that can\nhappen is kinda the reverse of that right?\n\n165\n00:07:45.109 --> 00:07:47.965\nWhere it might not be\na share permissions problem,\n\n166\n00:07:47.965 --> 00:07:50.630\nit might actually be\nan NTFS permission issue.\n\n167\n00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.190\n>> Absolutely, NTFS has some really cool\nfeatures where we can use groups and\n\n168\n00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.710\nwe put our users in those groups to\n\n169\n00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.640\nsimplify the administration\nof NTFS permissions right?\n\n170\n00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.960\nRather than assigning,\nevery individual sales person.\n\n171\n00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.942\nI've got a hundred of them and I dont\nwanna have to add a hundred of them to\n\n172\n00:08:05.942 --> 00:08:08.352\nthe access control list, and\nwe just put them in a group.\n\n173\n00:08:08.352 --> 00:08:12.323\nAnd then we add the group to the access\ncontrol list and we assign the permissions\n\n174\n00:08:12.323 --> 00:08:15.950\nto the group and everybody in the group\ngets those level of permissions.\n\n175\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:21.047\nBut we can still assign permissions, NTSF\npermissions directly to a user account,\n\n176\n00:08:21.047 --> 00:08:25.946\nusers can be a part of more than one group\nand so NTSF permissions are cumulative.\n\n177\n00:08:25.946 --> 00:08:28.059\nWe have to take all that\ninto consideration.\n\n178\n00:08:28.059 --> 00:08:30.353\nWhen that user goes to\naccess the resource,\n\n179\n00:08:30.353 --> 00:08:34.135\nbasically what Windows is doing is\nit's looking at your access token and\n\n180\n00:08:34.135 --> 00:08:38.110\nsaying there's your user's SID and\nthere's all the groups you belong to.\n\n181\n00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.982\nNow here's the access control list for\nthe resource.\n\n182\n00:08:41.982 --> 00:08:46.904\nLet me see if any of those SIDs that\nare listed in your access token are listed\n\n183\n00:08:46.904 --> 00:08:48.870\non that access control list.\n\n184\n00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.247\nAnd if they are,\nI'm gonna start adding them up.\n\n185\n00:08:51.247 --> 00:08:52.250\nAll right, it's cumulative.\n\n186\n00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.337\nIf you get write from one group and\nread from another group,\n\n187\n00:08:55.337 --> 00:08:58.935\nthen you get both read and write,\nbecause you belong to both groups.\n\n188\n00:08:58.935 --> 00:09:00.528\nThey are both on that list.\n\n189\n00:09:00.528 --> 00:09:04.644\nBut, sometimes they can have a detrimental\neffect, I guess we could say, yeah,\n\n190\n00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:07.821\nbecause if we don't plan it out properly,\nthings can go awry.\n\n191\n00:09:07.821 --> 00:09:12.274\nAnd I got an example of that here as well,\nso lets take a look at my screen,\n\n192\n00:09:12.274 --> 00:09:15.998\nI am currently logged on as a user name,\nDaniel, crazy guy,\n\n193\n00:09:15.998 --> 00:09:17.695\nalways goofing things up.\n\n194\n00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:20.420\nAnd I am going to open\nup File Explorer and\n\n195\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:25.071\nI'm gonna navigate over to a Share here,\nbackslash, backslash and\n\n196\n00:09:25.071 --> 00:09:29.879\non server 01, I've got a folder\ncalled Show Notes for our hosts, and\n\n197\n00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:34.928\nsure enough Daniel can access that, and\nif he takes a look at those notes for\n\n198\n00:09:34.928 --> 00:09:39.415\n2012, he can come in here and\nhe can, let's see, what else,\n\n199\n00:09:39.415 --> 00:09:44.145\nadd roles, maybe he's making some\nadditions to those notes, file,\n\n200\n00:09:44.145 --> 00:09:46.932\nsave, everything seems to be working.\n\n201\n00:09:46.932 --> 00:09:50.893\nHe goes to Windows 10,\nand he gets access denied.\n\n202\n00:09:50.893 --> 00:09:55.140\nSo now we gotta try to figure out why\nDaniel is not getting access to that.\n\n203\n00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.571\nSo we're gonna flip over to the server\nthat's hosting that share, and\n\n204\n00:09:58.571 --> 00:10:00.070\ntake a look at what we've got.\n\n205\n00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.750\nLet's see.\n\n206\n00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.100\nThere's my show notes folder.\n\n207\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.750\nAnd if I look at show notes and\ntake a look at the properties, and\n\n208\n00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.280\nI go to that security tab,\nwell, there's hosts.\n\n209\n00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.110\nDaniel's a member of the host group,\nand they have modify permissions.\n\n210\n00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.020\nSo everything looks okay there.\n\n211\n00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:22.240\nOr if I go inside here, and I take a look\nat that file, he's called me up and\n\n212\n00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.850\nsaid, I'm having trouble accessing this\nfile, let's take a look at its property.\n\n213\n00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.550\nCuz we know NTFS inherits, so\nthose permissions for host modify\n\n214\n00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:35.190\npermissions on the folder should\ninherit down to the document itself.\n\n215\n00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.589\nWe'll go into security,\n\n216\n00:10:36.589 --> 00:10:40.988\nand there's hosts, and sure enough,\nthey are inheriting modify permissions.\n\n217\n00:10:40.988 --> 00:10:45.862\nBut there is an access control entry\nin Ace for Daniel himself, and\n\n218\n00:10:45.862 --> 00:10:50.314\nsomebody has denied Daniel l\npermission over this one file.\n\n219\n00:10:50.314 --> 00:10:56.653\nAnd remember, an explicit deny,\nis going to override an inherited allow.\n\n220\n00:10:56.653 --> 00:10:59.560\nSo, even though Daniel belongs\nto that group host and\n\n221\n00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.250\nhosts has modify permission.\n\n222\n00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.900\nNotice that's inherited right.\n\n223\n00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.840\nGrey check marks.\n\n224\n00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.130\nIf we look at Daniel,\nthat's an explicit deny.\n\n225\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:11.095\nBlack check marks and\nthat is gonna override, not allow.\n\n226\n00:11:11.095 --> 00:11:13.692\n>> They put that well above my pay grade\n\n227\n00:11:13.692 --> 00:11:14.397\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know and\n\n228\n00:11:14.397 --> 00:11:15.260\nsometimes we do this intentionally.\n\n229\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:20.065\nI mean it is a good thing if I want,\nmaybe there's a particular folder that I\n\n230\n00:11:20.065 --> 00:11:24.642\nneed all my hosts to get into, but\nthere's one file maybe, pay rates,\n\n231\n00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:29.713\nyou know, or customer contact info,\nthey don't want the host messing with.\n\n232\n00:11:29.713 --> 00:11:33.634\nYou can see that I can override that\npermission on that one document.\n\n233\n00:11:33.634 --> 00:11:35.788\nSo sometimes that can be beneficial.\n\n234\n00:11:35.788 --> 00:11:40.298\nBut in this case, Daniel needs to get\ninto those show notes for Windows 10.\n\n235\n00:11:40.298 --> 00:11:42.975\nAnd somebody accidentally\ndenied him access.\n\n236\n00:11:42.975 --> 00:11:45.030\nSo I could.\nI'm simply going to come in here and\n\n237\n00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.025\nchoose Edit and grab Daniel's account.\n\n238\n00:11:47.025 --> 00:11:49.985\nAnd choose Remove.\n\n239\n00:11:49.985 --> 00:11:53.903\nRight, so remove that explicit entry for\nthat deny for Daniel.\n\n240\n00:11:53.903 --> 00:11:58.094\nAnd now if I go back over here,\nand we double-click on that.\n\n241\n00:11:58.094 --> 00:11:59.766\nAnd I do a little testing.\n\n242\n00:11:59.766 --> 00:12:07.045\nOne, two, and I go to save it.\n\n243\n00:12:07.045 --> 00:12:09.800\nAnd I close it and\neverything's working like a champ, right.\n\n244\n00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.500\nSo we've gotta be able to trouble\nshould those NTFS permissions and\n\n245\n00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:19.230\ndon't forget you've got the,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for.\n\n246\n00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.980\nI'm just going to pull it up.\n\n247\n00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.690\n>> It's going to be Effective Access.\n\n248\n00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:23.230\n>> Thank you, yes.\n\n249\n00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.384\nEffective Access tab.\n\n250\n00:12:24.384 --> 00:12:27.170\nSo I'm going to go to Security,\nand i can click Advanced and\n\n251\n00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:32.640\nI can do my effective access, and I can\nselect the user and I can for example,\n\n252\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.399\nwe could of done this before we\ndid that fix, but, there's Daniel,\n\n253\n00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:43.020\nview effective access, and sue enough,\nhe is now getting modified permissions.\n\n254\n00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.390\nSo, we did fix the problem and\nI could of done this, before hand,\n\n255\n00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:51.450\nto see that he wasn't getting access,\nright, it doesn't really tell you why.\n\n256\n00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.970\nBut it gives a good start, alright,\n\n257\n00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.870\ntrying to figure out why\nDaniel doesn't have access.\n\n258\n00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.590\nAlright, so\nthat's our NTFS troubleshooting.\n\n259\n00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:04.310\nAnother thing that we've gotta be able to\ntroubleshoot is Dynamic Access Control.\n\n260\n00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.950\nAlright, Dynamic Access Control\nis a really cool feature.\n\n261\n00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.790\nIt allows me to base authentication,\nor not authentication.\n\n262\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.858\nBase access on more than just who you are.\n\n263\n00:13:14.858 --> 00:13:17.590\nIn the past we've had to deal\nwith just who you are, and\n\n264\n00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.410\nwhat groups you belong to.\n\n265\n00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:23.530\nThat was the only thing could use to\ncontrol your access to these resources.\n\n266\n00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.750\nNow any attribute in active\ndirectory is up for grabs, right?\n\n267\n00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:31.320\nI can say, i'll give you access to this\nresource If you're in the host group, and\n\n268\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:36.710\nyour department is host, and your manager\nis Don, and you live in the U.S., right?\n\n269\n00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.040\nOr I can add in there,\n\n270\n00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.180\nand you're connecting from a laptop\ncomputer that's part of the domain.\n\n271\n00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:48.890\nI mean, we can do some really neat\nstuff with Dynamic Access Control.\n\n272\n00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.540\nBut it adds another level of complexity\nthat we've gotta be able to troubleshoot.\n\n273\n00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:57.130\nTry to figure out why\nsomebody's not getting access.\n\n274\n00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:57.830\nSo let's take a look.\n\n275\n00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:03.230\nFor an example for this one,\nI'm going to come back over here.\n\n276\n00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:08.010\nI'm still logged on as Daniel and\nlet's see what I've got here.\n\n277\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.220\nI've got another share, SVR01/ Data.\n\n278\n00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:15.070\nIn there I've got four folders,\none for development, host,\n\n279\n00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.420\nmarketing, and production.\n\n280\n00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.920\nAnd Daniel's a member of the host group,\nand\n\n281\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.350\nhe's also a part of the host department.\n\n282\n00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:27.870\nIn his user account,\nhis department attribute says host, so\n\n283\n00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.550\nhe gets access to that resource.\n\n284\n00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.240\nIf he tries to go to development,\nhe doesn't get access.\n\n285\n00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.460\nAnd that's because on these resources\nI've actually set the department value.\n\n286\n00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:42.220\nFor example if I look at hosts,\nproperties and let's see if he can,\n\n287\n00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.370\nI don't know if Daniel is\ngonna be able to see that.\n\n288\n00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.680\nLet's go over to the other side here,\nthis is where that share is located.\n\n289\n00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.320\nAnd I'll take a look and\nI'll show you what I'm talking about.\n\n290\n00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.540\nIn here if I go to this\ndevelopment folder and\n\n291\n00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.685\npull up it's properties and\ngo to this classification tab,\n\n292\n00:14:58.685 --> 00:15:04.240\nwe'll see that the resource has as\na department of development, right?\n\n293\n00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:11.860\nIf we take a look at hosts,\nproperties, classification.\n\n294\n00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:16.035\nI can see,\nthis one has a department value of hosts.\n\n295\n00:15:16.035 --> 00:15:19.140\nNow when we look at\nthe security tab alright,\n\n296\n00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.540\nwe see that users, or what do we got here,\nactually we don't see anything for\n\n297\n00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.840\nthat, we see users have\nspecial permission.\n\n298\n00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:30.520\nAnd if I click advanced and come over\nhere to this central access policy tab,\n\n299\n00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.940\nI'll see that there is something\nin place called department check.\n\n300\n00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.490\nAll right.\n\n301\n00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:39.160\nAnd if I look down here\n\n302\n00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.640\nthere's a condition that says user\ndepartment equals resource department.\n\n303\n00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.900\nSo that's how I'm controlling access.\n\n304\n00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.480\nThat's how I'm making sure that hosts\ncan get into the host folder but\n\n305\n00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.400\nthey can't Into the production folder.\n\n306\n00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.980\nSomebody in development can get\ninto the development folder, but\n\n307\n00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.290\nthey can't get into the host folder.\n\n308\n00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:58.380\nI'm using those departments,\nwhich means I've\n\n309\n00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.450\ngotta make sure the active directory\naccount is set up properly.\n\n310\n00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.190\nAnd let's take a look at\nwhat I'm talking about here.\n\n311\n00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.270\nIf we go back over to the client.\n\n312\n00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.410\nSo, Daniel,\neverything seems to be working.\n\n313\n00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.930\nHe can get into hosts, but\nhe can't get into development,\n\n314\n00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.130\nhe's not gonna be able to get\ninto any of these other folders.\n\n315\n00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.270\nNow let's log off as Daniel.\n\n316\n00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:21.170\nAnd we're gonna log back on as\n\n317\n00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:26.070\nRonnie once Windows 10 decides\nto let me log out here.\n\n318\n00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:30.200\nThere we go so\nwe'll log back in as another user.\n\n319\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.090\nWell Ronnie is a host as well,\n\n320\n00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.930\nand he so\ngraciously shared his password with me.\n\n321\n00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:39.870\n>> Through nefarious means.\n\n322\n00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.560\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nnow I'm logged on as Ronnie.\n\n323\n00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.510\nI'm going to go back up and\nopen File Explorer, and\n\n324\n00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.670\nI am going to that same share.\n\n325\n00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.750\nAnd Ronnie can't get into development.\n\n326\n00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.030\nWell, that's good.\n\n327\n00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.290\nHe's a host.\n\n328\n00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:59.120\nRonnie should be able to get into hosts,\nand no brain.\n\n329\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.620\nSomething went wrong, right?\n\n330\n00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.660\nso, why is Ronnie not getting\naccess to that hosts folder?\n\n331\n00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.540\nWell, in this case it's\nnot an NTSF permission.\n\n332\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.110\nRight?\nIt's that dynamic access control.\n\n333\n00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.660\nSo what we're gonna do.\n\n334\n00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.090\nIn fact, let's.\nI know I'm making you dizzy there.\n\n335\n00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:17.160\nLet's go over to active\ndirectory one more time.\n\n336\n00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.380\nI'll flip through these guys.\n\n337\n00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:23.410\nAnd I'm gonna open up active directory.\n\n338\n00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.910\nThat's not active directory.\n\n339\n00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:27.660\nThat is active directory.\n\n340\n00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.520\nAnd in here, there's Ronnie's account.\n\n341\n00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.860\nThere's Daniel's account.\n\n342\n00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.230\nIn fact, let's look at Daniel's first.\n\n343\n00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.430\nRemember, it worked for Daniel.\n\n344\n00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.520\nI go to organization.\n\n345\n00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.240\nDepartment host.\n\n346\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.310\nSo his department matched the folder's\ndepartment and he got access to it.\n\n347\n00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.990\nAlright?\n\n348\n00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.280\nIf I take a look at Ronnie,\nmake sure everything's good there.\n\n349\n00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.070\nOh look, somebody forgot to fill\nout his department attribute,\n\n350\n00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.380\nso Ronnie's not gonna be able\nto get access to the resource.\n\n351\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.580\nWe'll simply type inn host for that.\n\n352\n00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:00.080\nAnd we'll go back over here to Ronnie.\n\n353\n00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.520\nAnd say Ronnie,\nyou should now be able to connect.\n\n354\n00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.350\nOh.\nStill not working.\n\n355\n00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.680\nWhat the heck?\n\n356\n00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:14.930\nWell, this a situation where Ronnie is\ngoing to have to log off and log back on.\n\n357\n00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:19.076\nBecause with Dynamic Access Control, just\nlike with your group membership, right,\n\n358\n00:18:19.076 --> 00:18:22.710\nwe have learned with NTFS permissions,\nif I modify your group membership,\n\n359\n00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:26.508\nyou got to log off, and log back on to get\na new access token that has all the groups\n\n360\n00:18:26.508 --> 00:18:30.131\nyou now belong too listed on their right,\nthat only happens on that log on.\n\n361\n00:18:30.131 --> 00:18:33.796\nWell it's the same thing with\nDynamic Access Control, your generating,\n\n362\n00:18:33.796 --> 00:18:37.939\nit's generating a claim about you, and\nit's including that in your access token.\n\n363\n00:18:37.939 --> 00:18:42.115\nIt's saying, when Ronnie, logs on, he's\na member of this group, this group, and\n\n364\n00:18:42.115 --> 00:18:44.615\nthis group And by the way,\nhis department is host.\n\n365\n00:18:44.615 --> 00:18:46.240\nWe got that when he logged on.\n\n366\n00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.686\nI just fixed it in active directory.\n\n367\n00:18:48.686 --> 00:18:52.215\nSo before that, when he logged on,\nit didn't include that information.\n\n368\n00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:57.614\nSo Ronnie needs to log off and\nget a new access token.\n\n369\n00:18:57.614 --> 00:19:01.700\nThat'll now include\nthat fixed information.\n\n370\n00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.561\nSo we'll log off as Ronnie, and\n\n371\n00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:10.432\nthen we'll log right back on as Ronnie.\n\n372\n00:19:10.432 --> 00:19:12.534\nOh, he must have changed his password.\n\n373\n00:19:12.534 --> 00:19:13.520\nHe heard me out there.\n\n374\n00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.491\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n375\n00:19:15.491 --> 00:19:19.656\nwe log back in as Ronnie and\nnow it's getting a new access token.\n\n376\n00:19:19.656 --> 00:19:24.261\nAnd this time it's gonna include the fact\nthat he is part of the host department.\n\n377\n00:19:24.261 --> 00:19:27.367\nSo if I open up File Explorer and\n\n378\n00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:32.514\nI navigate back to that share,\nand I go into hosts.\n\n379\n00:19:32.514 --> 00:19:34.558\nSure enough, Ronnie has access now.\n\n380\n00:19:34.558 --> 00:19:36.517\nStill can't get into the other ones,\nright,\n\n381\n00:19:36.517 --> 00:19:38.436\nbecause his department is not development.\n\n382\n00:19:38.436 --> 00:19:40.255\nHis department is not production.\n\n383\n00:19:40.255 --> 00:19:41.935\nBut he can get into hosts.\n\n384\n00:19:41.935 --> 00:19:44.606\nSo, keep that in mind with\ndynamic access control,\n\n385\n00:19:44.606 --> 00:19:47.958\nit's all based on those users\nattributes and active directory.\n\n386\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:50.622\nBut if nobody fills those attributes out,\n\n387\n00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:54.251\nthen my dynamic access control\nis not gonna work, right?\n\n388\n00:19:54.251 --> 00:19:55.307\nSo, it's very easy.\n\n389\n00:19:55.307 --> 00:19:58.175\nAnd most companies, I don't know about\nyou, but know that I have worked in.\n\n390\n00:19:58.175 --> 00:19:59.912\nYou go and\nlook at these user accounts, and\n\n391\n00:19:59.912 --> 00:20:01.611\nthey fill out the required information.\n\n392\n00:20:01.611 --> 00:20:03.341\nUser name, you know, things like that.\n\n393\n00:20:03.341 --> 00:20:06.228\nBut nobody goes back and\nfills out who their manager is,\n\n394\n00:20:06.228 --> 00:20:08.938\nwhat department there is,\nwhat their job title is.\n\n395\n00:20:08.938 --> 00:20:10.688\nWell now,\nthat stuff is much more important.\n\n396\n00:20:10.688 --> 00:20:14.594\n>> Yeah, and it's very helpful for\nother people that are looking up users and\n\n397\n00:20:14.594 --> 00:20:17.265\naccounts inside of an active\nrecord environment.\n\n398\n00:20:17.265 --> 00:20:19.170\nThat's comes in very, very handy.\n\n399\n00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.075\nI've used it many, many times.\n\n400\n00:20:21.075 --> 00:20:23.915\nFind a phone numbers, what floor\nthey're on inside of a building.\n\n401\n00:20:23.915 --> 00:20:25.280\nIt can be very, very informative.\n\n402\n00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.456\nAnd also now that we see,\nit can help us restrict access or\n\n403\n00:20:29.456 --> 00:20:31.461\ngive access as necessary.\n\n404\n00:20:31.461 --> 00:20:35.756\nNow speaking of access, Mike, this is\nsomething I've seen happen a few times.\n\n405\n00:20:35.756 --> 00:20:36.824\nIt does occur.\n\n406\n00:20:36.824 --> 00:20:38.955\nYou got a user, they're working on things,\n\n407\n00:20:38.955 --> 00:20:41.599\nobviously they're in another\ndepartment somewhere.\n\n408\n00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:43.043\nAnd they're busy and\nthen they leave the company.\n\n409\n00:20:43.043 --> 00:20:46.979\nThey're no longer with us anymore for\nwhatever reason, and they've got files.\n\n410\n00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:50.870\nAnd they took a security class one day and\nheard that they have this lovely\n\n411\n00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:54.557\nencrypted file, our encrypting file\nsystem, that's built in the windows.\n\n412\n00:20:54.557 --> 00:20:56.662\nAnd I thought man, I'm gonna be secure and\n\n413\n00:20:56.662 --> 00:21:00.183\nI'm gonna encrypt these specific\nwork files, but now they're gone.\n\n414\n00:21:00.183 --> 00:21:02.801\nAnd then the user account\nhas been deleted, there's,\n\n415\n00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:06.380\ngot these orphaned encrypted files,\nwe're gonna get into these bad boys.\n\n416\n00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.425\n>> If we do.\n\n417\n00:21:07.425 --> 00:21:10.480\nAnd the problem is,\nif you didn't set this up before hand,\n\n418\n00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.940\nyou could be in a little bit of trouble,\nright?\n\n419\n00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.020\nBecause once those files are encrypted,\n\n420\n00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:19.300\nremember it's encrypted using that user's\nkey pair, which is their certificate,\n\n421\n00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.240\nwhich contains their public key and\nthen their public key is in their profile.\n\n422\n00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.719\nAnd if they haven't backed that up or\nyou haven't centrally managed that and\n\n423\n00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:28.015\nthey delete their profile.\n\n424\n00:21:28.015 --> 00:21:31.105\nOr like Daniel says, someone deletes\ntheir account, they format that machine,\n\n425\n00:21:31.105 --> 00:21:32.333\nthey use it for something else.\n\n426\n00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:33.244\nNow all of a sudden,\n\n427\n00:21:33.244 --> 00:21:36.350\na month later, we find some files\nthat were encrypted by this user and\n\n428\n00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.804\nthat user's no longer around and\nwe don't have their private key anymore.\n\n429\n00:21:39.804 --> 00:21:41.534\nYou're not gonna get\nback into those files.\n\n430\n00:21:41.534 --> 00:21:44.018\nUnless you've got a recovery agent set up.\n\n431\n00:21:44.018 --> 00:21:47.222\nLuckily for us, it is set up by default.\n\n432\n00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:51.344\nIn a domain environment, that built\nin domain administrator account.\n\n433\n00:21:51.344 --> 00:21:53.747\nThe one that's named administrator, right.\n\n434\n00:21:53.747 --> 00:21:56.847\nThat is your recovery agent by default.\n\n435\n00:21:56.847 --> 00:22:02.214\nAnd remember, a recovery agent is somebody\nthat can encrypt, decrypt any document.\n\n436\n00:22:02.214 --> 00:22:04.619\nEvery time somebody encrypts a document,\n\n437\n00:22:04.619 --> 00:22:07.300\nit uses their key pair\nto encrypt the document.\n\n438\n00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.582\nIt also uses the recovery agent's\nkey pair to encrypt a second copy\n\n439\n00:22:11.582 --> 00:22:13.500\nof that file encryption key.\n\n440\n00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.673\nSo if they lose their key pair,\nthe recovery agent can swoop in,\n\n441\n00:22:17.673 --> 00:22:21.307\nuse his key pair to decrypt\nthat data decryption field,\n\n442\n00:22:21.307 --> 00:22:25.507\nretrieve the file encryption key and\ndecrypt those documents.\n\n443\n00:22:25.507 --> 00:22:26.165\nBut like I said,\n\n444\n00:22:26.165 --> 00:22:29.522\nit's that built in administrator account,\nthat that's usually not a good thing.\n\n445\n00:22:29.522 --> 00:22:30.685\nWe wanna change that.\n\n446\n00:22:30.685 --> 00:22:32.827\nSo, let me just show you\nwhere you I might do that.\n\n447\n00:22:32.827 --> 00:22:36.413\nI'm gonna open up,\ngroup policy management and\n\n448\n00:22:36.413 --> 00:22:41.141\nI'm gonna pull up the prop or\nedit by default the name, policy.\n\n449\n00:22:41.141 --> 00:22:45.999\nAnd in here we are gonna go to policies,\nwindows settings,\n\n450\n00:22:45.999 --> 00:22:50.579\nsecurity settings,\npublic key policies and then EFS.\n\n451\n00:22:50.579 --> 00:22:53.915\nAnd here is what you'll find\nwho the recovery agent is.\n\n452\n00:22:53.915 --> 00:22:57.061\nAnd when you first come in here,\nwhen you first set that domain up again,\n\n453\n00:22:57.061 --> 00:23:00.487\nit's that built in administrator account\nand it's a self sign certificate.\n\n454\n00:23:00.487 --> 00:23:03.725\nIt's one that's not gonna be\ntrusted by your organization.\n\n455\n00:23:03.725 --> 00:23:08.680\nSo, best practice is to create a separate\naccount and minus the administrator.\n\n456\n00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.572\nMost organizations, what you're gonna\ndo is create an account solely for\n\n457\n00:23:12.572 --> 00:23:13.384\nthis purpose.\n\n458\n00:23:13.384 --> 00:23:15.892\nA data recovery account.\n\n459\n00:23:15.892 --> 00:23:20.540\nAnd then, you're gonna assign\na certificate based of of EFS recovery\n\n460\n00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:24.896\nagent template for the purpose of\nfile recovery to that account.\n\n461\n00:23:24.896 --> 00:23:28.264\nAnd then you're gonna come in here and\nremove that default one.\n\n462\n00:23:28.264 --> 00:23:32.997\nAnd then you're gonna add, right,\nyou'd say add data recovery agent.\n\n463\n00:23:32.997 --> 00:23:37.309\nBrowse and find that certificate that\nyou assigned to that special account,\n\n464\n00:23:37.309 --> 00:23:39.845\nlist it here, remove the other one, right.\n\n465\n00:23:39.845 --> 00:23:42.355\nMake sure you back up the keys for\nthe old one, though.\n\n466\n00:23:42.355 --> 00:23:46.942\nAnother thing we've gotta remember is,\nif you change who the recovery agent,\n\n467\n00:23:46.942 --> 00:23:51.340\nis It doesn't go back and change\nthe recovery agent on all encrypted files.\n\n468\n00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.603\nIn other words, administrator\nis currently my recovery agent.\n\n469\n00:23:54.603 --> 00:23:59.606\nAll the files that are encrypted up to\nthis point, he is the recovery agent.\n\n470\n00:23:59.606 --> 00:24:02.984\nWe changed that to DRA.\n\n471\n00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:06.632\nA special account we set up for\nit, and from this day forward,\n\n472\n00:24:06.632 --> 00:24:10.647\nthat DRA account would be the one\nwho could go and decrypt all files.\n\n473\n00:24:10.647 --> 00:24:12.870\nThe files that were encrypted before that,\n\n474\n00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.464\nit's still this administrator account,\nright?\n\n475\n00:24:15.464 --> 00:24:19.746\nSo we've gotta make sure we keep those\nprivate keys, or we gotta go and\n\n476\n00:24:19.746 --> 00:24:21.417\ndecrypt all those files and\n\n477\n00:24:21.417 --> 00:24:25.721\nencrypt them again now that we've\nchanged who the recovery agent is.\n\n478\n00:24:25.721 --> 00:24:30.498\nSo something you want to think about early\non before you start encrypting a bunch of\n\n479\n00:24:30.498 --> 00:24:35.207\nfiles is, decide who the recovery agent\nis gonna be, assign the certificate and\n\n480\n00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:37.029\nset it up here in group policy.\n\n481\n00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:38.457\nAll right.\n\n482\n00:24:38.457 --> 00:24:40.836\n>> Well, Mike,\nobviously that's the best way to go.\n\n483\n00:24:40.836 --> 00:24:45.089\nCreate that recovery agent so that if\nthis does happen, you're not stuck out in\n\n484\n00:24:45.089 --> 00:24:49.484\nthe weeds going, oh, no, we really need\nthis file, and it very well maybe gone.\n\n485\n00:24:49.484 --> 00:24:53.692\nSo if you've taken the proper precautions,\nyou shouldn't have that issue,\n\n486\n00:24:53.692 --> 00:24:57.405\njust use your recovery agent,\nget that data back and go back to work.\n\n487\n00:24:57.405 --> 00:25:00.842\nNow, Mike, I say we do have quite\na little bit more to cover.\n\n488\n00:25:00.842 --> 00:25:03.661\nBut our clock is showing\na little on the time, so\n\n489\n00:25:03.661 --> 00:25:05.717\nwe're gonna have to do a part two.\n\n490\n00:25:05.717 --> 00:25:06.844\nI know how much you love parts two so.\n\n491\n00:25:06.844 --> 00:25:09.955\n[LAUGH] Hopefully we'll\nsee you guys on part two.\n\n492\n00:25:09.955 --> 00:25:12.125\nBut as for this one we're gonna\ngo ahead and call it a day.\n\n493\n00:25:12.125 --> 00:25:13.903\nSigning off for IT Pro TV.\n\n494\n00:25:13.903 --> 00:25:15.121\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n495\n00:25:15.121 --> 00:25:15.969\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n496\n00:25:15.969 --> 00:25:17.257\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n497\n00:25:17.257 --> 00:25:21.895\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

everyone.\n\n4\n00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.450\nAnd welcome to another\nexciting episode of ITProtv.\n\n5\n00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.620\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry and\n\n6\n00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.580\njoining me again in the studio\nis none other than Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.660\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n8\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.110\n>> Oh, it's going great Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.780\nI'm excited we're continuing on\nwith our Windows 10 content.\n\n10\n00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.130\nAnd in fact, we're continuing on with,\n\n11\n00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.150\nthis is a part two of\ntroubleshooting access, right?\n\n12\n00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.160\nWe've been looking at\nsupporting data security and\n\n13\n00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.940\nwe want to just continue that thought.\n\n14\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.240\nAnd in the other episode if you've seen\nthat already we looked at troubleshooting\n\n15\n00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.940\nin NTFS and share permissions as\nwell as dynamic access control.\n\n16\n00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.960\nNow we're going to go into\nanother very common scenario and\n\n17\n00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.230\nthat is good old removable media.\n\n18\n00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.070\nPeople come into work and they plug in\ntheir thumbdrives that they know onto\n\n19\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.940\nwhich they just put some files\nat home before they left.\n\n20\n00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.170\nThey come into work, they plug\nthat thing in and it doesn't work.\n\n21\n00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.920\nNow what?\n\n22\n00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.700\n>> Yeah that's right.\n\n23\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.340\nWe do this for safety reasons.\n\n24\n00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.050\nMike's going to point her right\nto the reason this is happening.\n\n25\n00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.500\nBut in a corporate environment in a place\nwhere you have transient people maybe.\n\n26\n00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.420\nOr you just don't want\noutside devices coming in and\n\n27\n00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.745\nattaching to your inside devices.\n\n28\n00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:18.990\nWe'll put on some security measures\nto keep that from happening.\n\n29\n00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.710\nBut, our users might not be aware that\nthose security measures are in place,\n\n30\n00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.650\ntherefore, they plug in their thumb drive,\nand they get a whole, big fat nothing.\n\n31\n00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.550\nRight Mike?\n[LAUGH]\n\n32\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.750\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n33\n00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.830\nThese guys can be the bain of security,\nright?\n\n34\n00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.099\nWe've heard all kinds of stories,\n\n35\n00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:35.570\nif you watch the news you hear about\ndata leakage and things like that.\n\n36\n00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.210\nAnd we've talked in several episodes,\nbut anytime we talk about security,\n\n37\n00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.790\nnow these guys are easy to lose.\n\n38\n00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.740\nThese little thumb drives.\n\n39\n00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.250\nPeople put data on there because they\nwant to take it home and work with it.\n\n40\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.670\nThey leave it in the back of a cab or\na restaurant table or,\n\n41\n00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.370\nwhat have you, and\nall of a sudden that data's gone.\n\n42\n00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.230\nA lot of organizations, especially\nyour high security organizations,\n\n43\n00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.000\nthe way they solve this\nproblem is not to allow.\n\n44\n00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.500\nAll right, you look at most\nmilitary bases here in the U.S.,\n\n45\n00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.510\nyou will not get one of these thumb\ndrives on there, they won't be allowed.\n\n46\n00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.215\nAnd, we can try to prevent them\nfrom bringing into the building.\n\n47\n00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:12.310\nBut now we're talking about if we can\ndo searches on everybody's purses and\n\n48\n00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.910\nbookbags as they come in.\n\n49\n00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.770\nSome places, yes.\n\n50\n00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.320\nThat might be the level of access they go\nto or the level of control they go to.\n\n51\n00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.140\nBut we Have the ability to do this\nthrough group policy as well.\n\n52\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.880\nAnd I can just block\nthese removable devices.\n\n53\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.330\nThat way, even if they do\nbring them in the building,\n\n54\n00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.980\nthey're not gonna be able\nto get access to them.\n\n55\n00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.280\nNow let me show you what happens.\n\n56\n00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.490\nWhat I've got here, I've got a Windows\n10 laptop or a Windows 10 machine and\n\n57\n00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.790\nI'm gonna plug in a thumb drive.\n\n58\n00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.010\nSo just like a user, they come to work,\n\n59\n00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.380\nthey bring their thumb drive of that\nreport they worked on all night long and\n\n60\n00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.450\nwe're gonna plug this guy in, and\nthen we'll try to open up File Explorer.\n\n61\n00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.690\nGo to this PC, and\nthere's my drive right there.\n\n62\n00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.350\nGreat!\nI'm gonna double click on it,\n\n63\n00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.940\ntry to get, oh, no, where's my files?\n\n64\n00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.340\nWhy am I not getting access to it?\n\n65\n00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.040\nAnd that's the point that they're\ngonna call the help desk, right?\n\n66\n00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.730\nIf the organization has\nbeen doing this for\n\n67\n00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.290\na while, most likely it's part of your\nOnboarding process with your employees.\n\n68\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.990\nHey, removable media is not allowed,\nor thumb drives are not allowed or\n\n69\n00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.050\nwhat have you.\n\n70\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.940\nBut especially when your organization\nis making changes, right?\n\n71\n00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.286\nThey've decided that they\nwanna go this route, so\n\n72\n00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:19.835\nthey've implemented this policy and\nit takes a little while to decimate that\n\n73\n00:03:19.835 --> 00:03:23.020\ninformation out to all your users\nbefore they get used to it, right?\n\n74\n00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.069\nIt's something maybe they used\nto be able to do in the past and\n\n75\n00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.990\nall of a sudden it's not working.\n\n76\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.680\nSo let's see where we can do that.\n\n77\n00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.910\nSo we need to take a look our group\npolicies here to see where we can\n\n78\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.630\ngo about blocking these removable devices.\n\n79\n00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.702\nSo I'm gonna go Tools and\nthen Group Policy Management.\n\n80\n00:03:42.702 --> 00:03:45.080\nAnd here I've got a policy\ncalled black removable media.\n\n81\n00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.860\nNow this is something that I created.\n\n82\n00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.010\nIt's not anything built\nin there by default.\n\n83\n00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.800\nI'll click edit,\nexpand this out so we can see it.\n\n84\n00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.230\nAnd the configuration I'm looking for\nis underneath policies, administrative\n\n85\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.490\ntemplates, system and\nthen removable storage access.\n\n86\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.316\nAnd there are several settings in here\nthat I can work with to block that remove\n\n87\n00:04:08.316 --> 00:04:09.065\nall media.\n\n88\n00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:13.285\nThe one I implemented for\nthis demo was all removable storage.\n\n89\n00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:17.755\nBut maybe I wanna allow CDs and\nDVDs but not thumb drives.\n\n90\n00:04:17.755 --> 00:04:19.515\nSo there are other policies I can use.\n\n91\n00:04:19.515 --> 00:04:21.100\nThere's block CD and DVD.\n\n92\n00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.180\nDeny execute access.\n\n93\n00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.590\nSo they can still use it, but\nthey can't run anything off of those DVDs.\n\n94\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.760\nOr deny just write access.\n\n95\n00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.620\nMaybe I wanna allow them to read DVDs,\nbut not write to them.\n\n96\n00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.316\nRight, same thing when you get\ndown to floppy drives because\n\n97\n00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:36.660\nI know a lot of you still have\nfloppies on your systems.\n\n98\n00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.160\nJust in case.\n\n99\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.510\nTape drives, this WPD,\nthis is windows portable device.\n\n100\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.630\nThis would be like smartphones and\ntablets and things like that.\n\n101\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.760\nAnd then we've got the removable discs.\n\n102\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.970\nThat would include things like\nthumb drives, like I've got.\n\n103\n00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.520\nOr your USB hard drives as well.\n\n104\n00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.560\nOr you can block them all.\n\n105\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.610\nThe one I used here.\n\n106\n00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.390\nBut you can also do some custom classes.\n\n107\n00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.460\nSo maybe you want to block\na particular brand of thumb drive or\n\n108\n00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.246\nyou only want to allow\na particular brand of thumb drive.\n\n109\n00:05:09.246 --> 00:05:12.590\nYou have company issued thumb drives\nthat support a high level of encryption,\n\n110\n00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.000\nfingerprint scanning, or a biometric for\nauthentication, or something like that.\n\n111\n00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.390\nSo, you're okay with them using that.\n\n112\n00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.710\nThat way, as long as, if they're gonna\ntake data out of the corporate office\n\n113\n00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.370\nI know that it's encrypted, and\nit's protected with biometrics.\n\n114\n00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.970\nAll right?\nSo, we can get very specific in here.\n\n115\n00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.710\nWe can get that class ID\noff of the device, and\n\n116\n00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.720\nwe can choose to allow those and\nblock the rest.\n\n117\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.250\nAgain, the one I used, which was very\ngeneral, blocking all removable media,\n\n118\n00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.210\ntapes, portable devices, floppies,\nCDs, DVDs, and thumb drives.\n\n119\n00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.800\nSo, whatever your company needs to do.\n\n120\n00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.470\nAnd again, for\n\n121\n00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.140\nthis one, We're not really here to\nlearn about the policies themselves.\n\n122\n00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.130\nIt's as a Windows 10 technician,\nif I've got to support these devices,\n\n123\n00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.470\nmy users are calling me up saying hey,\nmy CD ROM drive,\n\n124\n00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.910\nI've got a portable CD ROM dive\nthat I've brought with me to work.\n\n125\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.420\nI've plugged it in, and\nI wanted to burn some stuff to the disk,\n\n126\n00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.590\nand it's not working.\n\n127\n00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.770\nIt's giving me access denied.\n\n128\n00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.600\nWhat's going on?\n\n129\n00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.050\nWe have to understand that it's\nour policy that's causing that.\n\n130\n00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.910\nAnd it's not an error on their end,\nit's a policy.\n\n131\n00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.930\nIt's supposed to say access is denied.\n\n132\n00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.880\nSo, something we need to be aware of.\n\n133\n00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.700\n>> Now, Mike that works great.\n\n134\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.200\nThis is obviously inside of\nthe Active Directory domain.\n\n135\n00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.700\nWe love Active Directory, but\nwhat about our smaller shops, guys?\n\n136\n00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.900\nWorking in a In a work group is that also\navailable on the local group policy?\n\n137\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.500\n>> It is in your local\ngroup policy as well.\n\n138\n00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.210\nSo if you wanted to,\njust remember if you're using the local\n\n139\n00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.220\npolicy you'd have to do it on each and\nevery machine.\n\n140\n00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.390\nBut if you don't have a domain that\nis the way you're gonna have to go.\n\n141\n00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.761\n>> Awesome.\nNow we're talking data security here and\n\n142\n00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:42.400\nit wouldn't be a data security day if we\ndidn't mention good old Bit Locker because\n\n143\n00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.270\nwell that's kinda what it does.\n\n144\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.790\nIt secures data through\nencryption of the drive.\n\n145\n00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.244\nNow Mike.\n[LAUGH] We talked about EFS and\n\n146\n00:06:48.244 --> 00:06:49.890\nwhat happens when that happens.\n\n147\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.580\nIs there also something similar for\nwhen somebody hoses their computer or\n\n148\n00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.970\nthey encrypt the drive and they're gone?\n\n149\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.290\nWe don't have that recovery key for\nwhatever reason.\n\n150\n00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.840\nHow do we get back into this thing?\n\n151\n00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.610\n>> That's a great question Daniel and\n\n152\n00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.430\nsomething that we've got to make\nsure we're protected against.\n\n153\n00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.110\nJust like EFS we've got\nthat data recovery agent.\n\n154\n00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.270\nThat can go back and\nget into those encrypted files,\n\n155\n00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.010\neven if the user has lost their keys and\nno longer has access.\n\n156\n00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.710\nWell, as Daniel said, Bit Locker,\nit's encryption as well, right?\n\n157\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.610\nWe're just encrypting the entire\nvolume instead of an individual file.\n\n158\n00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.760\nBut the same thing can happen what if I\nlose access to that volume I need to have\n\n159\n00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.480\na way to get in there and\nrecover that data.\n\n160\n00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.170\nWe've got our recovery keys, we've got our\npasswords that we might have set up or\n\n161\n00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.370\ndepending on what we're using\nto unlock those drives, but\n\n162\n00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.230\na recovery agent is just another\nlevel of protection against that and\n\n163\n00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.690\nits actually done the same\nway that we did The EFS.\n\n164\n00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.370\nIf we take a look at my screen here,\nI've got a policy says Bitlocker DRA.\n\n165\n00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:52.160\nI'm gonna edit that policy, and\nit's in the same place as well.\n\n166\n00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.130\nIf we go to Policies, and then\nWindows Settings, and Security Settings,\n\n167\n00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.962\nwe can go down to our Public Key Policies.\n\n168\n00:07:59.962 --> 00:08:05.130\nAnd remember this is where I decided,\nnot in this particular policy,\n\n169\n00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.530\nit was the other, the default of\nthe main policy that had that, but\n\n170\n00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.920\nthere's where we set\nour EFS recovery agent.\n\n171\n00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.100\nRight below there is my bit\nlocker drive encryption.\n\n172\n00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.100\nYou see that one?\n\n173\n00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.100\nAnd this is where I can set\nmy bit locker recovery agent.\n\n174\n00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.620\nSame thing.\nI have to go into my certificate authority\n\n175\n00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.740\nand I have to issue a certificate for\n\n176\n00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.460\nthe purpose of recovery,\na Bit locker recovery.\n\n177\n00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:33.420\nThen I have to come in here and\nchoose add data recovery agent.\n\n178\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:38.430\nI browsed and found the certificate\nthat I issued to an administrator for\n\n179\n00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:42.120\nthe purpose of Bit locker\nrecovery I added it here.\n\n180\n00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.480\nIn fact I can show you the wizard.\n\n181\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.850\nIt's just going to allow me to browse and\nfind that certificate.\n\n182\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:48.930\nAnd I go browse folders, and\n\n183\n00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.753\nthere's that certificate that\nI issued to administrator.\n\n184\n00:08:52.753 --> 00:08:57.640\nI'm gonna click open and\nit's going to add it here in this list.\n\n185\n00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.360\nAnd that way, I've got somebody that can\nget back into the drives as a last resort.\n\n186\n00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.887\nIf I've lost all other access to\nthose volumes that are encrypted with\n\n187\n00:09:04.887 --> 00:09:07.291\nBit Locker,\nthis is how I can get back in there.\n\n188\n00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:09.677\nEspecially like those\nbit locker to go drives.\n\n189\n00:09:09.677 --> 00:09:10.556\nThings like that.\n\n190\n00:09:10.556 --> 00:09:13.440\nThe user says, oh I want to put\nbit locker on my thumb drive.\n\n191\n00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.194\nThat's great.\n\n192\n00:09:14.194 --> 00:09:18.890\nUntil they forget the password that\nthey used to allow for the decryption.\n\n193\n00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.340\nNow we've got to be able to\nrecover that information and\n\n194\n00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.050\nthat's where this guy comes into play.\n\n195\n00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.060\nAnd it's not configured by default.\n\n196\n00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.020\nUnlike EFS, where that built in\nadminister account is the recovery agent.\n\n197\n00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.500\nSo if you never bother to change it,\nyou still have a recovery agent.\n\n198\n00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.880\nNot the best solution, but\nat least there is a recovery agent.\n\n199\n00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.910\nWith Bit Locker,\nthere is no one set up by default.\n\n200\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.360\nYou've gotta go into your\ncertificate authority and\n\n201\n00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.020\nyou've gotta enable the certificate\ntemplate for this purpose or extend one of\n\n202\n00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.590\nyour existing templates to add this\nextension for Bit Locker recovery.\n\n203\n00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.740\nYou gotta issue that\ncertificate to a user account.\n\n204\n00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.850\nAnd then you've gotta come in\nhere to your policy and add that.\n\n205\n00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.340\nSo something else that\nwe've gotta do to make,\n\n206\n00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.840\nit's again,\nit's just another level of protection.\n\n207\n00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.160\nRight?\nGiving us those fail safes.\n\n208\n00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:08.950\nAnd then the last thing I want to talk\nabout here is something known as MBAM.\n\n209\n00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.240\nMicrosoft Bitlocker and\nAdministration Management.\n\n210\n00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.500\nWe've seen bit locker in several episodes.\n\n211\n00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.820\nWe understand with a full volume\nencryption we can encrypt the volumes.\n\n212\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.260\nWe can also do our operating system drive.\n\n213\n00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.840\nWe can do our fixed data drives.\n\n214\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.835\nAnd then we have bit locker to go for\nour removal drives,\n\n215\n00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:30.485\nour thumb drives, our USB hard drives,\nand things like that.\n\n216\n00:10:30.485 --> 00:10:32.505\nBut all that's been done locally.\n\n217\n00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:33.035\nRight?\n\n218\n00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:35.055\nWe've gone into the machine,\n\n219\n00:10:35.055 --> 00:10:39.315\nwe've right clicked on the volume,\nwe've enabled bit locker.\n\n220\n00:10:39.315 --> 00:10:42.380\nAnd in a corporate environment\nthat's not how I wanna do that,\n\n221\n00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.520\nI don't wanna have to go to every,\nsingle machine.\n\n222\n00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.330\nIf this is a company policy, and\n\n223\n00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:51.500\nwe're gonna require that all laptops have\ntheir operating system drive encrypted,\n\n224\n00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.660\nwell, I don't want to go through\na stack of laptops and do this.\n\n225\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.890\n>> Don't be lazy, Mike.\n\n226\n00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:55.760\nCome on now.\n\n227\n00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.455\nYou can do this.\n\n228\n00:10:57.455 --> 00:10:58.840\n[LAUGH] You can do this.\n\n229\n00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.450\n>> Call me lazy if you must, but\n\n230\n00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.150\nI always think of it as working smarter,\nnot harder, right?\n\n231\n00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.280\nAnd Microsoft gives you\nthe tools to do that.\n\n232\n00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.030\nNow, it's not built into\nyour operating system.\n\n233\n00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.520\nYou have to go out into Microsoft and\ndownload it.\n\n234\n00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.706\nIt's part of the Microsoft Desktop\nOptimization Pack or MDOP,\n\n235\n00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:17.423\nthat your organization should be able\nto get if you've got an MSDN access or\n\n236\n00:11:17.423 --> 00:11:19.252\nvolume license, things like that,\n\n237\n00:11:19.252 --> 00:11:23.210\nanyway, we get MDOP, and in there is\nthe MBAM, I like the name, MBAM, right?\n\n238\n00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.395\n>> Just rolls off the tongue.\n\n239\n00:11:25.395 --> 00:11:26.570\n[LAUGH]\n>> It does.\n\n240\n00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.610\nMicrosoft, I wanna say baseline security\nanalyser, every time I say it, but\n\n241\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:36.870\nit's your Microsoft BitLocker,\nBitLocker Administration and Management.\n\n242\n00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.690\nManagement, MBAM.\n\n243\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.840\nYou get that, you download it,\nyou install it, and\n\n244\n00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.920\nthen I can control my BitLocker centrally.\n\n245\n00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.160\nAlright, I can go and say I need to\nencrypt the drives on all these machines.\n\n246\n00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.192\nMakes it much easier\nto work with BitLocker\n\n247\n00:11:50.192 --> 00:11:54.340\nat a enterprise level so\ntake a look at that.\n\n248\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:59.160\nFor this examine, it's mainly being\nfamiliar I think with that concept.\n\n249\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.250\nThat we have that ability, that we can get\nin, MBAM and we can use that to enable\n\n250\n00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.638\nBitLocker, work with our BitLocker\npolicies on an enterprise level.\n\n251\n00:12:06.638 --> 00:12:11.650\n>> So you don't have to be an MBAM\ngenius or somebody that's worked with\n\n252\n00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:17.540\nit exclusively with it for the last three\nyears to able to pass the exam, right?\n\n253\n00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.190\n>> Correct. Yeah. >> All right, Mikey,\nwe've gone through a lot of stuff here.\n\n254\n00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.640\nIs there anything else that we'd like\nto cover before we close this episode?\n\n255\n00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.140\n>> I think that does it for data security.\n\n256\n00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.990\nRemember we've talked about security\nin many different episodes so\n\n257\n00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.990\nmake sure you watch them all.\n\n258\n00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.830\nIn this one we're really focused\non some troubleshooting.\n\n259\n00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.240\nWhat things can go wrong and\nwhere we might look to figure out what\n\n260\n00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.560\nthe heck it is that's gone wrong and\nhow to fix it.\n\n261\n00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.100\n>> That's right, recover from those\ncrazy errors that plague our lives.\n\n262\n00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.660\nAlright, Mike.\nThank you so much for joining us today and\n\n263\n00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.270\nall this great demonstrations and\nexplanations that we had for the show.\n\n264\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.120\nAnd thank you for watching.\n\n265\n00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.230\nWe're going to sign off for ITProTv.\n\n266\n00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.910\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n267\n00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.723\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n268\n00:12:52.723 --> 00:12:58.708\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n269\n00:12:58.708 --> 00:13:01.043\n>> [SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:17.762\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:21.790\nAnd in today's episode we are continuing\non with our Windows 10 series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.708\nJoining us back in the studio today to\nhelp us out with that very endeavor is our\n\n6\n00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:27.836\ngood friend and mentor, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:29.260\nWes, welcome to the show sir,\nhow's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.610\n>> Thanks for having me here, and Dan,\n\n9\n00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.969\nit is always good to be here on the stage\nwith ITProTV, and that's right.\n\n10\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.940\nThe last few episodes that we've made,\nwe've been talking\n\n11\n00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.810\nabout some of the different app\nsupport technologies that we have.\n\n12\n00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.800\nAnd what we want to do is dive in\n\n13\n00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.600\nto round off all the different\ntechnologies that we've talked about.\n\n14\n00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.050\nTalk a little bit about the benefits and\n\n15\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.150\nsome of the things that you have to be\naware of just in case they, maybe throw\n\n16\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.540\nyou a scenario based question on the exam\nso that you'll be able to answer these.\n\n17\n00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.670\nNow if you remember, and\nif you haven't seen the videos go back and\n\n18\n00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.620\nwatch them and then you can definitely\ncome back here and watch this video, but\n\n19\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.640\nwe've talked about Azure RemoteApp.\n\n20\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.660\nWe talked about the Microsoft Intune\nplatform in other videos as well.\n\n21\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.000\nWe talked about Office 365 and App-V.\n\n22\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.080\nNow it's important to\nunderstand the benefits of\n\n23\n00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.250\neach one of these technologies.\n\n24\n00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.440\nGoing back to those scenario based\nquestions where if the ask you okay,\n\n25\n00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.650\nyou need to support such and such,\nwhich of these technologies would\n\n26\n00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.200\nperform whatever it is that\nyou're trying to implement.\n\n27\n00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.390\nSo, I'll tell you what, let's go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna jump in\n\n28\n00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.150\nand we're gonna recap Azure RemoteApp and\nlook at some of the benefits.\n\n29\n00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.640\nSo I got a diagram here\nabout Azure RemoteApp.\n\n30\n00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.990\nAnd some of the things that I'd like you\nto remember, there's a few of these that\n\n31\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.910\nthey'll be doing the same thing for\nus, have the same benefits.\n\n32\n00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.720\nSo Azure RemoteApp, what do we get?\n\n33\n00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.870\nWe get centralized administration.\n\n34\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.880\nThat's always key in any kind\nof enterprise level environment.\n\n35\n00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.260\nWe do not want a decentralized nature,\n\n36\n00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.490\nthe administrative overhead\nis just a nightmare.\n\n37\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.700\nSo, that's one of the great things, we\nsay centralized management, keep in mind,\n\n38\n00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.940\nyour RemoteApps are all stored in\na centralized location in the cloud, and\n\n39\n00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.170\nthe administrator or administrators really\njust have to log into a web browser.\n\n40\n00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.150\nAnd, that's the other benefit too.\n\n41\n00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.820\nA cloud based service, right?\n\n42\n00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.530\nWe get the benefit of all the things\nthat come along with cloud service\n\n43\n00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.350\nlike elasticity,\nscaling up to meet the needs of a company.\n\n44\n00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.730\nSo, as we discussed in\nthe Azure RemoteApp series,\n\n45\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.540\nor episodes, we talked about what\nhappens if one user connects to\n\n46\n00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.820\nyour instance of an application,\nwell that's fine, but\n\n47\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.590\nwhat if 500 users connect to your\ninstance of the application?\n\n48\n00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.850\nAnd again, go back and\nwatch these episodes, but\n\n49\n00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.230\none of the things you might remember,\nDan talked about provisioning servers.\n\n50\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.710\nAnd it was an all day process and that's\nreally, really being conservative, right,\n\n51\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.450\nis that it would be an all day process.\n\n52\n00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.210\nWell, if your current server couldn't\nsupport the application demands, well then\n\n53\n00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.360\nyou'd be out of business for a little bit,\nor maybe even losing a little business.\n\n54\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.980\nSo that's one of the good things about\nit really just remaining in the cloud,\n\n55\n00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.340\nis the fact that we got that\nelasticity in scaling up.\n\n56\n00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.260\nThe other big thing is\nthe application co-existence.\n\n57\n00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.170\nI want you to keep in mind that because\nthe remote applications in RemoteApp,\n\n58\n00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.570\nthey're not running on the local machine.\n\n59\n00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.540\nThe communication is nothing more\nthan your traditional RDP session,\n\n60\n00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.420\nremote desktop protocol.\n\n61\n00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.650\nSo you get the benefits of instance,\nthe encryption that RDP has and, I don't\n\n62\n00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.630\nreally have to worry about my local\nmachines applications interfering with it,\n\n63\n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.780\nso that if I do have another application\nthat's running on that machine and\n\n64\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.340\nwouldn't play nice together, well,\nit's okay because, well, guess what?\n\n65\n00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.650\nThe application is running on a server\nin the cloud, and that's a great thing.\n\n66\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.400\nNow, the other thing that's really good\nthat I want you to take a look at here is,\n\n67\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.180\nwhat if there are resource limitations?\n\n68\n00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.170\nWe have many, many, many different\ntypes of devices, you have a laptop,\n\n69\n00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.390\ntablets, we showed you on\nmobile phones as well.\n\n70\n00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.390\nWell, what if the device that you\npotentially want to run the application on\n\n71\n00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.240\nhas limited CPU, computing power?\n\n72\n00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.470\nHas, well, the network bandwidth,\nthat's gonna be one that you\n\n73\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.410\nhave to make sure there's plenty\nof good network communications,\n\n74\n00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.350\ncuz remember you're\nconnecting to the cloud.\n\n75\n00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.150\nBut what if you don't have\nenough storage space, or\n\n76\n00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.860\nyou don't have enough memory\nto support the application?\n\n77\n00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.170\nWell, with Azure RemoteApp,\n\n78\n00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.190\nthat's perfectly fine, because keep\nin mind, it isn't the local machine,\n\n79\n00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.901\nit isn't the local machine that's\nactually running the application.\n\n80\n00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.610\nThe other thing too with\nthe Azure RemoteApp\n\n81\n00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.140\nis you have service health monitoring.\n\n82\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.250\nI can see what is the condition\nof the platform right now.\n\n83\n00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.200\nIf I have application\ninstances that are spun up and\n\n84\n00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.110\nthere are people connecting to them, I\nmight wanna be able to monitor the quality\n\n85\n00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.380\nof the service that they have\nby going to that Azure Remote,\n\n86\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.587\nor really just the Azure interface itself\nand looking at the service health.\n\n87\n00:04:59.587 --> 00:05:03.790\n>> Now Wes, you've been talking about\nall the great benefits of RemoteApp, but\n\n88\n00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.890\nare there any drawbacks?\n\n89\n00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.715\nAre there any cons to our pros?\n\n90\n00:05:06.715 --> 00:05:09.790\n>> Yeah, it's always give and take, right?\n\n91\n00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.510\nAnd I'm sure some of you have probably\ncome from other trades out there.\n\n92\n00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.810\nIf you got one benefit, you're gonna\nhave something that might be a drawback.\n\n93\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.640\nAnd the big drawback with\nthe Azure RemoteApp is that it\n\n94\n00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.260\ndoes require internet connectivity.\n\n95\n00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.690\nSome of the other benefits that you see,\nwhat about remote locations?\n\n96\n00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.790\nWhat if you're off premise?\n\n97\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.180\nWell, keep in mind that all they need is\nan RDP connection and they can support it.\n\n98\n00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.220\nBut there again RDP connection, that\ndrawback, again coming back to the fact\n\n99\n00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.960\nthat if you don't have network\nconnectivity, you aren't gonna connect to\n\n100\n00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.670\nthe application and that could be\na productivity hinderance there.\n\n101\n00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.460\nIt's also good too, for\nBYOD scenarios, likewise.\n\n102\n00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.720\nIf we have these small devices that we\nwanna run applications, well think about\n\n103\n00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.740\nit, a lot of times they don't run x86,\nor x64, 32 bit, 64 bit, applications.\n\n104\n00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.700\nAgain, another benefit,\n\n105\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.695\nyou get around some of the compatibility\nissues inside of the RemoteApp.\n\n106\n00:06:09.695 --> 00:06:13.655\nI would say the last thing here for\nRemoteApp to keep in mind there Dan,\n\n107\n00:06:13.655 --> 00:06:16.035\nis a simplified user experience.\n\n108\n00:06:16.035 --> 00:06:19.238\nAll the user has to do is\ngo to their start menu, and\n\n109\n00:06:19.238 --> 00:06:21.815\ntheir RemoteApp is right\nthere in the start menu.\n\n110\n00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:25.065\nAnd it looks no different than the tile\nthat's sitting next to it that says\n\n111\n00:06:25.065 --> 00:06:26.300\nthe Windows Store.\n\n112\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.260\nTo them, they don't realize that all\nthe stuff behind the scenes that\n\n113\n00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.580\nyou're studying and we're telling you\nhere, they don't realize that it's going\n\n114\n00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.210\nout over the network, it's connecting\nthat server, and that's a great thing.\n\n115\n00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.120\nBecause the less the user has to get\ninvolved with the knowledge behind\n\n116\n00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.110\nthe scenes, the better\nexperience is gonna be for them,\n\n117\n00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.550\nthey don't need to know\nif it works out not.\n\n118\n00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.870\nOr that's really the only thing,\n\n119\n00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.835\nthey don't want you to know how it works,\njust that it works.\n\n120\n00:06:50.835 --> 00:06:52.950\nSo, RemoteApp does have its situations,\n\n121\n00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.730\nI would pay attention on the exam,\nif they give you a situation or\n\n122\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.090\nscenario where you're not allowed\nto have internet connectivity, for\n\n123\n00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.380\nwhatever reason, RemoteApp is not\ngonna be the solution for you.\n\n124\n00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.310\n>> I'll tell you my favorite benefit\nto using something like RemoteApp is\n\n125\n00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.180\nthe fact that it's\na ubiquitous environment.\n\n126\n00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.055\nI don't have to worry that Sally\nover here is running Office 2012, or\n\n127\n00:07:14.055 --> 00:07:19.045\nwhatever and Jim Bob is running Office\n365, there's a different environment.\n\n128\n00:07:19.045 --> 00:07:20.425\nOkay, well he wants to do this,\n\n129\n00:07:20.425 --> 00:07:22.775\nnow I gotta figure out how\nto do it in Office 365.\n\n130\n00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:26.952\nOr for whatever reason, this person's\nrunning Office 2003 and they love it,\n\n131\n00:07:26.952 --> 00:07:29.492\nand it's tried and true, and they're\nnever gonna get rid of it, you're gonna\n\n132\n00:07:29.492 --> 00:07:33.092\nhave to pry it from their cold dead hands,\nI no longer have to worry about that.\n\n133\n00:07:33.092 --> 00:07:35.531\nEverybody is always running an up to date,\n\n134\n00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:38.188\ncurrent version of what\nwe use in our company.\n\n135\n00:07:38.188 --> 00:07:42.265\nAll I gotta know is that product and\nI don't have to worry about supporting\n\n136\n00:07:42.265 --> 00:07:46.801\nthem and helping in installing and running\nupdates for it, I update it on my end and\n\n137\n00:07:46.801 --> 00:07:51.140\nwhen they access it it's already ready\nto go they just have to use the product,\n\n138\n00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.829\nand that's the biggest\nbenefit in my opinion.\n\n139\n00:07:53.829 --> 00:07:58.636\n>> Definitely absolutely,\nkeep in mind the drawbacks.\n\n140\n00:07:58.636 --> 00:08:02.313\nYou don't have an Internet connection, you\ncan't use the Remote Azure, or excuse me,\n\n141\n00:08:02.313 --> 00:08:03.760\nAzure Remote App.\n\n142\n00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.060\nNow the next one that we talked\nabout was Microsoft Intune, right?\n\n143\n00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:12.010\nAnd with Microsoft Intune, there are\nseveral benefits that we can discuss here,\n\n144\n00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.590\nand again, if you look,\nI've got another little diagram here.\n\n145\n00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.440\nWe talk about centralize that you're\ngonna see the consistency in this, right?\n\n146\n00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.630\nIn any enterprise environment,\nany business enterprise,\n\n147\n00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.780\nyou want centralized administration.\n\n148\n00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.070\nNow, one of the great things that we also\nhave, as you've seen with various mobile\n\n149\n00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:33.130\ndevices that we deployed into,\nBYOD scenarios, right?\n\n150\n00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.370\nHow are these devices managed?\n\n151\n00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.880\nWell, if they can be joined to the domain,\nI've got a tried and\n\n152\n00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.280\ntrue technology active directory.\n\n153\n00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.300\nBeen around for a long time.\n\n154\n00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.870\nBeen around since 2000, right?\n\n155\n00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.950\nBut the problem is not everyone of these\ndevices can become a domain member.\n\n156\n00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.690\nThey cannot join my domain, right?\n\n157\n00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.350\nI got, if you got an R-T device,\nif you got a Windows mobile phone, right,\n\n158\n00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.650\nif you got I-O-S device, they're not\ngonna be able to join your domain.\n\n159\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.890\nSo this gives you the ability to\nreach out across the Internet.\n\n160\n00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.115\nAnd that's the other thing it\ndoesn't have to be on-premise.\n\n161\n00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:05.630\nIt can on-premise, off-premise,\n\n162\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:10.000\nremote locations the moment that device\nconnects to a network and has Internet\n\n163\n00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.730\nconnectivity you as the administrator\nhave reachability, and the user\n\n164\n00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.330\nHas the reachability to applications\nthat you've deployed, if you will.\n\n165\n00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.240\nAnd like we've seen in some of the past\nepisodes that we did on Intune,\n\n166\n00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.570\nyou can see all the devices that\nthey've got currently enrolled,\n\n167\n00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:30.370\nwhether it be a desktop, an Android phone,\nwhether it be like the iPad that we\n\n168\n00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.550\ndeploy to, and they can also check\nthing like compliance, right?\n\n169\n00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.240\nWe talked about things like compliance and\nconfiguration management.\n\n170\n00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.600\nI wanna be able to\nconfigure these devices.\n\n171\n00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.400\nThere again, if they can join the domain,\nwe'll just push out settings in a GPO, and\n\n172\n00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.809\nwe can configure\nthe settings that we want.\n\n173\n00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.130\nBut that's the drawback again, right?\n\n174\n00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.640\nWith that trend people want\nthat familiarity being able to\n\n175\n00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.960\nuse a device that they feel comfortable\nwith, and as administrators we want\n\n176\n00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.620\nthe ability to secure those devices and\ncontrol what they have access to.\n\n177\n00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.950\nAnd we can do that through things\nlike configuration management.\n\n178\n00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.960\nWe can do that to things\nlike compliance management.\n\n179\n00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.710\nThe other thing that we have is\nthe ability to do software provisioning.\n\n180\n00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.390\nSoftware deployment.\n\n181\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.080\nThat is very, very important.\n\n182\n00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.650\nRemote locations, imagine the ability\nthat a phone gets lost, right?\n\n183\n00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.540\nThe phone gets lost and Dan calls me\nup cuz I'm in front of the interface,\n\n184\n00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.360\nhe's traveling says man I left\nmy phone at such and such place.\n\n185\n00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.630\nIt's got some company data on it.\n\n186\n00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.530\nOr even better yet, I don't even\nknow if it's got company data.\n\n187\n00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.740\nWell, I can do a remote wipe on it, right?\n\n188\n00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.660\nI can do a selective wipe that says I just\nwanna take care of the business data.\n\n189\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.840\nI don't wanna touch Dan's data,\npictures of family and stuff.\n\n190\n00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.660\nBut Dan might say I don't\nknow where the phone is,\n\n191\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.510\nmost likely I'm not gonna get it back.\n\n192\n00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.447\nThen we might opt for a full wipe,\nwhich not only takes our business data,\n\n193\n00:10:53.447 --> 00:10:56.368\nit would also eradicate any\ndata that Dan has there, so\n\n194\n00:10:56.368 --> 00:10:58.357\nit won't fall into the wrong hands.\n\n195\n00:10:58.357 --> 00:10:59.796\nSo.\n>> I hate to admit this but\n\n196\n00:10:59.796 --> 00:11:01.440\nI've actually done that.\n\n197\n00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.460\nI left my phone, I was at Guitar Center.\n\n198\n00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.251\nTook it off my belt clip, and\nstuck it on top of an amplifier, and\n\n199\n00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:07.823\nthat was the last time I ever saw it.\n\n200\n00:11:07.823 --> 00:11:08.534\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n201\n00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:12.862\nI had a friend that they had to do this to\nbecause he left his device in an airport.\n\n202\n00:11:12.862 --> 00:11:16.539\nAnd all he did is he walked over and\nwhen he come back somebody,\n\n203\n00:11:16.539 --> 00:11:19.108\nfive finger discount, they're mobile.\n\n204\n00:11:19.108 --> 00:11:20.431\n[LAUGH]\n>> They are mobile.\n\n205\n00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:21.500\n[LAUGH]\n>> And they will leave you.\n\n206\n00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.070\nSo, yeah, he called into one of the senior\nadministrators, and said this is what's\n\n207\n00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:29.460\ngoing on, and right away they did\na remote wipe on it and eradicated it.\n\n208\n00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.350\nSo it is, the ability if you\nwill to remotely manage these\n\n209\n00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:38.630\ndevices that otherwise you couldn't\nmanage with traditional means,\n\n210\n00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.880\nbecomes a very big benefit.\n\n211\n00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.790\nThe last one I would say\nthat's a very good benefit is\n\n212\n00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.030\nend point protection, right?\n\n213\n00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.450\nEnd point protection is important because\n\n214\n00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.770\nif they are devices that are in\nour networks, again G-P-O's,\n\n215\n00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.320\nwe can apply firewalls,\nwe can push out end point protection.\n\n216\n00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.390\nBut how can we do that on a device that\nis sitting in somebodys pocket, right?\n\n217\n00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.939\nWell, that's where Intune also benefits.\n\n218\n00:11:59.939 --> 00:12:02.725\nRemember that we showed you\ncan set policies, right?\n\n219\n00:12:02.725 --> 00:12:06.660\nWe can set configuration policies, right?\n\n220\n00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.730\nWindows firewall settings we can control\nwith those Intune agent settings policies.\n\n221\n00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:16.860\nRemember that we can control things like\nend point protection and how scams happen.\n\n222\n00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:21.950\nThe other thing that's great about Intune\ntoday is the fact that it integrates\n\n223\n00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.510\nwith Office365.\n\n224\n00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.490\nSo you don't have two different locations.\n\n225\n00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.060\nIf you log in to your Office365 to\nmanage it as an administrator and\n\n226\n00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.060\nyou scroll all the way down on\nthe left hand side, you'll see\n\n227\n00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.330\nIntune at the bottom, and when you launch\nthat it will launch that Intune interface.\n\n228\n00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:41.410\nSo, again, part of that centralized\nadministration, which is a really,\n\n229\n00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.120\nreally good thing.\n\n230\n00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.630\nNow, Dan, just like remote\napp it does have a drawback.\n\n231\n00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:52.215\nAnd one of the drawbacks with this one is\nagain going to be Internet connectivity.\n\n232\n00:12:52.215 --> 00:12:56.373\nYou have to have Internet connectivity\nin order to manage these devices.\n\n233\n00:12:56.373 --> 00:13:00.177\nIf not, we can't push out policies,\nthe devices can't check compliance,\n\n234\n00:13:00.177 --> 00:13:04.350\nthere's no communication between the cloud\nbased platform and the device itself.\n\n235\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.250\nSo keep in mind Intune\nis a great solution for\n\n236\n00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:12.210\nthings like mobile phones, iOS devices,\nand really desktops as well.\n\n237\n00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:15.630\nBut if it's a desktop and\nit can be joined to the domain,\n\n238\n00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.540\nlet's just tell you it's probably\ngoing to be joined to the domain and\n\n239\n00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.590\ncontrolled throughout Active Directory.\n\n240\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.530\nBut there are scenarios where you\nmight have somebody that's working at\n\n241\n00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.165\nhome, right?\n\n242\n00:13:23.165 --> 00:13:25.465\nSomebody that's working at\nhome's got a Pro device or\n\n243\n00:13:25.465 --> 00:13:27.665\nmaybe the Pro devices can\nbe joined to the domain, so\n\n244\n00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:31.840\nthat's not really an accurate description\nthere, but like a home device.\n\n245\n00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.905\nIt doesn't have a domain\njoin capabilities,\n\n246\n00:13:33.905 --> 00:13:35.770\nand if I've got somebody\nthat's working from home and\n\n247\n00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.830\nwants to connect back into the network,\nhow do I manage their device?\n\n248\n00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:44.380\nWell, there again, I can join it to the\nIntune and I have some type of control.\n\n249\n00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.536\nI can define what policies I want and\nwe can do some security on them.\n\n250\n00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:52.159\nSo Dan, in tune it can be a bit complex.\n\n251\n00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:53.599\nIt can be a little intimidating.\n\n252\n00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:57.934\nBut when you start to learn some of the\ndifferent pieces, you really start to see\n\n253\n00:13:57.934 --> 00:14:02.658\nthat it is a good integrated solution, and\nthey've even integrated it now into Office\n\n254\n00:14:02.658 --> 00:14:07.275\n365, so you're starting to see that\nunified interface for single management.\n\n255\n00:14:07.275 --> 00:14:11.840\nSo Intune, I think is something that\nnot only should you know for the exam,\n\n256\n00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.160\nyou should do the labs, you should get in\nthere, try your free trials, and then know\n\n257\n00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.030\na lot about the platform in general\nwhen you're going into the exam booth.\n\n258\n00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:24.960\n>> Yeah Wes, Intune is really becoming\nlike a poor man's system center, right?\n\n259\n00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.780\nIt really has a lot of functionality,\n\n260\n00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.740\na lot of features for\nadministrating devices on your network.\n\n261\n00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.100\nAnd all you have to do is say,\n\n262\n00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.390\nhey I'll join you to this Intune business,\nand now I have some sort of control,\n\n263\n00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.790\nyou can have access to resources\nthat we have available for you.\n\n264\n00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.140\nIt's a really nice piece of software.\n\n265\n00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.180\nUnfortunately there's always,\nI like to say a roach in the taco.\n\n266\n00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.283\n[LAUGH] Which is you gotta\nhave Internet connectivity but\n\n267\n00:14:49.283 --> 00:14:50.807\nwe live in a connected age.\n\n268\n00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:56.520\nSo that's really gonna be a minimal\ndownside to be honest with you.\n\n269\n00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.890\n>> Yeah and you gotta find what\nthe limitations are because, again,\n\n270\n00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.900\nlike Dan says,\nit's not always a one size fits all.\n\n271\n00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.540\nAnd there might be things that you\njust absolutely love about it, but\n\n272\n00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.080\nyou might look at it and\nsay okay there's 10% of it that I use and\n\n273\n00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.190\nthe other 80% I don't, so\nit might not be worth your while.\n\n274\n00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.610\nThat's all up to you, but\nyou still have to know it for the exam.\n\n275\n00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.910\nNow, there is another one\nthat we've talked about too.\n\n276\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.335\nWe talked about the application\nvirtualization software known as\n\n277\n00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:23.320\nApp-V that comes from\nthe Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack.\n\n278\n00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.270\nNow, that's another one that\nyou need to be aware of.\n\n279\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:29.210\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look at\na couple of the benefits of App-V here.\n\n280\n00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.570\nOne of the biggest benefits I would\nsay is application coexistence.\n\n281\n00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.044\nSee, if you were before Azure remote app,\nand\n\n282\n00:15:35.044 --> 00:15:39.372\nyou can still set up remote app on-premise\nand you can manage it and maintain it.\n\n283\n00:15:39.372 --> 00:15:43.635\nBut if I wanted applications to be\ncoexisting, let's say I had app 1, 2, 3,\n\n284\n00:15:43.635 --> 00:15:47.709\n4 and I want people to be able to use them\nall at the same time, well I'd have to\n\n285\n00:15:47.709 --> 00:15:51.416\ncreate four different individual\ninstances of these applications,\n\n286\n00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:54.909\nfour different remote apps, and\nthen publish them out that way.\n\n287\n00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:57.372\nWell, that's a lot of extra setup,\na lot of extra time and\n\n288\n00:15:57.372 --> 00:15:58.891\neffort that you have to go through.\n\n289\n00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:02.139\nRather than just taking your\napp via virtualization or\n\n290\n00:16:02.139 --> 00:16:06.800\nyour application virtualization sequencer,\nsequencing the application,\n\n291\n00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.060\nit isolates it and sandboxes it, and\nnow you can run it App1 and App2.\n\n292\n00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.870\nIf they're different versions of the app,\nthey can run side by side.\n\n293\n00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.399\nThey don't interfere with each other.\n\n294\n00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:18.230\nThe other thing that's good about App-V,\nand\n\n295\n00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:23.628\nthis is one of the things to keep in mind,\nis that you can deploy the software.\n\n296\n00:16:23.628 --> 00:16:26.740\nWhen it creates that virtualization\npackage, you can deploy\n\n297\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:31.650\nthe software through traditional ESDs or\nElectronic Software Distribution Points.\n\n298\n00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:32.810\nNow that's a big fancy word.\n\n299\n00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.750\nWill it give you an obvious one, right?\n\n300\n00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.930\nActive Directory, that's an ESD,\nElectronic Software Distribution Point.\n\n301\n00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.106\nWhy?\nCuz I can take MSI files and ESI's,\n\n302\n00:16:40.106 --> 00:16:43.740\nand I believe it's just the MSI file,\nand I can push them out, and\n\n303\n00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.150\nI can deploy software that way,\nand that's one of the benefits.\n\n304\n00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.080\nNow it's kind of interesting cuz Dan and\nI were having this conversation.\n\n305\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.006\nWe were saying well with RemoteApp today,\nis there really a necessity for\n\n306\n00:16:54.006 --> 00:16:57.640\nApp-V, cuz it kinda seems like\nRemoteApp does the same thing?\n\n307\n00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.230\nAnd he's absolutely correct.\n\n308\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:07.120\nThere is one scenario where you might be\nwanting to use App-V instead of RemoteApp,\n\n309\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.800\nand that is when you have some\nother things going on, right?\n\n310\n00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.390\nI have firewall concerns.\n\n311\n00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.850\nMaybe I've got a series\nof computers that are not\n\n312\n00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:16.880\nallowed to connect out to the Internet.\n\n313\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.840\nWell, remember that's one of\nthe drawbacks to RemoteApp.\n\n314\n00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.710\nIf I can't connect to the Internet,\n\n315\n00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:25.260\nI can't communicate with the instances of\nthat application running in the cloud.\n\n316\n00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.690\nWhat if you've got Internet restrictions?\n\n317\n00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.260\nWhich all of these really\ncould all tie together,\n\n318\n00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.870\nthey could be one concept if\nyou really think about it.\n\n319\n00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.170\nMaybe you're in a managed environment\nwhere there is no Internet communication.\n\n320\n00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.950\nThere isn't any communication\nout to the Internet except for\n\n321\n00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.690\nmaybe a couple select computers.\n\n322\n00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.770\nGuess what?\n\n323\n00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:43.830\nThere again, that's gonna hinder your\nchances of running remote app if you can't\n\n324\n00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.000\nconnect to the Azure platform.\n\n325\n00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.710\nIf you've got security policies.\n\n326\n00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.710\nAnd, again, you could see there's kind\nof like a blurring of the line here.\n\n327\n00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.140\nThey could all be wrapped up into one.\n\n328\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.530\nIf you've got security policies that\nsay you can only connect via a proxy.\n\n329\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:59.330\nAnd maybe the proxy's causing problems,\nor something like that.\n\n330\n00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.030\nAnd you're not getting\nthe full connectivity.\n\n331\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:04.420\nWell, it might just be easy\nto sequence an application.\n\n332\n00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:08.460\nAnd then copy it out to a few desktops,\nso that it can run locally.\n\n333\n00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.890\nNow, I want you to pay attention to\nsomething on the exam for this one.\n\n334\n00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.870\nInternet connectivity is not required,\n\n335\n00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.510\nwhich might be a choice as to why you\nwould choose App-V over RemoteApp.\n\n336\n00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.940\nHowever, there is a drawback, okay?\n\n337\n00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:25.280\nThe machine itself has to meet the minimum\nrequirements of the application.\n\n338\n00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.410\nAnd why is that?\n\n339\n00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.200\nYes, we get the benefit of application\ncoexistence, cuz they're sandboxed and\n\n340\n00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.440\nthey're not communicating with each other,\nbut\n\n341\n00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.675\nthe problem is they're\nstill running locally.\n\n342\n00:18:35.675 --> 00:18:40.470\nOkay, if you deploy App-V, you have\nto deploy App-V, the packaged app,\n\n343\n00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:44.810\nsequenced app, to a machine that meets\nthe minimum requirements, right?\n\n344\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.620\nSo here's where we start to get the\ncomparison between remote app and App-V,\n\n345\n00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.090\nas a remote app choice, right?\n\n346\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.750\nIf I've got Internet connectivity, and\nthat's not a problem, I might go with\n\n347\n00:18:54.750 --> 00:19:00.210\nsomething like RemoteApp over App-V,\ncuz it's an easier solution.\n\n348\n00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.960\nBecause if my devices that\nI try to deploy App-V\n\n349\n00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.530\ndon't support the application that\nI'm deploying, they can't run them.\n\n350\n00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:11.960\nSo even though they're virtualized,\nthey still use the local resources.\n\n351\n00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:17.290\nNow, one of the good things too, that you\nalso have is with App-V's virtualization,\n\n352\n00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.510\nthat sequencing of the application there,\n\n353\n00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.860\nis that you do get almost like\nan isolated instance the application, and\n\n354\n00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.290\nthat might be good for, Dan,\nlike a security benefit, right?\n\n355\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.120\nIt's why one of the reasons we\nuse virtualized infrastructure in\n\n356\n00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.780\ngeneral, right?\n\n357\n00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.950\nBut this is just\na virtualized application, so\n\n358\n00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.050\nit gives us protection from the hardware.\n\n359\n00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:39.080\nAll good things again Dan, one of\nthe things I would always remember though,\n\n360\n00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.002\nis that it uses local resources, and\n\n361\n00:19:41.002 --> 00:19:44.542\nthat your device is gonna have to\nmeet those minimum requirements.\n\n362\n00:19:44.542 --> 00:19:46.622\n>> All right, well App-V, very cool,\n\n363\n00:19:46.622 --> 00:19:50.393\nand when you need it it is there even\nthough we tend to use RemoteApp but\n\n364\n00:19:50.393 --> 00:19:54.180\nthere is those instances where you\nmight want to jump over to App-V.\n\n365\n00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.330\nThat being, we got one more to cover and\nthat is Office 365.\n\n366\n00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.040\nTell us the benefits,\nthe great wonders, that's Office 365.\n\n367\n00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.555\n>> The honorable mention here, for sure.\n\n368\n00:20:04.555 --> 00:20:06.888\nOffice 365 has a lot of benefits, and\n\n369\n00:20:06.888 --> 00:20:11.361\nI'm gonna set you up with a scenario\nbefore we even go into the Office 365.\n\n370\n00:20:11.361 --> 00:20:13.925\nAnd it helped me out this morning that,\n\n371\n00:20:13.925 --> 00:20:17.930\nyou might be most likely\nwatching it on the recording.\n\n372\n00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:22.471\nSo this morning Office 365 came into\na benefit, and I'll tell you why, Dan.\n\n373\n00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:24.728\nSo I'm so used to setting,\nmy wife works for\n\n374\n00:20:24.728 --> 00:20:29.001\nan organization that she commonly needs to\nremote into her computer from our home,\n\n375\n00:20:29.001 --> 00:20:32.240\nover the Internet,\nback into our work computer.\n\n376\n00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.663\nWell today,\nI was going through that process and\n\n377\n00:20:34.663 --> 00:20:38.340\nI didn't realize that the company\nshe works for deployed Office 365.\n\n378\n00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.014\nSo I'm trying to set up the RDP file,\nthe RDS Server,\n\n379\n00:20:42.014 --> 00:20:45.620\nthe Remote Desktop Gateway Server and\neverything.\n\n380\n00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.820\nWhat's the IP?\n\n381\n00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.730\nDo I have the right address?\n\n382\n00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:49.260\nAnd I set it up.\n\n383\n00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.610\nThe beach is that way, and then she\ncomes in and she goes to click and\n\n384\n00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:55.490\nshe goes, it's not connecting.\n\n385\n00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.410\nI said, okay,\nhold on a second, she goes no,\n\n386\n00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.210\nI don't even need that,\nall I need's an Internet connection.\n\n387\n00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:03.050\nBecause they deployed Office 365,\nI can get to the storage,\n\n388\n00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.250\nI can get the one drive,\nI can get to everything in the cloud,\n\n389\n00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:08.330\nand that right there is one\nof first benefits of it.\n\n390\n00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.320\nBeing able to access that\ninformation regardless of where you\n\n391\n00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.570\nare at as long as you have a web browser.\n\n392\n00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:16.250\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n393\n00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.430\nlook at some of the other benefits\nthat you get with the Office 365.\n\n394\n00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.300\nHere again,\nwe get the centralized administration.\n\n395\n00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:26.180\nYou might start to see a trend\nwith that one, yeah, definitely.\n\n396\n00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.770\nI wanna talk a little bit about\nthe applications themselves.\n\n397\n00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.560\nCentralized application deployment, right?\n\n398\n00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.610\nCentralized application management.\n\n399\n00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:36.920\nAll right, all your licensing,\nthat's a big thing, right?\n\n400\n00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.470\nLicensing, if your company deploys\nsoftware that maybe they're not\n\n401\n00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.460\nlicensed for, that's a big no-no.\n\n402\n00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.230\nThat can cost thousands and\ntens of thousands of dollars in fines.\n\n403\n00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.552\nOne of the good things about Office\n365 is when your users connect,\n\n404\n00:21:49.552 --> 00:21:51.085\nyou know what your license are.\n\n405\n00:21:51.085 --> 00:21:55.181\nSo you don't have to worry about things\nlike license compliance issues because\n\n406\n00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:59.166\nit's part of the software assurance\npolicy when you get your Office 365.\n\n407\n00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:02.010\nSo application management\nis something that you get.\n\n408\n00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.840\nHere's another thing Dan.\n\n409\n00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.770\nI think you probably had\nto deal with this before.\n\n410\n00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.580\nYou ever work for a company that your\nsoftware, you've been using it for\n\n411\n00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.130\na little bit, and now all of a sudden it's\nno longer worth it's weight in gold, and\n\n412\n00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.560\nnow it's time to update?\n\n413\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.250\n>> Yeah.\n\n414\n00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.390\n>> I'll tell you what.\n\n415\n00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:20.820\nThat ends up becoming a very,\nvery intricate and\n\n416\n00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:26.800\ncomplex task to take a piece of\nsoftware that's maybe on 500 devices,\n\n417\n00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.850\nnow we've got to upgrade, right?\n\n418\n00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:35.870\nWell, we could deploy it out\nthrough again Active Directory.\n\n419\n00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.930\nWhat happens if you could say\nthe updates of that software,\n\n420\n00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.330\nwe're gonna leave it in the cloud?\n\n421\n00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.480\nLet's let the cloud provider,\nin this case,\n\n422\n00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.480\nMicrosoft, let's let them\nworry about the updates.\n\n423\n00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.120\nAnd all we have to do is say,\nthere's a new version coming out.\n\n424\n00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.830\nGuess what, we're gonna connect to it and\ndownload it.\n\n425\n00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.110\nI don't need to worry about it anymore,\nright?\n\n426\n00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:57.030\nThe other benefit, too,\nis that you have single sign-on, right?\n\n427\n00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.730\nI don't have to worry about\ndifferent passwords and user names.\n\n428\n00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.550\nYour users can log into\nOffice 365 provided that\n\n429\n00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.950\nthey've got an account provision.\n\n430\n00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.140\nThat is something you need to do first.\n\n431\n00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.180\nBut once they've got that account\nprovision, they can log into PowerPoint,\n\n432\n00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.430\nthey can log into OneNote,\nthey can log into Excel, their email,\n\n433\n00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.529\nall through that single interface.\n\n434\n00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.920\nAnd this also goes back to\na couple of the same things too,\n\n435\n00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.540\nsimplified user experience.\n\n436\n00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.790\nAll I have to do is connect.\n\n437\n00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:25.400\nYou know what,\nmaybe my computer doesn't support\n\n438\n00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.790\nthe local installation of the Office apps.\n\n439\n00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.890\nWhich you can do, but you don't have to.\n\n440\n00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:31.580\nWhy?\n\n441\n00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.880\nWell I can connect to the web app itself.\n\n442\n00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.550\nAnd just like any cloud based solution,\nsoftware as a service,\n\n443\n00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:41.050\nlike we talked about in many different\nepisodes here at ITProTV, I now get\n\n444\n00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:45.210\nthe benefit that as long as I got an\nInternet connection, I can connect to it.\n\n445\n00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.300\nI can use it online.\n\n446\n00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.040\nI can save my data online, and\nit gets stored right over in OneDrive.\n\n447\n00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:50.540\nAnd guess what?\n\n448\n00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.920\nIt's transparent to our end users.\n\n449\n00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.160\nAnd remember, transparency to\nyour end user's experience is\n\n450\n00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.460\nalways gonna make it much better on the\nadmins behind it that have to support it.\n\n451\n00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.730\nOne of the last things I'll say, too,\nis just like some of the other technology,\n\n452\n00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:07.970\nespecially with Azure Remote out,\nis the ability to have\n\n453\n00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:12.838\nremote locations connect on-premise,\noff-premise, doesn't matter.\n\n454\n00:24:12.838 --> 00:24:14.330\nAll you need's the web browser.\n\n455\n00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:18.530\nSo keep in mind one of\nthe drawbacks to this one.\n\n456\n00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.410\nAgain, it all centers around\nthat Internet connection.\n\n457\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.420\nBut know the differences, know in\nsome of the scenarios that you would\n\n458\n00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.970\nuse these different solutions for\nthe exam.\n\n459\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.090\nIn case they set you up with a scenario,\n\n460\n00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.470\nbe able to differentiate which one you'll\nuse, and you should be doing good.\n\n461\n00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:35.100\n>> All right, Wes.\n\n462\n00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.330\nWell, thanks for this laundry list of\nawesomeness that comes from Microsoft,\n\n463\n00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.110\ngiving us a list of benefits and\n\n464\n00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.955\nfeatures that we get with\nour mobile device solutions.\n\n465\n00:24:43.955 --> 00:24:48.530\nConnect those mobile devices, it's just\nthe world we live in, so we've gotta start\n\n466\n00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:52.086\nsupporting it, and Windows X does that and\nalso Intune, App-V,\n\n467\n00:24:52.086 --> 00:24:56.804\nall the other great stuff we named today,\nOffice 365, as well as RemoteApp as well.\n\n468\n00:24:56.804 --> 00:25:00.319\nAll right, that being said, Wes,\nit looks like we've wrapped up the show.\n\n469\n00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:04.893\nI thank you so much for stopping by and\nteaching our good folks, and even myself,\n\n470\n00:25:04.893 --> 00:25:06.900\nall about these technologies.\n\n471\n00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.430\nWe appreciate you guys watching but\nit is time to sign off.\n\n472\n00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.090\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n473\n00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:13.967\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n474\n00:25:13.967 --> 00:25:14.991\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n475\n00:25:16.230

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:17.920\nI'm your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n4\n00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.790\nHere with me today,\nwell it's Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.534\nHow's it going Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:21.520\n>> Oh, it's going great Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.320\nI'm excited to be here because we're going\nto be doing our Windows 10 shows and\n\n8\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.060\nin this episode we're going\nto be going into shares.\n\n9\n00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.390\nA lot of different kinds of shares.\n\n10\n00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.293\nShared printers, shared folders,\nshared home groups.\n\n11\n00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:34.290\n>> We're back in kindergarten.\n\n12\n00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.696\nWe're learning how to share today,\nladies and gentleman.\n\n13\n00:00:36.696 --> 00:00:37.532\nAnd hey, you know what?\n\n14\n00:00:37.532 --> 00:00:38.910\nSharing is a good thing.\n\n15\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.810\nEspecially when it comes to our computers.\n\n16\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.020\nWe want to be able to share not\nnecessarily just the resources, but\n\n17\n00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.790\nsome of the things that we have on them.\n\n18\n00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.360\nFiles, emails, things of that nature,\nwe'll be able to share this stuff out so\n\n19\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.960\nthat hey, if Mike needs that copy\nof that document, not a problem.\n\n20\n00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.070\nHe can gain access to it even\nif it's located on my machine.\n\n21\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.280\nSo we have a few different ways in which\nwe can do some sharing using Windows 10.\n\n22\n00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.740\nAnd we're gonna explore those today and\n\n23\n00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.930\nsee how we can optimize that\nto our own environments.\n\n24\n00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.600\nMikey, you've done a little\nbit of sharing in your past.\n\n25\n00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.136\n>> Once or twice.\n\n26\n00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.134\nSharing is caring.\n\n27\n00:01:11.134 --> 00:01:12.237\n>> That's right, sharing is caring.\n\n28\n00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:13.909\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n29\n00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.778\nlet's take a look at how we can\ngo about doing some sharing.\n\n30\n00:01:15.778 --> 00:01:19.449\nAs Daniel said, there's actually a few\ndifferent ways we can go about making\n\n31\n00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:23.570\nthings available to other people on\nthe network, sharing out these resources.\n\n32\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.690\nSo we're gonna explore a couple of them.\n\n33\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.161\nAnd I wanna start by just talking about a\nshare and just making sure we're clear on\n\n34\n00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:34.627\nwhat we mean, or if Microsoft in an exam,\nor us here, when we say share something\n\n35\n00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:39.459\nout, what we're really talking about is\nmaking it available on the network, right.\n\n36\n00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:43.810\nI've got stuff on my PC,\nI want Daniel to be able to access it.\n\n37\n00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.530\nWell, I could copy it to a thumb drive,\nthrow it over there,\n\n38\n00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.550\nhope I don't hit him in the head.\n\n39\n00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.270\nAnd he could plug it into his computer and\nhe could get access to that resource.\n\n40\n00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.130\nIf he makes changes to it, he's gonna\nhave to copy back to the thumb drive,\n\n41\n00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.190\nhe's gonna have to throw it back at me,\nI gotta, that kind of thing.\n\n42\n00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.300\nIt's just not that easy or\nit's not convenient.\n\n43\n00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.010\nWhere as sharing something is\nmaking it available on the network.\n\n44\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.040\nHey, my computer's hooked up to the same\ncomputer Daniel's is, why don't I\n\n45\n00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.930\njust allow him to come across the network\nand get access to that resource?\n\n46\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.770\nAnd that's what we're talking\nabout when we talk about sharing.\n\n47\n00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.470\nAnd one of the big things that Microsoft's\ngonna call out on the exam is to make\n\n48\n00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.630\nsure we understand share permissions,\nright.\n\n49\n00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.040\nAnd we've got other episodes where\nwe deal with NTFS permissions.\n\n50\n00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.540\nI'm gonna mention those a couple of\ntimes in here bit we're not really\n\n51\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.580\ngoing over them.\n\n52\n00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.683\nThis one's focused on sharing and\n\n53\n00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:33.463\nit is a different set of permissions\nwhen it comes to sharing.\n\n54\n00:02:33.463 --> 00:02:37.021\nThey're not the same as NTFS, so\nwe've gotta make sure we understand them,\n\n55\n00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:40.280\nwhat they mean, how we apply them,\nand all that good stuff.\n\n56\n00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.850\nSo let's simply start by I've got\nour Windows 10 machine here, and\n\n57\n00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.479\nI'm gonna open up good old File Explorer.\n\n58\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.590\nAnd I'm going to maximize that for us.\n\n59\n00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.480\nNavigate over to my C drive, and\nI'm simply going to create a folder.\n\n60\n00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.770\nAnd I'm just gonna call it Data or\nsomething like that, right.\n\n61\n00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.190\nSo now I have a folder on my machine,\nbut only way anybody could\n\n62\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.208\naccess that folder at this point would\nbe to have a log-on on this machine.\n\n63\n00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:09.605\nIf they could come sit down and\n\n64\n00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:12.790\nlog-on to this machine,\nthey could gain access to the folder.\n\n65\n00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.420\nAnybody on the network, though,\nis not gonna be able to access that.\n\n66\n00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.400\nSo how do I make it available?\n\n67\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.800\nHow do I say hey Daniel,\ncome check out this folder.\n\n68\n00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.290\nIt's got some good stuff in there\nI want you to take a look at.\n\n69\n00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.670\nI have to share it,\nshare it with the network, right?\n\n70\n00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.030\nAnd that's what's gonna make\nit available to the network.\n\n71\n00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.100\nAnd as I said, there's several\ndifferent ways we can go about sharing.\n\n72\n00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.060\nSo I'm gonna show you a few of them.\n\n73\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.990\nThe first one,\nI'm gonna right click on this and\n\n74\n00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.230\nin that Context menu,\nthere's a Share With option, right?\n\n75\n00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.488\nAnd if I go over here, I could stop\nsharing it if was already being shared or\n\n76\n00:03:43.488 --> 00:03:45.288\nI can choose specific people.\n\n77\n00:03:45.288 --> 00:03:46.550\nSo this one is a shared get, right?\n\n78\n00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.190\nYou just saw me create it.\n\n79\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.209\nSo now I wanna make it\navailable to the network.\n\n80\n00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.800\nSo I'm gonna say specific people.\n\n81\n00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.320\nAnd I get this handy dandy little wizard.\n\n82\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.470\nAnd the first thing I do is I\nchoose who I want to share it with.\n\n83\n00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.700\nNow there's the everyone\ngroup listed there.\n\n84\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.690\nAnd remember the Everyone\ngroup means everyone.\n\n85\n00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.210\nThis could be guest accounts,\n\n86\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.667\nand things like that, so just keep\nthat in mind when you use Everyone.\n\n87\n00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:10.275\nLike in a corporate environment,\n\n88\n00:04:10.275 --> 00:04:13.490\nI'll tell you a better option is to\nuse the authenticated users group\n\n89\n00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.661\nbecause that's going to include everybody\nthat you're probably thinking of, right?\n\n90\n00:04:17.661 --> 00:04:20.830\nAll your co-workers,\nthe IT staff, things like that.\n\n91\n00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.680\nEverybody that has an account\nin your active directory domain,\n\n92\n00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.030\nusually a better option unless it's\na public resource or something like that.\n\n93\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.450\nSo I could choose Everyone,\n\n94\n00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.126\nbut if I'm not wanting to use the Everyone\ngroup I can choose Find People.\n\n95\n00:04:34.126 --> 00:04:38.597\nIt opens up a common dialog box that we\nhave probably seen in several shows, and\n\n96\n00:04:38.597 --> 00:04:40.720\nI can browse and find whoever I want.\n\n97\n00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.973\nI'll do Authenticated Users.\n\n98\n00:04:42.973 --> 00:04:46.150\nRemember, Authenticated Users\nincludes everybody that's logged in.\n\n99\n00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.630\nUsers and computers, for that matter.\n\n100\n00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.160\nAnd then, we'll click OK.\n\n101\n00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.099\nAnd then, for the permissions,\nthrough this wizard, I get a choice.\n\n102\n00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.152\nI've got either Read, or Read and Write.\n\n103\n00:04:57.152 --> 00:05:00.307\nAll right, and I'll go ahead and\nfor this first one,\n\n104\n00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:03.900\nlet's just say we want them to\nbe able to read this resource.\n\n105\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.440\nSo we'll choose Read and\nI'll click, Share.\n\n106\n00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.750\nAnd now it's gonna ask me and I'm not an\nadministrator on this machine evidently.\n\n107\n00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.980\nSo I will real quickly fill in\nan administrator user name and password.\n\n108\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.439\nWhich is a good learning point there.\n\n109\n00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:21.682\nYou do have to be an admin on\nthe local machine at least in order\n\n110\n00:05:21.682 --> 00:05:23.700\nto create that share.\n\n111\n00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.120\nAnd there you go, my share is created,\n\n112\n00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.620\nand it gives me a handy link here,\nshows me what the UNC path is gonna be.\n\n113\n00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.455\nRemember, UNC,\nuniversal naming convention.\n\n114\n00:05:32.455 --> 00:05:34.696\nBackslash, backslash,\nname of the computer.\n\n115\n00:05:34.696 --> 00:05:37.630\nBackslash, name of the share, right?\n\n116\n00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.460\nAnd I can email this to somebody,\nor copy and paste it, text it,\n\n117\n00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.520\nor what have you, so that they can\nnow get access to that folder.\n\n118\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.660\nI'll go ahead and click Done, all right?\n\n119\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.760\nAnd if I flip over to my server here and\nopen up File Explorer,\n\n120\n00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:02.390\nI should be able to go up in my address\nbar //client100/ and there's my share.\n\n121\n00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.181\nAnd now I'm connected.\n\n122\n00:06:04.181 --> 00:06:05.968\nNow, its empty I didn't\nput anything in it.\n\n123\n00:06:05.968 --> 00:06:10.728\nAnd I only gave myself I gave everybody\nread so let's see what it says.\n\n124\n00:06:10.728 --> 00:06:12.324\nBecause I'm an administrator,\n\n125\n00:06:12.324 --> 00:06:15.290\nI'm connecting as an administrator\nit is gonna let me write.\n\n126\n00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.448\nThat was a separate set of\npermissions listed over there.\n\n127\n00:06:18.448 --> 00:06:19.609\nSo there's my share.\n\n128\n00:06:19.609 --> 00:06:21.188\nThat's the basic way.\n\n129\n00:06:21.188 --> 00:06:23.576\nNow that wizard there Daniel,\nthat's what I call it, and\n\n130\n00:06:23.576 --> 00:06:25.660\nit's called the Basic Sharing Wizard.\n\n131\n00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.662\nAnd it's a very easy one to go through for\nany end user.\n\n132\n00:06:28.662 --> 00:06:32.913\nIf somebody, Joe office worker, wants\nto share something with somebody else,\n\n133\n00:06:32.913 --> 00:06:35.111\nit's quick, it's dirty, it's easy.\n\n134\n00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:37.073\nThat doesn't ask him a lot of questions.\n\n135\n00:06:37.073 --> 00:06:39.960\nMakes it very simple for them to do.\n\n136\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.310\nBut what we've gotta remember is that when\nyou connect to a resource on an NTFS file\n\n137\n00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.485\nsystem, there's another set of\npermissions that's always being checked.\n\n138\n00:06:48.485 --> 00:06:50.840\nAnd that's NTFS permissions, right?\n\n139\n00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.670\nThose are always checked,\nwhether you access the resource locally,\n\n140\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.680\nlike at the actual computer or whether\nyou go across the network to get to that\n\n141\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.630\nresource, NTFS permissions\nare always checked.\n\n142\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.180\nSo when you share something out,\nyou have to set the share permissions and\n\n143\n00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.470\nthe NTFS permissions.\n\n144\n00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.477\nYou have to set both.\n\n145\n00:07:08.477 --> 00:07:10.497\nNTFS always checked.\n\n146\n00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:15.410\nShare permissions only checked when you\ngo across the network to get to it.\n\n147\n00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.320\nIn other words if I gave you.\n\n148\n00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.590\nLet's see how I could say this.\n\n149\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:29.395\nIf you were to have NTFS full control but\nonly share read permissions.\n\n150\n00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:33.375\nWell, if you sit down locally and\naccess it, you're going to have\n\n151\n00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:37.805\nfull control because only NTFS is\nchecked you have NTFS full control.\n\n152\n00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:41.293\nIf you go across the network to get\nto that share, both are checked.\n\n153\n00:07:41.293 --> 00:07:45.781\nNTFS permissions, but you have to have\nfull control and shared permissions,\n\n154\n00:07:45.781 --> 00:07:47.625\nwhich I said you only have read.\n\n155\n00:07:47.625 --> 00:07:52.543\nWhen you go across the network like that,\nyou're going to combine NTFS and share.\n\n156\n00:07:52.543 --> 00:07:56.709\nPermission and\nit's the most restrictive of the two.\n\n157\n00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:01.340\nNTFS full control share read,\nwhich one's more restrictive?\n\n158\n00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.070\n>> Share read.\n\n159\n00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.250\n>> Share read, so you're gonna end\nup with just read permissions.\n\n160\n00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.140\nSo in other words,\n\n161\n00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.540\nif you go across the network to get\nto that folder, you could only read.\n\n162\n00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.220\nBut if you have sat down locally at the\nmachine, you'd actually have full control,\n\n163\n00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.330\nbecause share permissions aren't checked\nif you're not going across the network.\n\n164\n00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.155\nSo only when you go across the network,\na UNC path, a map network drive,\n\n165\n00:08:21.155 --> 00:08:24.502\nthat's when those share permissions\nare gonna get kicked in.\n\n166\n00:08:24.502 --> 00:08:28.200\nAnd you might think to yourself, well\nMike, you never said the NTFS permissions.\n\n167\n00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.780\nYou just said you had to do both,\nand you did not do it.\n\n168\n00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.320\nAnd you still got access.\n\n169\n00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.900\nThat's because of that\nbasic sharing wizard.\n\n170\n00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.730\nWhat that basic share wizard does is it,\nall right, this is probably somebody\n\n171\n00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:43.720\nthat's not an IT person creating a share,\nyou set the share permissions and\n\n172\n00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.170\nwe'll go ahead and make matching NTFS\npermissions for you in the background.\n\n173\n00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.480\nThat way, Joe Office Worker doesn't say,\nhey Bob, I shared this out.\n\n174\n00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.510\nYou should try to get to it now.\n\n175\n00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.670\nI can't get to it.\n\n176\n00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.960\nI don't know what's wrong.\n\n177\n00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.850\nThat kind of thing, right?\n\n178\n00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.310\nSo, it makes it very easy.\n\n179\n00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.421\nIn fact, let's go look.\n\n180\n00:08:58.421 --> 00:09:02.940\n[COUGH] If I pull up the properties for\nthis folder and go to the security,\n\n181\n00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:08.050\nyou'll see authenticated users and\nthey have read and\n\n182\n00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.960\nexecute, list contents, and read because\nI set that share permission read.\n\n183\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.910\nIt took care of the NTFS for me.\n\n184\n00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.080\nSo that's pretty handy.\n\n185\n00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.180\nLike I said, that's what makes it easy for\nthe end user because they don't have to\n\n186\n00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:24.175\nunderstand all that other stuff about\nwhat is an NT fee sepa permission right.\n\n187\n00:09:24.175 --> 00:09:27.630\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah totally anybody that's\never started to try to work with\n\n188\n00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.260\npermissions it can get a little hinky\npretty quickly because you're like okay so\n\n189\n00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.475\nwhen I get the most restrictive now\nwhich one's more restrictive than this?\n\n190\n00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:40.025\nAnd for that basic user, that gets very,\nvery difficult and very complex for them.\n\n191\n00:09:40.025 --> 00:09:42.305\nSo it's nice that Microsoft has said,\nyou know what?\n\n192\n00:09:42.305 --> 00:09:45.455\nWe'll make this easy for our basic users.\n\n193\n00:09:45.455 --> 00:09:46.765\nThey just wanna share a folder out?\n\n194\n00:09:46.765 --> 00:09:47.685\nNot a problem.\n\n195\n00:09:47.685 --> 00:09:49.705\nThere's a nice basic sharing option.\n\n196\n00:09:49.705 --> 00:09:51.385\nI need to share this folder.\n\n197\n00:09:51.385 --> 00:09:54.270\nI just say, I just need to share it, and\nhere's the people I need to share it with.\n\n198\n00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.330\nAnd then, based on what permission levels\nyou give it at that point it time,\n\n199\n00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.870\nit realizes, okay, that's what you need\nto do, I'm gonna go ahead and set that.\n\n200\n00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.648\nYou are an advanced user, though,\n\n201\n00:10:03.648 --> 00:10:07.028\nthere is a cool little trick to this\nthat I actually learned from Mr.\n\n202\n00:10:07.028 --> 00:10:10.251\nPezet, imagine that,\nsomething brilliant that Don has done.\n\n203\n00:10:10.251 --> 00:10:16.710\nHe says, what you do is you give everyone\nfull control over the share permissions.\n\n204\n00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.920\nIn that full control, and\ngoing into your NTFS permissions, and\n\n205\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.360\nyou set the control there.\n\n206\n00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.910\nSo if you only wanted them to have read,\nset read on the NTFS.\n\n207\n00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.750\nRemember, it's gonna be\nthat most restrictive.\n\n208\n00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.800\nSo, everyone can access the share,\nbut then that NTFS permission.\n\n209\n00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.444\nSo you're not trying to figure out,\noh does this trump that, and\n\n210\n00:10:34.444 --> 00:10:35.416\ndoes this go over that.\n\n211\n00:10:35.416 --> 00:10:38.230\nAnd does it overwrite this,\nand that and the other.\n\n212\n00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.900\nWhere the permissions are being set and\njust use the NTFS, very easy.\n\n213\n00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.120\n>> It's actually funny you mentioned that,\ncuz Microsoft is going that way.\n\n214\n00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.220\nI am old school and I'm very used to\nthe whole principle of least privilege.\n\n215\n00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.640\nAnd you don't give everyone full control\nand then rely on NTFS to take care of it,\n\n216\n00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.530\nbut that mindset has definitely\nchanged over the last couple of years,\n\n217\n00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.680\nbecause we know NTFS permissions\nare always checked, always.\n\n218\n00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.070\nSo you could have full control\nshare all day long and\n\n219\n00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.455\nas Daniel said, if you only have\nNTFS read, you're only getting read.\n\n220\n00:11:09.455 --> 00:11:11.335\nIf you don't have any\nNTFS persmissions at all,\n\n221\n00:11:11.335 --> 00:11:15.065\neven though you've got share full control,\nyou're not even connecting.\n\n222\n00:11:15.065 --> 00:11:19.210\nAnd it completely eliminates\nshare permissions as a problem.\n\n223\n00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.002\nLike you don't have to\ntroubleshoot those anymore.\n\n224\n00:11:21.002 --> 00:11:23.120\n>> Yeah.\n>> But in my mind I wanna say,\n\n225\n00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.205\nwell then why even have them?\n\n226\n00:11:25.205 --> 00:11:26.555\nWhy not just click share?\n\n227\n00:11:26.555 --> 00:11:29.839\nWhy have a set of permissions I don't\neven have to deal with when it comes\n\n228\n00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:30.459\nto sharing?\n\n229\n00:11:30.459 --> 00:11:32.126\n>> That's a good question, Mike.\n\n230\n00:11:32.126 --> 00:11:33.084\nHeck, who knows?\n\n231\n00:11:33.084 --> 00:11:34.425\n>> Yeah, that'd be cool.\n>> Maybe Windows 11,\n\n232\n00:11:34.425 --> 00:11:35.917\nget rid of it completely.\n\n233\n00:11:35.917 --> 00:11:38.050\n>> It goes away altogether, I don't know.\n\n234\n00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:38.620\n[LAUGH]\n>> Our\n\n235\n00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.625\npredictions are\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n236\n00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:40.255\n>> All right,\n\n237\n00:11:40.255 --> 00:11:41.894\nlet me show you another thing,\n\n238\n00:11:41.894 --> 00:11:46.200\nbecause there is one thing I don't like\nabout that wizard, and I wanna show you.\n\n239\n00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.750\nI'm gonna make another folder,\nand I'm gonna call this one.\n\n240\n00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.660\nMike doesn't like that wizard\nnow I'll call it data two.\n\n241\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.702\nAll right and I'm gonna pull up\nthe properties of this guy and\n\n242\n00:11:58.702 --> 00:12:02.508\nI'm gonna go to the security tab and I'm\ngonna show you the authenticated users,\n\n243\n00:12:02.508 --> 00:12:04.842\nthey've already got some\npermissions in there.\n\n244\n00:12:04.842 --> 00:12:09.202\nLet's say I'll share it with I\ndon't know the host groups so\n\n245\n00:12:09.202 --> 00:12:11.870\nnotice hosts are not in this list.\n\n246\n00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.800\nAll right?\n\n247\n00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.000\nWell I'm gonna go back over\nto the sharing tab here.\n\n248\n00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.580\nAnd when I right clicked on that folder\nearlier and launched that share with\n\n249\n00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.540\nspecific people, it launched that basic\nsharing wizard, same thing right here.\n\n250\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.210\nThis top little share button\nwill launch that same wizard.\n\n251\n00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.950\nSo either way you go.\n\n252\n00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.970\nAnd this time I'm gonna find\na group called Hosts, and\n\n253\n00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.950\nI'm gonna give them read and\nwrite permission, all right?\n\n254\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:44.792\nAnd I'm gonna click Share, and I'll log\nin, give it that admin permissions.\n\n255\n00:12:47.168 --> 00:12:48.715\nAnd I'm done.\n\n256\n00:12:48.715 --> 00:12:53.445\nAnd I'll close this to make sure all those\nchanges show up in my access control list.\n\n257\n00:12:53.445 --> 00:12:54.917\nGo back into the properties.\n\n258\n00:12:54.917 --> 00:13:00.959\nI'm gonna go to security, there's hosts\nand look what permission it gave them.\n\n259\n00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:02.300\nAll right?\n\n260\n00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.790\nNow I don't know in your world Daniel but\nin mine, read and\n\n261\n00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.755\nwrite and\nfull control are not the same thing.\n\n262\n00:13:08.755 --> 00:13:11.312\n>> Yeah that's talk about\nyour over share right?\n\n263\n00:13:11.312 --> 00:13:13.000\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's not what we want them to do.\n\n264\n00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.750\nWe just wanted to allow people to\nread whatever files are in there and\n\n265\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.790\nif they needed to create some new ones or\nmake changes to the ones that are there.\n\n266\n00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.560\nSo, why are we getting full control?\n\n267\n00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.300\nThat gives you a lot of power.\n\n268\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.040\n>> Full control.\n\n269\n00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.360\nAll of a sudden you can delete resources.\n\n270\n00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.500\nYou can take ownership of resources.\n\n271\n00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.290\nThere's a you can change access\ncontrol list permissions.\n\n272\n00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.550\nThere's a lot more to full\ncontrol than there is read/write.\n\n273\n00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:37.200\nSo that's why I say watch,\nbe careful with that wizard.\n\n274\n00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.260\nIt's great for an end user for\na quick share,\n\n275\n00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.080\nhey come check out this spreadsheet,\nhelp me fix this problem, what have you?\n\n276\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.670\nOn a file server, when you're setting up\nresources in your domain environment,\n\n277\n00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.310\nyour corporate environment,\nyou're not gonna be using that wizard,\n\n278\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.970\nbecause if I have to go back in and\nfix what the wizard did,\n\n279\n00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.990\nthere's really no point in using the\nwizard in the first place, in my opinion.\n\n280\n00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.340\n>> Yeah.\nI agree.\n\n281\n00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.990\n>> All right.\nSo just so I wanted to point that out.\n\n282\n00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.340\nTwo different ways to launch the wizard.\n\n283\n00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.890\nKeep in mind that the wizard is a little\nbit quirky with those permissions.\n\n284\n00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.708\nYou gotta watch what it assigns for\nNTFS permissions.\n\n285\n00:14:10.708 --> 00:14:14.800\nAll right, now I'm gonna show you\nanother way to share a folder.\n\n286\n00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.590\nI'm gonna make a new one, I'm gonna get\nreal creative, we're gonna call this one\n\n287\n00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:25.530\nData 3, and I'm gonna right click\non it and choose properties, right?\n\n288\n00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.500\nAnd again, I'll use the host cause I\nknow they're not in my list here, so\n\n289\n00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.750\nthat's a good example.\n\n290\n00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.960\nI'm gonna go sharing, but this time\nI'm gonna click Advanced Sharing.\n\n291\n00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.080\nNow if you've been in the field for\n\n292\n00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.730\nvery long,\nthis is the way we used to share things.\n\n293\n00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.070\nThere used to just be called Sharing.\n\n294\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:44.018\nNow that we've got that basic sharing\nwizard, this becomes Advanced Sharing, and\n\n295\n00:14:44.018 --> 00:14:48.001\nif I click on it it's gonna open up\nby permissions dialog box first.\n\n296\n00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:48.585\n>> Teach you not to log into that.\n\n297\n00:14:48.585 --> 00:14:51.450\n>> [LAUGH] I know, right.\n\n298\n00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.093\n>> I'm trying to do best practices here.\n\n299\n00:14:53.093 --> 00:14:55.001\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is true.\n\n300\n00:14:55.001 --> 00:14:58.937\n>> All right, so here we can\nsee I choose share this folder,\n\n301\n00:14:58.937 --> 00:15:04.020\nbut it gives me more options than\nwhat that basic sharing wizard did.\n\n302\n00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.850\nI could just click OK at this point,\nand it would be shared,\n\n303\n00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.120\nbut there are some things I can do in here\nthat I couldn't do with the wizard and\n\n304\n00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.450\nI wanna point those out.\n\n305\n00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.640\nThe name can be changed of the share.\n\n306\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.560\nNormally, it just takes\nthe name of the folder.\n\n307\n00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.511\nWhat if I wanna change this to Docs,\nor let's say EMP Files,\n\n308\n00:15:21.511 --> 00:15:23.560\nor something like that.\n\n309\n00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.020\nYour folder might have some long,\n\n310\n00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:31.170\ncomplex name like some kind of date stamp\nor blah, blah, blah, really long name.\n\n311\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.510\nYou don't want your users to have to type\nthat in when they connect to the share, so\n\n312\n00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.910\nusing the advanced sharing I can\nchange the name of the share.\n\n313\n00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.850\nIt doesn't have to be\nwhat the folder is named.\n\n314\n00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.100\nSo that's the first\nthing I can do in there.\n\n315\n00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.770\nI can also limit the number\nof concurrent users.\n\n316\n00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:49.297\nI'm on a PC, I might not want 150 people\nconnecting to the share on my computer,\n\n317\n00:15:49.297 --> 00:15:51.755\nmight suck up a lot of\nmy network resources and\n\n318\n00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:53.584\nthen I can't get anything done.\n\n319\n00:15:53.584 --> 00:15:56.250\nSo if I find that 20 is too many.\n\n320\n00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.370\nI could limit that if I wanted to.\n\n321\n00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.458\nCan't do that in the basic sharing wizard.\n\n322\n00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:02.043\nI can also come down here and\nplay with some caching options.\n\n323\n00:16:02.043 --> 00:16:04.930\nThis has to do with offline files.\n\n324\n00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.730\nI can't do that in\nthe basic sharing wizard.\n\n325\n00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:08.830\nAnd then permissions.\n\n326\n00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.780\nAnd you'll see the permissions are a\nlittle bit different instead of just read\n\n327\n00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.020\nand then read slash write I get\nfull control change and read.\n\n328\n00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.420\nSo read, or do I just say image\nread in the other wizard.\n\n329\n00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.720\nChange is really like read and\nwrite, which is basically modify,\n\n330\n00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.970\nif you want to think of it in NTFS terms,\nand then of course full control.\n\n331\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.440\nSo a little more granular on\nthe control using this way,\n\n332\n00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.980\ninstead of the basic chair wizard.\n\n333\n00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.710\nI'm going to add the hosts group.\n\n334\n00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:42.120\nAnd I'll go ahead and give them change\npermissions, and I'll click okay.\n\n335\n00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.010\nAnd now it's shared out.\n\n336\n00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.880\nSo a few different things\nthat I can do going this way,\n\n337\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.460\nthat I can do in that basic share wizard.\n\n338\n00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.890\nI'll click okay.\n\n339\n00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:55.821\nAnd now it's shared,\nyou can see CLIENT100/ImpFILES.\n\n340\n00:16:55.821 --> 00:16:59.550\nBut here's the thing, it did not, if we\ntake a look at the security tab, in fact\n\n341\n00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:03.410\nlet me just close and open it just to make\nsure you don't think I'm cheating here.\n\n342\n00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:10.180\nSo let me right click on that guy,\npull up properties, go back to security.\n\n343\n00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.850\nNotice host is not in there, right.\n\n344\n00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:14.950\nSo this way,\nit does not take care of anything for\n\n345\n00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.510\nyou, you have to do everything.\n\n346\n00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.090\nYou're saying, I'm advanced,\nI know what I'm doing,\n\n347\n00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:23.460\nI want that level of granular control,\nlet me do it myself.\n\n348\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.740\nSo at this point,\nif I had a user from the host group\n\n349\n00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:30.150\ntry to go across the network and\nconnect to the resource, they wouldn't.\n\n350\n00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.312\nThey have share permissions, but\nthey don't have NTFS permissions.\n\n351\n00:17:33.312 --> 00:17:37.770\nSo I'm going to have to make sure I click\nAdd, and add, find that host group again,\n\n352\n00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:43.100\nand then give them whatever permission I\nwant to give them on that share, right.\n\n353\n00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.100\nAs far as NTFS permissions\ngoes over that share.\n\n354\n00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.150\nIt's still the most\nrestrictive of the two.\n\n355\n00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:53.110\nSo if I had done full control share and\nread NTFS, all they would have would\n\n356\n00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.440\nbe read permissions when they\nconnected to it as a share.\n\n357\n00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.140\nSo another way that I can\nconnect to that share.\n\n358\n00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.280\nI don't think we've actually looked,\nlet's go back out here to client 100.\n\n359\n00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.017\nYou'll see all of those are showing\nup now, and notice data 3 shows up as\n\n360\n00:18:07.017 --> 00:18:10.470\nIMP files, not as data 3,\nbecause I was able to change that name.\n\n361\n00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.840\nSo that's a look at the couple of\ndifferent ways we can go about sharing.\n\n362\n00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.618\nIf we're going to sum that up,\nyou got the two different ways,\n\n363\n00:18:18.618 --> 00:18:22.530\nthe wizard, as well as the manual way,\nthe advanced sharing.\n\n364\n00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.600\nThe key to remember there\nis watch the wizard,\n\n365\n00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:30.230\nbecause it will assign the NTFS,\nthe matching NTFS permissions for\n\n366\n00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.660\nyou, don't always match\nlike you think they should.\n\n367\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.570\nYou might have to go back and\ndouble check those.\n\n368\n00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.470\nThe advance is fully,\nwhat's good way to say it.\n\n369\n00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:39.670\nIt's not automatic at all.\n\n370\n00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.550\nYou have to do everything.\n\n371\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.420\nSo if you go in there,\nyou create the share real quick,\n\n372\n00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.740\nyou sign the share permissions and\nyou go, okay, try it now.\n\n373\n00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.140\nIt's not going to work, because you need\nto set those NTFS permissions as well.\n\n374\n00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.930\n>> Auto versus manual,\nladies and gentleman.\n\n375\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.320\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n>> I remember the first time I actually\n\n376\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.260\nran into this in a corporate environment.\n\n377\n00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.190\nHad a user call up, said,\n\n378\n00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:02.570\nI need access to this shared environment\nthat all of my colleagues have as well.\n\n379\n00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:03.600\nOh yeah, yeah, no problem.\n\n380\n00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.530\nI set their share permissions.\n\n381\n00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.360\nOh you should be good to go.\n\n382\n00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.840\nYeah, I can't get to that.\n\n383\n00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.700\nHm.\n\n384\n00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:10.710\nLet's see here.\n\n385\n00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.030\nForgot to set those NTFS permissions.\n\n386\n00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.920\nSo you've got to remember, if they ask\nyou something like that on the exam,\n\n387\n00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.440\nthat you've set the share permissions and\nthe user still can't access that,\n\n388\n00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.480\nit's probably something to\ndo with NTFS permissions.\n\n389\n00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.350\n>> Absolutely, that's a great question.\n\n390\n00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:26.000\nHey, your user has share full control but\nwhen they go to it,\n\n391\n00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.170\nall they can do is read.\n\n392\n00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.100\nThey can't make anything.\n\n393\n00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.160\nWhy?\n\n394\n00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.490\nDon't troubleshoot your share permissions.\n\n395\n00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.620\nThey've got full control, right?\n\n396\n00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.260\nLook at NTFS.\n\n397\n00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.720\nAll right, next thing Daniel I think I\nwant to take a look at another share\n\n398\n00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.210\nconcept has to do with objects.\n\n399\n00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.950\nThis is a printer, right?\n\n400\n00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.970\nAnd a printer is another thing that we\ntypically want to be able to share out.\n\n401\n00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:45.890\nA lot of this can be done through group\npolicy at the corporate level, but\n\n402\n00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.420\nin a soho smaller office or\njust a quick and\n\n403\n00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.330\ndirty way to share out a printer, we need\nto be able to do that here in Windows 10.\n\n404\n00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:57.310\nWhat I'm going to do, is I'm going to add\na printer and I'm going to lie to it.\n\n405\n00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.490\nWhich I know is not what\nmy mother taught me but-\n\n406\n00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.880\n>> Shame, shame Michael.\n\n407\n00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.930\n>> We're going to lie to this machine.\n\n408\n00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.150\nI don't actually have a printer\nhooked up to this thing, but\n\n409\n00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.230\nI'm going to go through the wizard anyway\njust to show you some of these options.\n\n410\n00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.060\nSo I'll click on add a device,\n\n411\n00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.578\nI opened up from my control\npanel my devices and printers.\n\n412\n00:20:15.578 --> 00:20:19.880\nAnd then I click right up here at the top,\nadd a printer.\n\n413\n00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.440\nCouple of different\nways you can get there.\n\n414\n00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.890\nI'm a big, huge right-click fan here.\n\n415\n00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.236\nActually, you know what?\n\n416\n00:20:27.236 --> 00:20:28.740\nI clicked the wrong one there, didn't I?\n\n417\n00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.695\nI didn't mean to add a printer,\nI meant to add a printer.\n\n418\n00:20:32.695 --> 00:20:33.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah it is at a printer.\n\n419\n00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.600\nIt's not letting me.\n\n420\n00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.270\nLet's do it this way.\n\n421\n00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.300\nYeah.\nWhat it's going to do is it's\n\n422\n00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.280\ngoing to find.\n\n423\n00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.897\n>> That there are no printers.\n\n424\n00:20:43.897 --> 00:20:45.082\n>> There are no printers.\n\n425\n00:20:45.082 --> 00:20:47.880\nSo I'm going to do find a printer,\nprinter's a little older,\n\n426\n00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.080\nI'm trying to skip through some\nof this wizard course here.\n\n427\n00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.540\nI'll go ahead and click Next.\n\n428\n00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.604\nAnd again we'll try to force it, and\n\n429\n00:20:59.604 --> 00:21:02.987\nit's not going to let me.\n\n430\n00:21:02.987 --> 00:21:08.320\nAll right let's think of\na better way to go about this.\n\n431\n00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.321\nHow can I fake this guy out?\n\n432\n00:21:20.072 --> 00:21:23.071\nAll right, let's try it this way.\n\n433\n00:21:23.071 --> 00:21:24.154\nStill going to want to\ngo through a search.\n\n434\n00:21:24.154 --> 00:21:27.953\nI'm trying to figure out a way\nI can fake this guy out and\n\n435\n00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.025\njust get the wizard to pop up.\n\n436\n00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:34.517\nThere we go add a local printer there,\n\n437\n00:21:34.517 --> 00:21:35.946\nwe'll just do it that way\nwith manual settings.\n\n438\n00:21:35.946 --> 00:21:40.862\nOkay, so anyway again this is somewhere\nyou don't really go that often.\n\n439\n00:21:40.862 --> 00:21:44.946\nNowadays and for the last I don't know\nhow many years, printers are USB based.\n\n440\n00:21:44.946 --> 00:21:48.458\nYou plug them into your machine, and it's\ngoing to recognize it, and it's going to\n\n441\n00:21:48.458 --> 00:21:51.790\ngo through the process of installing\nthe driver and putting it on your machine.\n\n442\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.610\nSo I apologize, kind of struggling\nto find these manual settings here.\n\n443\n00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:59.180\nIf you ever had to do a printer that was\nnot USB-based, that didn't do the plug and\n\n444\n00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.070\nplay, you'd have to go through this\nas well, if it was a com port, or\n\n445\n00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.510\nserial port, or something like that.\n\n446\n00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.570\nSo we'll do existing port,\nand I'll click Next.\n\n447\n00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:11.300\nAnd I'm going to lie to it and\ntell it I've got a Canon Inkjet here, and\n\n448\n00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.930\nwe'll click Next.\n\n449\n00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.720\nAnd I'll give it a name,\nand I'll call it my Canon.\n\n450\n00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.405\nIf I can spell.\n\n451\n00:22:19.321 --> 00:22:22.130\nAnd it's going to go through and\ninstall this printer.\n\n452\n00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:26.320\nAll right, this is really what they call\nout on the exam, is sharing the printer.\n\n453\n00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.300\nAnd you can see, by default,\nit wants to share it.\n\n454\n00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.960\nSo if you don't want other people,\nif you buy a printer and\n\n455\n00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.270\nset it on your desk at work, and you plug\nit in and you don't want other people to\n\n456\n00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.400\nuse it, you're going to actually\nhave to uncheck this or\n\n457\n00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.120\nchoose do not share this printer,\nit's going to share it by default.\n\n458\n00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.360\nI'll just leave that same share name,\neasy enough.\n\n459\n00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.245\nIn order to connect to a shared printer,\nit's a UNC path just like a shared folder.\n\n460\n00:22:47.245 --> 00:22:53.910\n\\\\client100\\\\sharename, whatever\nwe put there.\n\n461\n00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.670\nI'll click Next.\n\n462\n00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.650\nI'll go ahead and set it as my default,\nand I'll click Finish.\n\n463\n00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:02.180\nAnd that's really, I mean, that's\nall there is to actually sharing it.\n\n464\n00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.172\nBut let's go back and look here,\nif I go back to my connected devices,\n\n465\n00:23:05.172 --> 00:23:06.305\nhere's my Canon, here.\n\n466\n00:23:09.861 --> 00:23:12.630\nJust disappeared from my list, didn't it?\n\n467\n00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.240\nWow, isn't that nice.\n\n468\n00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.460\nBecause it's not actually connected.\n\n469\n00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.760\nDid it really disappear on me?\n\n470\n00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.570\n>> It does look like it did Matt.\n\n471\n00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.120\nProbably needs to be a network printer or\nsomething.\n\n472\n00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.040\n>> Yeah, it's really not liking that idea.\n\n473\n00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.710\nLet's see if we can see it, though.\n\n474\n00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:36.987\nIf I come back over here and\nI go to, let's see, if I go to.\n\n475\n00:23:39.987 --> 00:23:46.488\nPrinters, and this is on a server,\ngoing to be a little bit different here.\n\n476\n00:23:46.488 --> 00:23:49.418\nPut our devices in Printers.\n\n477\n00:23:49.418 --> 00:23:52.043\nI'm going to say, Add a Printer.\n\n478\n00:23:52.043 --> 00:23:54.918\nAnd it tells me the printer wasn't listed,\nit didn't find it.\n\n479\n00:23:54.918 --> 00:23:57.168\nSo I'm going to select it\nby shared printer name.\n\n480\n00:23:57.168 --> 00:24:02.488\nAnd so all you would do,\nyou would tell your coworker the name that\n\n481\n00:24:02.488 --> 00:24:09.668\nyou chose when you share it //, and that\nwas on client100/canon and there she is.\n\n482\n00:24:09.668 --> 00:24:14.150\nAnd I'll click Canon, and Next.\n\n483\n00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.040\nAnd now what would happen is your\ncoworker's computer would be reaching out\n\n484\n00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.666\nto your machine, downloading that driver,\nand then installing it.\n\n485\n00:24:23.666 --> 00:24:28.209\nAnd you can see if I can give it, it's got\nthe name filled in there, I'll click Next.\n\n486\n00:24:28.209 --> 00:24:31.717\nI can set it as my default,\nI'll click Finish,\n\n487\n00:24:31.717 --> 00:24:36.046\nand now I've got this Canon on client100,\nall right.\n\n488\n00:24:36.046 --> 00:24:39.501\nAnd I want to try to show you\nthe permissions so let me look up,\n\n489\n00:24:41.751 --> 00:24:45.880\nSee if we can get in here, Real quick.\n\n490\n00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.210\nSee if that guy'll show up in this window.\n\n491\n00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:51.520\nEven though it's not actually hooked up,\nthere it is.\n\n492\n00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.900\nAll right, so what I wanna do is I wanna\nshow you some of these permissions.\n\n493\n00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.660\nNow, if you had not shared\nit when you created it,\n\n494\n00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.550\nyou can always come back in and\nshare it later.\n\n495\n00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.280\nI'm gonna pull up my\nprinter properties here.\n\n496\n00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.960\nAnd that pulls up the properties for\nthe printer, obviously.\n\n497\n00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.100\nAnd then I go to the Sharing tab and\nyou see share this printer is chosen, and\n\n498\n00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.350\nthat name is in there.\n\n499\n00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.500\nSo if I hadn't shared it,\nand I wanted to now,\n\n500\n00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.460\nI could always come back in here and\ncheck this.\n\n501\n00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:19.245\nIf I had shared it and I don't want to,\nI can come back in here and uncheck it.\n\n502\n00:25:19.245 --> 00:25:21.155\nI can also choose,\nin a corporate environment,\n\n503\n00:25:21.155 --> 00:25:24.845\na domain environment,\nI can choose to list in the directory.\n\n504\n00:25:24.845 --> 00:25:27.972\nThis would allow, remember how I had to\ntype in a name for it when I went and\n\n505\n00:25:27.972 --> 00:25:29.376\nadded it to that other machine?\n\n506\n00:25:29.376 --> 00:25:32.376\nIf I'd listed in Active Directory, it\nwould have shown up in that search list.\n\n507\n00:25:32.376 --> 00:25:35.605\nAll right, it would have made it\neasier for my co-workers to find.\n\n508\n00:25:35.605 --> 00:25:39.081\nThe other thing that they're gonna call\nout on the exam is the permissions.\n\n509\n00:25:39.081 --> 00:25:41.910\nCuz the permissions are a little bit\ndifferent then what we have when we\n\n510\n00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.010\ndeal with NTFS.\n\n511\n00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:45.590\nThere's three permissions that\nyou deal with on printers.\n\n512\n00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.390\nThere's the print,\nmanage the printer and manage documents.\n\n513\n00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.410\nBy default, everybody gets print.\n\n514\n00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.630\nSo you can see everyone\nhas print permissions.\n\n515\n00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:59.820\nThe creator owners group is given\nmanage documents, all right?\n\n516\n00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.550\nNow, what that means is, anybody,\n\n517\n00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:05.400\nonce I share this out, by default anyway,\nanybody can send a print job to it.\n\n518\n00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.870\nBecause everybody has print permission.\n\n519\n00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:11.670\nIf you send that print job to the printer,\nyou're the creator/owner for\n\n520\n00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.090\nthat one print job.\n\n521\n00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.730\nSo you'll have manage\ndocument permissions, but\n\n522\n00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:17.830\nonly over your print jobs.\n\n523\n00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.720\nManage document gives you\nthe ability to cancel the job,\n\n524\n00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.060\npause the job, resume the job,\nthings like that.\n\n525\n00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.650\nYou wouldn't be able to start and\nstop anybody else's, but\n\n526\n00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:30.330\nany of your own print jobs,\nyou would have that ability to.\n\n527\n00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:34.440\nSo by default, everyone can print,\nand then manage their own print jobs.\n\n528\n00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.881\nManage the printer permission let's\nyou change settings on a printer,\n\n529\n00:26:38.881 --> 00:26:42.940\nlike two-sided, collate it,\nwhatever that printer happens to support.\n\n530\n00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:47.080\nIf you want somebody to manage all\ndocuments, you need to give them them\n\n531\n00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.930\nthe managed document permission\nother then the creator owner, right.\n\n532\n00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:52.760\nCreator owner says,\nif you created the job, you can manage it.\n\n533\n00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.100\nWhat if I got somebody, Bob, sits right\nnext to the printer and if something gets\n\n534\n00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:00.475\njammed or stuck or whatever I want him to\nbe able to look at the queue and fix it.\n\n535\n00:27:00.475 --> 00:27:04.126\nI could actually add Bob in here and\nI could add, I'll add myself.\n\n536\n00:27:06.334 --> 00:27:10.709\nIf I give Mike Rodrick the manage\nthe printer permission, I'm sorry, and\n\n537\n00:27:10.709 --> 00:27:15.515\nthe managed document permission, I can\nnow stop and start anybody's print job.\n\n538\n00:27:16.595 --> 00:27:18.715\nIt's not just the creator\nowner at that point.\n\n539\n00:27:18.715 --> 00:27:19.405\nSo by default,\n\n540\n00:27:19.405 --> 00:27:24.000\neverybody get's print, creator owner\ngets the manage the documents.\n\n541\n00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.400\nAnd that's really all there\nis to sharing out a printer.\n\n542\n00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.820\nLike I said, that first little part there,\n\n543\n00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:34.810\nit's a lot easier with USB, cuz they're\ngonna be detected automatically.\n\n544\n00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:38.630\nIt's shared by default, so if you don't\nwant other people using your printer,\n\n545\n00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:41.791\nyou're gonna have to go in there and\nundo those default settings.\n\n546\n00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:44.890\nAnd then,\nbe familiar with those three permissions.\n\n547\n00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:48.942\n>> Oh yeah, in today's day and age we're\nreally not doing a lot of printer sharing\n\n548\n00:27:48.942 --> 00:27:50.709\nvia the operating system anyway.\n\n549\n00:27:50.709 --> 00:27:53.917\nBecause, well most printers have\na print server built into them,\n\n550\n00:27:53.917 --> 00:27:56.590\nespecially if they have\na network connection.\n\n551\n00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:00.710\nThey are intended to be accessed\nby everyone that's on the network.\n\n552\n00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.700\nSo only if that function is broken or\n\n553\n00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.680\nyou don't have a network\nto connect to of some sort.\n\n554\n00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.380\nI mean, I guess you would be connecting to\nany computer that's sharing a printer out\n\n555\n00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.690\nvia, but it's more for\n\n556\n00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:16.570\nmaybe, like you said, the small printer\nthat's sitting on someone's desk and,\n\n557\n00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:20.095\nfor whatever reason, the other\nshared printer that's in the office.\n\n558\n00:28:20.095 --> 00:28:23.185\nWhich, most likely there is usually one,\nand I need to share that.\n\n559\n00:28:23.185 --> 00:28:27.315\nI need to let Sue print to that printer\nbecause it's got special paper in it or\n\n560\n00:28:27.315 --> 00:28:29.035\nit's a special type of printer.\n\n561\n00:28:29.035 --> 00:28:30.584\nAnd we can use this option,\nshare those out.\n\n562\n00:28:30.584 --> 00:28:34.144\nSo it is a handy way to become\na print server, really,\n\n563\n00:28:34.144 --> 00:28:36.209\nin your network environment.\n\n564\n00:28:36.209 --> 00:28:38.450\nAnd it's super easy to do,\nthere's nothing to it.\n\n565\n00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.790\n>> It really is, and\nthat's a perfect example, Daniel.\n\n566\n00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.620\nThat's pretty much the one I always use.\n\n567\n00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.260\nYou've got the big printer\nthat everybody can print to,\n\n568\n00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.959\nthat big bizhubby thing that's\ngot all those functions.\n\n569\n00:28:47.959 --> 00:28:51.029\nBut in payroll I've got a printer\nthat's got checks loaded up into it and\n\n570\n00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:54.168\nonly certain people really need to be\nable to print to that printer there.\n\n571\n00:28:54.168 --> 00:28:57.980\nSo that's when you attach it to one of\nthe machines over there in payroll and\n\n572\n00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.140\nthen you share it out.\n\n573\n00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.520\nYou remove the everyone group, right?\n\n574\n00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.230\nYou don't want everybody\nto be able to print.\n\n575\n00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.390\nRemove the everyone group,\nyou put the payroll group back in,\n\n576\n00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:08.820\nand you give them print permissions and\njust they can print to that.\n\n577\n00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.860\n>> All right, Mike, well,\nI'm taking a look at our clock.\n\n578\n00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.420\nWe're running a little bit short\non time so we're gonna need to do\n\n579\n00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:17.320\na part two cuz we've got plenty of\nmore

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:17.780\nI'm your host Daniel Lowery,\n\n4\n00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.040\nhere with me yet\nagain is none other than Mike Roderick.\n\n5\n00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.840\nHow's it going today Mikey?\n\n6\n00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.050\n>> Oh it's going great Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.267\nI'm excited to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:26.890\nWe've got our Windows 10\nepisodes coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.790\nAnd in this one we're going to be\ndiving into one of my favorite topics,\n\n10\n00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.650\ngood old NTFS and permissions.\n\n11\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.820\nIt's one of those things where, when it\ncomes down to it, when we look at our jobs\n\n12\n00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.860\nas an IT person, permissions play a big\npart of it, cuz when we look at security,\n\n13\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.850\nwe talk about confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability well that aid,\n\n14\n00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.430\nthat availability that has\na lot to do with permissions.\n\n15\n00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.410\nThat confidentiality has\na lot to do with permissions.\n\n16\n00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.105\nAnd that is one of our primary jobs,\nmaking sure that people have access to\n\n17\n00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:59.715\nthe resources that they need to do\ntheir job, but no extra access, right?\n\n18\n00:00:59.715 --> 00:01:02.345\nNot access to things that they\nshouldn't be able to access, and\n\n19\n00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:06.235\nmost of that is controlled through NTFS,\nso it's a very important part of our job.\n\n20\n00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:08.865\nIt's also gonna pop up on the exam\nin several different ways.\n\n21\n00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:12.765\nThere not gonna come out and say what\ndoes read, or what does modify mean?\n\n22\n00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:15.840\nBut they're gonna give\nyou scenarios that say\n\n23\n00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.310\nyou need to make sure that this\ngroup of people has access to this,\n\n24\n00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.210\nbut not able to modify anything here or\nsome scenario like that.\n\n25\n00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.460\nAnd if you don't understand NTFS\npermissions, what they are, how they work,\n\n26\n00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.300\nhow they inherit, how it can block that,\n\n27\n00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.460\nyou're going to have a really\nhard time with the questions.\n\n28\n00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.090\nSo we'll spend a little time going\nover good old NTFS permissions.\n\n29\n00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.530\n>> Yeah, I remember the first time\nI encountered NTFS permissions way\n\n30\n00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.660\nback in the day, like what,\n\n31\n00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.360\n2001 or so, I think, was when I\nstarted my career down this path.\n\n32\n00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.640\nI was like, wow,\n\n33\n00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.870\nadvanced calculus is easier than\nfiguring these stinking permissions out.\n\n34\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.550\nBut once you kind of get your feet wet,\nyou're like oh, okay,\n\n35\n00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.930\nit's not really that hard.\n\n36\n00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.710\nMike you're gonna dispel a lot\nof the mystery behind this and\n\n37\n00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.450\nshow these good people exactly\nhow we can set permissions so\n\n38\n00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.950\nthat we get exactly\nwhat we're looking for.\n\n39\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.720\nAccess to what they need, and\nno access to what they don't.\n\n40\n00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.310\n>> Exactly.\n\n41\n00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.430\nI'm sure going to try.\n\n42\n00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.670\n>> [LAUGH] Give it the old\ncollege try anyway.\n\n43\n00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.142\n>> Well let's start off by just looking\nat what these permissions are that we\n\n44\n00:02:13.142 --> 00:02:14.010\ntalk about.\n\n45\n00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.530\nAnd hopefully this isn't your first\nlook at them, but if it is, that's okay.\n\n46\n00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.950\nI'm gonna open up file explorer and\n\n47\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.830\nI'm simply gonna right-click\non a folder over here.\n\n48\n00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.460\nI've got a folder called Sales.\n\n49\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.300\nInside Sales, I have several sub folders.\n\n50\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.090\nI'll back out one, and what I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna right-click on Sales and\n\n51\n00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.490\nchoose Properties, and then I'm gonna\nnavigate over to the Security tab.\n\n52\n00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.420\nLittle terminology lesson for us.\n\n53\n00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.340\nWe talk about permissions and\nwe're in Security Plus,\n\n54\n00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.710\nwe talk about access control lists, right?\n\n55\n00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.750\nThis security tab is\nthe access control list.\n\n56\n00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.950\nThey don't put ACL up there,\nthey put security,\n\n57\n00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.980\nbut this is your access control list.\n\n58\n00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.310\nThis list controls what access\npeople have to this resource.\n\n59\n00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.350\nEach one of these lines is actually\nsomething called an ACE, or\n\n60\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.610\nan access control entry.\n\n61\n00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.660\nSo you add an entry to the access control\nlist to give somebody permissions or\n\n62\n00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.420\nto deny somebody permissions, right?\n\n63\n00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.060\nI would simply click Edit, and then I\ncould click Add, and I can go on browse\n\n64\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.530\nand find say a group and I can add\nthem into this access control list.\n\n65\n00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.910\nNow that there's an access control entry\nfor that group I can select it and\n\n66\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.960\nI can control what permissions\nthat group is going to get.\n\n67\n00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.510\nAll right.\n\n68\n00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.820\nThat is a best practice,\nMicrosoft recommendation.\n\n69\n00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.150\nWe always wanna assign permissions to\ngroups, never to individual users.\n\n70\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.020\nEven if that means creating a group,\nputting one user in the group, and\n\n71\n00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.710\nthen assigning that group permissions.\n\n72\n00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.530\nYou might think,\nwhy in the heck would I do that?\n\n73\n00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.840\nWhy not just give that person permissions?\n\n74\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.510\nBecause today it's one person.\n\n75\n00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.550\nTomorrow, next week, next month,\nit could be ten, 20, 50 people.\n\n76\n00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.920\nAnd you don't wanna add 50 people to this\naccess control list and have to scroll,\n\n77\n00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.890\nscroll, scroll to find anything.\n\n78\n00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.960\nAll right.\nYou wanna add the group.\n\n79\n00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.780\nAnd now I can control the permissions\nby just adding removing members of that\n\n80\n00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.640\ngroup, and that access control\nlist itself doesn't change.\n\n81\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.070\nThere's a lot more to it.\n\n82\n00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.080\nWe'll talk more about\nthat in our server class,\n\n83\n00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.540\nas far as using Microsoft's\nstrategy of using groups.\n\n84\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.930\nJust kinda put that in the back\nof your head at this point.\n\n85\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.320\nI really want to avoid adding users\ndirectly to the access control list,\n\n86\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.950\nI'd much rather use groups.\n\n87\n00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.910\nSecond thing we need to talk about\nis the permissions themselves.\n\n88\n00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.910\nSo let's take a look at what\npermissions are available.\n\n89\n00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.670\nIf we scroll down here, you see I've got\nFull control, Modify, Read & Execute,\n\n90\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.800\nList folder contents, and Read, and\nthen Write, sorry, I almost forgot Write.\n\n91\n00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.680\nAnd then Special Permissions.\n\n92\n00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.030\nAnd what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to uncheck everything here.\n\n93\n00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.970\nI want to show you how this works.\n\n94\n00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.660\nThere's a little thing in here that\nconfuses people the first time\n\n95\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.640\nthey look at it.\n\n96\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.460\nRead is simply that.\n\n97\n00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.920\nIf you have read permission over a file\nthen you can open that file up and\n\n98\n00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.550\nyou can read the contents of the file,\nbut that's all you can do.\n\n99\n00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.070\nYou can't make changes, you can't\ndo anything else to that document.\n\n100\n00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.050\nAll right?\nNotice when I check Read,\n\n101\n00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.570\nnothing else gets selected.\n\n102\n00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.910\nThat's its own individual permission.\n\n103\n00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.450\nThe one that confuses people\na lot of times, or is weird,\n\n104\n00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.430\nis this Write permission.\n\n105\n00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.490\nWrite permission gives you the ability to\nwrite, obviously, depending on what it is,\n\n106\n00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.620\nif it's a folder, and\n\n107\n00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.330\nyou have write permission, you can\ncreate new documents inside that folder.\n\n108\n00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.410\nIf you have write permissions over a file,\nthen you can open up that file and\n\n109\n00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.190\nyou can change the contents of the file.\n\n110\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.290\nAll right?\n\n111\n00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.520\nYou cannot delete the file itself,\n\n112\n00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.630\nyou could backspace up over all the\ncontent and save it as an empty file, but\n\n113\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.180\nthe object, the file itself with write\npermissions, you cannot delete it.\n\n114\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.870\nAll right?\n\n115\n00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.140\nAlso notice when I check Write,\nyou don't get any other permission.\n\n116\n00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.790\nMost people think, hey, if I give you a\nwrite, you've got to have read permission.\n\n117\n00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.380\nWrong.\n\n118\n00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.690\nI can give you write permission and\nnot read.\n\n119\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.770\nIt's a rare thing that I would ever\ndo that, but you can do it and\n\n120\n00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.610\nit's important that we understand that.\n\n121\n00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.690\nThe only scenario, Daniel, that I've ever\ncome up with that might make sense is\n\n122\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.090\nlet's say, I'm taking some\nonline classes and I have to\n\n123\n00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.080\nupload my homework using FTP to this\nfolder that the instructor has set up.\n\n124\n00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.800\nAll right, I need write\npermissions over that folder, so\n\n125\n00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.260\nI can upload my document there,\nmy homework that I'm supposed to turn in.\n\n126\n00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.480\nBut he doesn't want me to be able\nto read other people's homework,\n\n127\n00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.340\nthe ones that they've already uploaded.\n\n128\n00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.920\nRight?\nSo\n\n129\n00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.610\nhe would give me write\npermissions over the folder, but\n\n130\n00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.220\nhe wouldn't give me read permission.\n\n131\n00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.810\nSo that way I couldn't look\nat other people's' files and\n\n132\n00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.690\ntry to copy their homework or\nsomething like that.\n\n133\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.940\nSo again, rare thing, but\njust know that it's possible.\n\n134\n00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.530\n>> Yeah, the only thing I could think of\nis maybe if you had a script that ran as\n\n135\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.860\na backup, since all it's doing is\nbacking up, just writing files.\n\n136\n00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.910\nIt doesn't need access to read them.\n\n137\n00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.060\nIt just needs access to write them.\n\n138\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.660\nSo maybe if you're doing some scripting,\n\n139\n00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.320\nthat write only permission might\ncome into play from time to time.\n\n140\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.850\n>> Yeah, very good example.\n\n141\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.640\nAll right, so the next thing,\nwe'll uncheck Write, and\n\n142\n00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.960\nwe'll take a look at List\nfolder contents only shows up\n\n143\n00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.160\nif you've right click on a folder and\nchosen Properties, right?\n\n144\n00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.190\nIt wouldn't be on a file,\nbecause there's not folder contents.\n\n145\n00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.457\nAnd that's what lets you browse.\n\n146\n00:07:00.457 --> 00:07:04.180\nIf I had List folder contents,\nwhen I double click on that folder,\n\n147\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.960\nI can see the files that\nexist inside that folder.\n\n148\n00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.980\nI don't get,\nthat does not build on anything either.\n\n149\n00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.250\nThen there's Read & execute.\n\n150\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.940\nAnd Read & execute does build.\n\n151\n00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.075\nNotice if I select Read & execute I\nalso get List folder contents and Read.\n\n152\n00:07:18.075 --> 00:07:22.360\nAnd if I try to take any of these away,\nRead & execute goes away.\n\n153\n00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.760\nSo Read & execute builds on top\nof List folder contents and Read.\n\n154\n00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.260\nAnd you need this if you\nwanna run something.\n\n155\n00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.050\nIf there's an executable or a command\nscript or something like that, and\n\n156\n00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.020\nyou want to double click on it and\n\n157\n00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.350\nhave it run, you need Read & execute,\nnot just Read.\n\n158\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.820\nRead would let you see it there,\nbut you couldn't run it.\n\n159\n00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.480\nSo Read & execute to execute something.\n\n160\n00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.120\nI'll uncheck all those.\n\n161\n00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.244\nAnd let's try Modify.\n\n162\n00:07:46.244 --> 00:07:50.210\nModify, notice,\ngives you almost everything else.\n\n163\n00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.530\nRead & execute, List folder contents,\nRead and Write.\n\n164\n00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.640\nA lot of people now get confused here.\n\n165\n00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.095\nWhat's the difference between Write and\nModify.\n\n166\n00:07:59.095 --> 00:08:02.159\nWell, one,\nModify gives you the other permissions.\n\n167\n00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:03.252\nRight, it builds.\n\n168\n00:08:03.252 --> 00:08:07.449\nBut the big difference we need to be aware\nof is the fact that Modify Lets you delete\n\n169\n00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:08.511\nthe object itself.\n\n170\n00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:13.090\nWhereas, write would let you delete\nthe contents, but not the file.\n\n171\n00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.200\nModify lets you delete the file.\n\n172\n00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.252\nSo that's the big permission\nyou pick up when you get modify\n\n173\n00:08:18.252 --> 00:08:21.194\npermissions is the ability\nto delete the object itself.\n\n174\n00:08:21.194 --> 00:08:25.854\nAll right, and then we'll uncheck, and if\nI uncheck any of this, modify goes away,\n\n175\n00:08:25.854 --> 00:08:27.490\nright cuz it builds on those.\n\n176\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.040\nAnd then the last one is full control.\n\n177\n00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:35.590\nAnd of course,\nthat gives you everything as well.\n\n178\n00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.395\nFull control doesn't give you\na whole lot more than modify.\n\n179\n00:08:39.395 --> 00:08:41.400\nModifiy is a pretty powerful permission.\n\n180\n00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.880\nIf I can delete the object, it doesn't\nget much more powerful than that.\n\n181\n00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.050\nFull control does you give\nyou a few things though.\n\n182\n00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.690\nIt gives you the ability to modify\nthe access control list itself.\n\n183\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.230\nLike if I have modify,\nI could delete the file.\n\n184\n00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.029\nBut I couldn't right-click on the file,\ngo to the Security tab, and\n\n185\n00:08:57.029 --> 00:08:59.380\nchange what permissions people have.\n\n186\n00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.052\nFull control gives me the ability to\nmodify the access control list itself.\n\n187\n00:09:03.052 --> 00:09:06.965\nIt also gives me the ability to\ntake ownership of an object,\n\n188\n00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:12.700\nwhich could be important depending on, I\ndon't know, changing ownership on a file.\n\n189\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.910\nIf somebody, let's say Daniel made\na company phone list document.\n\n190\n00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.970\nWell he created it.\n\n191\n00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.690\nHe's now the creator owner of that, and\n\n192\n00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.760\nthe creator owner's a special\ngroup that gets full control.\n\n193\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.280\nSo Daniel could at any\ntime delete that file.\n\n194\n00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.090\nHe could change.\n\n195\n00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.828\nHe could say, I'm mad at Mike.\n\n196\n00:09:29.828 --> 00:09:32.119\nI don't want him to have\npermissions over this, and\n\n197\n00:09:32.119 --> 00:09:35.890\nI'm gonna take his permissions away\ncuz creator owner has full control.\n\n198\n00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.435\nIf Daniel ever leaves or something like\nthat, that could also pose a problem.\n\n199\n00:09:39.435 --> 00:09:43.316\nSo sometimes we'll switch\nthe owner to the admins group, and\n\n200\n00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:47.812\nyou need full control to be able to\nchange who the owner is of a document.\n\n201\n00:09:47.812 --> 00:09:50.040\nAll right, so\nthose are the basic permissions.\n\n202\n00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.350\nThese are what we call our\nstandard NTFS permissions.\n\n203\n00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.280\nDown at the bottom, there's this Special\npermissions down here, right, and\n\n204\n00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.160\nnotice I can't check it.\n\n205\n00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.090\nAnd what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n206\n00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.030\napply these changes that I've done so far.\n\n207\n00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.520\nAnd I'll tell you that 99% of the time,\nthese standard permissions are all you\n\n208\n00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.250\nneed, read, write, modify, full control,\nlist folder contents, read and execute.\n\n209\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.070\nOccasionally I might need\na little more granular control.\n\n210\n00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.710\nAnd that's where I need to\nclick this Advanced button.\n\n211\n00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:25.980\nAnd then I can come in here,\nand I can go to the Add button.\n\n212\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.740\nAnd let's select a principal,\nand I'm gonna add another group,\n\n213\n00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.360\nthe Developers group here.\n\n214\n00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.953\nAnd down below, over here on the left,\n\n215\n00:10:35.953 --> 00:10:38.750\nor on the right,\nI can't tell my left from my right.\n\n216\n00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.250\nI'll click Show advanced permissions,\nright.\n\n217\n00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:42.920\nI'll try to click it.\n\n218\n00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.482\nThere we go.\nAnd\n\n219\n00:10:43.482 --> 00:10:46.169\nnotice I have a lot more\npermissions than I did on that\n\n220\n00:10:46.169 --> 00:10:48.130\nstandard access control list.\n\n221\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.490\nBasically, what was one permission,\nbecomes multiple.\n\n222\n00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.930\nIt breaks it down into\nmore granular control.\n\n223\n00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:58.020\nLike read, for example, is one check\nmark on the access control list.\n\n224\n00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.025\nBut if I do my special permissions or\nAdvanced permissions,\n\n225\n00:11:02.025 --> 00:11:07.455\nread becomes Read data, Read attributes,\nand Read extended attributes.\n\n226\n00:11:07.455 --> 00:11:10.555\nWrite is one permission on\nthe standard permissions.\n\n227\n00:11:10.555 --> 00:11:14.460\nIn here it's Write data,\nAppend data, Write attributes,\n\n228\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.470\nWrite extended attributes.\n\n229\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.010\nSo if there was ever a reason that you\nwanted them to be able to read the data\n\n230\n00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:25.570\nbut not the attributes for the data,\nyou could come in here and uncheck those.\n\n231\n00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.680\nSo if you ever need to break\nthe permissions down into more\n\n232\n00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.850\ngranular control,\nspecial permissions are the way to go.\n\n233\n00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.130\nNow if I've changed these special\npermissions like this, I'll click OK and\n\n234\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.420\nOK there.\n\n235\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.698\nAnd I'll click OK and\nthen pull the Properties back up so\n\n236\n00:11:40.698 --> 00:11:44.168\nthose changes are apparent\nin my dialog box.\n\n237\n00:11:44.168 --> 00:11:48.500\nGo back over here to Security,\nand I look at that dev team.\n\n238\n00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.350\nNotice it doesn't look like\nthey have any permissions.\n\n239\n00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.060\nBut it does say they\nhave special permissions.\n\n240\n00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.900\nAnd the only way to see what permissions\nthey would have would be to, again,\n\n241\n00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.580\ngo into Advanced.\n\n242\n00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.950\nCome in here and take a look at the dev\nteam and Edit, and show those again.\n\n243\n00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.263\nJust Special permissions there,\n\n244\n00:12:04.263 --> 00:12:06.915\nI'd have to click the Show\nadvanced permissions to see it.\n\n245\n00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:08.174\nNow Daniel, I don't know about you.\n\n246\n00:12:08.174 --> 00:12:10.514\nI've never in the 12 years\nI've been doing this,\n\n247\n00:12:10.514 --> 00:12:14.305\nneeded to break down permissions that\nmuch, but it's good to know they're there.\n\n248\n00:12:14.305 --> 00:12:15.855\n>> Yeah, it is good to know they're there.\n\n249\n00:12:15.855 --> 00:12:19.285\nThey're definitely going to test\nyou about this on the exam.\n\n250\n00:12:19.285 --> 00:12:23.291\nBut right, and as Mike said in\npracticality there's rarely been a time\n\n251\n00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:26.915\nthat I can remember that I needed\nto actually make some changes.\n\n252\n00:12:26.915 --> 00:12:27.704\nIt's actually,\n\n253\n00:12:27.704 --> 00:12:31.570\nI can't even think of a time that I needed\nto make special permissions changes.\n\n254\n00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.140\nLike Mike said,\n\n255\n00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.590\nnormally just sticking right there in\nthe main security tab of the properties of\n\n256\n00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:40.930\nthe object you're working with will do you\njust fine, get you where you need to go.\n\n257\n00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.720\nThe only time I really ever go in\nhere is when we start to talk about\n\n258\n00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.750\nchanging ownership.\n\n259\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.720\nSometimes, you have\na user that owns a file.\n\n260\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.420\nAnd maybe they leave your company or\nleave the organization.\n\n261\n00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.990\nAnd they're no longer there,\nthey're gone, right?\n\n262\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.354\nBut they still own that file, and\n\n263\n00:12:54.354 --> 00:12:57.532\nthat's when you gotta take ownership of\nthat guy and end up going to that tab.\n\n264\n00:12:57.532 --> 00:13:00.689\nBut special permissions,\nother than knowing why they're there and\n\n265\n00:13:00.689 --> 00:13:01.677\nhow they're there.\n\n266\n00:13:01.677 --> 00:13:02.309\nAnd maybe,\n\n267\n00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:06.167\nif you are really adept at understanding\nthose fine tuned permissions,\n\n268\n00:13:06.167 --> 00:13:10.292\nyou can gain a little extra control and\nmake it a little better, more secure.\n\n269\n00:13:10.292 --> 00:13:11.139\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n270\n00:13:11.139 --> 00:13:15.627\nAnd that's why they're there, is if I ever\nhave the need to do that granular control,\n\n271\n00:13:15.627 --> 00:13:16.558\nand maybe you do.\n\n272\n00:13:16.558 --> 00:13:20.193\nOr maybe some application needs just\na certain set of permissions, and\n\n273\n00:13:20.193 --> 00:13:23.172\nyou don't want to give it too many or\nsomething like that.\n\n274\n00:13:23.172 --> 00:13:25.848\nAll right, so the next thing we're\ngonna talk about is called inheritance.\n\n275\n00:13:25.848 --> 00:13:29.377\nAnd one of the great things about\nNTFS is that permissions inherit.\n\n276\n00:13:29.377 --> 00:13:32.405\nIn other words,\nif I set permissions at one level,\n\n277\n00:13:32.405 --> 00:13:36.360\nthose permissions then inherit\ndown to everything inside there.\n\n278\n00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:41.590\nLike if I set the permissions on a folder,\nthen all the files inside that folder,\n\n279\n00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.810\nall the subfolders,\n\n280\n00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.650\nthe files inside those subfolders,\nthose permissions will inherit down.\n\n281\n00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:47.490\nAnd that's a good thing.\n\n282\n00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:51.070\nWe always try to apply\nthe permissions as high up as I can.\n\n283\n00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.440\nIf there's a folder with\n100 documents in it,\n\n284\n00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.270\nI don't wanna right-click on each document\none at a time and change permissions.\n\n285\n00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.894\nI can do it at the folder level and\nlet inheritance do the work for me, right,\n\n286\n00:14:00.894 --> 00:14:04.510\nlet it take those permissions down\nto all the objects inside there.\n\n287\n00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.580\nAnd that is by default.\n\n288\n00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.810\nWhen you set permissions like that, NTFS\npermissions, they are going to inherit.\n\n289\n00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.614\nFor example, I'm going to come over\nhere to this Sales folder, and\n\n290\n00:14:14.614 --> 00:14:17.036\nI'm going to modify this access control.\n\n291\n00:14:17.036 --> 00:14:21.320\nNow, inside Sales, before I do that,\nlet's go inside Sales.\n\n292\n00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:25.110\nAnd I'm gonna pull up the Properties for\nCustomers, a subfolder.\n\n293\n00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.730\nAnd if I go to the Security tab,\n\n294\n00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:32.710\nyou'll see that in this list I do not have\nanybody called, let's do owners or sales.\n\n295\n00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:33.819\nThey're not in that list.\n\n296\n00:14:33.819 --> 00:14:36.340\nSo I'm gonna cancel that.\n\n297\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:41.586\nGo back up one level,\nright-click on Sales > Properties.\n\n298\n00:14:41.586 --> 00:14:45.206\nAnd then I'm going to go over\nto that Security tab, and\n\n299\n00:14:45.206 --> 00:14:48.030\nI'm going to click Edit > Add.\n\n300\n00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:54.674\nAnd I'm going to add both sales\nas well as the owners group.\n\n301\n00:14:54.674 --> 00:14:58.750\nAll right, and now I've got my owners, and\nI'm gonna give the owners full control.\n\n302\n00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.505\nAnd then, I'm gonna find sales.\n\n303\n00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:06.700\nAnd we'll give them modify provisions\nsince they're not the owners.\n\n304\n00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.110\nAnd we'll go ahead and click OK, and OK.\n\n305\n00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.570\nAnd now if I go inside Sales and\nI pull up the Properties for\n\n306\n00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:19.332\nany one of these folders,\nwe're gonna see both\n\n307\n00:15:19.332 --> 00:15:26.240\nSales has modify and\nOwners has full control, all right?\n\n308\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.980\nThat's the advantage, that's inheritance.\n\n309\n00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.600\nThat means, I said it once, and it\ninherited down, even the documents inside.\n\n310\n00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.420\nLike if I go inside this folder, and\nI take a look at one of these documents in\n\n311\n00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.740\nhere, pull up its Properties,\nand I go to Security.\n\n312\n00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.650\nSure enough we should find\nSales with modify permission,\n\n313\n00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.150\nOwners with full control, right?\n\n314\n00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.520\nInheritance is good.\n\n315\n00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.040\nWe like it.\n\n316\n00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.490\nIt saves us a lot of time.\n\n317\n00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:53.510\nBut, there are going to be some times when\nyou need to change that default behavior.\n\n318\n00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:58.513\nAnd I don't want the inheritance\nto do what it's doing, all right?\n\n319\n00:15:58.513 --> 00:16:04.714\nFor example, let's say,\nlet me go back up one.\n\n320\n00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:08.241\nAnd let's say, well, reports,\nand these are sales reports.\n\n321\n00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:10.603\nAnd I'm okay with\nthe sales team seeing them,\n\n322\n00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:14.432\nbut I don't want them to be able to\nmodify these sales reports, all right?\n\n323\n00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:17.397\nSo, I could think, all right, well,\nI'll just go and take that away, right?\n\n324\n00:16:17.397 --> 00:16:20.348\nI'm gonna click on Reports and\nchoose Properties, and\n\n325\n00:16:20.348 --> 00:16:22.184\nI'll go over to the Security tab.\n\n326\n00:16:22.184 --> 00:16:25.566\nAnd I know that inheritance has already\ngiven sales modify permission over\n\n327\n00:16:25.566 --> 00:16:26.538\neverything in here.\n\n328\n00:16:26.538 --> 00:16:28.976\nSo sales, sure enough, they have modify.\n\n329\n00:16:28.976 --> 00:16:32.854\nI click Edit, and\nI'm gonna take it away from the right.\n\n330\n00:16:32.854 --> 00:16:35.698\nUh-oh, its all grayed out.\n\n331\n00:16:35.698 --> 00:16:36.975\nI can't change it.\n\n332\n00:16:36.975 --> 00:16:38.078\nHow come?\n\n333\n00:16:38.078 --> 00:16:40.098\nBecause they're being inherited, right.\n\n334\n00:16:40.098 --> 00:16:44.719\nYou cannot change inherited permissions,\nnot directly, all right.\n\n335\n00:16:44.719 --> 00:16:47.760\nThere is really three ways I can\nchange inherited permissions.\n\n336\n00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.488\nAnd it is important you\nunderstand these ways, for\n\n337\n00:16:50.488 --> 00:16:52.651\nthe exam as well as out in the real world.\n\n338\n00:16:52.651 --> 00:16:54.671\nI can't change them directly here.\n\n339\n00:16:54.671 --> 00:16:59.158\nOne way I can change the inherited\npermissions would be to simply assign\n\n340\n00:16:59.158 --> 00:17:00.893\nthe opposite permission.\n\n341\n00:17:00.893 --> 00:17:04.937\nFor this particular folder,\nI could grab that sales group and\n\n342\n00:17:04.937 --> 00:17:07.441\nI could deny them modify, all right.\n\n343\n00:17:07.441 --> 00:17:10.546\nBut notice that takes away read and\neverything else.\n\n344\n00:17:10.546 --> 00:17:12.690\nModify builds on all those permissions.\n\n345\n00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.530\nIf I still want them to read it but\n\n346\n00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.700\nnot modify it,\nthis isn't gonna work all that well.\n\n347\n00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.620\nBut just know that is one way you\ncan override inherited permissions\n\n348\n00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:22.540\nis assign the opposite permission.\n\n349\n00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.509\nIn this scenario it's not\ngonna work the way I want it.\n\n350\n00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.534\nSo since I can't change these checkmarks,\nnotice they're grey.\n\n351\n00:17:30.534 --> 00:17:34.070\nThat's my indicator that these\nare inherited permissions.\n\n352\n00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.691\nThe other way you can change it is to\ngo to wherever the permissions where\n\n353\n00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:39.929\nassigned itself.\n\n354\n00:17:39.929 --> 00:17:41.399\nLike, if I go back out to sales,\n\n355\n00:17:41.399 --> 00:17:44.130\nthis is where I signed\nthe permissions initially, right?\n\n356\n00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.510\nSo these are not inherited permissions.\n\n357\n00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.403\nThese are explicit permissions.\n\n358\n00:17:48.403 --> 00:17:52.222\nNotice the check marks are gray,\nI mean they're black here, right?\n\n359\n00:17:52.222 --> 00:17:55.866\nSo if you can figure out where\nthe permissions are being inherited from,\n\n360\n00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:57.249\nyou can go change it there.\n\n361\n00:17:57.249 --> 00:17:59.652\nThat's the second way I can\nchange inherited permissions.\n\n362\n00:17:59.652 --> 00:18:04.611\nBut, if I change it here, remember,\nI only want to change the permissions\n\n363\n00:18:04.611 --> 00:18:08.094\non the reports folder,\nnot forms, not customers.\n\n364\n00:18:08.094 --> 00:18:10.157\nWell, if I go to sales and\nchange the permission,\n\n365\n00:18:10.157 --> 00:18:12.922\nI'm changing where they're being\ninherited from, guess what?\n\n366\n00:18:12.922 --> 00:18:15.567\nIt's going to change the permissions\non all three of those folders,\n\n367\n00:18:15.567 --> 00:18:17.218\nas well as all the documents inside there.\n\n368\n00:18:17.218 --> 00:18:22.221\nSo, in this particular scenario,\nthat's not going to work either, right.\n\n369\n00:18:22.221 --> 00:18:25.739\nThe third way I can change\nit is to block inheritance.\n\n370\n00:18:25.739 --> 00:18:29.234\nI can say, look NTFS,\nI don't want you to inherit permissions.\n\n371\n00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:34.140\nSo I can go to the Reports folder,\nwhere the permissions are being inherited,\n\n372\n00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.757\npull up the Properties, go to Security.\n\n373\n00:18:36.757 --> 00:18:40.274\nAnd this is another one I\nneed my Advanced tab on.\n\n374\n00:18:40.274 --> 00:18:43.432\nAnd down here at the bottom,\nI've got Disable inheritance.\n\n375\n00:18:43.432 --> 00:18:45.457\nAnd I can see that for sales,\n\n376\n00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:50.874\nthat modified permission is being\ninherited from the sales folder itself.\n\n377\n00:18:50.874 --> 00:18:54.136\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna disable inheritance.\n\n378\n00:18:54.136 --> 00:18:56.911\nNow when you disable inheritance,\nyou gotta make a choice.\n\n379\n00:18:56.911 --> 00:18:58.373\nYou've got two choices here.\n\n380\n00:18:58.373 --> 00:19:02.637\nI could either remove all inherited\npermissions and start with a clean slate\n\n381\n00:19:02.637 --> 00:19:06.566\nand just add who I wanted to that\nhave permissions over this object, or\n\n382\n00:19:06.566 --> 00:19:11.052\nI could choose convert the inherited\npermissions into explicit permissions.\n\n383\n00:19:11.052 --> 00:19:14.012\nThey would be black check marks\ninstead of grey check marks.\n\n384\n00:19:14.012 --> 00:19:16.320\nThey'd be independent from\nthat parent folder now,\n\n385\n00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.971\nbecause I'm blocking inheritance.\n\n386\n00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:20.212\nI'm turning them into\nexplicit permissions.\n\n387\n00:19:20.212 --> 00:19:22.487\nAnd now, I can actually change them.\n\n388\n00:19:22.487 --> 00:19:25.992\nNow, you want to be careful with these\noptions because you might think, well,\n\n389\n00:19:25.992 --> 00:19:29.520\nMike, just remove all the inherited\npermissions and start with a clean slate.\n\n390\n00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.504\nThat sounds the easiest,\nbut what about the owners?\n\n391\n00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.303\nWhat about system?\n\n392\n00:19:34.303 --> 00:19:37.174\nWhat about authenticated users and\nall those other permissions?\n\n393\n00:19:37.174 --> 00:19:40.621\nIf I clean this slate, all right,\nin fact, here I'll go ahead and\n\n394\n00:19:40.621 --> 00:19:42.236\ndo it to show you what happens.\n\n395\n00:19:42.236 --> 00:19:43.663\nI'll remove all inherited permissions.\n\n396\n00:19:43.663 --> 00:19:47.077\nNow nobody, not even system,\nhas permissions.\n\n397\n00:19:47.077 --> 00:19:53.396\nYou can get yourself in trouble\nreally quick with this, right?\n\n398\n00:19:53.396 --> 00:19:55.567\nI'm gonna cancel that cuz I\nreally don't wanna do that.\n\n399\n00:19:55.567 --> 00:19:59.430\n[LAUGH] The better option\nis to disable inheritance,\n\n400\n00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.426\nconvert them to explicit permissions.\n\n401\n00:20:02.426 --> 00:20:04.667\nNow look where they're inherited from.\n\n402\n00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:05.340\nNowhere.\n\n403\n00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:05.886\nAll right.\n\n404\n00:20:05.886 --> 00:20:10.552\nSo I go ahead and apply these changes,\nand I go back out to my main screen or\n\n405\n00:20:10.552 --> 00:20:13.474\nmy main access control list and\nI go to sales.\n\n406\n00:20:13.474 --> 00:20:15.471\nNotice they're black check marks now.\n\n407\n00:20:15.471 --> 00:20:20.131\nSo I can come over here to Edit, and\nI can go to Sales, and then say,\n\n408\n00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:25.401\nI just want you to be able to read these\nreports not make any changes to them.\n\n409\n00:20:25.401 --> 00:20:28.134\nAnd I can click okay and okay.\n\n410\n00:20:28.134 --> 00:20:32.953\nAnd now, the sales is still going to\nhave modify over say customers right.\n\n411\n00:20:32.953 --> 00:20:35.728\nIf I go to Security and I find sales,\n\n412\n00:20:35.728 --> 00:20:41.000\nthey still have modify here\nbeing inherited from sales.\n\n413\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.535\nBut this particular folder,\nwe not longer have that.\n\n414\n00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:48.536\nIf we go inside here and\ntake a look at one of these reports,\n\n415\n00:20:48.536 --> 00:20:53.610\nnotice that Sales-Only has\nread permission, right?\n\n416\n00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:59.050\nSo, three different ways I can\nmodify those inherited permissions.\n\n417\n00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.581\nI can either assign\nthe opposite permission.\n\n418\n00:21:01.581 --> 00:21:05.249\nI could change the source of\nthe inherited permissions.\n\n419\n00:21:05.249 --> 00:21:08.488\nOr I could delete or disable inheritance.\n\n420\n00:21:08.488 --> 00:21:12.772\nIf I disable inheritance, I've gotta\nchoose to either clean the slate and start\n\n421\n00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:17.245\nfrom scratch or convert the inherited\npermissions into explicit permissions, and\n\n422\n00:21:17.245 --> 00:21:20.088\nthere are times that you're\ngoing to want to do that.\n\n423\n00:21:20.088 --> 00:21:25.089\nFor example, Sales, I've done all\nthese things that change it so\n\n424\n00:21:25.089 --> 00:21:30.914\nthat owners have full control and\nsales has just read-over that one folder.\n\n425\n00:21:30.914 --> 00:21:34.318\nBut if we really look carefully\nat this access control list,\n\n426\n00:21:34.318 --> 00:21:38.402\ntake a look at the authenticated users,\nthey have modify permissions.\n\n427\n00:21:38.402 --> 00:21:41.432\nAnd when you look at NTFS permissions,\nthey accumulate.\n\n428\n00:21:41.432 --> 00:21:44.776\nIn other words,\nI belong to Sales, so I get read.\n\n429\n00:21:44.776 --> 00:21:48.595\nBut I also belong to the authenticated\nusers, so I'm picking up modify from them.\n\n430\n00:21:48.595 --> 00:21:53.640\nSo even though I did all that work to make\nsure sales couldn't modify those reports,\n\n431\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.203\nthey can still modify it,\n\n432\n00:21:55.203 --> 00:21:59.841\nbecause the authenticated users group\nhas modify permissions, all right.\n\n433\n00:21:59.841 --> 00:22:03.491\nSo, let's go back out to\nthat Sales folder and\n\n434\n00:22:03.491 --> 00:22:07.150\nthese permissions\nare also being inherited.\n\n435\n00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:13.057\nAll right, so if we look at authenticated\nusers, I can't change it here, all right.\n\n436\n00:22:13.057 --> 00:22:14.938\nWhere is it being inherited from?\n\n437\n00:22:14.938 --> 00:22:17.875\nIt's actually being inherited\nfrom the C drive itself.\n\n438\n00:22:17.875 --> 00:22:20.543\nThat's a default permission\nauthenticated users\n\n439\n00:22:20.543 --> 00:22:22.658\nhave permission over the drive itself.\n\n440\n00:22:22.658 --> 00:22:27.368\nSo what I would need to do is go to Sales,\nand I'll just pull that back up,\n\n441\n00:22:27.368 --> 00:22:32.004\nProperties, Security, and in this case,\nI'm not gonna do it because\n\n442\n00:22:32.004 --> 00:22:35.894\nI'd have to reset the permissions\non all the root folders.\n\n443\n00:22:35.894 --> 00:22:39.443\nBut what I would do is I would come\nin here and I would say, Advanced,\n\n444\n00:22:39.443 --> 00:22:41.452\nand, why don't we go ahead and do it?\n\n445\n00:22:41.452 --> 00:22:42.204\nWhat the heck?\n\n446\n00:22:42.204 --> 00:22:44.981\nAnd I would go and\ndisable inheritance, and\n\n447\n00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:49.118\nthis time I would remove all\ninherited permissions, all right?\n\n448\n00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:52.878\nAnd so, you can see the ones that were\nexplicitly assigned didn't get removed,\n\n449\n00:22:52.878 --> 00:22:56.585\nbut all the inherited permissions did,\nlike the authenticated user's system\n\n450\n00:22:56.585 --> 00:22:59.315\ngot wiped out of here as well,\nwhich is never a good thing.\n\n451\n00:22:59.315 --> 00:23:02.231\nSo, not the best way to go about it.\n\n452\n00:23:02.231 --> 00:23:06.615\nAgain, I would actually rather\ndo it like this, Advance,\n\n453\n00:23:06.615 --> 00:23:09.521\nDisable Inheritance, convert them.\n\n454\n00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:15.199\nThen I could go find the authenticated\nusers and just remove them, all right?\n\n455\n00:23:15.199 --> 00:23:18.269\nSo now, only if you're in Sales or\nAdmin, or the owners,\n\n456\n00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:20.350\nare you gonna have those permissions.\n\n457\n00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:24.576\nSo we really start to see there's a lot\nof ways to configure these permissions,\n\n458\n00:23:24.576 --> 00:23:25.910\nand they can be complex.\n\n459\n00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.463\nIf you're new to this, and\nyou've just watched the last 15 minutes,\n\n460\n00:23:29.463 --> 00:23:31.900\nyou're probably going, what the heck?\n\n461\n00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.570\nI mean, that was a lot of information.\n\n462\n00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:38.903\nHighly recommend that you go back and\nwatch this, pause it, go try it on your\n\n463\n00:23:38.903 --> 00:23:43.373\nown system, make a couple accounts on\nyour computer, set some permissions,\n\n464\n00:23:43.373 --> 00:23:47.052\nlog off, log on as those other accounts,\nand see what happens.\n\n465\n00:23:47.052 --> 00:23:48.155\nLook at that inheritance.\n\n466\n00:23:48.155 --> 00:23:52.353\nLook at the way they inherit block\ninheritance, play around with that stuff,\n\n467\n00:23:52.353 --> 00:23:54.961\nreally get familiar because\nyou need to have that\n\n468\n00:23:54.961 --> 00:23:58.546\ninformation locked away in the noggin\nto get through these exams.\n\n469\n00:23:58.546 --> 00:23:59.972\nNot just this exam, right?\n\n470\n00:23:59.972 --> 00:24:00.971\nI mean, most of your exams.\n\n471\n00:24:00.971 --> 00:24:04.467\nYou get in the server level stuff,\nyou still need to understand permissions.\n\n472\n00:24:04.467 --> 00:24:05.755\nSo.\nVery important part\n\n473\n00:24:05.755 --> 00:24:07.142\nof the learning process.\n\n474\n00:24:07.142 --> 00:24:11.474\n>> Yeah, when it comes to permissions,\nthe best thing that I can recommend is to\n\n475\n00:24:11.474 --> 00:24:16.275\nbuild yourself some servers, use virtual\nmachines if you need to, build yourself,\n\n476\n00:24:16.275 --> 00:24:18.800\nor just have a couple of work stations.\n\n477\n00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.727\nStart setting permissions.\n\n478\n00:24:19.727 --> 00:24:24.670\nStart creating scenarios on why you would\nhave one permission over the other.\n\n479\n00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:29.210\nApplying real life type of scenarios\nto permissions really helps\n\n480\n00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.710\nsolidify what it is you're doing in,\nat least in mind.\n\n481\n00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.060\nIt works great.\n\n482\n00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.880\nI come up with, okay I have Bob.\n\n483\n00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.260\nHe's in the sales group.\n\n484\n00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:42.225\nAnd I need to give access to HR for\nBob because he worked in HR.\n\n485\n00:24:42.225 --> 00:24:44.695\nYou know you just create all\nthese crazy scenarios and\n\n486\n00:24:44.695 --> 00:24:46.545\nyou start playing with the permissions.\n\n487\n00:24:46.545 --> 00:24:49.370\nMaking sure,\nokay now I'm going to log in as Bob and\n\n488\n00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:51.155\nsee if he has the proper access.\n\n489\n00:24:51.155 --> 00:24:53.085\nIf he doesn't I know I\ndid my permissions wrong.\n\n490\n00:24:53.085 --> 00:24:54.630\nI need to go back to the drawing board.\n\n491\n00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:57.090\nSee where I made my mistake, and fix it.\n\n492\n00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:00.010\nThat is really where permissions start\n\n493\n00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:03.270\nburying themselves in your brain on\nhow you're supposed to work with them.\n\n494\n00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.730\nIf I need to do those inheritance,\n\n495\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.090\nmaybe I need to block inheritance,\nmaybe I need to take ownership.\n\n496\n00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.770\nAll those different scenarios\nyou need to go through them,\n\n497\n00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:14.220\ntry to get an idea of why\nI would be doing that?\n\n498\n00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.680\nWhy I would set a permission\nover another permission?\n\n499\n00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.960\nOr block inheritance or do whatever, and\n\n500\n00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.060\nthat's really what's going to help; so\nget in there and get your feet wet,\n\n501\n00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.820\ndon't be afraid to play around with those\npermissions, set up some folders, and\n\n502\n00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.490\nstart setting that stuff up so\nthat you totally and completely\n\n503\n00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:33.830\nunderstand that stuff in your brain so\nwhen test time comes you're good to go.\n\n504\n00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:34.650\n>> Exactly.\n\n505\n00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:38.880\nAll right last thing I wanna take a peek\nat here is gonna be something called NTFS\n\n506\n00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.040\ndisk quotas.\n\n507\n00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:44.570\nNow I'll be honest with you guys,\nthis isn't something we use all that much\n\n508\n00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:49.030\nin networks today because we have other\nchoices, other ways of accomplishing this\n\n509\n00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.350\nfrom the server side of things\nthat gives us a lot more control,\n\n510\n00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.690\na lot more flexible,\njust a better way to go.\n\n511\n00:25:55.690 --> 00:26:00.100\nBut NTFS disc quote is,\nit's a part of the NTFS file system and\n\n512\n00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.740\nit's been around for a while and they\nstill call them out on the objectives.\n\n513\n00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.230\nSo we need to make sure understand it,\nyou know for\n\n514\n00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.060\nenvironments where you\ndon't have a domain.\n\n515\n00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.860\nSoHo's, home networks, things like that.\n\n516\n00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.480\nThese types of disc quotas might\nbe the way you have to go.\n\n517\n00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.810\nNow when I talk about a disk quota,\nfirst, what is a disk quota?\n\n518\n00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:21.340\nWe're talking about limiting\nhow much space a person or\n\n519\n00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.680\na group of people is allowed to use.\n\n520\n00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.745\nWe don't want one person,\nwe've got a limited amount of disk space,\n\n521\n00:26:27.745 --> 00:26:29.100\nsay on that file server.\n\n522\n00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.400\nThere's a limited amount\nof space on that drive.\n\n523\n00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.190\nAnd I don't want one person\neating up 90% of it and\n\n524\n00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.490\nthe other 50 employees get the 10%\nthat's left, right, because\n\n525\n00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:44.230\nDaniel decides he's gonna store his\nentire MP3 collection on my file server.\n\n526\n00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.772\nNow I can't save my reports that\nI'm supposed to put up there.\n\n527\n00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:48.278\nSorry.\n>> Hey.\n\n528\n00:26:48.278 --> 00:26:49.248\nThanks for backing those up\n\n529\n00:26:49.248 --> 00:26:49.808\nfor me.\n[LAUGH]\n\n530\n00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:51.302\n>> You know how he is.\n\n531\n00:26:51.302 --> 00:26:52.874\n>> Those DVDs are safe.\n\n532\n00:26:52.874 --> 00:26:55.379\n>> So disk quotas are going to give me\n\n533\n00:26:55.379 --> 00:26:58.990\nthe ability to control that, all right?\n\n534\n00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:00.190\nI'm gonna just show you how we do it.\n\n535\n00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:04.530\nI'm gonna open up, this is on my server,\nI've opened up file explorer and\n\n536\n00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:08.360\nI'm simply gonna right click on\nthis drive and choose properties.\n\n537\n00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:14.810\nIt is a property of the drive itself so\nif I take a look at the properties here,\n\n538\n00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:19.190\nthere's my quota tab and I'm gonna go\nahead and turn on quota management.\n\n539\n00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:23.520\nThat starts the whole process and then\nthere's a check mark deny disk space to\n\n540\n00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.600\nusers exceeding the quota limit and you\nmight think well Mike what's the point?\n\n541\n00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.030\nWhy do you have to check that if you're\nturning on quota's that's the object,\n\n542\n00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.490\nto control how much space they can use.\n\n543\n00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:36.170\nYou might be trying to\ndetermine how much space\n\n544\n00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.880\neach user is actually using before\nyou put the hard limit on there.\n\n545\n00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.490\nSo if I don't check this,\nit's still going to log entries and\n\n546\n00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:48.030\nshow me how much space each user is using,\nbut it's not going to actually block them.\n\n547\n00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.060\nIf I turn this on,\nwhen they hit the limit, that's it,\n\n548\n00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.800\nthey can't save any more files,\nat least to this particular drive.\n\n549\n00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.830\nNow a couple limitations with the NTFS\ndisk quotas that we need to be aware of.\n\n550\n00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.390\nIt is on a per-drive basis.\n\n551\n00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.630\nThat means if there's four different\nshares on this drive that a user\n\n552\n00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.580\ncan connect to, it tallies it all up.\n\n553\n00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.960\nIf you have two files on one share,\nfive files on another share,\n\n554\n00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.850\nit's adding all that space up and\nit's all counting towards your quota, so\n\n555\n00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.820\nit's per drive, not per share.\n\n556\n00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.990\nAll right.\n\n557\n00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:23.030\nOther limitations here, well,\nlet's go through how we set this up.\n\n558\n00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:27.740\nI can choose limit the disk space to,\nand then I'm gonna put something like,\n\n559\n00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.920\nwe'll say 1024,\nwe'll give them a gig each or something.\n\n560\n00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.010\nAll right.\n\n561\n00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.370\nOr, I guess I could just simplify that and\ndo one gigabyte.\n\n562\n00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:45.320\nAnd I can set a warning to maybe,\nI don't know, 750 megabytes.\n\n563\n00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.760\nSo, the warning is going to log\nan entry into the event viewer system,\n\n564\n00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.490\nthat a user is reaching their quota.\n\n565\n00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.290\nOr they're getting close to their quota.\n\n566\n00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.400\nYou can set that to whatever you want.\n\n567\n00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.110\nThe big limitation of this system\nthough is it doesn't tell the user.\n\n568\n00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.940\nAll right?\n\n569\n00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.550\nThey're not checking the event log system,\n\n570\n00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.960\nmost likely our users\naren't going in there.\n\n571\n00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.250\nThey're never even gonna see the warning.\n\n572\n00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.160\nThey're not gonna know\nuntil they hit the limit.\n\n573\n00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.060\nThat's a huge issue in\na corporate environment.\n\n574\n00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.890\nSo again, another reason these\naren't used all that much.\n\n575\n00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.830\nYou can see here, I can log an event\nwhen the user exceeds their quota limit.\n\n576\n00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:22.480\nLog an event when they\nexceed their warning level.\n\n577\n00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.210\nBut again, my user's not checking their\nevent log system most likely, right?\n\n578\n00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.270\nAnd that's it.\n\n579\n00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:29.070\nThat's all there is to it.\n\n580\n00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:30.310\nI go ahead and click Apply, and\n\n581\n00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:34.270\nit's gonna warn me that if this disk\nalready has a lot of data on it.\n\n582\n00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.570\nThis process could take a little while\nbecause it's got to go through and\n\n583\n00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.600\nlook at the owners of the files and\n\n584\n00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:43.270\nfigure out whose quota this counts\ntowards and add all this up so if it's\n\n585\n00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.120\na drive that's in use you might not\nwant to do this during production hours.\n\n586\n00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:47.830\nI'll go ahead and click okay.\n\n587\n00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.760\nOkay, there's really nothing on that\ndrive at this point, all right?\n\n588\n00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.270\nAnother big limitation\nof this NTFS disk quota\n\n589\n00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:01.820\nsystem is that,\nagain it's a per-drive basis, and\n\n590\n00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:07.120\nalso, it's based on the owner, so\nwhat's a good way to say this?\n\n591\n00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.760\nI guess they're all based on owner.\n\n592\n00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:13.340\nI don't want you to think that as a user I\ncould move this over to Daniel's folder.\n\n593\n00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.840\nMaybe I've got a folder and\nDaniel's got a folder, and\n\n594\n00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.030\nI move it into Daniel's folder,\nthat's not gonna help.\n\n595\n00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:22.390\nI'm still the owner of that file,\nit's still gonna count towards my quota.\n\n596\n00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:26.820\nI can change ownership if I had full\ncontrol, remember our NTFS permissions and\n\n597\n00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.660\nthen it would count\ntowards Daniel's quota.\n\n598\n00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:33.400\nAnother limitation is it's based on\nthe actual file size, not the file\n\n599\n00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.810\nsize used on disk, in other words, let's\nsay I'm getting close to my quota, and\n\n600\n00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.910\nI decide, you know what I've got these\ndocuments I don't use that often,\n\n601\n00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:45.050\nI'm gonna compress them using\nsome compression utility.\n\n602\n00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.780\nThat'll free up some space, right,\ncuz now they're taking up less space.\n\n603\n00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:52.130\nDepending on the type of a document, if\nit's a Word document you can really crunch\n\n604\n00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.750\nthose things and make them take less\nthan a quarter of their original space.\n\n605\n00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.500\nDoesn't help you towards your quota.\n\n606\n00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.620\nEven though you free up that disk space by\ncompressing the files, NTFS is still going\n\n607\n00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.750\nto say, nope, you've reached your\nquota limit, you can't save anymore.\n\n608\n00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:09.330\nAnother big issue I have\nwith these NTFS disc quotas.\n\n609\n00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.370\nLast thing I want to show you\nguys is when you set this up,\n\n610\n00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.970\nnotice I didn't specify who in here.\n\n611\n00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.290\nThis applies to everybody, almost.\n\n612\n00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:20.600\nIf I click quota entries\n\n613\n00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.730\nI'm going to see that it's trying\nto retrieve my names here.\n\n614\n00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.820\nThere are some default exceptions,\n\n615\n00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:32.699\nanybody in the local administrators group\ngets a free pass on the disc quotas.\n\n616\n00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.080\nSo there we go, you can see the built-in\nadministrators group gets a free pass,\n\n617\n00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.180\nsystem gets a free pass.\n\n618\n00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.700\nProbably a good thing, you don't wanna\nlimit the system or anything like that.\n\n619\n00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.450\nI happen to be in the local admins group,\nso I get a free pass on this, as well.\n\n620\n00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:54.460\nIf I wanted to set individual quotas,\nmaybe I wanna give everybody a gig, but\n\n621\n00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.560\nDaniels in marketing and\nhe's got some bigger files.\n\n622\n00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.560\nAnd I want to give him two gigs.\n\n623\n00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.910\nI can come in here and create new entries,\nI could find Daniels account.\n\n624\n00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:09.000\nAnd I could say you know what,\nI'm gonna give him two gigabytes and\n\n625\n00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.270\nI'll change his warning to 1 gigabyte or\nsomething like that.\n\n626\n00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.960\nWe could probably find a better number but\nfor now that will work, so\n\n627\n00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.710\nyou can create individual entries.\n\n628\n00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:22.350\nThe one on the properties\naffects everybody,\n\n629\n00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:27.260\nexcept the administrators group, and in\nhere you can control individuals like you\n\n630\n00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:32.040\nsee Dan now has two gigabytes\nwith a one gigabyte warning.\n\n631\n00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.430\nAnd that's really disk\nquotas in a nutshell.\n\n632\n00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.300\nLike I said, that there's better options\nthat you're going to learn about when we\n\n633\n00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:42.790\nget into our server classes, but for\ncontrolling access on like say a client\n\n634\n00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:48.280\nmachine, that's a shared computer between\nusers, this might be your only choice.\n\n635\n00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.590\nIn a work group environment,\n\n636\n00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.260\nin a SoHo something like that,\nthis might be your choice.\n\n637\n00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.340\nSo it is important we\nunderstand that they are there,\n\n638\n00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.310\nthey are available and how they work.\n\n639\n00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.960\n>> Excellent.\n\n640\n00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.850\nDisk quotas, NTFS permissions, hopefully,\n\n641\n00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:03.180\nyou guys are now getting up to speed on\nhow to work with these types of things\n\n642\n00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.620\ninside of your Windows\n10 operating system.\n\n643\n00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.720\nAnd hey, start using them to your benefit.\n\n644\n00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.550\nYou have the power,\nas the administrator over that system.\n\n645\n00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:13.715\nSo start wielding that stick\nas much as you'd like.\n\n646\n00:33:13.715 --> 00:33:17.030\n[LAUGH] Mike, is there anything else we\nneed to go over before we end the show?\n\n647\n00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:18.870\n>> No, I think we covered\neverything pretty good there.\n\n648\n00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:19.800\n>> All right.\nWell, excellent job.\n\n649\n00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.090\nI really appreciate those demonstrations\nfor our viewers, and we thank you for\n\n650\n00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:24.280\njoining us today.\n\n651\n00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.440\nSigning off for\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n652\n00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.181\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n653\n00:33:28.181 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.770\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.330\nHere with me today is,\nwell it's Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.110\nHow's it going Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.230\n>> It's going great Daniel,\nexcited to be here.\n\n7\n00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.810\nWe've got our Windows 10 content rolling\nout, and this one we're gonna continue on.\n\n8\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.560\nWe've been talking about what file and\nfolder access and we took a really good\n\n9\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.440\nlook at NTFS, and permissions, and\ninheritance, and blocking inheritance.\n\n10\n00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.890\nWe're gonna continue on with that theme\nand in this one we're gonna look at EFS or\n\n11\n00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.760\nour encrypting file system.\n\n12\n00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.990\n>> We're gonna dabble a little bit into\nthe dark arts as it were in the IT world\n\n13\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.170\nwhere we're gonna take some files, we're\ngonna jumble them up so that only I and\n\n14\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.500\nMike can read them, or whoever it is you\nneed to be able to read these files,\n\n15\n00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.315\nit's a great thing to use, encryption,\nand we have sensitive data.\n\n16\n00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:02.055\nYou don't want people just to be\nable to grab a hold of those files,\n\n17\n00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:03.655\ntake a look and see what's inside of them.\n\n18\n00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:06.805\nIf you can compromise my system\nyou have access to those files but\n\n19\n00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:08.575\nwhat security do I have after that?\n\n20\n00:01:08.575 --> 00:01:11.790\nThis is just another layer of\nsecurity that we can add to the pile.\n\n21\n00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.277\nSo that if that horrible day comes\nwhere you're compromised your\n\n22\n00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:18.815\nsystems have been penetrated into.\n\n23\n00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:21.439\nI hate to use that word,\nbut if that does happen,\n\n24\n00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.750\nwe can still have another level security.\n\n25\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.340\nSo at least if they have the files,\n\n26\n00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.220\nthey're not gonna be able to\ndo a whole lot with them.\n\n27\n00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.040\nMike, you're gonna help us,\nshow us how to get this thing up and\n\n28\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.700\nrolling so we can start encrypting files.\n\n29\n00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.773\n>> I'm sure gonna try, exactly.\n\n30\n00:01:32.773 --> 00:01:33.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n31\n00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.450\nwhat I wanna start with is a little\nexplanation on EFS itself, or\n\n32\n00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.710\nencrypting file system, and to get there,\n\n33\n00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.090\nwe really need to have a good\nunderstanding of encryption in general and\n\n34\n00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.380\nthe way that works, so\nI'm gonna do a quick overview of it.\n\n35\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.720\nIf you need anymore information,\n\n36\n00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.790\nI know we've got our cryptography\nepisodes in our library.\n\n37\n00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.010\nGo check that out or\ngo post something up on the forums.\n\n38\n00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.840\nI'd love to get back to you there.\n\n39\n00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.136\nSo let's do a quick break down\nthough of encryption in general.\n\n40\n00:01:59.136 --> 00:02:02.110\nAnd then, we'll see how EFS works.\n\n41\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.950\nSo first off, we need to understand\nthere's two different types of encryption\n\n42\n00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.430\nthat we're gonna deal with here.\n\n43\n00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.217\nThere's symmetric encryption and\nthere's asymmetric encryption.\n\n44\n00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:14.261\nAnd the short of it is, with symmetric\nencryption you've got your algorithm, and\n\n45\n00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:17.760\nthen you've got a key that's\nused along with that algorithm.\n\n46\n00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.010\nAnd the key that you\nuse to encrypt the data\n\n47\n00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.760\nis the same you use to decrypt the data.\n\n48\n00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.630\nThat's symmetric.\n\n49\n00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.150\nThe same on both sides.\n\n50\n00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.898\nIn other words, if I encrypt the document\nusing a symmetric algorithm,\n\n51\n00:02:30.898 --> 00:02:32.031\nI'm going to generate a key.\n\n52\n00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:35.573\nI'm gonna use that key with\nthe algorithm to encrypt the document.\n\n53\n00:02:35.573 --> 00:02:38.050\nI'm gonna send that\ndocument over to Daniel.\n\n54\n00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.500\nDaniel is gonna need to\nknow what algorithm I used\n\n55\n00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.870\nas well as have access\nto the key that I used.\n\n56\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.846\nBecause the same key that\nencrypts it also decrypts it.\n\n57\n00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:47.340\nAnd there's a problem with that.\n\n58\n00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.460\nThe problem is if somebody intercepts that\nencrypted document that I sent to Daniel,\n\n59\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.250\nand intercepts the key as I send it to\nDaniel they can then decrypt that document\n\n60\n00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.930\nas well, cuz they've got the encrypted\ndocument, they've got the key, and\n\n61\n00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.110\nwe've lost our confidentiality.\n\n62\n00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.510\nAsymmetric encryption,\n\n63\n00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.930\nasymmetric not the same on both sides,\nwe are gonna be using two different keys.\n\n64\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.869\nWe have what we call a public key and\na private key.\n\n65\n00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.609\nIt's also known as\npublic key cryptography.\n\n66\n00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.940\nThat is where that term comes from and\n\n67\n00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.096\nthe way that works is with\nthe two different keys,\n\n68\n00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:26.600\none of the keys will do the encryption,\nthe other key is gonna do the decryption.\n\n69\n00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.550\nAnd it really doesn't matter\nwhich one you use in general.\n\n70\n00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.200\nI'll talk about which ones you're\ngoing to use here in a minute.\n\n71\n00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.030\nBut it doesn't really matter if for\nsimplicity's sake,\n\n72\n00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.730\nif we look at it just in general.\n\n73\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.940\nIf I use my public key to encrypt it,\nthe only key that can decrypt it\n\n74\n00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.180\nis the other half of the key pair or\nmy private key.\n\n75\n00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.430\nI can't use the public key encrypts it.\n\n76\n00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.270\nI can't use the public\nkey to get it back out.\n\n77\n00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.240\nI have to have the other key.\n\n78\n00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.190\nI could do it the other way around.\n\n79\n00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.520\nI could encrypt it with my private key,\nand then the only key\n\n80\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.600\nthat could decrypt it would be the public\nkey, the other half of that key pair.\n\n81\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.000\nThese keys are known as a key pair,\nthey're mathematically related and\n\n82\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.240\nthey work together, and what's really cool\nabout this system is I don't have to worry\n\n83\n00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.080\nabout sending the key because now if I'm\ngonna send Daniel an encrypted document,\n\n84\n00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.370\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna ask him for\nhis public key, I'm gonna say,\n\n85\n00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.400\nDaniel, give me your certificate.\n\n86\n00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.125\nYour public key is actually part of\na certificate, and the name public should\n\n87\n00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:24.929\nlet you know that you don't care who has\nyour public key, anybody can have it.\n\n88\n00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:28.180\nSo I'm gonna say, Daniel, give me your\npublic key, I wanna encrypt something and\n\n89\n00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.130\nsend it to you.\n\n90\n00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.820\nHe'll just say, sure, here's my\ncertificate, and use my public key.\n\n91\n00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.370\nIf I use his public key to encrypt it,\nwe just learn that the only key that could\n\n92\n00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.580\ndecrypt it is the other half of\nthe key pair, or his private key.\n\n93\n00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.550\nAnd Daniel,\nif he's doing his job right, nobody,\n\n94\n00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.870\nexcept Daniel has that private key.\n\n95\n00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.680\nHence, the name private.\n\n96\n00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.670\nSo I can encrypt it with this public key,\nand\n\n97\n00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.880\nthen I could post\nthe document to the Internet.\n\n98\n00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.030\nAnybody could have it.\n\n99\n00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.450\nBecause the only person that has the key\nto decrypt it, is Daniel himself.\n\n100\n00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.880\nSo now,\nI don't have that key distribution issue.\n\n101\n00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.180\nSo that's asymmetric encryption.\n\n102\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.460\nNow, EFS uses a combination\nof both to get the job done.\n\n103\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.540\nAnd you might think, well,\nwhy use just why not use one or the other?\n\n104\n00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.870\nAnd I'll kind of explain it as we go here.\n\n105\n00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.830\nSo on my screen I've got a little diagram.\n\n106\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.823\nAnd what I've got is\na document sitting here.\n\n107\n00:05:18.823 --> 00:05:21.052\nAnd then, these are actually headers.\n\n108\n00:05:21.052 --> 00:05:24.209\nNow, I'll explain what they are, but\nthey're headers for the document,\n\n109\n00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:25.290\nin just a minute.\n\n110\n00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.470\nI've got a couple users over here,\nand this user has a certificate.\n\n111\n00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.150\nAnd you can see the public key, the green\nkey, public, is part of a certificate.\n\n112\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.240\nThe private key actually gets stored in\nyour user profile in a hidden location.\n\n113\n00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.500\nThat one has to remain private.\n\n114\n00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.350\nAnd I've got another user down\nhere they've got a certificate\n\n115\n00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.600\nthey've got their public key\nas part of the certificate and\n\n116\n00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.980\nthey've got their private key.\n\n117\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.140\nBefore we go any further\nhow do we get those,\n\n118\n00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.550\nbecause that's something they\ncan ask you on the exam.\n\n119\n00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.520\nIn a corporate environment normally if\nwe're gonna be using things like this\n\n120\n00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.138\nwe're gonna setup a certificate server and\nthose are gonna issue.\n\n121\n00:06:02.138 --> 00:06:04.110\nThey are gonna generate their key pairs,\nand\n\n122\n00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.550\ngenerate the certificate, and\nissue them to all my different users.\n\n123\n00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.920\nEach user gets their own key pair,\ntheir own certificate.\n\n124\n00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.860\nAnd that's the way I really want to do it.\n\n125\n00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.592\nBut if I don't, if I'm in an environment\nthat doesn't have that or\n\n126\n00:06:16.592 --> 00:06:20.649\nif we're not issuing out certificates,\nand I try to encrypt something,\n\n127\n00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:23.407\nWindows will generate a key pair for\nme on the fly.\n\n128\n00:06:23.407 --> 00:06:26.160\nBut there's a lot of\ndisadvantages to that.\n\n129\n00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.610\nIf the company is issuing out\nthe certificates to the users,\n\n130\n00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.600\nthey can back those keys up\nbefore they issue them out.\n\n131\n00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.910\nThere's a lot of things they can do to\ncontrol the process, the strengths,\n\n132\n00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.140\nthe lengths of the keys and\nthings like that.\n\n133\n00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.892\nIf we're letting Windows\ngenerate it on its own, well,\n\n134\n00:06:41.892 --> 00:06:46.987\nwe lose a lot of that control and that can\nend up coming back to bite us later on.\n\n135\n00:06:46.987 --> 00:06:50.880\nBut just understand that Windows\nwill generate a key pair for\n\n136\n00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.022\nyou if you don't have one\nissued to you already.\n\n137\n00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:58.540\nSo what's gonna happen with EFS or\nencrypting file system,\n\n138\n00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.588\nif I choose to encrypt this document\nwhat Windows is gonna do is it's\n\n139\n00:07:03.588 --> 00:07:09.045\ngonna generate what we call a file\nencryption key or a FEK for short.\n\n140\n00:07:09.045 --> 00:07:11.225\nNow, this is a symmetric key.\n\n141\n00:07:11.225 --> 00:07:16.875\nAnd it's gonna use that symmetric\nkey to encrypt the documents.\n\n142\n00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:20.400\nSo I'm gonna kinda color it blue there,\nto match that.\n\n143\n00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.790\nSo it's gonna use that symmetric key,\nthat algorithm, to encrypt the document.\n\n144\n00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.450\nThen it's gonna take a copy of that key,\nand\n\n145\n00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.700\nit's gonna put it right here\nin the header of the document.\n\n146\n00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.810\nIn what's called the data\ndecryption field, or the DDF.\n\n147\n00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.600\nDoesn't sound real secure.\n\n148\n00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.440\nSo the key I need to decrypt the document\nis stored right there with the document.\n\n149\n00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.400\nDoesn't sound good.\n\n150\n00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.620\nBut wait, there's more.\n\n151\n00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.701\nIf you call an outhouse.\n\n152\n00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:50.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What it's gonna do next.\n\n153\n00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.220\nIs this gonna see if I have a key pair?\n\n154\n00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.080\nIf I already have one issued\nby my company, great.\n\n155\n00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.638\nIf I don't it's gonna generate one for me.\n\n156\n00:07:58.638 --> 00:08:02.559\nAnd then, it's gonna take my public\nkey from that certificate and\n\n157\n00:08:02.559 --> 00:08:04.599\nnot encrypt the entire document.\n\n158\n00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:10.357\nIt's just going to encrypt The data\ndecryption field using my public key.\n\n159\n00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:13.020\nAnd if we think back to the beginning,\n\n160\n00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.790\nhow can I need that key\nto decrypt the document.\n\n161\n00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.740\nBut that key's been encrypted with\nthis green key, my public key.\n\n162\n00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.850\nSo the only way to get it out would be\nto have the matching private key that\n\n163\n00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.570\ngoes with that public key.\n\n164\n00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.430\nI can use my private\nkey to decrypt the DDF,\n\n165\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:35.010\nretrieve the file encryption key,\nand then decrypt the document.\n\n166\n00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.190\nIf somebody else\ndouble-clicks on this file,\n\n167\n00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.690\nit might try to use their private key,\nbut that's not a match, right?\n\n168\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.210\nThat it wasn't their public key that\nwas used to encrypt in the first place,\n\n169\n00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.000\ntheir private key is not gonna\nbe able to decrypt that.\n\n170\n00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.670\nSo now, I have encrypted this document,\n\n171\n00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.920\nonly I can open that document\nat this point, all right?\n\n172\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:58.010\nThat's the first part that we need to know\nabout EFS is the basics of how it works.\n\n173\n00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:03.940\nNow, couple other things we need\nto be familiar with EFS is,\n\n174\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:10.300\nfirst of all, what do you think might\nhappen if I lose my private key?\n\n175\n00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.540\n>> You have some locked files that are\nnever, ever, ever going to open [LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.720\n>> Exactly right if I lose that private\n\n177\n00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.550\nkey I cannot decrypt the data decryption\nfield retrieve the file encryption key and\n\n178\n00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.160\ndecrypt that document I'm done, all right?\n\n179\n00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.280\nWhich is definitely not a good thing so\nI'm gonna put my private key back.\n\n180\n00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.340\nAnd that's the first thing\nwe have to worry about.\n\n181\n00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:38.480\nIf Windows is generating the keys for\nme on the fly, my system admin,\n\n182\n00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.150\nmy IT people,\nthey're not backing up my key for me.\n\n183\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.380\nThey don't know anything about it, right?\n\n184\n00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.840\nIt's on my local system.\n\n185\n00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.130\nThey've never seen it, and\nthey can't do anything about it.\n\n186\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.720\nI need to back that up, and\nwe can do that by exporting that key.\n\n187\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.240\nBut most users, that's probably\na little bit above their pay grade,\n\n188\n00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.770\nworrying about that key, backing it up.\n\n189\n00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.270\nAnd that's why I say in most\ncorporate environments,\n\n190\n00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.660\nwe're gonna be issuing keys for\nthem because I can back up their key.\n\n191\n00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.280\nI can say these are what I'm gonna issue,\n\n192\n00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.670\nwait first, I'm gonna make a copy of\nit then I'm gonna issue it to you.\n\n193\n00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.060\nThat way if something happens I can go and\nget that out, all right?\n\n194\n00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.750\nThe other thing we can do to\nhelp protect against this\n\n195\n00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:17.000\nis designate what's known as a recovery\nagent by default in a domain environment\n\n196\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.560\nthe built-in domain administrator\naccount is the recovery agent.\n\n197\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.990\nWe can change that if we need to.\n\n198\n00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.530\nThe recovery agent gets\na special certificate for\n\n199\n00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.590\nthe purpose of recovering documents.\n\n200\n00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:31.390\nAnd any time somebody encrypts\na document in a domain environment,\n\n201\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:36.000\nwith a recovery agent specified, when it\ngoes through this process it's gonna take\n\n202\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.610\nanother copy oops,\nif I can get that guy there, of that key.\n\n203\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.490\nAnd it's gonna put it up here\nin the data recovery field.\n\n204\n00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:53.220\nAnd it's gonna use the recovery\nagents public key to encrypt the DRF,\n\n205\n00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.880\nor the Data Recovery Field.\n\n206\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.560\nSo now I can use my private key,\ndecrypt the DDF,\n\n207\n00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.430\nretrieve the file encryption key,\ndecrypt the document.\n\n208\n00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:08.010\nIf I happen to lose my private key,\nthe recovery agent can get his public key,\n\n209\n00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.790\ndecrypt the DRF,\nretrieve the file encryption key and\n\n210\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.070\ndecrypt the document for me, all right?\n\n211\n00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:17.680\nSo that way I'm protected in\nthe event I lose that private key.\n\n212\n00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.820\nAnd you might think how do\nyou lose a private key?\n\n213\n00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.380\nIt's not a key on a key chain I\nleave laying around somewhere.\n\n214\n00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.760\nIt's stored in your user's profile,\nso think about that, right?\n\n215\n00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.090\nProfile gets deleted,\nprofile gets corrupt,\n\n216\n00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.380\nhard drive fails,\noperating system gets reinstalled,\n\n217\n00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.470\nany number of ways we could end\nup losing that private key.\n\n218\n00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:40.970\nNow we've got a, not a fault taller\nmethod, but a way that we can kind of\n\n219\n00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.590\nrecover in the event of I lose\nthat private key, all right?\n\n220\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.510\nNow, again, you might be thinking,\nwell Mike, why didn't we just\n\n221\n00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.820\nuse your public key to encrypt\nthe document in the first place, right?\n\n222\n00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:59.030\nThen only you can get access to it using\nyour private key in the end, same result.\n\n223\n00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.820\nWell, not exactly.\n\n224\n00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:05.400\nWe wouldn't have the ability for the\nrecovery agent to decrypt that document\n\n225\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.410\nif it was encrypted with my public key,\nand I lose my private key, that's it.\n\n226\n00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.540\nThere's no way to get back\ninto that document, all right?\n\n227\n00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.890\nSo that's the first thing,\nis the ability to get that recovery agent.\n\n228\n00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:21.830\nTwo, using this system,\nI can share encrypted files.\n\n229\n00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.930\nNormally once I've encrypted it I'm\nthe only one that can double-click on it.\n\n230\n00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.490\nThe recovery agent could as well, and\n\n231\n00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.800\nI'll come back to that\nthought in just a second.\n\n232\n00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.270\nBut using this system, I can share it.\n\n233\n00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.250\nIf I want to share this document,\nall I have to do\n\n234\n00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.340\nis get that persons certificate,\nall right?\n\n235\n00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.391\nAnd I could, and I'm just gonna kinda\ncopy and paste a couple things here,\n\n236\n00:12:45.391 --> 00:12:46.821\nI can create a second DDF.\n\n237\n00:12:50.604 --> 00:12:56.310\nAnd let's say in this case I use Angie's\nPublic key to encrypt the second DDF.\n\n238\n00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.820\nNow I can use my private key\nto decrypt the first DDF and\n\n239\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.350\nI can decrypt the document.\n\n240\n00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.900\nAngie could use her private key\nto decrypt the second DDF up here\n\n241\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.250\nretrieve a copy of the file encryption\nkey and decrypt the document.\n\n242\n00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.780\nSo now I can share encrypted documents,\nwhich is very important.\n\n243\n00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.240\nLet's say a group of you is\nworking on a top secret project.\n\n244\n00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.900\nYou wanna encrypt those files.\n\n245\n00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.330\nBut, if we can't share encrypted files,\nlet's say I encrypt it.\n\n246\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.870\nOne person in the team encrypts it,\nwhat if I don't come in to work that day?\n\n247\n00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.220\nNobody else can get anything done\nbecause they can't decrypt it.\n\n248\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.820\nThe only way they could decrypt it is\nif I allowed them to log on as me,\n\n249\n00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.960\nwhich would give them access\nto my private key in.\n\n250\n00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.480\nThat's not gonna happen, right?\n\n251\n00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.620\nHopefully, it wouldn't\nhappen in your team either.\n\n252\n00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.850\nBack to that data recovery agent,\nthis has to be a very trusted person.\n\n253\n00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:44.200\nWhoever you assign this role to,\nwhoever knows the password for\n\n254\n00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.380\nthis account has to be trusted.\n\n255\n00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.300\nBecause as the recovery agent,\nevery document that gets encrypted on\n\n256\n00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.190\nthe network,\nthe recovery agent has access to it.\n\n257\n00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.650\nThey can go decrypt the documents.\n\n258\n00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.450\nWe want that for recovery's sake, but\n\n259\n00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.410\nit also means that any time that person\ncould log on as that recovery account and\n\n260\n00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.910\ndecrypt anything they want,\neven stuff well above their pay grade.\n\n261\n00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.140\nSo you have to make sure that\nthis is a trusted person, or\n\n262\n00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.348\ngroup of people that has the password\nto that recovery agent account.\n\n263\n00:14:11.348 --> 00:14:16.590\n>> I was gonna say, that is really\nthe great reason to use a public and\n\n264\n00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.950\nprivate key type of infrastructure.\n\n265\n00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.880\nBecause like Mike said,\nwe can share it out.\n\n266\n00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.870\nAll I got to do is know his public key and\nI can encrypt\n\n267\n00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.980\nthat key onto a piece of data, give it\nto Mike, he can decrypt it all day long.\n\n268\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:32.720\nI can put my key on it and only I can,\nthen both of us can decrypt the thing.\n\n269\n00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.530\nSo it all comes down to being able\nto share within that group and\n\n270\n00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.700\nonly the people that you want to have\naccess to it will then have access to it.\n\n271\n00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.440\nAnd then you have\nthe built on top of that.\n\n272\n00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.799\nThe whole symetric underneath that.\n\n273\n00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:45.140\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Giving you double the pleasure and\n\n274\n00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.860\ndon't forget your safety net.\n\n275\n00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.280\nThat's the way to go.\n\n276\n00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.980\n>> Exactly, and\nanother benefit of using this system\n\n277\n00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.170\nis the fact that symmetric encryption\nalgorithms are lightweight.\n\n278\n00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.960\nIt means they don't take\na lot of processing power.\n\n279\n00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.380\nSo to encrypt the document,\nthis document might be one page.\n\n280\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.850\nIt might be 500 pages long, right?\n\n281\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:04.860\nOr bigger.\n\n282\n00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.710\nIf symmetric encryption can encrypt\nthat data like that, right?\n\n283\n00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.460\nIt's a much lighter process.\n\n284\n00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:12.830\nAsymmetric is a lot heavier.\n\n285\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.890\nit's a much more complex\nmathematical algorithm.\n\n286\n00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.890\nSo if I'm trying to encrypt\nthe entire document with asymmetric,\n\n287\n00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.480\nthat can actually be\na much longer process.\n\n288\n00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.610\nSo we're using the really quick\nencryption to do the bulk of the work.\n\n289\n00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:29.000\nWe're using the slower asymmetric\nencryption to just encrypt\n\n290\n00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.060\nthe file encryption key.\n\n291\n00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.290\nThat take's nothing right.\n\n292\n00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.260\nSo again a lot of advantages\nto doing this system.\n\n293\n00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.450\nSo hopefully that gives you a good\nidea of how it works now Daniel,\n\n294\n00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.710\nI think we got to take a look at it and\nshow it in action?\n\n295\n00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.090\n>> Let's do it.\n\n296\n00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:44.470\n>> All right, so what we'll do is we'll\nflip over to one of my client machines\n\n297\n00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:49.120\nhere, and what I wanna do is fire up\nan MMC, a Microsoft Management Console,\n\n298\n00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.490\nand I'm going to, I forget,\nactually, you know what?\n\n299\n00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.126\nLet's switch users here.\n\n300\n00:15:54.126 --> 00:15:56.424\nLet's do this.\n\n301\n00:15:56.424 --> 00:16:02.646\n[SOUND] So I'm going to switch\nto another user account.\n\n302\n00:16:02.646 --> 00:16:05.700\nSo we can kinda test\nall of this stuff out.\n\n303\n00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.745\nI'll log on as Tim.\n\n304\n00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.500\nAnd we'll wait for it to log on there.\n\n305\n00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.801\nIs this Tim's first time?\n\n306\n00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:16.741\n>> It is not Tim's first time.\n\n307\n00:16:16.741 --> 00:16:20.068\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I did do you guys the benefit of\n\n308\n00:16:20.068 --> 00:16:23.510\nlogging out as these people first.\n\n309\n00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:27.020\nSo you didn't have to watch\ntheir profile being built.\n\n310\n00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.230\nSo I'm gonna fire up a Microsoft\nmanagement console and\n\n311\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.130\nI'm gonna go file, add remove snap in.\n\n312\n00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.640\nAnd I'm gonna add my certificate snap in.\n\n313\n00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.650\nAnd this is what you would have to teach\nyour users if you wanted them to be able\n\n314\n00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.970\nto back up their own keys.\n\n315\n00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.310\nWhich, you're probably already thinking I\ncouldn't get half my users to even type in\n\n316\n00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.040\nMMC at this point.\n\n317\n00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.450\nBut, so here we go.\n\n318\n00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:48.650\nI'm looking at my certificates.\n\n319\n00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:49.530\nI go under Personal.\n\n320\n00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.380\nAnd I'll see that Tim doesn't\nhave any certificates.\n\n321\n00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.572\nNone have been issued by the company.\n\n322\n00:16:54.572 --> 00:16:59.112\nSo let's see what happens\nwhen I try to encrypt a file.\n\n323\n00:16:59.112 --> 00:17:05.482\nAll right, I'm actually gonna\nconnect over to a share,\n\n324\n00:17:05.482 --> 00:17:10.269\nlet's see I know I've got one on RTR01.\n\n325\n00:17:10.269 --> 00:17:15.226\nAnd I'll go into this sales folder or\nI won't go into that sales folder.\n\n326\n00:17:15.226 --> 00:17:16.480\nAll right, we'll do it locally.\n\n327\n00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.030\n>> That sales folder was highly overrated.\n\n328\n00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.360\n>> It really was [LAUGH], wasn't it?\n\n329\n00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.960\nI'm gonna make a new folder right on\nthe root here, and I call it Data.\n\n330\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.730\nAnd inside there,\nI'll go make up a new document.\n\n331\n00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.200\nIf it'll let me.\n\n332\n00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.210\n>> The top secret document of doom.\n\n333\n00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.368\n>> Yeah, report super secret,\nwe'll just call it Secret Info.\n\n334\n00:17:37.368 --> 00:17:42.910\nAll right, and if I want to encrypt it,\nin Windows it's extremely easy.\n\n335\n00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.146\nRight?\nAll I have to do is right-click on this\n\n336\n00:17:46.146 --> 00:17:48.272\nguy and choose Properties.\n\n337\n00:17:48.272 --> 00:17:53.730\nAnd then on my general tab here at the\nbottom I've got my Advanced Attributes and\n\n338\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.002\nI'll choose Encrypt Contents\nto Secure Data.\n\n339\n00:17:57.002 --> 00:18:00.276\nAll right, notice this details button is\ngrayed out, that's where I can go to share\n\n340\n00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:02.949\nit with other people out of it\nbecause it hasn't been encrypted yet,\n\n341\n00:18:02.949 --> 00:18:04.140\nit's not available.\n\n342\n00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.720\nSo I click OK.\n\n343\n00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.630\nAnd then I click OK.\n\n344\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.620\nAnd it's gonna encrypt the document.\n\n345\n00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.902\nNow it's asking me do I wanna do\nthe document or the folder that includes,\n\n346\n00:18:12.902 --> 00:18:15.380\nthat contains the document.\n\n347\n00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.580\nWhen you encrypt a folder, the folder\nitself doesn't become encrypted.\n\n348\n00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.440\nAnybody can still go into that folder.\n\n349\n00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.270\nBut new documents created in there\nwould automatically be encrypted.\n\n350\n00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.790\nAnd by the person that\ncreates the document.\n\n351\n00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:30.090\nIn other words if I encrypt a folder, and\nthen Daniel goes to this location and\n\n352\n00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:34.460\ncreates a file inside the folder, it will\nbe encrypted with Daniel's keys not mine.\n\n353\n00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.520\nI'm just marking the folder as encrypted.\n\n354\n00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.462\nAnd that is the recommended way to go.\n\n355\n00:18:38.462 --> 00:18:42.770\nI'm gonna do the file only just for\nthis demo to make it a little bit quicker.\n\n356\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.868\nSo now you can see\nthe file name turns green,\n\n357\n00:18:44.868 --> 00:18:46.982\nthat's my indicator that it is encrypted.\n\n358\n00:18:46.982 --> 00:18:49.212\nI can double-click on it,\nno problem, I can type in here.\n\n359\n00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.450\nOops, we'll put our super\nbig secret in there.\n\n360\n00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:58.150\nI can save it.\n\n361\n00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:59.760\nI can close it.\n\n362\n00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.300\nNo problem.\n\n363\n00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.060\nRight?\nEncryption to the user is transparent,\n\n364\n00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.990\nmeaning I don't have to decrpyt\nit first in order to view it, or\n\n365\n00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:07.950\nat least I don't have\nto do anything special.\n\n366\n00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.140\nAll that's happening behind the scenes.\n\n367\n00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.480\nI just double-click on it\nbecause I'm authorized.\n\n368\n00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.190\nIt's gonna go ahead and open it up.\n\n369\n00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.270\nNow if we go back over that MMC and\nI refresh,\n\n370\n00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:22.430\nwe'll see that I now have a certificate\nissued to Tim, issued by Tim.\n\n371\n00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.400\nRight?\nSelf-signed\n\n372\n00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.180\ncertificate generated on the fly for\nthe purpose of EFS.\n\n373\n00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:32.290\nAll right, and lets not do that,\nlets not close just yet.\n\n374\n00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.610\nSo now what I wanna do is I want to\nshow you how to share that guy out.\n\n375\n00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:40.130\nI don't have another,\nwe're a little short on time.\n\n376\n00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:44.070\nIf I wanted to share this,\nI would just pull up the properties,\n\n377\n00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.790\ngo back into Advanced, and\nnow you can see details.\n\n378\n00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.480\nAnd I can see who can decrypt this file.\n\n379\n00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.040\nTim is currently the only one,\nand then administrator.\n\n380\n00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.720\nThat's that recovery agent,\nrecovery certificates for\n\n381\n00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.840\nthis file is defined by recovery policy.\n\n382\n00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.460\nSo either I or Tim in this case,\ncan double-click on the file or\n\n383\n00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.450\nthe administrator for the lab.net\ndomain could decrypt this file.\n\n384\n00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.600\nBut, if I wanna add somebody else,\nI'd simply click Add.\n\n385\n00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.360\nRight?\n\n386\n00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.640\nI don't have their certificate here,\nbut if I ask them to send it to me or\n\n387\n00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.050\nif I could browse through\nactive directory and\n\n388\n00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.550\nfind it,\nI could just simply add them here.\n\n389\n00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:24.220\nAnd then they would be listed up here as\nanother person that decrypt the file.\n\n390\n00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.900\nAnd I can add as many people as I need to,\n\n391\n00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.140\nmy entire team that's working on that top\nsecret program could be listed there.\n\n392\n00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.630\nThen anyone of us could\ndecrypt that document.\n\n393\n00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.080\n>> Now, Mike do you have to use users or\nare you able to do groups?\n\n394\n00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.710\nCould I use maybe group and\nactive director, a local group?\n\n395\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.030\n>> Great question, and you cannot.\n\n396\n00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:44.680\nYou have to use users accounts so you\ncan't say I want anybody in this group to\n\n397\n00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.560\nbe able to decrypt it, it has to be done\non an individual per user basis there.\n\n398\n00:20:49.852 --> 00:20:53.910\nAll right so tell you what,\nthat's probably good for certificates.\n\n399\n00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.170\nI will show you one more thing.\n\n400\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.230\nIf I wanted to save my\nkey to backup my key.\n\n401\n00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.960\nThere's my export option.\n\n402\n00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.050\nSo, if I'm a user and this is\na self-signed certificate, I can choose\n\n403\n00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:10.960\nexport and I can walk through this wizard\nand I an say yes, export the private key,\n\n404\n00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:16.460\nI choose my format and\nthen I'm gonna set a password for it.\n\n405\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:22.000\nI'm trying to think, if you can give.\n\n406\n00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.010\nIn this case, you can give a group\npermission to import the key.\n\n407\n00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.640\nBut again, it's imported into\na profile not to the group, itself.\n\n408\n00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.200\nAnd you really wanna password\nprotect this export.\n\n409\n00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.490\nBecause if somebody else can find\nthis file that gets generated.\n\n410\n00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.230\nThey can take it to there machine,\ndouble-click,\n\n411\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.640\nit will import the private key onto there\nmachine now they have your private key and\n\n412\n00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.068\nthey can decrypt anything that\nyou've encrypted, so do becareful.\n\n413\n00:21:45.068 --> 00:21:48.270\nWhen you backup your key you should\nput it on removable media and\n\n414\n00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:52.060\nyou need to keep that thumb drive or\nthat CD, or whatever you burn it to.\n\n415\n00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.170\nKeep that safe somewhere\ncuz if anybody gets it, and\n\n416\n00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.080\nthey can become you, and\nthat's all she wrote.\n\n417\n00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:02.370\nAll right, so I think that's probably\ngood for EFS, it's a good look at it.\n\n418\n00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.410\nThere's more to it than that,\nbut we'll save a lot of that for\n\n419\n00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.190\nwhen we get into certificates.\n\n420\n00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:11.660\nAnd we'll look at that whole process, I\nwas talking about issuing certificates and\n\n421\n00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.840\nbeing able to back them up, and setting up\ndata recovery agents, things like that.\n\n422\n00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.720\nOne other thing, I keep thinking of\nthese things I wanna tell you guys.\n\n423\n00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:24.342\nOne other thing, there's a reason we don't\nhave encryption in home operating systems.\n\n424\n00:22:24.342 --> 00:22:24.937\nRight?\n\n425\n00:22:24.937 --> 00:22:27.450\nAnd it's because of what I just told you,\n\n426\n00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:31.840\nif you lose that key, you lose access\nto everything that's been encrypted.\n\n427\n00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.420\nRight?\n\n428\n00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.660\nThere is no recovery agent, by default,\n\n429\n00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:39.705\nin a home operating system\nlike your Win10 Pro.\n\n430\n00:22:39.705 --> 00:22:41.170\nRight?\nIn a domain,\n\n431\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.520\nwe've got that built in recovery agent,\nso if something happens,\n\n432\n00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.550\nif my user starts encrypting things,\nI can go and recover it for him.\n\n433\n00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.210\nOn that home computer,\nthere is no recovery agent.\n\n434\n00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.360\nAnd Microsoft doesn't wanna deal\nwith grandma calling up and saying,\n\n435\n00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.270\nhey I encrypted everything because it was\non the news and it said it was safe, and\n\n436\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.610\nI've lost my profile,\nI've lost access to everything.\n\n437\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:00.479\nThey can't help you.\n\n438\n00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.820\nSo, do becareful.\n\n439\n00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.560\nIf you're not gonna set up a recovery\nagent, you probably shouldn't use EFS.\n\n440\n00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.915\n>> Yes, wise words from Mr. Roderick.\n\n441\n00:23:09.915 --> 00:23:11.125\nHeed them, my young children.\n\n442\n00:23:11.125 --> 00:23:12.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That being said,\n\n443\n00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.980\nnow we are talking about security here.\n\n444\n00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.360\nThat's kind of the vein in\nwhich we are swimming down.\n\n445\n00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.630\nAnd in that vein we wanna talk\nabout what happens if I think my,\n\n446\n00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.610\nmaybe system has been compromised.\n\n447\n00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:23.680\nHow do I know?\n\n448\n00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.290\nWhat do I do to see who's\nbeen accessing what files?\n\n449\n00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:28.280\nWell, guess what?\n\n450\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.370\nWe have a built in auditing system\nin the Windows operating system.\n\n451\n00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.450\nSo that we can check and see who has\nbeen sneaking around, lurking around, or\n\n452\n00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.760\njust accessing files,\nif we're curious, and\n\n453\n00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.600\nwe're the administrators\nof those machines.\n\n454\n00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:44.431\nMike, this is obviously how we\ndiscover if the bad guys have gotten\n\n455\n00:23:44.431 --> 00:23:47.807\ninto our systems,\nhow do we know who they are?\n\n456\n00:23:47.807 --> 00:23:50.986\nOr if I'm just curious to see who's\nbeen accessing certain files,\n\n457\n00:23:50.986 --> 00:23:52.171\nI can use this auditing.\n\n458\n00:23:52.171 --> 00:23:53.510\n>> Absolutely.\n\n459\n00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.670\nAuditing is just tracking\nwhat's going on in the system.\n\n460\n00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.740\nFile access auditing is just that.\n\n461\n00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.598\nIt's auditing access to files.\n\n462\n00:24:00.598 --> 00:24:02.943\nMaybe somebody is been\nchanging a document,\n\n463\n00:24:02.943 --> 00:24:07.028\nthey've been changing rates on a quote or\nthey've been modifying the phone.\n\n464\n00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:08.746\nSo, I need to know who's doing that or\n\n465\n00:24:08.746 --> 00:24:10.913\nwho's been trying to\naccess these documents.\n\n466\n00:24:10.913 --> 00:24:13.747\nThat's where file access\nauditing comes into play.\n\n467\n00:24:13.747 --> 00:24:16.011\nIt is a multi-step process.\n\n468\n00:24:16.011 --> 00:24:20.512\nIt does branch over into the server\nside of things, but let's go ahead and\n\n469\n00:24:20.512 --> 00:24:21.960\ntake a look at it.\n\n470\n00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.380\nOn my domain controller here,\n\n471\n00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.180\nthe first thing I'm going to do is\nopen up group policy management.\n\n472\n00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:31.460\nAs a tech, or as a help desk with the\nWindows 10 stuff, we really need to just\n\n473\n00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.480\nunderstand the basics of this\nprocess when we're troubleshooting.\n\n474\n00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.830\nWe might have to escalate it up.\n\n475\n00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:39.260\nWe might not have rights on this\nserver to change any of this,\n\n476\n00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.130\nbut let's make sure we have\na good idea of what's going on.\n\n477\n00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.720\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm just going\nto modify, or I'm going to not do that.\n\n478\n00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.740\nThat's not a recommended practice so\nI don't want to teach you that.\n\n479\n00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.062\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm going to create a new policy,\n\n480\n00:24:51.062 --> 00:24:52.535\ncall it audit access.\n\n481\n00:24:52.535 --> 00:24:57.640\nOr let's just call the file\naudit access for completeness.\n\n482\n00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.280\nAll right, I'll click OK, and\n\n483\n00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.880\nthen I'm going to go back in and\nedit this group policy.\n\n484\n00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.850\nAnd the settings I'm looking for are going\nto be under Policies > Windows Settings,\n\n485\n00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:12.210\nand then Security Settings, and then\nLocal Policies, and then Audit Policy.\n\n486\n00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.740\nBuried way down in here.\n\n487\n00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.338\nHere's my auditing settings.\n\n488\n00:25:15.338 --> 00:25:18.250\nAnd I wanna audit object access.\n\n489\n00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.440\nAnd I'm gonna gonna turn this feature on.\n\n490\n00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.520\nAgain, we'll cover group policy heavily in\nthe server class so just kind of follow\n\n491\n00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:29.060\nalong with me here cuz we really need to\nunderstand just the concept of auditing.\n\n492\n00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.040\nI'm gonna turn this on and\nI'm gonna choose Success and Failure.\n\n493\n00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.870\nAnd I'm gonna click OK.\n\n494\n00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:38.590\nSuccess meaning I'm wanna audit when\nsomebody, maybe they have permissions\n\n495\n00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.120\nto change the file, and\nthey make a change to the file, right?\n\n496\n00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.120\nI wanna know.\n\n497\n00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.510\nIf the failure would be if somebody tries\nto make a change to the document and\n\n498\n00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.970\nthey couldn't, or\ntries to read the document and\n\n499\n00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:49.330\nthey didn't have read permission, right.\n\n500\n00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:51.040\nSo success or failure?\n\n501\n00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.150\nAnd notice here, I really didn't tell\nit what I'm auditing or anything.\n\n502\n00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:58.012\nThis is just turning on the ability for\nmy servers to do auditing.\n\n503\n00:25:58.012 --> 00:26:01.880\nAll right, so we've got to do that first.\n\n504\n00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.020\nThen I'm going to go ahead and\nclose that, and\n\n505\n00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:09.100\nI'm going to flip over to my server, and\nI'm going to first refresh policy, so\n\n506\n00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.300\nthat that setting kicks in\nwith a little gpupdate.\n\n507\n00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.360\nI could type switch force.\n\n508\n00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.550\nThen I'm going to update policy.\n\n509\n00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:20.770\nNow my server knows hey,\nI'm allowed to audit object access and\n\n510\n00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:24.090\nI can audit both success and\nfailure if you want me to, right?\n\n511\n00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:28.152\nSo now we just turned on the capability,\nbasically.\n\n512\n00:26:28.152 --> 00:26:31.910\nNow what I have to do is\ngo to my file system.\n\n513\n00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:38.320\nFind what it is that I want to audit and\npull up its properties, right.\n\n514\n00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:44.570\nAnd then I'm gonna go to the Security tab,\nremember this is the access control list.\n\n515\n00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.940\nAnd I'm gonna click Advanced, and\nthen I'm gonna click on Auditing.\n\n516\n00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.150\nThis is actually known as\nthe system access control list.\n\n517\n00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:55.340\nThat first one, that's the discretionary\naccess control list or the DACL.\n\n518\n00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.890\nThat's where my permissions are.\n\n519\n00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.630\nThis is the system access control list or\nthe SACL.\n\n520\n00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.170\nThis is where we do our auditing settings.\n\n521\n00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.800\nAnd all I'm gonna do is add a new entry.\n\n522\n00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.340\nAnd who do I want to audit?\n\n523\n00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.890\nMaybe this is something that\nyou've got to think about.\n\n524\n00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.270\nDo you wanna audit everybody, everything?\n\n525\n00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.240\nThat can generate lots of log entries.\n\n526\n00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.750\nYou've gotta be really careful with this.\n\n527\n00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:18.110\nMaybe everybody is supposed\nto have access to this.\n\n528\n00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.650\nI just wanna know if any of my\ncontractors are accessing this.\n\n529\n00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.390\nSo I can choose who it is I want to audit.\n\n530\n00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:28.500\nI'm gonna go ahead and audit,\nI'll do authenticated users just so\n\n531\n00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.920\nI audit everybody in the domain.\n\n532\n00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.345\nAnd then what permission do I wanna audit?\n\n533\n00:27:33.345 --> 00:27:36.420\n[COUGH] Do I wanna do success,\nfailure, or both?\n\n534\n00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.900\nI'll go ahead and do all, and\nI'm going to apply it to folder and\n\n535\n00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.160\nsubfolders and files, I don't have to,\nand then what permission?\n\n536\n00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.860\nIf everybody in the company has,\nmaybe it's the employee handbook.\n\n537\n00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.750\nIf everybody in the company\nhas read permission,\n\n538\n00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:54.010\ndo I really want to keep track\nof every time somebody reads it?\n\n539\n00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:55.320\nProbably not, right?\n\n540\n00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.440\nSo maybe I just audit write permission.\n\n541\n00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.260\nI want to know when somebody\ntries to change the handbook.\n\n542\n00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.250\n[COUGH] I'll leave it\non the defaults here.\n\n543\n00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:05.070\nI'll just do read and write for now.\n\n544\n00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.210\nYou could do full control.\n\n545\n00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.500\nAudit every single thing.\n\n546\n00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:15.580\nAnd that's pretty much it,\nI'll go ahead and click OK and OK and Ok.\n\n547\n00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.810\nAnd now we are auditing this folder.\n\n548\n00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.830\nAnd let's make sure that's shared out.\n\n549\n00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.370\nBecause I was going to try to access\nthat from that other machine.\n\n550\n00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:28.110\nSo let's say, we're just going to do,\nI'm just going to do the no-no and\n\n551\n00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.380\nshare it with everyone just so\nwe can get through this demo real quick.\n\n552\n00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.810\nSo now I've made sure I've got\nnetwork access to this folder.\n\n553\n00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:39.420\nNow all auditing goes to\nthe event log system and,\n\n554\n00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.110\nin particular, the security log.\n\n555\n00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:46.670\nSo, if I open up Event Viewer and I take\na look underneath my Windows logs, and\n\n556\n00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:50.760\nthen Security, this is where my\nauditing is going to show up.\n\n557\n00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.320\nWhat I'm gonna do is another no-no,\nbut I'm gonna do it for a reason.\n\n558\n00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.460\nI wanna clear the log.\n\n559\n00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:58.470\nYou would never clear\nthis without saving it.\n\n560\n00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.500\nYou want to keep your audit trails.\n\n561\n00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.220\nA lot of companies you know\nif you're under HIPAA or\n\n562\n00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.370\nthings like that, you might have a period\nof years that you have to keep this stuff.\n\n563\n00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.230\nSo don't do what I'm doing right here.\n\n564\n00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:11.600\nI'm going to clear the log\nmainly to show you what happens.\n\n565\n00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.690\nSo now there's only one\nentry saying that hey,\n\n566\n00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.510\nMike Rodrick cleared a log file, right.\n\n567\n00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:18.250\nNow I'm going to come\nover here to the client.\n\n568\n00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.740\nI'm currently logged in as\nTim if I remember right.\n\n569\n00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:24.312\nI'm going to open up File Explorer and\nI'm going to access\n\n570\n00:29:24.312 --> 00:29:29.990\nrtr01/sales [COUGH]\nand\n\n571\n00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.130\nit tells me that I don't\nhave any permissions, nice.\n\n572\n00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:36.990\nAll right, let's switch user,\nactually, you know what?\n\n573\n00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.380\nThat'll probably show up in my auto\nlog anyway, the fact that I tried,\n\n574\n00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.730\nlet's go check it out.\n\n575\n00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:45.420\nI'm going to refresh my log file,\nand there you go.\n\n576\n00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.070\nAll right?\n\n577\n00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:50.500\nNow, that was one person\naccessing one file.\n\n578\n00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.450\nLook at all these entries.\n\n579\n00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:56.460\nNot every single one of these entries\nhas to do with what I just did.\n\n580\n00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.650\nBut most of these failures do.\n\n581\n00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:00.234\nMost of these entries do.\n\n582\n00:30:00.234 --> 00:30:05.690\nLet's see if we can pull one up here and\nso you can see the word Tim right there.\n\n583\n00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:06.760\nLet us make this a little bigger.\n\n584\n00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.680\nAll right.\n\n585\n00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.240\nAnd as I go through here.\n\n586\n00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.870\nTim, Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim,\nTim, Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim,\n\n587\n00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:21.526\nTim, Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim,\nTim, Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim.\n\n588\n00:30:21.526 --> 00:30:24.080\nThere was a System.\n\n589\n00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.980\nThe point of this is,\n\n590\n00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.390\nyou really have to be careful about\nsetting up your audit policy.\n\n591\n00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:33.060\nIf you just think I'm gonna audit\neveryone and everything and\n\n592\n00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:37.700\nanything they do, if that many entries\ngets generated from one person getting\n\n593\n00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:42.830\ndenied access to one shared folder,\nthink about if you have 10,000 employees.\n\n594\n00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.850\nAnd hundreds of thousands of documents and\nthings like that.\n\n595\n00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.210\nYou can generate some huge log files.\n\n596\n00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:53.210\nNot that they're big disk wise, but trying\nto find important information when you've\n\n597\n00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.350\ngot hundreds of thousands of\nentries can be challenging.\n\n598\n00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:59.950\nSo you really wanna think about\nwhat it is that you're auditing.\n\n599\n00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:03.910\nAnd that's auditing, there's other\ncategories that you can do for\n\n600\n00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:06.950\nfile access, but\nthat's a good example of a basic one.\n\n601\n00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.070\nIt's just keeping track\nof what's going on.\n\n602\n00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:12.620\nYou're picking, who is it you want to\naudit, do you want to audit success or\n\n603\n00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.830\nfailure or both?\n\n604\n00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.950\nAnd then,\nwhat permission do you want to audit?\n\n605\n00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:16.930\nAnything they do or\n\n606\n00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:20.350\nonly if they try to write,\nfull control, what is it you wanna do?\n\n607\n00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:21.120\n>> Yeah, looking for\n\n608\n00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:25.330\nthose audit logs can be like trying to\nfind a needle in a stack of needles.\n\n609\n00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:29.730\nBut it will, if you stick at it and\nyou maybe use some tools or\n\n610\n00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:33.270\nsome interesting filters, find\nexactly what it is you're looking for.\n\n611\n00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:36.510\nAnd that's really gonna give you\nthe gold that you're looking for\n\n612\n00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.740\nwhen it comes to finding out who\nis doing this, who is doing that.\n\n613\n00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:45.030\nAnd now I see exactly where this is\ncoming from, and that's what helps out.\n\n614\n00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:45.790\nSo stick with those,\n\n615\n00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:49.460\ndon't give up on them just because it\ncan be a little daunting, which it can.\n\n616\n00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.260\nIt does reap a lot of good\nbenefits once you get to\n\n617\n00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.810\nwhat you're actually looking for.\n\n618\n00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:54.580\nGreat stuff, Mike.\n\n619\n00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.200\nObviously, this is security.\n\n620\n00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.140\nI mean, this is what we do to keep\nour systems on the secure up-and-up.\n\n621\n00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.710\nSo, you need to understand these concepts.\n\n622\n00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:06.130\nYou need to get this under the hat,\nunder the belt.\n\n623\n00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:07.690\nWhatever the case you wanna call it.\n\n624\n00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:12.450\nSo, that when you go to apply for jobs or\nif you're trying to support a system,\n\n625\n00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:14.990\nyou know exactly what to\ndo to help keep it safe.\n\n626\n00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:17.260\nMike, have we forgotten anything for\nthese good people today?\n\n627\n00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.080\n>> No,\nI think we covered it pretty thoroughly.\n\n628\n00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.150\n>> Excellent.\n\n629\n00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:23.450\nWell, looks like we've come to the end\nof yet another great episode here.\n\n630\n00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:24.720\nHopefully you've guys have enjoyed it.\n\n631\n00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.830\nThanks for watching.\n\n632\n00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.140\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n633\n00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.790\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n634\n00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:29.478\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n635\n00:32:29.478 --> 00:32:30.535\n>> And we'll

another fantastic\nepisode of ITProTv.\n\n4\n00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.950\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nhere with me today,\n\n5\n00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.600\nwell it's none other than Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.400\nHow's it going Mikey?\n\n7\n00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.450\n>> It's going great Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.790\nI'm excited to be here, we've got our\nWindows 10 episode coming your way,\n\n9\n00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.320\nand in this one we're gonna be\nlooking at a couple of things.\n\n10\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.320\nWe're gonna look at remote access and\nremote control.\n\n11\n00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.740\nSo some good stuff we wanna go over.\n\n12\n00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.760\n>> Oh yeah, definitely.\n\n13\n00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.091\nRemote access is part and\nparcel of the computing world nowadays.\n\n14\n00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:41.926\nIf you're any kind of user, even just\na standard, who knows, maybe you're\n\n15\n00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:45.643\nin sales, maybe you're in research,\na lot of people work mobilely, they\n\n16\n00:00:45.643 --> 00:00:49.733\nwork remotely from different places, they\nhave to go to a lot of different areas.\n\n17\n00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:53.129\nAnd they're gonna have access back\nto the actual network that they need\n\n18\n00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.400\nconnection to.\n\n19\n00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.270\nAnd sometimes they need access to\nthe computers that are in their office or\n\n20\n00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.370\nsomewhere else, that's where\nremote access helps us out a lot.\n\n21\n00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.540\nI know when I worked in\na corporate environment,\n\n22\n00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.405\nI took full advantage\nof the remote access.\n\n23\n00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:08.461\nAnd Mike you're gonna show\nus how to set this up today,\n\n24\n00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:10.258\nhow to actually take\nadvantage of this system.\n\n25\n00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:11.720\n>> Yeah, I am.\n\n26\n00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.202\nOne of the things for a corporation,\nhey if I can get my users to work while\n\n27\n00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:17.500\nthey're home and\nI'm not paying them why not?\n\n28\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.250\nRight?\n\n29\n00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.730\n[LAUGH] No,\n\n30\n00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.080\nand seriously, it's very nice to be\nable to say connect to another machine.\n\n31\n00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.790\nLike if you go home, you've got files on\nyour computer at work that you need to\n\n32\n00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.900\naccess, you could use a remote desktop\nprotocol to gain access to that machine.\n\n33\n00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.410\nOr if you're on help desk and\nyou need to fix somebody's computer,\n\n34\n00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.200\nyou might be using Remote Desktop to\naccess their machine, get access to their\n\n35\n00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.710\ndesktop hence the name Remote Desktop,\nor even if you're working on a server.\n\n36\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.860\nThe server might be in the,\nthe server closet locked up,\n\n37\n00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.070\nmight not even be in the same building or\nthe same country as you.\n\n38\n00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.410\nVery rarely do we get up and\ngo walk into the server closet.\n\n39\n00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.420\nI do all my administration from my\nmachine sitting in my cubicle and\n\n40\n00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.640\nI manage servers no matter where they are.\n\n41\n00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.200\nAnd sometimes remote\ndesktop is the way to go.\n\n42\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.630\nRemote desktop, like I just said,\nit does give you access to the desktop.\n\n43\n00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.720\nYou're basically taking that\nremote machines desktop,\n\n44\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.600\nsending it across the network and\nbringing it back to your monitor.\n\n45\n00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.900\nSo, your monitor is now looking\nat that remote session.\n\n46\n00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.470\nAll right.\n\n47\n00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.190\nAnd Microsoft of course,\nhas remote access built in to it.\n\n48\n00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.640\nRemote Desktop Protocol.\n\n49\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.210\nThis is what I like to call\na Remote Control Protocol,\n\n50\n00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.720\ndifferent from a Remote Access Protocol.\n\n51\n00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.350\nOn the exam I don't know that they\nwould really differentiate on that, but\n\n52\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.720\nmentally I think it is good\nthat we make that distinction.\n\n53\n00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.905\nWith a remote control protocol you're\ntaking over a machine that's already on\n\n54\n00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:40.483\nthe network.\n\n55\n00:02:40.483 --> 00:02:44.333\nSo I might be sitting at my machine at\nhome, it's not part of your domain, or\n\n56\n00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:45.670\nthe domain that I work at.\n\n57\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.520\nRight?\n\n58\n00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.880\nI'm not adding it to the domain or\nanything like that.\n\n59\n00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.670\nI'm taking over a machine that\nalready exists on the network.\n\n60\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.120\nAnd the big key there is that,\nlike with a client operating system,\n\n61\n00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.810\nonly one person can be logged\ninto it at the same time.\n\n62\n00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.650\nAnd we can do switch users and\nthings like that, but\n\n63\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.520\nonly one person actively\ndealing with that machine.\n\n64\n00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.230\nSo if I remote into\na machine back at work,\n\n65\n00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.390\nnobody else can use it\nwhile I'm remoted in.\n\n66\n00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.550\nThe screen's gonna be locked just\nlike your screen saver kicked in.\n\n67\n00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.490\nSo if it's your machine everybody has\ntheir own machine at work, I go home,\n\n68\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.950\nI can remote into my machine,\nthat's great.\n\n69\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.090\nIf it's a three shift shop,\n\n70\n00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.740\nwhere somebody else uses that\ncomputer while you're not there.\n\n71\n00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.270\nMaybe the second shift or\nthe third shift, then\n\n72\n00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.175\nI can't very well remote into it because\nsomebody is at work using that machine.\n\n73\n00:03:31.175 --> 00:03:33.205\nRight?\nServers will give you two connections\n\n74\n00:03:33.205 --> 00:03:35.195\nwithout doing any additional licensing so\n\n75\n00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:38.522\nyou can have more than one person\nremoted into a server at the same time.\n\n76\n00:03:38.522 --> 00:03:44.590\nBut beyond two you're gonna need terminal\nservices licensing to gain access to that.\n\n77\n00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.940\nSo something to keep in mind.\n\n78\n00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.680\nSo let's take a look at how we\ngo about doing remote desktop.\n\n79\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.970\nThere's a bunch of settings.\n\n80\n00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.810\nI recommend that you go through them,\nplay around with them,\n\n81\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.280\nkind of familiarize yourself with them for\nthe exam.\n\n82\n00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.170\nI'm gonna highlight some of the key\nones I think that we need to know about.\n\n83\n00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.720\nSo on my screen here, I've got my\nWindows 10 client pulled up, and\n\n84\n00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.740\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna remote\ninto a server that's on my network.\n\n85\n00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.820\nSo for that, I'm gonna come down to my\nsearch, and I'm gonna type in remote.\n\n86\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.380\nAnd I'm gonna find my remote\ndesktop connection app.\n\n87\n00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.800\nAnd I'll watch launch it.\n\n88\n00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.830\nAnd here [COUGH] I've got my\nRemote Desktop Connection.\n\n89\n00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.540\nNow I could just type in the name of\nthe computer I want to connect to,\n\n90\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.820\nclick Connect and type in my password.\n\n91\n00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.970\nWe'll go ahead and authenticate and\n\n92\n00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.340\nI'm gonna connect to this\nremote machine hopefully.\n\n93\n00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.463\nRight?\nYou've always got gotta keep your\n\n94\n00:04:31.463 --> 00:04:32.077\nfingers crossed.\n\n95\n00:04:32.077 --> 00:04:36.770\nBut as long as I have network connectivity\nI can, in this case I type in the name so\n\n96\n00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.410\nI would need name resolution to resolve\nthat name RTR01 into an IP address.\n\n97\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.340\nI can very easily type in the IP address\ninstead if name resolution was an issue.\n\n98\n00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.440\nAnd there you go I am now\nconnected to my server.\n\n99\n00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.620\nYou can see up across the top here\nRTR01 and I can do whatever I need,\n\n100\n00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.950\nI can launch Server Manager,\nassuming I have permissions.\n\n101\n00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.990\nRight?\nThat doesn't change my permissions,\n\n102\n00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.480\nmy account that I'm using is actually\nnot an admin on this machine.\n\n103\n00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.860\nSo you're gonna see a lot of red down\nthere in my little messages because I\n\n104\n00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.610\ndon't have access to that kind of stuff,\nbut we're not worried about that.\n\n105\n00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.640\nThe fact that I'm remoted into\nthe desktop is what we need to know.\n\n106\n00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.567\nNow, second thing we want to talk about\nis how do I disconnect from this machine?\n\n107\n00:05:18.567 --> 00:05:20.759\nBecause there are actually a couple\ndifferent ways I can do this.\n\n108\n00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.941\nIf I want to leave something running.\n\n109\n00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:24.603\nAll right?\n\n110\n00:05:24.603 --> 00:05:26.577\nLike let's say I start up a process.\n\n111\n00:05:26.577 --> 00:05:31.526\nAnd just as an example,\nI'm gonna run something\n\n112\n00:05:31.526 --> 00:05:36.123\nlike cmd and\nlet's also open up the notepad.\n\n113\n00:05:36.123 --> 00:05:41.020\nAll right, so\nI got a couple applications open here.\n\n114\n00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.620\nIf I click on this X up here at the top or\nif I go to my Start Menu and,\n\n115\n00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.580\noops, we'll flip back over there, if I go\nto my Start Menu and choose Disconnect,\n\n116\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.720\nthose would be the same things.\n\n117\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.370\nDisconnect or clicking on this X up here.\n\n118\n00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.170\nWhat's gonna happen is it's gonna end my\nsession, my connection to that machine.\n\n119\n00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.290\nIt's not gonna log me off of that server.\n\n120\n00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.870\nRight?\nSo\n\n121\n00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.500\nmy applications are still\ngonna be running.\n\n122\n00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.500\nUseful if you've started up something\nlike disk defragmentation or\n\n123\n00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.810\na virus scan, something that needs to run.\n\n124\n00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.600\nWhereas if I log out,\nthose process will stop.\n\n125\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.745\nSo I can go ahead and disconnect, and\nthose are still running over there.\n\n126\n00:06:16.745 --> 00:06:20.277\nRight?\nIf I flip back over to the server,\n\n127\n00:06:20.277 --> 00:06:27.304\nlet's see if I can do a little log out\nhere and log back in as me, as Mike.\n\n128\n00:06:30.385 --> 00:06:33.460\nYou can see that I am still signed in.\n\n129\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.700\nIt's showing me as signed in.\n\n130\n00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.390\nAnd in fact, if I go ahead and\ntype in my password,\n\n131\n00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.389\nI will connect to that same session.\n\n132\n00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.081\nThere's notepad,\nthere's my command prompt still open.\n\n133\n00:06:43.081 --> 00:06:46.401\nAll right, which is a good thing,\nDaniel, but it can also cause problems.\n\n134\n00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:47.050\nRight?\n\n135\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.850\n>> Oh yeah, sometimes when you have\nmultiple administrators working on\n\n136\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.550\nthe same machine, so if Mike and\nI were both logged in and\n\n137\n00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.060\nthen Nate wanted to log in and\ndo some work as well.\n\n138\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.650\nWell Mike said before, we can only\nhave two sessions concurrently.\n\n139\n00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.290\nSomebody's got to leave the party so\nthat Nate can join.\n\n140\n00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.330\nWell if he needs something to get done and\nI'm just kind of idly logged in,\n\n141\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.250\nI'm not, I just left my session going.\n\n142\n00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.840\nI just kinda disconnected.\n\n143\n00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.830\nWell, does he know what's going on?\n\n144\n00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.920\nNo, for all he knows, I'm in that server.\n\n145\n00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.911\nI'm doing work,\neven if it says that I'm idle or away.\n\n146\n00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:22.754\nI still might have something running\nthat I'm waiting for completion.\n\n147\n00:07:22.754 --> 00:07:27.207\nNow he's gotta figure out, well do I kick\nhim out which will end his session and\n\n148\n00:07:27.207 --> 00:07:29.750\nactually log him out and log me in?\n\n149\n00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.960\nOh, I gotta send an email, so it is good\nto if you're going to be logged in like\n\n150\n00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.580\nthat and you need some extended time\nthat if you have other administrators or\n\n151\n00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.370\nother people that need to log in to that\nserver, shoot them a quick email and\n\n152\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.490\nsay hey I'm still logged into this thing.\n\n153\n00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.960\nIt's gonna be a little while.\n\n154\n00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.177\nI'll let you know as soon as I'm done,\nso if anybody else needs to get in.\n\n155\n00:07:46.177 --> 00:07:49.243\nThat was always one of my\npet peeves is I had to hey,\n\n156\n00:07:49.243 --> 00:07:51.217\nare you still logged into this?\n\n157\n00:07:51.217 --> 00:07:53.074\nIs it okay if I log you out?\n\n158\n00:07:53.074 --> 00:07:54.779\nKind of emails going back and forth.\n\n159\n00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:58.495\nAnd maybe they're at lunch,\nthings like that.\n\n160\n00:07:58.495 --> 00:08:00.490\nYou never know when they're\ngonna get back to you.\n\n161\n00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:01.320\nIt slows things down.\n\n162\n00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.860\n>> Oh yeah, you need to get\nsomething done real quick and you\n\n163\n00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.570\ncan't remote into it because both sessions\nare currently occupied, you can't get\n\n164\n00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.050\nahold of anybody to find out if you can\nboot them off and it's a pain in the but.\n\n165\n00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.400\nSo the better way to do it, let me connect\nagain I went ahead and disconnected.\n\n166\n00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.690\nI'm gonna connect over again.\n\n167\n00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.580\nSetup that remote connection.\n\n168\n00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.610\nAnd instead of disconnect, there\nare times when you need to disconnect.\n\n169\n00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.740\nLike we said if you need something to\ncontinue running in the background\n\n170\n00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.540\nyou disconnect and that session\ncontinues to run and you're good to go.\n\n171\n00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:34.395\nBut if you don't need anything to continue\nrunning you need to log off instead\n\n172\n00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:35.448\nof disconnect.\n\n173\n00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:39.163\nIt use to not give you that warning at\nleast now it pops up a warning that says,\n\n174\n00:08:39.163 --> 00:08:41.721\nhey, dummy you're gonna\nleave your session active\n\n175\n00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:46.150\nare you sure you want to do that and\nif you don't that's when you go sign out.\n\n176\n00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.530\nNow, I've killed my\nsession on that server.\n\n177\n00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.840\nSomebody else can remote\nin if they need to.\n\n178\n00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.910\nI'm not taking up one of those two\navailable slots for Remote Desktop.\n\n179\n00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.479\nSo the next thing I wanna do is take\na look at some of the options that we can\n\n180\n00:08:57.479 --> 00:08:59.470\nconfigure with Remote Desktop.\n\n181\n00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.490\nAgain, there's a lot of them.\n\n182\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:04.330\nI'm not gonna go over all of them, but\nyou should familiarize yourself with them.\n\n183\n00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:05.907\nYou never know what they're\ngonna ask you about on the exam.\n\n184\n00:09:05.907 --> 00:09:09.529\nOn this first tab here, the general tab,\nthis is where, in fact,\n\n185\n00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:11.340\nlet me show you that again.\n\n186\n00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.360\nWhen you first open Remote Desktop,\nyou don't see a lot of options.\n\n187\n00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.930\nBut if I click Show Options,\nI get the rest of my options.\n\n188\n00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.220\nI've got the name of the computer\nI'm gonna connect to.\n\n189\n00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.060\nThe credentials I wanna use.\n\n190\n00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:26.090\nYou could choose to save your credentials,\njust keep in mind that could be a security\n\n191\n00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.063\nrisk, especially if you make an icon on\nyour desktop for this, somebody else walks\n\n192\n00:09:30.063 --> 00:09:34.248\nby your computer, they could double-click\non it, connect as you now to that server.\n\n193\n00:09:34.248 --> 00:09:38.280\nSo be careful saving your credentials\non the display tab whether or\n\n194\n00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.970\nnot it starts out in full screen or a\nwindow, depending on how you wanna do it.\n\n195\n00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:43.490\nI love full screen.\n\n196\n00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.544\nYou can always bring it down to\na window size if you need to.\n\n197\n00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:49.810\nYou can also bring multiple monitors.\n\n198\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.000\nMy server does not have multiple\nmonitors connected to it, but\n\n199\n00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.750\nin my cubicle I might have\nthree monitors sitting there.\n\n200\n00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.710\nWhen I remote in I can actually take\nadvantage of all the real estate I\n\n201\n00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.200\nhave on my desk even though the remote\ncomputer does not have all those screens,\n\n202\n00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.060\nvery nice option there.\n\n203\n00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.940\nLocal resources, this is probably the one\nyou wanna pay the most attention to.\n\n204\n00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.996\nNot worried about audio settings.\n\n205\n00:10:09.996 --> 00:10:12.526\nDo you wanna stream audio?\n\n206\n00:10:12.526 --> 00:10:15.242\nIn other words,\nwhen I remote into that server, and\n\n207\n00:10:15.242 --> 00:10:19.131\nthat server makes some kind of audible\nalert, like a ding for a warning, or\n\n208\n00:10:19.131 --> 00:10:23.280\nsomething like that, do I want that\nsound played on my speakers here?\n\n209\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.430\nAnd most likely, yes, and that actually\nis the default play on this computer.\n\n210\n00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.911\nWhich is fine.\nYou're not gonna be streaming mp3s or\n\n211\n00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:31.280\nanything like that.\n\n212\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.742\nIt's not gonna, well,\nI guess it would work, but-\n\n213\n00:10:33.742 --> 00:10:34.682\n>> On a gig network, it might.\n\n214\n00:10:34.682 --> 00:10:36.503\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n215\n00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:38.943\nbring those audio settings\nwith you if you want.\n\n216\n00:10:38.943 --> 00:10:40.336\nKey strokes.\n\n217\n00:10:40.336 --> 00:10:45.720\nIf I do a Ctrl+Alt+Del or\na Windows key C+E or something like that.\n\n218\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.600\nWhere do those key combinations go?\n\n219\n00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.650\nTo the remote machine or to my host\nmachine, the one I'm sitting at?\n\n220\n00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:56.070\nIf, and the default is,\nif the remote connection is in full screen\n\n221\n00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.180\nthen any keyboard combinations you\ndo fire against the remote machine.\n\n222\n00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.260\nThat's the default if you wanna\nchange that you have that option.\n\n223\n00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.137\nThis down here at the bottom,\nthough, this is the important part.\n\n224\n00:11:05.137 --> 00:11:07.230\nThis is the local resources.\n\n225\n00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.840\nWhen I remote into that server, and\nI open up File Explorer, for example,\n\n226\n00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.860\nI'm gonna see the hard drives\non that remote server.\n\n227\n00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.030\nI can't copy files back and forth.\n\n228\n00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.680\nI can't drag them out of\nthe Remote Desktop Window onto my machine,\n\n229\n00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.860\nas well as I can't drag files from my\ncomputer onto that Remote Desktop Window.\n\n230\n00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.130\nThere are times I need to move\nfiles back and forth, and\n\n231\n00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:30.450\nall I need to do is bring\nmy hard drive with me.\n\n232\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.403\nSo if I come in here and said, hey, look,\nbring my C drive with me or drives that I\n\n233\n00:11:34.403 --> 00:11:38.239\nplug in later, plug and play devices,\nother supported like thumb drives and\n\n234\n00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.973\nthings like that,\nI can choose to bring those with me.\n\n235\n00:11:40.973 --> 00:11:43.730\nAnd I'll show you what\nhappens when I do that.\n\n236\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.430\nAlso, you'll see that printers,\n\n237\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:49.530\nby default, are brought with you,\nas well as your clipboard, which is handy,\n\n238\n00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:54.000\ncuz you can do some cut and\npaste there with some data.\n\n239\n00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.160\nPrinters, if I'm sitting at home,\nI've got a printer,\n\n240\n00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.480\nI remote into my computer at work, I get\nthat document that I worked on all day\n\n241\n00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.650\nthat I want to get a hard\ncopy of while I'm at home.\n\n242\n00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.640\nIf I click Print, it prints to the printer\nat work, which doesn't do me any good,\n\n243\n00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.940\nbecause I'm sitting at home.\n\n244\n00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.760\nSo I'm gonna bring my printers with me.\n\n245\n00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.740\nAny printer that I have\nattached locally here\n\n246\n00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.270\nwill show up in that remote\ndesktop connection by default.\n\n247\n00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:24.110\nExperience just has to do if you're\nhaving any bandwidth issues you can limit\n\n248\n00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.940\nsome of the functionality.\n\n249\n00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.220\nYou can turn off desktop background or\ncontents of Windows while dragging.\n\n250\n00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.790\nThat can help your\nperformance a little bit.\n\n251\n00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.417\nThe advanced tab, if you're supporting\nnetwork level authentication,\n\n252\n00:12:36.417 --> 00:12:40.098\nwhether you want it to warn you if\nthe remote machine doesn't support it, or\n\n253\n00:12:40.098 --> 00:12:42.937\nnot connect at all, or\nconnect anyway and don't warn me.\n\n254\n00:12:42.937 --> 00:12:45.487\nAnd then,\nyou've got your terminal services or\n\n255\n00:12:45.487 --> 00:12:48.050\nyour remote desktop gateway settings.\n\n256\n00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.380\nThis is useful if you're remoting\ninto a particular computer at work,\n\n257\n00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.430\nthat work computer doesn't have a public\nIP address, so your company might have set\n\n258\n00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:59.120\nup a remote desktop gateway,\nwhich is like a connection point.\n\n259\n00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.305\nYou first connect to that,\nand then from there,\n\n260\n00:13:01.305 --> 00:13:03.025\nyou remote into your machine at work.\n\n261\n00:13:03.025 --> 00:13:07.620\nSo you just have to know the settings for\nthat remote desktop gateway.\n\n262\n00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.857\nYour IT staff would provide those for you.\n\n263\n00:13:09.857 --> 00:13:11.650\nI don't need those.\n\n264\n00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:12.840\nI'm gonna cancel that out.\n\n265\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.990\nI'm gonna go ahead and click Connect.\n\n266\n00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.950\nAnd now, it's gonna warn me.\n\n267\n00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.260\nIt's gonna say, hey,\nyou're bringing along your drives and\n\n268\n00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.340\nsome other things,\ndo you trust that remote computer?\n\n269\n00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.380\nI'll say, yes, go ahead,\nI can say don't ask me again.\n\n270\n00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:31.560\nConnect anyway, provide my credentials and\nestablish this remote desktop connection.\n\n271\n00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.961\nAnd let's take a look at what happens now\nthat I'm bringing those local drives with\n\n272\n00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:40.096\nme as soon as it decides to connect,\nit's taking it's time.\n\n273\n00:13:40.096 --> 00:13:41.227\nThere it goes.\n\n274\n00:13:41.227 --> 00:13:46.770\n[COUGH] So now I've connected\ninto that server remotely,\n\n275\n00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:52.590\nand if I open up File Explorer,\nit's firing up server manager,\n\n276\n00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.260\nso it's lagging a little bit behind here.\n\n277\n00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.870\nNotice there's my C drive on client one.\n\n278\n00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.170\nSo if there was a file on this server,\n\n279\n00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.010\nthat I wanted to pull\nback to my local machine.\n\n280\n00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.140\nWell, I can now copy that file, and\n\n281\n00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.820\nI can go back out to that mapped drive,\nwhich is basically what it's doing.\n\n282\n00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:21.260\nThe server now has a mapped drive\nback to my local hard drive.\n\n283\n00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.380\nAnd so, I can come in here.\n\n284\n00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.300\nI can go into my user profile.\n\n285\n00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.350\nAnd into my documents.\n\n286\n00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.664\nAnd I can paste that file.\n\n287\n00:14:32.664 --> 00:14:34.067\nSo we can move files back and\n\n288\n00:14:34.067 --> 00:14:37.240\nforth as long as we remember to\nbring our local drives with us.\n\n289\n00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.320\nSo a lot of cool options you\ncan do with remote desktop\n\n290\n00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.000\nremember we're taking\nover that remote machine.\n\n291\n00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.950\nSometimes it's very handy.\n\n292\n00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.606\nWe always talk about server\nadministration and doing it remotely and\n\n293\n00:14:47.606 --> 00:14:52.082\nusing snap-ins and things like that which\ntypically work fine, sometimes you just\n\n294\n00:14:52.082 --> 00:14:55.502\nneed access to the desktop, and\nremote desktop is the way to go.\n\n295\n00:14:55.502 --> 00:14:58.672\nI'm gonna disconnect, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and log off of this guy.\n\n296\n00:14:58.672 --> 00:15:03.780\nAnd you can also save your configuration,\nlike all of those settings that I\n\n297\n00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:09.052\njust did, bringing my local drive,\nwhether or not I wanna bring my printer,\n\n298\n00:15:09.052 --> 00:15:12.862\ngraphics options,\nthings like that, I can save this,\n\n299\n00:15:12.862 --> 00:15:17.845\nI can do a Save As, and I'll just dump\nit out on my desktop so we can see it.\n\n300\n00:15:17.845 --> 00:15:22.262\nI'll say this is my connection to RTR01\ngive it a name and save, and now anytime I\n\n301\n00:15:22.262 --> 00:15:26.615\nwanna remote into that machine I can just\ndouble-click on that little icon there\n\n302\n00:15:26.615 --> 00:15:30.905\nit prompts me with our credentials I'm\ngood to go and I could save multiples, so\n\n303\n00:15:30.905 --> 00:15:35.004\nif I had four different servers I was\nresponsible for managing, I could have\n\n304\n00:15:35.004 --> 00:15:38.880\nan icon for each one of those and\njust double-click on it when I need it.\n\n305\n00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.887\nSo handy that you can save those\nremote desktop settings, as well.\n\n306\n00:15:41.887 --> 00:15:44.870\nAnd that's remote desktop which is,\nagain, remote control.\n\n307\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:45.767\n>> Yeah.\nIt's very,\n\n308\n00:15:45.767 --> 00:15:48.770\nvery nice piece of technology they have,\nit's built into the operating system.\n\n309\n00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.141\nSo you don't have to use\na third party product,\n\n310\n00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:53.216\nhave to go purchase something separate so\n\n311\n00:15:53.216 --> 00:15:56.910\nthat you can get remote connectivity\nto other computers in your network.\n\n312\n00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.850\nIt's a very very handy thing to have.\n\n313\n00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:03.040\nNow, something that usually walks\nhand in hand with remote desktop,\n\n314\n00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.660\nespecially if they are,\nif you have users that are really remote.\n\n315\n00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.650\nI'm not sitting at my desk and\n\n316\n00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:14.230\nI'm remoting into the server in the server\ncloset all on the same internal network.\n\n317\n00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.820\nWhat happens if I have users\nthat are outside of my network?\n\n318\n00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.290\nHow do I get them to connect\nto our internal network\n\n319\n00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.770\nwhen they're outside of the network so\n\n320\n00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.680\nthat they can use Remote Desktop to\naccess their computer from home at work?\n\n321\n00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.238\nRight?\nSo if they're at home and\n\n322\n00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:30.909\nneed to access that PC\nsitting on their desktop,\n\n323\n00:16:30.909 --> 00:16:33.069\nhow do I get those two networks to talk?\n\n324\n00:16:33.069 --> 00:16:37.070\nWell that's where VPNs come in and Mike,\nyou know all about this VPN stuff.\n\n325\n00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:37.685\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n326\n00:16:37.685 --> 00:16:38.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely.\n\n327\n00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.990\n>> He's the master.\n\n328\n00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:41.190\n>> VPNs are a fantastic thing.\n\n329\n00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:45.630\nThey've been around for a while Virtual\nPrivate Network is what it stands for.\n\n330\n00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:49.290\nAnd if we think about it, my work\nnetwork is connected to the Internet.\n\n331\n00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:53.910\nWherever I'm at, the hotel, Starbucks,\nhome, it's connected to the Internet,\n\n332\n00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:54.556\nmost likely.\n\n333\n00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:56.980\nAnd the Internet is just one\nbig fat mesh network, so\n\n334\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.470\nit kinda makes sense that I should\nbe able to connect from home or\n\n335\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:03.250\nwherever back to my corporate network,\nand you absolutely can.\n\n336\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.160\nThe problem is you're going\nacross public infrastructure.\n\n337\n00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.900\nRight?\nYou're relying on the Internet\n\n338\n00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.520\nto establish that connection back to work,\nand that's not a trusted network and\n\n339\n00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.960\nyou wanna make sure that\nyour data is protected.\n\n340\n00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.150\nWho knows who's out there\ntrying to spy on your data.\n\n341\n00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:21.580\nSo a virtual private network creates what\nwe call a tunnel, it encapsulates our\n\n342\n00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:25.400\ntraffic and protects it from prying\neyes out there on the Internet.\n\n343\n00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.990\nAnd it's different from remote\ndesktop in the fact, remember,\n\n344\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.500\nremote desktop is a remote control.\n\n345\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.800\nYou're taking over a machine that\nalready exists on the network.\n\n346\n00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.290\nLike, I could be at home, and\nI'm going to remote into that server.\n\n347\n00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.997\nI'm taking over the server,\nthe server exists on the work network.\n\n348\n00:17:40.997 --> 00:17:46.150\nVPN, you're connecting your\nmachine to the work network.\n\n349\n00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.398\nYou're adding another\nmachine to the network.\n\n350\n00:17:48.398 --> 00:17:51.160\nIt's like you're taking a really\nlong ethernet cable and\n\n351\n00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.770\nrunning it from wherever you are to\na switch in the server closet.\n\n352\n00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:55.350\nRight?\nSo,\n\n353\n00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.070\ninstead of taking over a machine\nthat's already on the network.\n\n354\n00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.470\nYou're adding another computer to\nthe network when you do a VPN.\n\n355\n00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.180\nAnd then,\nonce you're connected to the work network,\n\n356\n00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.060\nit's just like you were sitting\nat your computer at work.\n\n357\n00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.260\nYou have access to the printers,\nto the shared folders, to whatever it is.\n\n358\n00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.440\nYou could remote desktop into\na machine that's on the network.\n\n359\n00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.450\nBut you don't have to.\n\n360\n00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.000\nYou're actually at the network now and\nyou can print,\n\n361\n00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.920\nyou can browse the file servers.\n\n362\n00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.240\nIt's just like you were\nconnected to that work network.\n\n363\n00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.284\nThat's the big advantage of VPN or Virtual\nPrivate Network because you're extending\n\n364\n00:18:26.284 --> 00:18:28.566\nout your corporate network\nto cover your house.\n\n365\n00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.820\nRight?\nOr whatever the case is.\n\n366\n00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.120\nNow, it's gotta be all set up.\n\n367\n00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.670\nThis isn't something that\njust happens automatically.\n\n368\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.590\nYour server admins are gonna set\nup what we call a VPN server.\n\n369\n00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.579\nThat's the listener, the endpoint.\n\n370\n00:18:40.579 --> 00:18:41.770\nRight?\nIt sits on\n\n371\n00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.350\nthe edge of your corporate network.\n\n372\n00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.815\nIt has one network adapter connected\nto the inside, to the internal network.\n\n373\n00:18:46.815 --> 00:18:50.477\nIt has a second network adapter connected\nto the outside, to the Internet.\n\n374\n00:18:50.477 --> 00:18:55.051\nAnd then when you're at home, you point\nyour computer to that outside interface.\n\n375\n00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:59.070\nAnd that's what allows you to establish\nthat connection to the corporate network.\n\n376\n00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.412\nAnd in that VPN server just routes your\ntraffic through to the internal network\n\n377\n00:19:03.412 --> 00:19:05.793\nand then back out to\nyour computer at home.\n\n378\n00:19:05.793 --> 00:19:07.160\nSo lets see how that works.\n\n379\n00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.999\nI've already got the VPN server all set\nup, everything should be good to go there.\n\n380\n00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:16.323\nSo to create my VPN,\nI'm simply gonna come down here and\n\n381\n00:19:16.323 --> 00:19:21.016\ntype in VPN, and\nthen change virtual private networks, and\n\n382\n00:19:21.016 --> 00:19:25.070\nhere I can choose to add\na new VPN connection.\n\n383\n00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.700\nAnd you can add several connections,\n\n384\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.900\nyou might have different\nnetworks you have to VPN into.\n\n385\n00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.950\nI'll choose my provider, Windows,\nit's the only one I get by default.\n\n386\n00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:38.490\nI'll give the connection a name, and\nI'm just gonna call it CorpNetwork or\n\n387\n00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.480\nsomething like that.\n\n388\n00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.600\nAnd I'll give the IP address.\n\n389\n00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.488\nThis is where you need to know\nthe VPN server's information.\n\n390\n00:19:45.488 --> 00:19:48.400\nRight?\nI'm gonna point across the Internet and\n\n391\n00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.120\nhit that VPN server.\n\n392\n00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.330\nSo I need to know it's name or\nit's IP address.\n\n393\n00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.655\nNames can be finicky,\n\n394\n00:19:53.655 --> 00:19:57.929\nbecause when you're at home you're\nnot using your work's DNS server.\n\n395\n00:19:57.929 --> 00:20:01.445\nSo you might not be able to resolve\nthe name of that VPN serve depending on\n\n396\n00:20:01.445 --> 00:20:03.360\nhow your company has set it up.\n\n397\n00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.430\nSo, if you can resolve that VPN\nserver publicly from the outside,\n\n398\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.570\nyou can use a name.\n\n399\n00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.070\nMost of the time we use IP addresses,\n\n400\n00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.520\nso we eliminate DNS as\nbeing a source of trouble.\n\n401\n00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.330\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\ntype in the IP address of the VPN server.\n\n402\n00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.640\nAnd again that would normally\nbe a public IP address.\n\n403\n00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.100\nThis is a lab environment.\n\n404\n00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.820\nSo I'm using all private networks.\n\n405\n00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.010\nBut remember, we're going across the\nInternet, so I couldn't sit at home and\n\n406\n00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.320\ntype in a private IP address and\nconnect to that VPN server.\n\n407\n00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:35.370\nI would need to know the public IP of that\npublic facing adapter on that VPN server.\n\n408\n00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.350\nAnd I'll leave the VPN type as automatic.\n\n409\n00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.770\nI'm gonna use a user name and\n\n410\n00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:44.710\npassword, although I have other options if\nmy company has set up SmartCard or OTPs,\n\n411\n00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.430\nOne Time Passwords,\nwe could use those as well.\n\n412\n00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:51.670\nI'll leave it on user name and\npassword and I'm gonna click Save, and\n\n413\n00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:55.640\nnow I've got my new CorpNetwork VPN\nconnection and we'll attempt to connect.\n\n414\n00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.230\nThis is gonna say, well who are you?\n\n415\n00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.112\nAre you allowed?\n\n416\n00:20:59.112 --> 00:21:01.660\nRight?\nI have to have permission\n\n417\n00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.810\nto VPN into work.\n\n418\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.959\nAnd if I can remember the password for\nthat account,\n\n419\n00:21:06.959 --> 00:21:08.642\nI should be able to click OK.\n\n420\n00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:10.916\nIt's verifying my information, and\n\n421\n00:21:10.916 --> 00:21:15.580\nthen we keep our fingers crossed cuz\nVPNs can be very finicky sometimes.\n\n422\n00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.360\nAnd there you go, I'm now connected.\n\n423\n00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.756\nNow, this is what throws a lot of people\nbecause, if you look at my screen,\n\n424\n00:21:21.756 --> 00:21:23.707\nnothing is changed.\n\n425\n00:21:23.707 --> 00:21:24.320\nRight?\n\n426\n00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.370\nWhen you do remote desktop, you see this\nother machine's desktop on your screen.\n\n427\n00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.600\nAnd it's very obvious what you're doing.\n\n428\n00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.648\nWhen you do a VPN connection,\nit says you've connected, and now what?\n\n429\n00:21:34.648 --> 00:21:37.410\nRight?\nI'm right back to my normal desktop.\n\n430\n00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:42.120\nWell, what we have to remember is,\nI now have a connection back to work.\n\n431\n00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.920\nWhen I'm sitting at home, I can't connect\nto file shares on the corporate network.\n\n432\n00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.610\nBut now that I've VPN'd in,\nI can actually open up file explorer and\n\n433\n00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:56.490\nconnect to a file share that\nexists on my work network.\n\n434\n00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:00.650\nAgain, it's just like I plugged my\ncomputer into the work network.\n\n435\n00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:02.170\nAnything that I have permission to do,\n\n436\n00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:06.140\nwhen I'm at work,\nI can now do through this VPN connection.\n\n437\n00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.910\nSo, a little bit different\nfrom remote desktop.\n\n438\n00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.230\nThis is remote access but fantastic.\n\n439\n00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:15.390\nAnd with remote desktop, you get access to\nthat one machine that you're remoted into.\n\n440\n00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:20.040\nWith VPN, I can connect to anything on\nthe network that I wanna access, and\n\n441\n00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.220\nthat I have permissions for.\n\n442\n00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.120\n>> Yeah, and the only time this can\nget really hinky is, like Mike said,\n\n443\n00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.920\nnothing really changes once\nyou connect to that VPN.\n\n444\n00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.220\nIt just says you're connected.\n\n445\n00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.320\nAnd you're like, oh,\ngreat, that's wonderful.\n\n446\n00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.060\nWhere you do need to understand this,\nI don't know if this will be on the test,\n\n447\n00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.090\nbut this is definitely\npractical VPN support.\n\n448\n00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:41.270\nIs that their password,\nespecially on a domain joined machine.\n\n449\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.470\nIf we give a user a laptop and it's\njoined to our domain, they take it home,\n\n450\n00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.350\nwell it doesn't contact the domain but\nthey still login.\n\n451\n00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.920\nRight?\nThe cached credentials allow\n\n452\n00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.540\nthem to login.\n\n453\n00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.262\nMaybe we've given them\na local user account, but\n\n454\n00:22:51.262 --> 00:22:53.443\nthey're probably logging in\nwith those cached credentials.\n\n455\n00:22:53.443 --> 00:22:55.196\nTheir password changes, and\n\n456\n00:22:55.196 --> 00:22:59.155\nthen they try to login to VPN Its\ngonna say you can't login the VPN.\n\n457\n00:22:59.155 --> 00:22:59.687\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n458\n00:22:59.687 --> 00:23:03.763\nthen they call the help desk they get\ntheir password reset they log into the VPN\n\n459\n00:23:03.763 --> 00:23:08.150\nand they say okay, I logged out but\nnow I can't log in using the new password.\n\n460\n00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:11.850\nThat's because you have to change the\ncache credentials on the actual machine.\n\n461\n00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.002\nDo the Ctrl+Alt+Delete\nlock this computer and\n\n462\n00:23:14.002 --> 00:23:17.148\nthen sign in while you're connected\nto the VPN using the new password,\n\n463\n00:23:17.148 --> 00:23:20.470\nit'll cast those credentials and\nthen they'll be back in action.\n\n464\n00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.180\nIt's a really important thing to\nremember if you're supporting VPN users.\n\n465\n00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:24.974\n>> It sounds like you might've had.\n\n466\n00:23:24.974 --> 00:23:26.605\n>> I had to do that once or twice.\n\n467\n00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:28.685\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A time or two, yes.\n\n468\n00:23:28.685 --> 00:23:29.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n469\n00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.630\nif we take a look at my screen one more\ntime here, I wanna show you one or\n\n470\n00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.050\ntwo more things.\n\n471\n00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:38.710\nNow that I'm connected, I've got that\nVPN established, how could I tell?\n\n472\n00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.160\nWell, if I go down here you'll see\nI actually have two connections.\n\n473\n00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.150\nI've got my unidentified network,\nthat's my normal connection.\n\n474\n00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:46.750\nBut then there's that lab.net.\n\n475\n00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.219\nRight?\nThat's my VPN connection.\n\n476\n00:23:48.219 --> 00:23:52.177\nIf I open up an IP command prompt and\ndo a little IP config.\n\n477\n00:23:52.177 --> 00:23:54.616\nYou're gonna see that\nI have my IP address.\n\n478\n00:23:54.616 --> 00:23:57.920\nThis is my IP address\nfrom my home network.\n\n479\n00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.220\nThis, my PPP adapter,\nthat's my VPN connection.\n\n480\n00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.480\nThat's what gives me an IP address\nthat's valid on the corporate network.\n\n481\n00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.310\nCuz if I didn't have an IP address that\nwas valid on the corporate network,\n\n482\n00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.110\nI couldn't connect with those file shares.\n\n483\n00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.840\nSo you see I get two IP addresses.\n\n484\n00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.840\nOne for my network at home or\nthe hotel where I'm at, a separate one for\n\n485\n00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.490\nthat VPN connection that gives me\nan IP address that's on the right.\n\n486\n00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:24.086\nSo subnet will allow me talk to\nthe resources on the work network.\n\n487\n00:24:24.086 --> 00:24:25.610\nSo that's a couple ways you can tell.\n\n488\n00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.480\nNow, a couple other things that\nI do want to talk about VPN's,\n\n489\n00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.070\nthat they call out on the objectives,\none is called VPN Reconnect.\n\n490\n00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.200\nThere's really with Windows there's\nfour different VPN protocols\n\n491\n00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.680\nthat I can use to establish\nthat connection back to work.\n\n492\n00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.230\nThere is one called PPTP,\npoint to point tunneling protocol.\n\n493\n00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.950\nThere's L2TP,\nlayer two tunneling protocol.\n\n494\n00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.546\nThere's SSTP,\nsecure socket tunneling protocol.\n\n495\n00:24:51.546 --> 00:24:56.260\nAnd then, there's IKEv2,\nwhich is internet key exchange, version 2.\n\n496\n00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.620\nNow, with my VPN connection,\nI left it on automatic.\n\n497\n00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.140\nAnd it will cycle through all those\ndifferent protocols, and the server that\n\n498\n00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:08.370\nthe server admin set up is really\ngonna determine what I end up using.\n\n499\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.220\nThey pick one or two, and\n\n500\n00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.500\nmy computer will negotiate that\nwhen I establish that connection.\n\n501\n00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.770\nMaybe they only allow PPTP and SSTP.\n\n502\n00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.279\nMy computer will figure that out and\nit will make that connection.\n\n503\n00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:22.230\nThe one protocol,\n\n504\n00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.830\nIKEv2, has a special feature that's\nnot available in the other ones.\n\n505\n00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.800\nAnd it's called VPN Reconnect.\n\n506\n00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.000\nI'm not gonna show it to you here.\n\n507\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.640\nBut I want you to make sure you're\naware of it and what it is, so\n\n508\n00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.290\nif they ask you on the exam.\n\n509\n00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:39.010\nIKEv2, just another tunneling protocol,\nsupports this VPN Reconnect.\n\n510\n00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.510\nAnd what that means is if I use one of\nthose other protocols, like PPTP or\n\n511\n00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:46.940\nL2TP and\nI lose my internet connection, well,\n\n512\n00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.710\nobviously if I'm VPN back to work,\nacross the Internet, and\n\n513\n00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:54.650\nI lose my internet connection,\nI've also lost my VPN connection.\n\n514\n00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.969\nOnce I reestablish my Internet connection\nI'm gonna have to reestablish my VPN\n\n515\n00:25:58.969 --> 00:25:59.748\nconnection.\n\n516\n00:25:59.748 --> 00:26:02.480\nAnd there's a good chance\nI could lose some work.\n\n517\n00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.800\nLike if I was in the middle of doing\na document, typing up a word document or\n\n518\n00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.690\nsomething like that,\nI could lose that information.\n\n519\n00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:13.560\nAs well as I have to manually go through\nthe whole process of reconnecting again.\n\n520\n00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.540\nClick on the VPN,\nput in my authentication, reconnect,\n\n521\n00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.300\nall that good stuff.\n\n522\n00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.170\nWith IKEv2,\nIKEv2 if I say that correctly and\n\n523\n00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.200\nVPN reconnect, that happens\nautomatically in the background.\n\n524\n00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.808\nWhat'll happen is, it'll sense that\nyou have, the remote access server\n\n525\n00:26:29.808 --> 00:26:34.060\nat the corporate network will sense that\nyou've gone, you've lost your connection.\n\n526\n00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.860\nIt's gonna maintain your connection as far\nas the corporate network is concerned.\n\n527\n00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.460\nIt thinks you're still there.\n\n528\n00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:44.130\nAnd as soon as you reestablish network\nInternet activity, your client will\n\n529\n00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.660\nreestablish its connection to\nthat VPN server all automatic.\n\n530\n00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.428\nAll behind the scene.\n\n531\n00:26:49.428 --> 00:26:53.410\nAnd that can be pretty handy,\none, for the user, it's easy.\n\n532\n00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:54.510\nThey go, oh, I lost my Internet,\n\n533\n00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.280\ncuz usually, my Internet\nconnection is a temporary thing.\n\n534\n00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:03.670\nMicrosoft gives the example of riding a\ntrain, establishing an Internet connection\n\n535\n00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.550\ngoing through a tunnel, temporarily losing\nInternet connection, coming out the other\n\n536\n00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:11.630\nside of the tunnel, reestablishing\nInternet connection, reestablished.\n\n537\n00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.390\nI've never done a lot of work on\na train or had a, I don't know.\n\n538\n00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:15.990\n>> Maybe European countries?\n\n539\n00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.480\n[LAUGH] They have a lot of trains.\n\n540\n00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.754\n>> Maybe.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n541\n00:27:18.754 --> 00:27:20.628\n>> So, but if you're at a hotel,\n\n542\n00:27:20.628 --> 00:27:25.318\nsometimes those access points there can\nbe flaky and you drop a connection and\n\n543\n00:27:25.318 --> 00:27:26.920\nit will just pick back up.\n\n544\n00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.620\nI will say when I've played with this\nbefore I've shut my computer down here,\n\n545\n00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.550\ngone home, popped up my computer,\nand forgot about it and\n\n546\n00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:37.150\nall of a sudden the VPN pops back\nup like oh wow, that's kinda cool.\n\n547\n00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:41.500\nIt automatically reconnected, so\na little bit easier on the end user.\n\n548\n00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.980\nAgain, only available though using IKEv2.\n\n549\n00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:51.410\nSo if on the exam they say,\nyou want to support VPN reconnect\n\n550\n00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:57.030\nyou need to know,\nI better setup IKEv2 as my VPN protocol.\n\n551\n00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:01.730\nBecause it does not work with PPTP,\nL2TP, or SSTP.\n\n552\n00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:04.230\nSo something you need to know for\nthe exam there.\n\n553\n00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:08.340\nThe last thing, Daniel, I wanna show\nis going to be that, gosh what was it?\n\n554\n00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.130\n>> Broadband tethering.\n\n555\n00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:09.930\n>> Broadband tethering.\n\n556\n00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.200\n>> It's a wonderful thing.\n\n557\n00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.006\n>> Yeah.\n\n558\n00:28:12.006 --> 00:28:14.912\nThis is something,\nit is becoming the rage now, or\n\n559\n00:28:14.912 --> 00:28:17.840\nit's something that's more commonly done.\n\n560\n00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.130\nBecause our speeds have increased\non our cellular networks, LTE and\n\n561\n00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.470\nall that has definitely gone up.\n\n562\n00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:29.267\nAnd if you ever find yourself in an area\nwhere you don't have Internet connection,\n\n563\n00:28:29.267 --> 00:28:35.050\nyou don't have that Wi-Fi, you can set\nup broadband tethering from Windows 10.\n\n564\n00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:40.670\nWhere if you've got a broadband\nconnection like a PPPoE type connection,\n\n565\n00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.380\nit's basically Internet\nconnection sharing.\n\n566\n00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:46.012\nIt's something we've had in the past,\nbut it's gonna allow you to connect,\n\n567\n00:28:46.012 --> 00:28:48.778\nyou're gonna turn your machine\nbasically into a hotspot.\n\n568\n00:28:48.778 --> 00:28:52.855\nAnd then, other machines can\nconnect through you, and then for\n\n569\n00:28:52.855 --> 00:28:55.573\nthrough you out there to the Internet, and\n\n570\n00:28:55.573 --> 00:28:59.952\nit's relatively easy to do its not\nthat all that exciting to see, but\n\n571\n00:28:59.952 --> 00:29:05.011\nif I go open up my Control Panel and I go\ninto Network and Internet, and I'm gonna\n\n572\n00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:10.030\nchoose Connect to the Internet to set\nup a broadband PPP security connection.\n\n573\n00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.179\nAnd I don't actually have one,\nso I'm just gonna make this up.\n\n574\n00:29:17.179 --> 00:29:22.170\nAnd my super secret password,\nI'll give it a name.\n\n575\n00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.720\nNow, call it Broadband Connection\nhow about that.\n\n576\n00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.422\nAnd then, right here,\nallow other people to use this connection.\n\n577\n00:29:28.422 --> 00:29:30.510\n[COUGH] Then I'll click Connect.\n\n578\n00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.350\nAnd then, I'm gonna skip it because its\njust gonna look and its not gonna find it.\n\n579\n00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:37.460\nNow, I'll go ahead and click Close.\n\n580\n00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:44.710\nAnd now, when I go into my Network,\n\n581\n00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.480\noh, see I had this broadband\nconnection sitting here.\n\n582\n00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.720\nAnd if I pull up\nthe properties of that guy.\n\n583\n00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.910\nAnd I go over to the sharing tab.\n\n584\n00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.430\nHere, I can choose and\neven though I choose it in the setup,\n\n585\n00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.510\nI still need to come in here and\nchoose it.\n\n586\n00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.270\nAnother thing that you should\nbe aware of for the exam.\n\n587\n00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.461\nAllow others to connect through this\ncomputer's Internet connection.\n\n588\n00:30:04.461 --> 00:30:07.540\nAnd it's telling me that my\ncredential's weren't saved.\n\n589\n00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:09.480\nWhich means I would have\n\n590\n00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.990\nto authenticate before anybody could\nactually connect through this.\n\n591\n00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:13.610\nYou can choose to save your credentials.\n\n592\n00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:15.810\nAnd that's it.\n\n593\n00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:21.180\nSo now, if I was to actually\ndouble-click on that guy, and\n\n594\n00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.400\nestablish that connection,\nother people could then see that.\n\n595\n00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.230\nThey would see that connection and\nthen they could connect to it.\n\n596\n00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.440\nAnd then, through me out to the Internet.\n\n597\n00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.120\nI don't know, I find this useful.\n\n598\n00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.989\nMaybe like you said, I see it more\nuseful doing it from my Window 10 phone.\n\n599\n00:30:35.989 --> 00:30:38.870\nAnd then, if I was in a place\nwhere I didn't have Wi-Fi where\n\n600\n00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:42.180\nI could then connect my laptop,\nI could tether it to my phone.\n\n601\n00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.390\nAnd take advantage of that way.\n\n602\n00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:45.040\n>> Yeah.\nVery cool stuff, Mike.\n\n603\n00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.790\nWe have enjoyed watching this show.\n\n604\n00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.580\nWe've done a lot of neat\nthings with remote access.\n\n605\n00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.140\nHopefully you guys\nare starting to understand,\n\n606\n00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.550\nwe try to do a really good\njob of giving some practical\n\n607\n00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:59.210\nideas of how we use these\ndifferent remote-type connections.\n\n608\n00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:04.230\nWell, obviously RDP, the remote desktop\nprotocol, is the bread and butter.\n\n609\n00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.170\nWe're gonna use that a lot.\n\n610\n00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:09.580\nVPNs are gonna be for those mobile users\ngoing out there into the field and\n\n611\n00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.840\nstill needing to connect back\ninto our internal private network\n\n612\n00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.860\nthat allows us to do that great stuff.\n\n613\n00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.320\nAnd then, a couple other options as well,\nwith the broadband tethering,\n\n614\n00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.420\nvery interesting.\n\n615\n00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.920\nMike, have we missed anything?\n\n616\n00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.710\nOr are we finally at the end of our show?\n\n617\n00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:22.640\n>> I think we've hit all of\n\n618\n00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.340\nthe objectives-\n>> All right.\n\n619\n00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.600\n>> We need for the exam anyway.\n\n620\n00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.940\n>> Next-\n>> But again, make sure you go through and\n\n621\n00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.920\nplay with a lot of those settings like in\nthat VPN options and things like that.\n\n622\n00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.453\n>> That's right.\nSo\n\n623\n00:31:30.453 --> 00:31:33.365\ndon't be afraid to kick your feet around\ninside of the operating system that\n\n624\n00:31:33.365 --> 00:31:33.878\nbeing said.\n\n625\n00:31:33.878 --> 00:31:36.679\nWe thank you for\nwatching sign off for ITProTV,\n\n626\n00:31:36.679 --> 00:31:38.535\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n627\n00:31:38.535 --> 00:31:39.440\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n628\n00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.451\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n629\n00:31:40.451 --> 00:31:47.820\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:20.498\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and joining me\nin the studio today is none other than my\n\n4\n00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:21.936\ngood friend Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:22.963\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:22.963 --> 00:00:24.455\n>> It is going great Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:25.666\nI'm excited to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.923\nWe've got more of our Windows\n10 content coming your way and\n\n9\n00:00:28.923 --> 00:00:32.504\nin this one we're gonna be looking\nat Microsoft as your remote app.\n\n10\n00:00:32.504 --> 00:00:37.740\nA remote app is a really cool technology\nand we've been able to use it in-house or\n\n11\n00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.370\non-premise for some time, and it gives us\nthe ability to run applications remotely.\n\n12\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.855\nWhat do you mean?\n\n13\n00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:47.544\nWell we're actually gonna host\nthese apps on a server and\n\n14\n00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:51.311\nthe clients are gonna be able to access\nthem remotely right across the network.\n\n15\n00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:54.401\nAnd like I said we've been doing\nthis internally for a little while.\n\n16\n00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:57.635\nNow we're gonna talk about\nmoving this out to the cloud and\n\n17\n00:00:57.635 --> 00:01:00.081\nusing Microsoft Azure's cloud services.\n\n18\n00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:04.359\nAnd it's really pretty cool cuz now all\nof a sudden I can give people access\n\n19\n00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:06.776\nto applications from wherever they are,\n\n20\n00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:11.401\nwhether they're in a corporate, at\nthe work network, on their work machine,\n\n21\n00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:16.511\nwhen they're at home on their own personal\nPC or they're traveling with their laptop,\n\n22\n00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:19.717\nand even better than that,\nnot only Windows devices.\n\n23\n00:01:19.717 --> 00:01:22.798\nWe can do this with iOS and\nAndroid as well.\n\n24\n00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:27.985\nSo it's really pretty cool, it runs up\non top of the remote desktop services.\n\n25\n00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:30.427\nBut instead of providing\nan entire desktop,\n\n26\n00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:32.620\nwe're just providing an application.\n\n27\n00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.816\nAnd the benefits are one, I can access\nit from anywhere from any computer,\n\n28\n00:01:36.816 --> 00:01:41.364\nI don't have to go around and install\nthe application on each and every machine.\n\n29\n00:01:41.364 --> 00:01:44.267\nI install it on my remote app server.\n\n30\n00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:48.579\nAnd the application resides there and then\nas I said they're basically using RDP or\n\n31\n00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.238\nremote desktop to connect\nup to this application.\n\n32\n00:01:51.238 --> 00:01:54.534\nThey see it on their computer\njust like it was a local F.\n\n33\n00:01:54.534 --> 00:01:57.129\nIn fact it'll show up like\nin a Windows machine.\n\n34\n00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:58.655\nIt'll show up on their Start menu and\n\n35\n00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:00.784\nit'll look like it's\ninstalled on that machine.\n\n36\n00:02:00.784 --> 00:02:01.723\nThey click on it.\n\n37\n00:02:01.723 --> 00:02:02.839\nIt launches it.\n\n38\n00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:05.236\nEverything looks as it always has.\n\n39\n00:02:05.236 --> 00:02:07.236\nBut it's being hosted on a server.\n\n40\n00:02:07.236 --> 00:02:10.790\nAnd that's advantageous one as I told you\nbecause of the fact I can deliver to them\n\n41\n00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:11.688\nanywhere they are.\n\n42\n00:02:11.688 --> 00:02:15.443\nIf it's cloud that means anybody with\nInternet access can get access to this.\n\n43\n00:02:15.443 --> 00:02:17.780\nAlso think about updates.\n\n44\n00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.970\nWhat about when it's time to move from\none version of an application to another?\n\n45\n00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.150\nI don't have to do that on\n10,000 client machines.\n\n46\n00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.950\nI do it on my remote app servers,\nthat's all I got to do.\n\n47\n00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.090\nWhen updates come out,\npatches for those applications.\n\n48\n00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.642\nI'm not patching hundreds or\nthousands of machines.\n\n49\n00:02:33.642 --> 00:02:36.368\nI'm patching it once or\ntwice on my remote app servers.\n\n50\n00:02:36.368 --> 00:02:37.425\nAnd we're good to go.\n\n51\n00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:41.297\n>> Yeah, obviously there's a lot of\nbenefits to using remote app via Azure,\n\n52\n00:02:41.297 --> 00:02:44.985\nbecause we can do what Mike was just\ntalking about let's cut those apron\n\n53\n00:02:44.985 --> 00:02:45.554\nstrings.\n\n54\n00:02:45.554 --> 00:02:48.711\nLet our users roam free,\ngo wherever they need to go.\n\n55\n00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:51.141\nStill have access to the apps\nthey need access to.\n\n56\n00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:53.058\nNow Mike I'm sold on this obviously.\n\n57\n00:02:53.058 --> 00:02:54.956\nThis is one of the best\nthings since sliced bread.\n\n58\n00:02:54.956 --> 00:02:58.457\nNow we gotta know, all right,\nlet's dive in headfirst.\n\n59\n00:02:58.457 --> 00:03:00.458\nWhere do we start was this,\nhow do we configure it?\n\n60\n00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:01.530\nI want it on my network.\n\n61\n00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.241\nLet's do it.\n\n62\n00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:04.507\n>> All right, so\nwhat we're gonna do, first of all,\n\n63\n00:03:04.507 --> 00:03:06.415\nAzure is a subscription-based service.\n\n64\n00:03:06.415 --> 00:03:10.548\nSo for an organization to do this you're\ngonna have to have a Microsoft Azure\n\n65\n00:03:10.548 --> 00:03:12.109\naccount, which I've got.\n\n66\n00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.474\nAnd if we take a look at my screen here,\n\n67\n00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:16.102\nI can show you what it would look like\nif you're gonna be setting this up.\n\n68\n00:03:16.102 --> 00:03:19.924\nAgain for this exam, we're not really\ngonna dive in too far into Azure.\n\n69\n00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:24.572\nWe've got other videos in our course\nlibrary that you can watch and\n\n70\n00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:26.159\nlearn all about that.\n\n71\n00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:32.185\nBut here on my Azure portal, I can\nscroll down, and I can find remote app.\n\n72\n00:03:32.185 --> 00:03:37.970\nAnd we'll just refresh this page here,\ngot a little time out I believe.\n\n73\n00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.036\n>> One of the small caveats of being\na web-based forum is that it will lose its\n\n74\n00:03:42.036 --> 00:03:42.569\ntiming.\n\n75\n00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.765\n>> It will, so\nhopefully we'll get this thing connected.\n\n76\n00:03:45.765 --> 00:03:46.453\nThere we go.\n\n77\n00:03:46.453 --> 00:03:47.441\nWe can see it popping back in.\n\n78\n00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:49.158\nIt's populating all that information.\n\n79\n00:03:49.158 --> 00:03:51.220\nBasically what it's doing is it's\ngoing through my subscription.\n\n80\n00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.656\nAnd looking to see what I have.\n\n81\n00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:53.639\nDo have any web apps?\n\n82\n00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.537\nDo I have virtual machines up there?\n\n83\n00:03:55.537 --> 00:03:57.852\nNetworks, that kind of thing.\n\n84\n00:03:57.852 --> 00:03:59.817\nThere we go that looks a little better.\n\n85\n00:03:59.817 --> 00:04:03.767\nAnd now I've got my remote app collection\nand if I click on that ITPro remote apps,\n\n86\n00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:05.379\na couple things that I have to do.\n\n87\n00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.210\nTelling you, setting this up was a breeze.\n\n88\n00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.823\nI came in here,\nI went into that remote app.\n\n89\n00:04:10.823 --> 00:04:14.158\nI clicked a couple links and\nI set it up and that was it.\n\n90\n00:04:14.158 --> 00:04:17.296\nAnd once you got it set up then\nwe're gonna do our publish.\n\n91\n00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:21.156\nThese are the programs you wanna make\navailable, publishing remote app,\n\n92\n00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:22.019\napplications.\n\n93\n00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.858\nSo I click on that link, and\nI've already done this, but\n\n94\n00:04:24.858 --> 00:04:27.827\njust to show you what it looks like,\nit'll provide a list.\n\n95\n00:04:27.827 --> 00:04:29.677\nNow depending on your subscription,\n\n96\n00:04:29.677 --> 00:04:33.216\nthis is basically a pre-built machine\nthat I'm using from Microsoft.\n\n97\n00:04:33.216 --> 00:04:37.385\nSo it has a lot of the Microsoft products\nhere, kinda lets you test-drive remote app\n\n98\n00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:40.104\nand see if that's what your\norganization wants to do.\n\n99\n00:04:40.104 --> 00:04:42.602\nAnd you can see all the different\napplications that I have available.\n\n100\n00:04:42.602 --> 00:04:44.044\nAgain, I'm not limited to that.\n\n101\n00:04:44.044 --> 00:04:46.578\nIf I wanna put my own apps up there,\nwe can do that.\n\n102\n00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:50.366\nWe can make our own remote app\nprograms and make those available.\n\n103\n00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:54.225\nI'm gonna close that down but once I had\nselected a few and decided to publish\n\n104\n00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:58.100\nthose, and that's what it's called\nyou're publishing an application.\n\n105\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.825\nThen you've got to configure who's\ngonna be allowed to access that.\n\n106\n00:05:00.825 --> 00:05:03.254\nAnd you've got a couple of\ndifferent ways you can do this.\n\n107\n00:05:03.254 --> 00:05:06.726\nWith Azure I can use Active Directory.\n\n108\n00:05:06.726 --> 00:05:10.687\nI have a directory hosted in the cloud\nup here in my Azure service and\n\n109\n00:05:10.687 --> 00:05:12.610\nI can create accounts in there.\n\n110\n00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.868\nI could be tying Azure in with\nmy on-premise Active Directory.\n\n111\n00:05:16.868 --> 00:05:20.205\nSo that it's synchronizing between my\nActive Directory up there in the cloud.\n\n112\n00:05:20.205 --> 00:05:21.762\nAnd I could use my normal work account.\n\n113\n00:05:21.762 --> 00:05:25.275\nSo I could say all you gotta do is click\non this link, log in with your work\n\n114\n00:05:25.275 --> 00:05:29.097\naccount, and you'll get access to this,\nor we can use Microsoft accounts.\n\n115\n00:05:29.097 --> 00:05:33.466\nYou can see here I've got a few different\nones listed on my little test account here\n\n116\n00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:37.964\nwhere I've just added a Hotmail account,\nan Outlook account, even a Gmail account\n\n117\n00:05:37.964 --> 00:05:41.282\nthat's been associated with\na Microsoft account will work.\n\n118\n00:05:41.282 --> 00:05:46.756\nAnd so you're deciding who is allowed\nto connect to your remote application.\n\n119\n00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:50.463\nOnce you've got that set up and I'll show\nyou, I've got, as far as my publishing\n\n120\n00:05:50.463 --> 00:05:53.764\ngoes I published most of the the office\napps, just as a little test here.\n\n121\n00:05:53.764 --> 00:05:55.838\nSo it's reaching out.\n\n122\n00:05:55.838 --> 00:05:58.592\nIt's looking to see which ones\nI've actually published and\n\n123\n00:05:58.592 --> 00:06:00.164\nit will give me a nice little shot.\n\n124\n00:06:00.164 --> 00:06:05.338\nAnd there I can see which applications\nI've made available via remote app.\n\n125\n00:06:05.338 --> 00:06:09.416\nSo once you've got that set up,\nnow you just have to instruct your users.\n\n126\n00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:13.887\nAnd if I go back out to my dashboard,\nhere, I believe that's showing it on\n\n127\n00:06:13.887 --> 00:06:17.437\nthis page, there's the link\nthat they're going to use.\n\n128\n00:06:17.437 --> 00:06:21.639\nIt was also on the user page when I\nconfigured my users to decide who has\n\n129\n00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:22.224\naccess.\n\n130\n00:06:22.224 --> 00:06:24.350\nThat's what they're gonna use to connect.\n\n131\n00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.657\nNotice that's not a specific URL for\nme or my organization,\n\n132\n00:06:28.657 --> 00:06:33.309\npretty generic\nwww.remoteapp.windowsazure.com, right?\n\n133\n00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:37.712\nSo what this is going to do is it's just\ngonna connect me to the Azure page so\n\n134\n00:06:37.712 --> 00:06:40.650\nthat I can pick the client\nthat I wanna download.\n\n135\n00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.606\nI download that client and install it.\n\n136\n00:06:42.606 --> 00:06:46.629\nAnd that's when I set up my what\nthey would call a subscription or\n\n137\n00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:48.351\nI sign in to the remote app.\n\n138\n00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:51.411\nAnd by using my account,\nthat's how it knows what to connect me to.\n\n139\n00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.140\nIt's gonna show me what\napplications are available, and\n\n140\n00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.595\nI can choose which ones I want.\n\n141\n00:06:55.595 --> 00:06:59.924\nSo let's go back over here to,\nlet's do this on a Windows machine first.\n\n142\n00:06:59.924 --> 00:07:01.583\nSo here I've got my Windows 10 now.\n\n143\n00:07:01.583 --> 00:07:04.469\nSometimes it can take a little\nwhile to download this client so\n\n144\n00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:07.423\nI've done done that ahead of time\nto kinda got things started.\n\n145\n00:07:07.423 --> 00:07:10.109\nBut when I typed in that URL and\n\n146\n00:07:10.109 --> 00:07:15.596\nit was\nhttps://www.remoteapp.windowsazure.com,\n\n147\n00:07:15.596 --> 00:07:17.755\nit took me to this page.\n\n148\n00:07:17.755 --> 00:07:20.597\nAnd it detected that I'm running\nWindows on this machine.\n\n149\n00:07:20.597 --> 00:07:22.299\nSo it offers to download that client.\n\n150\n00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:24.891\nYou can see the other clients\nthat are available though.\n\n151\n00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:27.386\nThe app store I can get one for the iOS.\n\n152\n00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:30.551\nI can get one for\nmy Android from Google Play.\n\n153\n00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:34.567\nAnd for my Mac, I can get one\nfrom the Mac app store as well.\n\n154\n00:07:34.567 --> 00:07:37.077\nAs I said I've already\nstarted the download here.\n\n155\n00:07:37.077 --> 00:07:40.633\nAnd what it did was it took a few\nminutes to download that application.\n\n156\n00:07:40.633 --> 00:07:42.996\nAnd then it began to run the application.\n\n157\n00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:44.241\nAnd that's where we're at now.\n\n158\n00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:49.406\nSo I'm simply gonna click to get started,\nand that launches this Azure RemoteApp.\n\n159\n00:07:49.406 --> 00:07:50.553\nAnd we'll give it a second.\n\n160\n00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:54.635\nIt's gonna reach out and find or\nit's gonna ask me actually for\n\n161\n00:07:54.635 --> 00:07:59.654\ncredentials, cuz it has to know who I am,\nand what I should be connecting to.\n\n162\n00:07:59.654 --> 00:08:02.798\nSo there goes my Azure RemoteApp\nlogin dialog box.\n\n163\n00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:04.829\nWe'll give it a chance to populate.\n\n164\n00:08:04.829 --> 00:08:05.991\nIt has been a little slow today.\n\n165\n00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:11.521\nBut they're probably a little busy out\nthere in the Microsoft world, getting\n\n166\n00:08:11.521 --> 00:08:17.100\nready for Halloween here in the US,\nI know, so if you're watching this live.\n\n167\n00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.311\nAll right, so\nwe'll give that a second to load up.\n\n168\n00:08:20.311 --> 00:08:21.422\nThere we go.\n\n169\n00:08:21.422 --> 00:08:27.066\nAnd I'm gonna type in one of the email\naddresses that was allowed to access.\n\n170\n00:08:27.066 --> 00:08:30.916\nIf I can remember my email address,\nwe'll click Continue.\n\n171\n00:08:30.916 --> 00:08:34.240\nAnd it's gonna take me over to Microsoft,\ncuz you notice it didn't ask me for\n\n172\n00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.791\na password on that screen, right?\n\n173\n00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:40.055\nIt wants to verify that that email address\nis associated with something up there.\n\n174\n00:08:40.055 --> 00:08:42.526\nIt says okay, we found it, it is good.\n\n175\n00:08:42.526 --> 00:08:48.423\nNow go ahead and authenticate and\nwe'll log into this guy.\n\n176\n00:08:48.423 --> 00:08:52.279\nAnd then what it should do is\npresent me a list of invitations.\n\n177\n00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:54.793\nAnd the invitations\nare different publications.\n\n178\n00:08:54.793 --> 00:08:55.960\nI'm running one.\n\n179\n00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.078\nBut I could have in fact, this one has\njust assumed since there was only one.\n\n180\n00:08:59.078 --> 00:09:00.623\nI'm just gonna show you that one.\n\n181\n00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:02.499\nAnd there we go.\n\n182\n00:09:02.499 --> 00:09:03.892\nThese are my applications.\n\n183\n00:09:03.892 --> 00:09:04.452\nWell, like, okay, great.\n\n184\n00:09:04.452 --> 00:09:06.224\nWhat's so special?\n\n185\n00:09:06.224 --> 00:09:08.652\nI don't have Excel installed\non this machine or\n\n186\n00:09:08.652 --> 00:09:10.480\nWord or any of these applications.\n\n187\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.340\nLet's launch Excel.\n\n188\n00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.370\nI'm just gonna double-click on that\nicon there, it's the remote app and\n\n189\n00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.016\nit looks just like your remote desktop.\n\n190\n00:09:17.016 --> 00:09:18.449\n>> Yeah, it does.\n\n191\n00:09:18.449 --> 00:09:20.155\n>> And it's gonna reach out.\n\n192\n00:09:20.155 --> 00:09:21.975\nSays it's firing up Excel.\n\n193\n00:09:21.975 --> 00:09:24.996\nWe'll give it just a second.\n\n194\n00:09:24.996 --> 00:09:26.950\nAnd it's gonna launch it and your user.\n\n195\n00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.750\nI mean it to them it's just like\nthey were running it locally.\n\n196\n00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.243\nIt's fantastic and I like I said,\n\n197\n00:09:31.243 --> 00:09:34.193\nthis case it's up there in the clouds\nbeing provided by Microsoft.\n\n198\n00:09:34.193 --> 00:09:37.042\nThey're taking care of all the updates and\nthings like that.\n\n199\n00:09:37.042 --> 00:09:39.117\nDon't have to worry about that stuff.\n\n200\n00:09:39.117 --> 00:09:40.872\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n201\n00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.960\nExcel is launching.\n\n202\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.222\nAnd there it is.\n\n203\n00:09:44.222 --> 00:09:47.244\nI can go click a blank workbook.\n\n204\n00:09:47.244 --> 00:09:51.667\nAnd just like if I was sitting in Excel\ninstalled on my desktop, there it is.\n\n205\n00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:53.673\n>> I'm really taken aback on how much,\n\n206\n00:09:53.673 --> 00:09:56.918\nyou really cannot tell that\nthis is not installed locally.\n\n207\n00:09:56.918 --> 00:10:01.695\nIt looks identical to the actual app\napp that you would have installed as\n\n208\n00:10:01.695 --> 00:10:03.852\nsoftware on your local system.\n\n209\n00:10:03.852 --> 00:10:05.358\nAnd yet we're not installing it.\n\n210\n00:10:05.358 --> 00:10:07.474\nIt's not taking up any hard drive space.\n\n211\n00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:09.878\nIt's not taking up any risk or\nsomething to worry about.\n\n212\n00:10:09.878 --> 00:10:14.217\nThose pesky updates that go along\nwith that stuff, it's just there.\n\n213\n00:10:14.217 --> 00:10:15.758\nI just access it through the cloud.\n\n214\n00:10:15.758 --> 00:10:17.824\nMakes it really, really easy.\n\n215\n00:10:17.824 --> 00:10:19.626\n>> I guess my formulas\naren't working there.\n\n216\n00:10:19.626 --> 00:10:23.051\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's right they changed that to\n\n217\n00:10:23.051 --> 00:10:24.263\nequals add now.\n\n218\n00:10:24.263 --> 00:10:27.154\nI was just goofing around\nthis really is not important.\n\n219\n00:10:27.154 --> 00:10:28.930\n>> Good thing.\n>> Show off my Excel skills.\n\n220\n00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.192\n[LAUGH]\n>> Good thing isn't a show about how to\n\n221\n00:10:31.192 --> 00:10:34.356\nuse Excel, it's just about how\nto access Excel using Azure.\n\n222\n00:10:34.356 --> 00:10:35.343\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n223\n00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.453\nSo, yeah, don't take my Excel classes.\n\n224\n00:10:37.453 --> 00:10:40.270\nThere you go,\njust typing in a formula to show you.\n\n225\n00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.083\nIt is live, it's just like it\nwas sitting on my desktop.\n\n226\n00:10:43.083 --> 00:10:45.540\nJust like working with Excel locally.\n\n227\n00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.316\nAs you change a cell, it's gonna read\nthose formulas and execute them.\n\n228\n00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:52.313\nIt's not like you're getting\na screenshot of Excel.\n\n229\n00:10:52.313 --> 00:10:54.406\nAnd you have to type in\nall your formulas and\n\n230\n00:10:54.406 --> 00:10:57.679\nthen click Refresh to have a go out and\nupdate everything, right?\n\n231\n00:10:57.679 --> 00:11:02.630\nYou're working in it, just like you were\nsitting with a locally installed copy.\n\n232\n00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.252\nAll right, I'm gonna close that and\n\n233\n00:11:04.252 --> 00:11:06.616\nI'm not gonna bother save\nmy changes that workbook.\n\n234\n00:11:06.616 --> 00:11:09.929\nAnd I wanna take a look,\nI'm gonna close edge here too.\n\n235\n00:11:09.929 --> 00:11:14.280\nAnd if we look at my Start menu,\nwe'll see there's some recently added.\n\n236\n00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.405\nLet's go to all apps.\n\n237\n00:11:16.405 --> 00:11:23.127\nAnd here I can see,\nwhere have we got them here?\n\n238\n00:11:23.127 --> 00:11:29.430\nSomewhere, if I'm missing them I should\nsee, well there's my Azure RemoteApp.\n\n239\n00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.249\nAnd that gives me access to that and it\ndoesn't look like they populated my Start\n\n240\n00:11:33.249 --> 00:11:35.993\nmenu yet, but\nthere I can see them under recently added.\n\n241\n00:11:35.993 --> 00:11:40.053\nThey are going to appear down here\neventually once Cortana refreshes\n\n242\n00:11:40.053 --> 00:11:41.246\neverything there.\n\n243\n00:11:41.246 --> 00:11:43.482\nBut again,\nI can launch it from right here.\n\n244\n00:11:43.482 --> 00:11:46.562\nSo just like I was sitting at my\ncomputer with it locally installed,\n\n245\n00:11:46.562 --> 00:11:49.220\nI can go to my Start menu,\nI can type word, it'll find it.\n\n246\n00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.237\nIt'll launch it.\n\n247\n00:11:50.237 --> 00:11:51.274\nWe're good to go.\n\n248\n00:11:51.274 --> 00:11:53.012\nSo fantastic.\n\n249\n00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:56.757\nAnd I said a really cool thing,\nthat if this wasn't cool enough, but\n\n250\n00:11:56.757 --> 00:12:00.131\nthe other part is,\nremember I said not just Windows devices.\n\n251\n00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:01.803\nLet's flip over here.\n\n252\n00:12:01.803 --> 00:12:04.540\nI've got my Chrome opened\nup on my MacBook and\n\n253\n00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.070\nwe're gonna navigate to that same page.\n\n254\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:17.070\nhttps://www.remoteapp.windowsazure.com.\n\n255\n00:12:18.417 --> 00:12:22.262\nAnd we'll connect right up and\nI will scroll down.\n\n256\n00:12:22.262 --> 00:12:26.033\nAnd I'll choose to download a client.\n\n257\n00:12:26.033 --> 00:12:28.178\nAnd those that tells me,\nhey it's available the Mac app store,\n\n258\n00:12:28.178 --> 00:12:29.020\nso you're running Mac.\n\n259\n00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.720\nAnd I can download this guy.\n\n260\n00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.500\nI could install it on here.\n\n261\n00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.380\nAnd it would be exactly the same.\n\n262\n00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.853\nAnd we don't wanna wait around and wait\nfor the App Store to download this and\n\n263\n00:12:39.853 --> 00:12:40.456\ninstall it.\n\n264\n00:12:40.456 --> 00:12:43.141\nI'd have to log in with my credentials and\nstuff.\n\n265\n00:12:43.141 --> 00:12:46.655\nBut I also did this on my iPad,\nand it was easy breezy.\n\n266\n00:12:46.655 --> 00:12:50.355\nSame thing,\nI went to the store on my iPad.\n\n267\n00:12:50.355 --> 00:12:51.326\nActually I'm sorry, I didn't do that.\n\n268\n00:12:51.326 --> 00:12:56.124\nI opened up Safari, and I typed in\nremoteapp.web, windowsazure.com,\n\n269\n00:12:56.124 --> 00:12:57.960\nconnected to that Web page.\n\n270\n00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.630\nIt detected I was running iOS.\n\n271\n00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.719\nTold me what client I should get,\ndirected me over to the store.\n\n272\n00:13:02.719 --> 00:13:03.879\nI downloaded it.\n\n273\n00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:07.815\nI now have an icon on my desktop or\non my screen.\n\n274\n00:13:07.815 --> 00:13:10.822\nI touched it and\nI saw the same list of programs there.\n\n275\n00:13:10.822 --> 00:13:15.319\nAnd I was able to launch Word and I was\nable to launch Excel on my iOS device.\n\n276\n00:13:15.319 --> 00:13:17.335\nSo pretty darn cool, Android as well.\n\n277\n00:13:17.335 --> 00:13:20.386\n>> Yeah, and it's kind of interesting\nthat we're living in the day and\n\n278\n00:13:20.386 --> 00:13:23.497\ntime where companies that are in\ndirect competition with each other.\n\n279\n00:13:23.497 --> 00:13:27.859\nApple and Microsoft are having to\nbasically cross-pollinate with each\n\n280\n00:13:27.859 --> 00:13:31.372\nother because of the way that\npeople are working anymore.\n\n281\n00:13:31.372 --> 00:13:35.216\nAnd it's very uncommon to not have\nApple devices in a PC environment\n\n282\n00:13:35.216 --> 00:13:38.461\nanymore because a lot of\npeople like the iPhone, right?\n\n283\n00:13:38.461 --> 00:13:40.847\nBut you're still using a Windows-based PC.\n\n284\n00:13:40.847 --> 00:13:42.170\nI gotta make those two things marry.\n\n285\n00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:47.780\nI gotta make the convenience factor of\nhaving that iPhone, that smartphone,\n\n286\n00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:53.313\nor Android device and still work with\nmy productivity suites, like Office.\n\n287\n00:13:53.313 --> 00:13:57.772\n>> Absolutely, it's just a fantastic\nthing cuz now I don't have to use that.\n\n288\n00:13:57.772 --> 00:13:59.433\nIt's BYOD, right?\n\n289\n00:13:59.433 --> 00:14:01.452\nEverybody's got their own\ndevices that they're bringing.\n\n290\n00:14:01.452 --> 00:14:03.519\nI don't have to worry about\nshipping a laptop with them,\n\n291\n00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:04.647\nthey can use their own laptop.\n\n292\n00:14:04.647 --> 00:14:06.659\nIt doesn't even have to\nbe a part of my domain.\n\n293\n00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:09.607\nAnd they can access all\nthese applications.\n\n294\n00:14:09.607 --> 00:14:11.679\nI can provide that level of access.\n\n295\n00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:13.877\nI don't have to buy a new\nequipment every so often.\n\n296\n00:14:13.877 --> 00:14:16.682\nIf you want a faster machine,\nyou go buy yourself a new laptop.\n\n297\n00:14:16.682 --> 00:14:18.292\nThe apps are available.\n\n298\n00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:19.859\nI'm sorry if your laptop doesn't perform.\n\n299\n00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.909\n>> Enjoy.\nIt really is nice with it comes to\n\n300\n00:14:21.909 --> 00:14:26.043\nthe budget meeting, you're gonna be the\nhero because they are starting to see that\n\n301\n00:14:26.043 --> 00:14:29.586\nIT budget go down, down, down because\nyou're figuring out ways to use\n\n302\n00:14:29.586 --> 00:14:31.792\nthings like Azure to\nmake that shrink down.\n\n303\n00:14:31.792 --> 00:14:34.154\nAnd they still have all\nthe functionality and\n\n304\n00:14:34.154 --> 00:14:38.267\neverything that they need to access files\nthat they work with on a daily basis.\n\n305\n00:14:38.267 --> 00:14:40.147\nIt's a really smart way to go.\n\n306\n00:14:40.147 --> 00:14:41.072\n>> It really is.\n\n307\n00:14:41.072 --> 00:14:43.452\nNow back here on my screen,\nlet's take a look one more time.\n\n308\n00:14:43.452 --> 00:14:44.975\nNow there was that Azure RemoteApp.\n\n309\n00:14:44.975 --> 00:14:45.631\nI do wanna show.\n\n310\n00:14:45.631 --> 00:14:49.769\nI'm gonna click on App Imitations and\nsee if I can show that initial list again.\n\n311\n00:14:49.769 --> 00:14:52.838\nBecause you might make certain\napps available to certain people,\n\n312\n00:14:52.838 --> 00:14:54.662\nother apps available to other people.\n\n313\n00:14:54.662 --> 00:14:58.920\nAnd, like I said, it's reaching out now\nto my Azure servers and then checking and\n\n314\n00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.426\nseeing.\n\n315\n00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:02.027\nI only have one but I just wanted\nto make sure you're aware of that.\n\n316\n00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:04.642\nAnd that's what they call\nsubscribing to a feed.\n\n317\n00:15:04.642 --> 00:15:07.135\nThere is the one I created, Work Apps.\n\n318\n00:15:07.135 --> 00:15:09.778\nAnd that's the one that's\nproviding all these applications.\n\n319\n00:15:09.778 --> 00:15:12.909\nBut you might see several\nthat your company provides,\n\n320\n00:15:12.909 --> 00:15:15.572\ndepending on who you're authenticating as.\n\n321\n00:15:15.572 --> 00:15:20.182\nSo they might have some productivity apps\nfor marketing, Word and things like that,\n\n322\n00:15:20.182 --> 00:15:23.331\nsome different apps for\ndevelopment that's available.\n\n323\n00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:26.673\nThey might go in some\nprogramming type apps for them.\n\n324\n00:15:26.673 --> 00:15:28.919\nSo it's really cool what you can do.\n\n325\n00:15:28.919 --> 00:15:32.253\nThe other thing I do wanna mention here\nis some group policy settings that\n\n326\n00:15:32.253 --> 00:15:34.833\nwe need to be familiar with for\ndealing with RemoteApp.\n\n327\n00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:37.268\nThese are basically RDP files, right?\n\n328\n00:15:37.268 --> 00:15:40.419\nEach one of these applications,\nas you would take the application,\n\n329\n00:15:40.419 --> 00:15:41.953\nit would generate this package.\n\n330\n00:15:41.953 --> 00:15:45.867\nAnd we publish it, and\nit creates what's an RDP file.\n\n331\n00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:47.877\nAnd that's what these are.\n\n332\n00:15:47.877 --> 00:15:54.279\nAnd when we get these,\nthey should be digitally signed.\n\n333\n00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:59.982\nAnd we wanna make sure that our users\nare using signed packages, right?\n\n334\n00:15:59.982 --> 00:16:03.904\nBecause if we're not, if they don't have\ndigital signatures that means there's no\n\n335\n00:16:03.904 --> 00:16:07.673\nway to tell if those files have been\nmodified, either unintentionally, right?\n\n336\n00:16:07.673 --> 00:16:11.538\nThat would be just a corruption\nof some kind or maliciously.\n\n337\n00:16:11.538 --> 00:16:15.063\nSomebody trying to modify files and\nwhen you run that app, maybe it runs\n\n338\n00:16:15.063 --> 00:16:18.671\nsomething else in the background\nthat you didn't really want, right?\n\n339\n00:16:18.671 --> 00:16:21.489\nThat's the advantage of using\nthose digital signatures.\n\n340\n00:16:21.489 --> 00:16:25.694\nAnd so by default, by actually this\nclient will only run signed apps,\n\n341\n00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:28.138\nyou could disable that if you needed to.\n\n342\n00:16:28.138 --> 00:16:31.450\nIf you're doing a test platform and\nyou didn't want to spend the money on\n\n343\n00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:35.375\ncertificates or have an in-house CA that\nyou could have issue certificates to them.\n\n344\n00:16:35.375 --> 00:16:39.464\nSo you just wanted to do it for testing\npurposes you can allow unsigned apps.\n\n345\n00:16:39.464 --> 00:16:41.560\nI would just have to to go\nin a Group Policy here.\n\n346\n00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:46.030\nAnd I'm gonna take a look at any\npolicy that I have available.\n\n347\n00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.821\nAnd underneath Policies, and\nthen Administrative Templates >\n\n348\n00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:55.860\nWindows Components,\nI'll make that a little bit wider for\n\n349\n00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:00.090\nus, I'll scroll down and\nwe'll find Remote Desktop Services, and\n\n350\n00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.450\nthen Remote Desktop Connection Client.\n\n351\n00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.344\nAnd that's that little\nAzure RemoteApp that we're using.\n\n352\n00:17:05.344 --> 00:17:09.597\nAnd you see allow our RDP files\nfrom valid publishers and\n\n353\n00:17:09.597 --> 00:17:15.313\nuser's default RDP settings or\nallow RDP files from unknown publishers.\n\n354\n00:17:15.313 --> 00:17:17.554\nSo again by default it's keeping us safe.\n\n355\n00:17:17.554 --> 00:17:18.616\nWe turn that on.\n\n356\n00:17:18.616 --> 00:17:21.825\nWe should have a good reason for\nturning that on, like I said,\n\n357\n00:17:21.825 --> 00:17:24.131\na test environment or something like that.\n\n358\n00:17:24.131 --> 00:17:28.389\nIf you're getting an app that's signed but\nyour computers don't trust\n\n359\n00:17:28.389 --> 00:17:33.160\nthat certificate authority, you could\nget a warning, it could try to block it.\n\n360\n00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.107\nAnd so maybe you need to do it for\nthat but there's better ways.\n\n361\n00:17:36.107 --> 00:17:41.214\nI should trust the signing or whoever's\nsigning those to help keep me safe.\n\n362\n00:17:41.214 --> 00:17:44.903\nSo there are some settings we need to be\nfamiliar with there with group policy.\n\n363\n00:17:44.903 --> 00:17:47.645\nAnd that Daniel is remote app.\n\n364\n00:17:47.645 --> 00:17:50.111\nIt's a very cool technology.\n\n365\n00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:52.202\nIt's available locally.\n\n366\n00:17:52.202 --> 00:17:55.742\nYou can run this in-house\nto do the very same thing.\n\n367\n00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:58.860\nBut by moving it up to Azure,\nnow we give access for\n\n368\n00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.514\npeople that are outside of\nmy corporate network, right?\n\n369\n00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:06.230\nThose sales people that are traveling,\nthey're grabbing their home laptop,\n\n370\n00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.669\nthey're hitting the road, they don't\nhave Office installed on there or\n\n371\n00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:12.958\nsome other line of business application\nthat I wanna make available.\n\n372\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:16.268\nIt doesn't matter where they are,\nStarbucks, the hotel, they can connect.\n\n373\n00:18:16.268 --> 00:18:19.431\nThat home PC that I can't manage\nwith group policy, I can still make\n\n374\n00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:22.820\nthese applications available as long\nas they've got Internet access,\n\n375\n00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.168\nthey can connect that to it.\n\n376\n00:18:24.168 --> 00:18:27.404\nSo really leveraging the power of\nthe cloud, taking two pretty cool\n\n377\n00:18:27.404 --> 00:18:31.625\ntechnologies, putting them together, and\nvery beneficial for most organizations.\n\n378\n00:18:31.625 --> 00:18:34.802\n>> So Mike, is there anything else\nthat we need to know about Azure and\n\n379\n00:18:34.802 --> 00:18:36.634\nthe RemoteApp before we call it a day?\n\n380\n00:18:36.634 --> 00:18:37.727\n>> I don't think so.\n\n381\n00:18:37.727 --> 00:18:40.925\nIt's pretty darn simple,\nyou just have to give your client,\n\n382\n00:18:40.925 --> 00:18:42.779\nsetting it up could be a little bit.\n\n383\n00:18:42.779 --> 00:18:44.315\nYou gotta have your Azure subscription.\n\n384\n00:18:44.315 --> 00:18:47.631\nYou gotta have your applications\nprepped up and published up there.\n\n385\n00:18:47.631 --> 00:18:51.308\nBut then it's just a matter of giving\nyour users that URL, and from just about\n\n386\n00:18:51.308 --> 00:18:55.115\nany device they can connect, download\nthe client, and run the applications.\n\n387\n00:18:55.115 --> 00:18:58.329\n>> Yeah, a simple feature with a lot\nof flexibility, and a lot of power.\n\n388\n00:18:58.329 --> 00:18:59.902\nWe really, really like it.\n\n389\n00:18:59.902 --> 00:19:02.503\nSo, if you have the means, and\nthe opportunity play around with this.\n\n390\n00:19:02.503 --> 00:19:05.720\nStart implementing this in your network,\neven if it's just in a test environment.\n\n391\n00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.558\nSo you can have some practical\nknowledge in and a skill set with that.\n\n392\n00:19:09.558 --> 00:19:12.024\nIt was definitely well worth the effort.\n\n393\n00:19:12.024 --> 00:19:15.304\nThat being said, Mike, I guess we'll\ngo ahead and call this a day and\n\n394\n00:19:15.304 --> 00:19:16.106\nclose the show.\n\n395\n00:19:16.106 --> 00:19:18.899\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n396\n00:19:18.899 --> 00:19:19.844\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n397\n00:19:19.844 --> 00:19:22.208\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n398\n00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:26.040\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.980\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.990\nIn today's episode we are continuing\non with our Windows 10 MCSA series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.640\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to help us out with that\n\n6\n00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.740\nis none other than our good friend,\nMr. Wes Brian.\n\n7\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.410\nWes, welcome back to the show and\nhow's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.140\n>> It's going great.\n\n9\n00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.420\nAnd as always it's good to be here\nwith ITProTV and on the stage and\n\n10\n00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.510\nthat's right we are moving along.\n\n11\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.620\nAnd we really in the last couple of\nepisodes that we've been doing we've been\n\n12\n00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.890\nfocusing on application coexistence.\n\n13\n00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.182\nNow what we're gonna be talking\nabout today is something that we've\n\n14\n00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:48.870\nalready covered in a high level\noverview of what Azure RemoteApp is.\n\n15\n00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.466\nBut we wanna kind of dive\ndeep into the engine here and\n\n16\n00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.920\nshow you how you set this up.\n\n17\n00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.180\nCuz you very well could get questions\nin the exam, the MCSA for Windows 10.\n\n18\n00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.060\nThey might ask you to support and I know\nit's called out on the skills measured,\n\n19\n00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.955\nif you will, to support Azure RemoteApp.\n\n20\n00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:11.935\nSo the goal today is to show\nyou the steps that it takes to\n\n21\n00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:15.205\nget Azure RemoteApp deployed.\n\n22\n00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:19.085\nHopefully you'll be able to do\nthat by the end of this episode.\n\n23\n00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:24.918\nLet's go ahead and recap very briefly,\nwhat is Azure and what is Azure RemoteApp?\n\n24\n00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:29.550\nAzure if you will is a cloud-based\nsolution that you have from Microsoft.\n\n25\n00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.460\nAnd part of the Azure,\nmany services that it provides,\n\n26\n00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.130\nis also the ability to do RemoteApp.\n\n27\n00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.120\nNow if you look at, conceptually, what\nRemoteApp is, it really hasn't changed\n\n28\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.610\nfrom the standalone deployments before\nit ever got integrated in the cloud.\n\n29\n00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.510\nIt is a way that you can allow\nsomebody to connect over the Internet\n\n30\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.490\nto an application and\nbe able to run that application.\n\n31\n00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.530\nAnd the running of that\napplication if you will,\n\n32\n00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.137\nalmost like the running of the bulls.\n\n33\n00:01:58.137 --> 00:02:02.592\nThe running of that application\nisn't really contingent on how\n\n34\n00:02:02.592 --> 00:02:05.830\nmuch hardware is on the local device.\n\n35\n00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.740\nThe benefit of using Azure RemoteApp\nis the application is actually\n\n36\n00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.430\nhosted in the cloud.\n\n37\n00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.410\nAnd when the user connects to it, well\nthey're not connecting and running any\n\n38\n00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.010\nresources locally past maybe some of their\nInternet connection and whatever the local\n\n39\n00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.700\nremote desktop application is\nthat's running on that device.\n\n40\n00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.618\nSo it's a very good way that you can\nhave people connect over the Internet to\n\n41\n00:02:27.618 --> 00:02:29.300\nan application.\n\n42\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.150\nYou don't have to manage\nthe infrastructure per se behind it.\n\n43\n00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.500\nAnd it can run on multiple devices.\n\n44\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.680\nSo what we wanna show you\nis from beginning to end,\n\n45\n00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.250\nhow would you If Dan came to me today and\nsaid,\n\n46\n00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.820\nhey Wes I need you to deploy this\napplication and I need it done.\n\n47\n00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.080\nWould we be able to do that,\nand that's our goal here.\n\n48\n00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.170\nSo Dan, one of the first\nthings that we have to do,\n\n49\n00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.270\nwhen we're in Azure is we have\nto create a virtual machine.\n\n50\n00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.660\nNow why do we have to\ncreate a virtual machine?\n\n51\n00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.050\nUnderstand that with Azure RemoteApp,\nwhat you end up doing is you create this\n\n52\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.620\nvirtual machine and then the virtual\nmachine itself, we take an image of it.\n\n53\n00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.890\nAnd that image gets stored, and when\nyour users connect to the application,\n\n54\n00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.020\nthis is the part I really think's cool,\nDan.\n\n55\n00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.800\nIs that it spins up that\ninstance into a virtual machine\n\n56\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.870\nallowing the user to connect to it, and\nthen another user can connect to it, and\n\n57\n00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.520\nanother user can connect to it.\n\n58\n00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.100\nWell, we know that that takes\nsome kind of communications and\n\n59\n00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.029\nanytime you're running an application on\nthe server you're consuming resources.\n\n60\n00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.980\nSo what happens if I have,\n30 people that connect to it, based on my\n\n61\n00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.720\nlicense agreements, cloud-based service,\nand check the subscriptions out.\n\n62\n00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.720\nOr I get 100 people to connect to it,\nor 500 people that connect to it.\n\n63\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.840\nRight, if had a normal server in my server\ncloset, chances are at a certain point,\n\n64\n00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.950\nit's gonna say I got no, I don't have\nanything else, I don't have anything left.\n\n65\n00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.930\nI've given you all\nthe resources that I have.\n\n66\n00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.780\nWell what's really cool about\nthe Azure RemoteApp is the fact that\n\n67\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.480\nwhen your users connect to it and\nmore users connect.\n\n68\n00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.760\nAnd that virtual machine instance can\nno longer support the simultaneous\n\n69\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.500\nconnections, in the background silently,\n\n70\n00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.020\nanother copy of that\nimage is brought online.\n\n71\n00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.520\nAnd now in the background Microsoft is\ndoing things like load balancing and\n\n72\n00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.860\nmaking sure that all your users can\ncontinually connect to that app\n\n73\n00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.320\ntransparent to them and\nprobably transparent to us.\n\n74\n00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.510\nAnd as more people connect,\nthey just keep scaling up,\n\n75\n00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.470\nspending up more virtualization instances.\n\n76\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.290\nBut, you have to know the steps.\n\n77\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.740\nYou gotta know the steps in order\nto have that instance prepared, and\n\n78\n00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.240\nthe first part of that is\ncreating a virtual machine.\n\n79\n00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.400\nSo I've actually logged in as\nthe tentative administrator here in Azure,\n\n80\n00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.690\nI'm logged in.\n\n81\n00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.120\nYou guys can always check out Azure for\nfree.\n\n82\n00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.260\nThings like Intune, Office 365, a lot of\ntimes they have trial accounts out there\n\n83\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.315\nand I would suggest that if you are gonna\nsit this exam, use a trial account.\n\n84\n00:04:45.315 --> 00:04:50.450\nIt's the best way to learn, dive in there,\nlearn what the technology is doing.\n\n85\n00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.000\nI'm in the all items menu,\nit's kind of like a dashboard menu.\n\n86\n00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.145\nI'm in the all items menu and\n\n87\n00:04:56.145 --> 00:05:00.785\nif I scroll all the way down, you're gonna\nsee RemoteApp is down here at the bottom.\n\n88\n00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:06.165\nThat's where we're gonna get to, but the\nfirst thing we have to do is build that\n\n89\n00:05:06.165 --> 00:05:09.830\nvirtual machine, so\nwe're gonna start right here.\n\n90\n00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.530\nRight here at the top virtual machines.\n\n91\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.850\nNow, when you create the virtual machine,\nwhat you're gonna do is you're gonna go to\n\n92\n00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.560\ninstances, right,\ninstances of virtual machines.\n\n93\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.680\nNow, I already have one\ninstance running here, but,\n\n94\n00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.960\nwe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nspin up another virtual machine.\n\n95\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.740\nNow, we do that by the little\nplus button down here all\n\n96\n00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.000\nthe way in the lower left hand corner\nof your screen there, you can see new.\n\n97\n00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.170\nAnd if I click this it brings up another\nmenu that's gonna give me some options\n\n98\n00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.020\nthat I can choose for\nspinning up this virtual machine.\n\n99\n00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.120\nNow, you'll see that it's a compute,\nit's a virtual machine,\n\n100\n00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.210\nmake sure these selections are right cuz\nyou can always change it if you want.\n\n101\n00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.400\nNot for what we wanna do here,\nwe don't wanna change it.\n\n102\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.290\nAnd then I can do a quick create.\n\n103\n00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.910\nIf I do a quick create what it's gonna\ndo it's gonna give me some options here,\n\n104\n00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.310\nsome different servers here, but the\nproblem is there's a specific server you\n\n105\n00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.470\nneed in order to support RemoteApp.\n\n106\n00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.420\nAnd let's show you what I mean here.\n\n107\n00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.175\nSo we're actually gonna switch this up.\n\n108\n00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:06.705\nIt's gonna change and I hit go from\nthe gallery, from the gallery.\n\n109\n00:06:06.705 --> 00:06:11.427\nAnd that's what I want, and a lot of the\nsame different types of servers here but\n\n110\n00:06:11.427 --> 00:06:16.250\nthe one that I really really really\nwant to look at is this one right here.\n\n111\n00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.600\nAnd this is a big exam alert.\n\n112\n00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.610\nBig exam alert.\n\n113\n00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.010\nWhen they say that you\nneed to support RemoteApp,\n\n114\n00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.510\nthey might ask you well what server\noperating system do you need to run?\n\n115\n00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.740\nWell you're most likely gonna wanna be\nrunning Windows Server 2012 R2, but\n\n116\n00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.660\nthere's a specific role.\n\n117\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.160\nRight, a type of service that\nthis server has to provide and\n\n118\n00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.220\nthat is\nthe Windows Server Remote Desktop Session.\n\n119\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.030\nAnd my head's kind of\ncovering it up here but\n\n120\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.070\nall the way at the end what you're\ngonna see is that session host.\n\n121\n00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.370\nRemember that for the exam, and\n\n122\n00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.880\nI always want to get this wrong trying\nto remember that big old long name.\n\n123\n00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.970\nTry it again there Dan.\n\n124\n00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.330\nRemote Server, see I can't even do it.\n\n125\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.550\nWindows Server Remote\nDesktop Session Host.\n\n126\n00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.350\nSo this is the one that we want.\n\n127\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.290\nSo we're gonna pick that.\n\n128\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.300\nAfter we pick that,\ngot a little arrow down here.\n\n129\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.560\nWe're just gonna next along in the wizard,\nand we've got some other options.\n\n130\n00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.450\nAll right?\nVersion release date, this is if we wanna\n\n131\n00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:17.650\nkeep track of every little bit of\nthe specifications for this server.\n\n132\n00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.170\nNow we're also gonna use,\nwe're gonna name it.\n\n133\n00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.870\nWe've gotta name the virtual machine.\n\n134\n00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.252\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna call this ITTraining.\n\n135\n00:07:27.252 --> 00:07:31.830\nAnd I've already got one called\nITTraining, so keep it unique here,\n\n136\n00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.800\nwe'll call this ITTraining2.\n\n137\n00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.130\nNow you've got a couple of options\nwhen you're building your servers.\n\n138\n00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.751\nUnderstand that we're not\nbuilding a virtual machine for\n\n139\n00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:43.005\nthe purposes of supporting\nmultiple users here.\n\n140\n00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:47.510\nWe're running a virtual machine simply to\nget that image that we want to have spun\n\n141\n00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.650\nup that supports our application.\n\n142\n00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.596\nSo here's something that\nI'd recommend here.\n\n143\n00:07:52.596 --> 00:07:56.856\nGotta be careful with Basic, you're gonna\nsee down here, see how it says 0, A0,\n\n144\n00:07:56.856 --> 00:08:00.877\nthis is the lowest part of the totem pole\nif you will is what hardware this machine\n\n145\n00:08:00.877 --> 00:08:01.436\nhas in it.\n\n146\n00:08:01.436 --> 00:08:02.796\nAnd I can say Dan it\nreally doesn't matter.\n\n147\n00:08:02.796 --> 00:08:05.356\nBut it's painfully slow.\n\n148\n00:08:05.356 --> 00:08:10.105\nIf you're running Server 2012 R2 on 768\nmegs of RAM even the installation of your\n\n149\n00:08:10.105 --> 00:08:14.285\napplication could take forever, I've\nseen it where I waited forever just for\n\n150\n00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.460\nServer Manager to come up on the screen.\n\n151\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.390\nBy default it does every\ntime you log into a machine.\n\n152\n00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.110\nLesson learned on my part.\n\n153\n00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.040\nI would at least go with the A1,\nthat seems to be enough horsepower.\n\n154\n00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.050\nIt's not a lot of horsepower, but\n\n155\n00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.110\nit's enough horsepower to at least\nget this virtual machine created.\n\n156\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.290\n>> And keep you out of the poor house.\n\n157\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.450\n>> And keep you out of the poor house.\n\n158\n00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.450\nThat's another good question.\n\n159\n00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.330\nJust keep in mind,\nyou know that's a very good point.\n\n160\n00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.320\nYou're gonna get charged for\neverything you use.\n\n161\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.400\nYou might say,\nwell then maybe I do want the A0.\n\n162\n00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.060\nLet me give you a little piece of advice.\n\n163\n00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.410\nThe reason this doesn't matter is because\nthe moment we do some more steps here,\n\n164\n00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.470\ncreating the virtualized or\n\n165\n00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.820\nthe remote app,\nit's gonna delete this virtual machine.\n\n166\n00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.740\nSo you're not gonna be charged for\nthe virtual machine itself.\n\n167\n00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.650\nThat is one good thing in this process.\n\n168\n00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.500\nAt the end,\n\n169\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.530\nit's going to delete the virtual\nmachine that we're creating right here.\n\n170\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.800\nCuz again, we just need it for that image.\n\n171\n00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.412\nNow user name here, I'll go ahead and\nput my name in here, and\n\n172\n00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:09.887\nwe'll put our famous\nsuper secret password.\n\n173\n00:09:15.599 --> 00:09:18.020\nAnd let's see here.\n\n174\n00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.080\nAll right, so that's step two, all right.\n\n175\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.715\nNow the next thing we\nhave to do in step three,\n\n176\n00:09:23.715 --> 00:09:28.210\nwe have to tie this to\na cloud service DNS name and\n\n177\n00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:33.950\nwe also have to do some affinity, where is\nthis virtual machine going to be stored?\n\n178\n00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.230\nFor us it's going to be here, East US.\n\n179\n00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.780\nIf your watching from the West Coast,\nyou're probably gonna put some kind\n\n180\n00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.660\nof cloud based solution that\nMicrosoft has on the West Coast.\n\n181\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.512\nYou can see for instance here,\nEurope, South East Asia.\n\n182\n00:09:46.512 --> 00:09:49.340\nI'm gonna keep mine here in the east US.\n\n183\n00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.047\nNow you have the option that you\ncan use existing cloud services,\n\n184\n00:09:53.047 --> 00:09:57.270\njust if this the first time, you don't\nhave those so there's nothing to choose.\n\n185\n00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.480\nSo just keep that in mind so\nI'm gonna keep it with the defaults.\n\n186\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.830\nAll right I'm gonna leave storage account,\nlet it generate it automatically,\n\n187\n00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.780\nthat's fine.\n\n188\n00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.770\nAvailability set we don't have to\nworry about high availability.\n\n189\n00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.760\nRemember this machine is gonna be deleted\nonce we get done with our process here.\n\n190\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.440\nAnd then it says,\nwhat do you want protocols?\n\n191\n00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.040\nWhen this machine comes online,\ndo you want anything open?\n\n192\n00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.600\nThey're gonna completely\nharden this server right way.\n\n193\n00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.410\nAnd the only thing that's gonna be,\n\n194\n00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.580\nthe only way that you can connect\nto it are with what you see here.\n\n195\n00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.440\nRemote desktop, right?\n\n196\n00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.630\nOur RDP or PowerShell if you\ndo remote administration.\n\n197\n00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.140\nNow you could add some additional\nvalues if you wanted here.\n\n198\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.570\nLike, maybe Dan,\nI know you come from like a Linux world.\n\n199\n00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.010\nMaybe you want SSH, right, so\n\n200\n00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.665\nI'm gonna turn on SSH because I\nwant to securely connect to it.\n\n201\n00:10:37.665 --> 00:10:39.225\nSo you do have those options.\n\n202\n00:10:39.225 --> 00:10:42.585\nYou have LDAP in here for\ndirectory, that'll be up to you.\n\n203\n00:10:42.585 --> 00:10:45.745\nReally for our purposes here, we can leave\nthe defaults, because we're going to be\n\n204\n00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:49.565\nusing RDP and I'm not going to be using\nPowerShell, it's just on by default.\n\n205\n00:10:50.982 --> 00:10:52.222\nAll right.\n\n206\n00:10:52.222 --> 00:10:53.352\nAnd we're gonna choose Next.\n\n207\n00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:54.772\nNow, here's another thing.\n\n208\n00:10:54.772 --> 00:10:56.902\nThis is kind of interesting.\n\n209\n00:10:56.902 --> 00:11:00.752\nThis will probably be the one time\nI say that this doesn't matter.\n\n210\n00:11:00.752 --> 00:11:05.736\nIf you look at what we have here, we have\na whole bunch of antivirus agents, right?\n\n211\n00:11:05.736 --> 00:11:09.066\nAV software, and\nyou can pick what they have.\n\n212\n00:11:09.066 --> 00:11:10.146\nYou know, some of the offers here.\n\n213\n00:11:10.146 --> 00:11:12.107\nAnd they've got a lot of\nthem like Microsoft's,\n\n214\n00:11:12.107 --> 00:11:13.466\nobviously it's their platform.\n\n215\n00:11:13.466 --> 00:11:16.586\nSymantec, Trend Micro is\nin there you can see.\n\n216\n00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:19.316\nYou can put antivirus software when\nyou're making a virtual machine.\n\n217\n00:11:19.316 --> 00:11:21.176\nLike I said this is the one\ntime I'll say this,\n\n218\n00:11:21.176 --> 00:11:23.710\nyour antivirus software doesn't\nreally mean too much in here,\n\n219\n00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.098\nprovided you're gonna do this and\nfinish this process immediately!\n\n220\n00:11:27.098 --> 00:11:28.860\nIf this server's gonna\nsit on the shelf for\n\n221\n00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.912\na little bit, your most likely gonna want\nto put some anti-virus software on there.\n\n222\n00:11:32.912 --> 00:11:35.779\nAll right, and notice the we\ndon't have anything else here,\n\n223\n00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:39.200\nDan, we got a check mark, so\nwe've gone through all the steps here.\n\n224\n00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.140\nAnd that machine is gonna go ahead and\nspin up.\n\n225\n00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.430\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n226\n00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:48.520\nkinda take care some troubleshooting\nas we go through this show as well.\n\n227\n00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.030\nIf you are trying to\nconnect to your machine and\n\n228\n00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:55.250\nyou're not getting a connection,\nkeep in mind, as you can see here,\n\n229\n00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.490\nit takes a little bit to\nprovision the machine.\n\n230\n00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.550\nThese machines don't just start up\nright away, they do take a little bit.\n\n231\n00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.840\nThey do have to be provisioned so,\nthank goodness we've got virtual machines.\n\n232\n00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.850\nWe've already got one that has been\ncreated for us, this IT training.\n\n233\n00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.480\nSo we're gonna let that one just\nsit back there and it can start.\n\n234\n00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.780\nThis one's already finished its\nprovisioning, so we're ready to go.\n\n235\n00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.280\nSo now we have to connect to the machine,\nright?\n\n236\n00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.380\nWe have to connect to it and\nthey make it fairly easy for us down here.\n\n237\n00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.400\nYou'll see all the way at the bottom\nthere's this little Connect option.\n\n238\n00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.376\nNow you might think that if you've been in\nmaybe some other virtual like Hyper-Visor,\n\n239\n00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.875\nright, you click Connect, what happens?\n\n240\n00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:36.440\nYou connect right to the console.\n\n241\n00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.840\nIt's not that way here, okay?\n\n242\n00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.740\nKeep in mind if you are connecting\nfrom a non-Microsoft system,\n\n243\n00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.410\nyou have to download an RDP client.\n\n244\n00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:49.120\nIf you're in a Microsoft Windows\nclient you will have that software\n\n245\n00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.590\navailable to you.\n\n246\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.950\nAll right, now,\nit's gonna download this little RDP file.\n\n247\n00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.120\nIt's down here at the bottom.\n\n248\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.140\nAnd when I decide that I\nwant to connect to it,\n\n249\n00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.212\nall I've got to do is push the RDP file.\n\n250\n00:13:02.212 --> 00:13:04.190\nAll right, and\nit negotiates the credentials and\n\n251\n00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:08.180\nit connects me right to the machine.\n\n252\n00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.500\nNow when we created the virtual machine\nremember I put in the username and\n\n253\n00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.040\npassword.\n\n254\n00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.890\nThat is the same password\nthat is the only account\n\n255\n00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:17.920\nthat is now active on this machine.\n\n256\n00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.690\nSo as another troubleshooting piece of\nadvice, don't forget that username and\n\n257\n00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.040\npassword or just go back and\ndelete the virtual machine.\n\n258\n00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.904\n>> I like to write it on a sticky note and\nput it on my monitor or\n\n259\n00:13:26.904 --> 00:13:28.535\nmaybe underneath my keyboard.\n\n260\n00:13:28.535 --> 00:13:30.592\n[LAUGH]\n>> Those are the safest place, Dan,\n\n261\n00:13:30.592 --> 00:13:32.551\nto store your credit card information.\n\n262\n00:13:32.551 --> 00:13:35.289\n>> That by the way everyone, that was\nus having fun and being facetious.\n\n263\n00:13:35.289 --> 00:13:36.300\nDon't do that.\n\n264\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.564\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, that's right.\n\n265\n00:13:37.564 --> 00:13:41.018\n>> Do something like, a last pass,\na key pass or something,\n\n266\n00:13:41.018 --> 00:13:44.480\na software vault or\na password vault to keep those things.\n\n267\n00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.700\nWes is right,\nyou got to maintain those things,\n\n268\n00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.315\nbecause if you lose it, you are basically\ncreating a new machine after that.\n\n269\n00:13:50.315 --> 00:13:51.160\n[LAUGH]\n>> You are, and\n\n270\n00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.944\nI won't tell you how I know that.\n\n271\n00:13:52.944 --> 00:13:56.485\n[LAUGH] I have typed the password,\npassword was correct,\n\n272\n00:13:56.485 --> 00:14:01.710\nI just incorrectly typed it and forgot it\n[LAUGH], so I've had to do that before.\n\n273\n00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.220\nAnd now what you see,\nthat quick, fairly quick.\n\n274\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.790\nKeep in mind that when it's provisioning\nin the background, I have to say,\n\n275\n00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.100\nit could take somewhere about 15 to\n20 minutes to provision the server,\n\n276\n00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.960\nso it's really not that bad.\n\n277\n00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.770\nBut of course,\n\n278\n00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.500\nwe don't wanna wait 15 minutes before\nwe can even get into the server here.\n\n279\n00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.540\nSo now I've got a connection.\n\n280\n00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.760\nAll right,\nI've got a connection to this server.\n\n281\n00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.340\nNow, there's an optional set\nthat we can do right here.\n\n282\n00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.440\nIf I have line of business software,\nyou do wanna gather that software,\n\n283\n00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.470\nget that software on this machine.\n\n284\n00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.060\nNow, you might be asking\nyourself wait a second,\n\n285\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.180\nWes, this machine is hosted in the cloud.\n\n286\n00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.770\nHow do I get my software on it?\n\n287\n00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.110\nWell every one of these machines\nhas an Internet connection.\n\n288\n00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.910\nSo again it is a server, we're straying\na little bit from best practices here,\n\n289\n00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.210\nyou obviously don't want to go to\na server and start browsing the Web.\n\n290\n00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.280\nBut if you needed to you could.\n\n291\n00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.840\nAll right, so here's our server, right.\n\n292\n00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.190\nNow what are we gonna do to it?\n\n293\n00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:58.610\nNow the next process is to\nrun our sys prep utility.\n\n294\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:05.500\nAll right, and I could come down\nin here into File Explorer, right?\n\n295\n00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.568\nAnd inside of File Explorer\nyou can navigate into C:,\n\n296\n00:15:10.568 --> 00:15:15.710\nWindows, System32, and let me show\nyou where I'm talking about here.\n\n297\n00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.549\nAll right, so we're in LocalDisk (C:),\nwe're gonna get down into Windows.\n\n298\n00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.947\nAnd then we're gonna go to System32.\n\n299\n00:15:27.947 --> 00:15:35.190\nAll right, and inside of System32\nthere is a Sysprep folder, right.\n\n300\n00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.460\nYou'll see it right here, Sysprep.\n\n301\n00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.600\nAnd maybe some of you guys have\nseen Sysprep before, right.\n\n302\n00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.340\nWe've talked about it,\n\n303\n00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.330\nas you're provisioning an Operating System\nto deploy it out with WDS, right.\n\n304\n00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.000\nI need to prepare it for use.\n\n305\n00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.503\nI need to remove all\nthe unique identifiers, but\n\n306\n00:15:50.503 --> 00:15:54.868\nthey make it even easier for\nthat, or then that I should say.\n\n307\n00:15:54.868 --> 00:15:59.979\nIf I close this down, Dan, notice that\nlittle script that I got right there and\n\n308\n00:15:59.979 --> 00:16:05.400\nI know it's really hard to see, guys, but\nit's validate Azure remote app image,\n\n309\n00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.610\nright, and if I hover to\ndiscover there you can see that.\n\n310\n00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.050\nNow what is that gonna do?\n\n311\n00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.010\nWell that's really, really cool.\n\n312\n00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:18.080\nI don't have to know where sys prep is,\nalthough I do, I can just run this script.\n\n313\n00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.360\nThey put that script on the desktop for\n\n314\n00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.600\nthe purposes of provisioning\na remote app image.\n\n315\n00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.210\nAnd tell you what, any time you've got\na script and you've automated the process,\n\n316\n00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.200\nand even more so, I didn't have to know\nany scripting language, because I don't.\n\n317\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.160\nAll I have to do is double click on that.\n\n318\n00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.050\nAnd what it's gonna do is it's gonna\nstart, it's gonna ask me first,\n\n319\n00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.330\nit's gonna say, you know what?\n\n320\n00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.650\nWe're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna just prep this image.\n\n321\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.770\nWe're gonna generalize it, and then\nwe're gonna shut it down for you, right.\n\n322\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.520\nAnd, we'll get it here,\njust a second here.\n\n323\n00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.970\nAnd, it'll do that process, all right.\n\n324\n00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.420\nSo now you can see that it's\nletting you know, current image.\n\n325\n00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.610\nAnd it validates it, right?\n\n326\n00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.790\nLet me get in here and show you this.\n\n327\n00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.130\nThis is really, really cool.\n\n328\n00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.380\nIt does all of this for you.\n\n329\n00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.860\nRight and\nit says the current image satisfy,\n\n330\n00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:08.145\nI could read this, all the requirement for\nthe Azure RemoteApp template image.\n\n331\n00:17:08.145 --> 00:17:11.110\nIt checked it for us, I don't have\nto know where this prep is and\n\n332\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:15.430\nI don't have to know up the top of my\nhead your preps are good whether or\n\n333\n00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.350\nnot this image is compliance.\n\n334\n00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:22.830\nSo now I'm gonna go ahead and\nsay yes and its gonna Sysprep.\n\n335\n00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:27.470\nAll right, and it is doing, oops,\nif I don't close that down.\n\n336\n00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.640\nIf you see right here,\n\n337\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.260\nit is doing the generalized Sysprep\nthat we see when we do deployments.\n\n338\n00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.480\nAll right, but they've taken\nall the guess work out of it.\n\n339\n00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.450\nAll I had to do was launch the script.\n\n340\n00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.010\nSo the first two things that we have to,\nand\n\n341\n00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.750\nyou might say a third thing too,\nit's kind of optional.\n\n342\n00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.730\nRemember, the first thing you have\nto do is create the virtual machine,\n\n343\n00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.350\nall right, which we've done.\n\n344\n00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.140\nThe second thing that you have to do,\nand this is where the optional part is.\n\n345\n00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.600\nIf you're customizing a line of business\napplication that you want to stream out\n\n346\n00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.700\nover the Internet, then what you, you have\nto have that line of business software.\n\n347\n00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.260\nAnd you load it into the virtual machine,\nor if it happens to be something you can\n\n348\n00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:03.260\nbrowse through the Internet and download,\nyou can do it that way too all right.\n\n349\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.260\nThe third thing is we have to connect\nto that virtual machine once we have\n\n350\n00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.790\nthat software and\nthat's what we've done, right?\n\n351\n00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:13.680\nWe've got that software ready to go and\nwe're imaging the machine.\n\n352\n00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.300\nNow this is gonna take a bit so one of the\ngreat things is I've already got an image\n\n353\n00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.640\nready to go for us, all right.\n\n354\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.120\nIt takes a bit, it shuts the machine down.\n\n355\n00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.080\nIt'll take a while to do this.\n\n356\n00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.630\nSo, the next thing that we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna go ahead we'll let this one.\n\n357\n00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.299\nI'm actually going to disconnect\nfrom this RDP session here.\n\n358\n00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.530\nAnd I don't want to sign out or anything,\nI'm just gonna disconnect from it.\n\n359\n00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:43.500\nI'm gonna let it do it's job because\nit's gonna shut down for me, all right?\n\n360\n00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:49.710\nBut now going back to the Azure interface,\nnow I need an image, right.\n\n361\n00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.940\nAnd that's what's happening\nhere in the background.\n\n362\n00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.570\nNotice that our first virtual machine,\nit's running but\n\n363\n00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.470\nit's still provisioning, so\nit does take a bit, all right?\n\n364\n00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:05.580\nSo the next place I have now\nthat I've got my instance, and\n\n365\n00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.570\nwe're kinda fast-forwarding a little bit,\nI've already got the machine ready to go,\n\n366\n00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:14.030\nanother machine ready to go, now I need\nto capture this machine, all right?\n\n367\n00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:19.060\nOnce it's done,\nonce we have sysprepped it, and\n\n368\n00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.590\nit should shut down here in just a second,\nwhat we're gonna go down and\n\n369\n00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:28.100\ndo is we're gonna to the capture option,\nright?\n\n370\n00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:34.110\nThe capture option allows me,\nonce this machine has been sys prepped.\n\n371\n00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:39.690\nAll the unique identifiers have been taken\nout of it, and it finally shuts down.\n\n372\n00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.460\nThen we capture the image.\n\n373\n00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.520\nAnd what does a capture do?\n\n374\n00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.820\nWell the capture itself, it turns\naround and it takes a file by file, or\n\n375\n00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:53.610\nbit by bit if you will, snapshot of the\ncurrent condition of the applications and\n\n376\n00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:57.600\nthe operating system at the time\nthat I run the sysprep.\n\n377\n00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.130\n>> All right Dan, it looks like\nwe have finally syspreped that\n\n378\n00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.370\nvirtual machine there, it takes a bit for\nthe virtual machine to shut down\n\n379\n00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.850\nbecause the next process has to\nbe with the virtual machine stop.\n\n380\n00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.830\nSo you can see that our IT training,\nvirtual machine that we just captured\n\n381\n00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.280\nhere, it is in a stopped state and\nthat's what we need.\n\n382\n00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.960\nCan't have a running machine if we\ncapture the image because, keep in mind,\n\n383\n00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.030\nit's just a bit by bit copy.\n\n384\n00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.440\nNow they make it fairly easy for\nus to capture here, and\n\n385\n00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.850\nyou can see right down here at the bottom.\n\n386\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:30.350\nWe got this little capture option and\nall I got to do is click that.\n\n387\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.210\nNow, some of the things\nthat we wanna look at.\n\n388\n00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.540\nPay attention to your naming convention.\n\n389\n00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.040\nEven though this is called IT training,\nI've\n\n390\n00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.750\nalready got one that's called IT training,\nso we're gonna name this something else.\n\n391\n00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:47.080\nLet's see here, we'll call this,\nhow about, test image.\n\n392\n00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.255\nBecause I'm creative.\n\n393\n00:20:50.255 --> 00:20:54.950\n[LAUGH] The next thing you could,\nyou have an image label if you want.\n\n394\n00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:59.550\nI might say,\nmaybe something like just remoteapp test.\n\n395\n00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.810\nBe careful because some of\nthe names that you go through here,\n\n396\n00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:09.310\nthey don't like certain,\nlike most fields that you fill out,\n\n397\n00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.980\nthey don't like certain\ncharacters in them.\n\n398\n00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.090\nOne of the things that I do know\nis none of these machines can\n\n399\n00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.250\nend in like a hyphen.\n\n400\n00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:20.220\nIt has to start with a letter and end\nwith a letter so just a FYI on that one.\n\n401\n00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.690\nNow here's the other thing.\n\n402\n00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.230\nNotice that we just got done\nSysprepping this machine.\n\n403\n00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:30.870\nIt is going to ask us before we create\nthis image, have you generalized it?\n\n404\n00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:32.240\nHow I removed generalizing?\n\n405\n00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.500\nHave I removed all those\nunique identifiers.\n\n406\n00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:39.760\nAs you'll see, we are going to capture\nthe image cuz we have Sysprep now.\n\n407\n00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.680\nRemember the other thing too.\n\n408\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.530\nOne of the reasons I told\nyou if you get the A0,\n\n409\n00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.390\nI really wouldnt get\nthe A0 768 megs of RAM.\n\n410\n00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.890\nA1 or A2, that's fine.\n\n411\n00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:52.260\nKeep in mind the virtual machine's gonna\nbe on long enough to take care of this\n\n412\n00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.220\nprocess and then, they show you\nright here, it's gonna be deleted.\n\n413\n00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.070\nSo that's a little bit easier\non the wallet for sure.\n\n414\n00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.057\nAnd we'll choose next.\n\n415\n00:22:02.764 --> 00:22:06.817\nAll right, now we got our heads up\nmenu down here at the bottom and\n\n416\n00:22:06.817 --> 00:22:08.220\nit lets us know.\n\n417\n00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.760\nWe zoom in on that a little bit that,\n\n418\n00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:14.580\nyes, it's capturing that test image\nof the virtual machine IT training.\n\n419\n00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.870\nAnd so just keep that in mind.\n\n420\n00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.240\nIT training, that machine when I go back\nto virtual machines after this is done,\n\n421\n00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.910\nit isn't gonna be there anymore.\n\n422\n00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:26.440\nIt's only there for\nthe purposes of creating this image.\n\n423\n00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.550\nSo now that's the next process, right?\n\n424\n00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.100\nWe've created our virtual machine.\n\n425\n00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.580\nWe've yet again gathered your\nline of business software.\n\n426\n00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.950\nWe've connected to it if we needed\nto install the software we could.\n\n427\n00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:38.630\nWe've sysprepped it, right.\n\n428\n00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.970\nOnce the machine shut down and\nit stopped we backed out of it, right, and\n\n429\n00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.400\nthen we come back and\nwe create this image.\n\n430\n00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.700\nAll right, so\nwhat's the next thing that we have to do.\n\n431\n00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:51.490\nWell, the next thing we have to do is we\nhave to create what is known what is known\n\n432\n00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:59.150\nas a remote app template and wow,\nthat actually finished fairly quick.\n\n433\n00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:03.160\nSo the next thing we're gonna do is we're\ngonna go over, now, we're start getting,\n\n434\n00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.120\nit's funny,\nnow we're getting into remote app.\n\n435\n00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.862\nWe spent all this time talking here,\nyou know.\n\n436\n00:23:06.862 --> 00:23:08.684\n[LAUGH]\n>> You set the stage.\n\n437\n00:23:08.684 --> 00:23:12.427\nBuild up all this tension and\nanticipation, can you deliver\n\n438\n00:23:12.427 --> 00:23:12.960\n>> [LAUGH]?\n\n439\n00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.100\n>> Yeah, we better hope, if not it's going\nto be an air ball on camera, I tell ya.\n\n440\n00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.220\nSo, we're gonna go to remoteapp\non this one, and now, and again,\n\n441\n00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:26.210\nguys, I've spun some of these up, to help\nspeed up time in the background, but\n\n442\n00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:32.960\nwe need to look at that image template,\nand we need to create one of these.\n\n443\n00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.570\nAnd we need those because we are going to\nassociate it with another process here.\n\n444\n00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.580\nSo, I am going to go ahead and choose new.\n\n445\n00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:44.680\nAll right and with this one you can\nupload a template, I don't recommend it.\n\n446\n00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.767\nYou can if you need to but you better have\nsome bandwidth, because if you have got\n\n447\n00:23:48.767 --> 00:23:52.438\nan image that is 60 gigs It's gonna\nbe a while before it ever uploads.\n\n448\n00:23:52.438 --> 00:23:56.911\nThe good thing is with everything that we\njust did we saved ourselves that time,\n\n449\n00:23:56.911 --> 00:23:59.649\nright, cuz we've created\na virtual machine and\n\n450\n00:23:59.649 --> 00:24:02.278\nnow we have an image To\nimport in as a template.\n\n451\n00:24:02.278 --> 00:24:05.078\nAll right, and you can see that\nI've got a couple of them and\n\n452\n00:24:05.078 --> 00:24:06.430\nit's kind of interesting.\n\n453\n00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:08.800\nThis actually spun up really fast,\nI'm kind of impressed on that.\n\n454\n00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.460\nLook at that, test images already there.\n\n455\n00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:15.880\nSo the one that we just created the image,\nit's ready to go that fast.\n\n456\n00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.670\nSo like I said,\nI'm pleasantly surprised on that one.\n\n457\n00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.920\nAll right now, I'm gonna go ahead and\npick that one but\n\n458\n00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.630\nI want you to see some of these options.\n\n459\n00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:26.820\nOops, now you can really see it [LAUGH]\nI confirm that I follow these steps.\n\n460\n00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:30.590\nAll right, ensure that my\napplication met app requirements.\n\n461\n00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.840\nNow, don't worry about the intricacies and\nthe details, but\n\n462\n00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:39.310\nthere is a Windows development guideline\nthat they say that you're going to follow\n\n463\n00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.120\nI'm not customizing anything here right?\n\n464\n00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.040\nWere gonna use some of the applications\nthat are already in the server so\n\n465\n00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.320\nI know that the apps\nmeet the requirements.\n\n466\n00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.950\nDoes the image meet the requirements?\n\n467\n00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.180\nWell has it been sysprepped?\n\n468\n00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.020\nWe've seen that it did and\nwe confirmed it and\n\n469\n00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.468\nthen it let us know that hey well it's\ngoing to delete the virtual machine.\n\n470\n00:24:55.468 --> 00:24:59.380\nWe ran sysprep?.\n\n471\n00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.050\nNo.\nI know where sysprep is,\n\n472\n00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:04.140\nmaybe some of you guys do.\n\n473\n00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.300\nYou don't run sysprep manually yourself.\n\n474\n00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.550\nYou run that validate\nAzure RemoteApp image\n\n475\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.465\nscript that puts on the desktop\nthat's why they put it there.\n\n476\n00:25:14.465 --> 00:25:15.155\nSo we run that.\n\n477\n00:25:15.155 --> 00:25:16.415\n>> You had me worried there for a second.\n\n478\n00:25:16.415 --> 00:25:18.375\nI was like, I thought we did run sysprep.\n\n479\n00:25:18.375 --> 00:25:21.063\nYou mean we ran it through their\nlittle script that they gave it to us.\n\n480\n00:25:21.063 --> 00:25:22.455\n>> Yeah.\n\n481\n00:25:22.455 --> 00:25:26.495\nThe reason I make mention of it that way,\ncuz I know we've probably got some viewers\n\n482\n00:25:26.495 --> 00:25:29.925\nout there that have maybe done\nsome deployments through WDS, and\n\n483\n00:25:29.925 --> 00:25:32.975\nyou've captured your own image as\npart of the deployment process and\n\n484\n00:25:32.975 --> 00:25:34.345\nmaybe even run sysprep.\n\n485\n00:25:34.345 --> 00:25:38.960\nSo don't do that [LAUGH] don't\ndo what you'd normally do when\n\n486\n00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.650\nyour operating system deployments\ncome up here and run the script.\n\n487\n00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.920\nIt's why they put it there, it makes it\neasy breezy, set it and forget it, and\n\n488\n00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.640\nthat's always the least administrative\neffort which is another term they like to\n\n489\n00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.500\nuse on the exams.\n\n490\n00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.460\nAll right, so I've confirmed that I\nhave met the following, all right.\n\n491\n00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.450\nAnd we're gonna chose next.\n\n492\n00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.960\nNow, what do we want to name this?\n\n493\n00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.640\nWell, I'm going to go ahead and\nkeep it all consistent here and\n\n494\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:10.895\nI'm gonna call it Test Template cuz well,\nDan, that's the limit of my creativity.\n\n495\n00:26:10.895 --> 00:26:16.220\n[LAUGH] Now, I want you to be careful\nwhen you set your location on this.\n\n496\n00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.040\nLocation does matter.\n\n497\n00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:23.400\nI actually created, went to try to\ncreate a RemoteApp collection and\n\n498\n00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.600\nI put the affinity into Northern Europe.\n\n499\n00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.800\nI came back and\n\n500\n00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.540\nI didn't see it in the list because I had\nthe affinity of the location to east US.\n\n501\n00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.540\nAnd it wasn't there,\nit's in another location.\n\n502\n00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.270\nLocation matters.\n\n503\n00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.130\nSo you've heard this term in maybe\na different context, location,\n\n504\n00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:39.970\nlocation, location.\n\n505\n00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:41.740\nThis is one that it really\ndoes come into play here.\n\n506\n00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:48.140\nSo we're gonna go to east US here and\nwe're gonna start that RemoteApp template.\n\n507\n00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.800\nNow, the remoteapp template\ngonna take a little bit to cook.\n\n508\n00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.500\nYou could see that it's working on it,\nDan.\n\n509\n00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.680\nSo this one kind of\nlike the image process,\n\n510\n00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.410\nI'm still kind of surprised that\nthe image process was quick.\n\n511\n00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.070\nBut the virtual machine and\nthe sysprep took a little while so\n\n512\n00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.580\nwe will have to wait just a little\nbit here to get this one ready.\n\n513\n00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.790\n>> Well, Wes this is a great stopping spot\nto be honest with you cuz looking at our\n\n514\n00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.977\nclock, we have precious little time,\nactually we have no time left.\n\n515\n00:27:11.977 --> 00:27:15.150\n[LAUGH] We've exhausted the amount\nof time allocated for this show, so\n\n516\n00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:19.260\nit really is a good spot for us to stop\nand, when we come back and do a part two,\n\n517\n00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.900\nwe can pick right back up\nwhere we left off, right here.\n\n518\n00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.190\n>> Sounds good.\n>> So I look forward to it,\n\n519\n00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:24.640\nwe do thank you for stopping by.\n\n520\n00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.490\nWe thank you for\nwalking us through this RemoteApp process.\n\n521\n00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:31.940\nObviously, it's rather involved\nit takes a little brain power,\n\n522\n00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.600\nwe have got to know these steps.\n\n523\n00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.850\nWe have got to know them for the exam,\nas well, that is why this is important.\n\n524\n00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:39.160\nThat is why we are doing this, again we\nthank you for showing us how to do that.\n\n525\n00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.100\nWe thank you guys for watching us,\nstopping by, hanging out with us today.\n\n526\n00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.580\nWe hope you enjoyed the episode,\nwe are going to go ahead and sign off for\n\n527\n00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.110\nIT Pro TV.\n\n528\n00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:46.920\nI have been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n529\n00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.730\n>> And I am Wes Ryan.\n\n530\n00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:48.989\n>> We will see you next time.\n\n531\n00:27:50.532 --> 00:27:57.710\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:17.858\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.858 --> 00:00:21.370\nin today's episode we're continuing\non with our Windows 10 content.\n\n5\n00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.250\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto help us out with that very endeavor is\n\n6\n00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.990\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.797\nWes, welcome back to the show,\nand how's it going today?\n\n8\n00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:28.834\n>> It's going great, Dan, as always.\n\n9\n00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:33.360\nAnd it's a pleasure to be here with\nthe ITProTV crew in the studio.\n\n10\n00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.540\nThat's right, we're coming back\nwith a part two because, well,\n\n11\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.250\nWes talks a lot, and well, the first part,\nwe didn't get all the information in.\n\n12\n00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.610\nWhat information is that?\n\n13\n00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.860\nWell, nothing more than Azure RemoteApp.\n\n14\n00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.490\nIt is something that's called out\non the MCSA examine in Windows 10,\n\n15\n00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.000\nso we do want you to be familiar with it.\n\n16\n00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.480\nLet's kind of recap, maybe you're\njust joining us now in the part two.\n\n17\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.410\nAgain, do back back and watch part one,\nand then come back and see us here again.\n\n18\n00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.830\nBecause in part one, we showed you how\nto create a virtual machine, right?\n\n19\n00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.670\nThen we told you some of\nthe optional things that you could\n\n20\n00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.577\ndo if you're gonna deploy a line of\nbusiness application out to your devices,\n\n21\n00:01:10.577 --> 00:01:13.204\nyour BYOD devices,\nyour desktops, to RemoteApp.\n\n22\n00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:16.845\nWell, you're gonna have to\nhave that software already,\n\n23\n00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:19.400\nready to go before you can do that.\n\n24\n00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.833\nNext thing that we did there, remember\nthat we connected to the virtual machine.\n\n25\n00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:27.113\nIt took a little bit, but\nonce the machine was provisioned,\n\n26\n00:01:27.113 --> 00:01:31.356\nwe could turn around and use an RDP app\nthat we downloaded to turn that around and\n\n27\n00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:33.720\nconnect right to that machine.\n\n28\n00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.882\nNow once that's done, remember,\nthat's when you install your software.\n\n29\n00:01:36.882 --> 00:01:42.960\nAnd you run that Azure validation,\nthat validate Azure RemoteApp image.\n\n30\n00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.704\nAnd it does the sysprep for us, stripping\nout all of those unique identifiers.\n\n31\n00:01:47.704 --> 00:01:51.500\nAnd once that was done,\nonce we got done with our sysprep,\n\n32\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.000\nremember that we imaged the machine.\n\n33\n00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.300\nWe captured an image of it and\nthen once that image was captured,\n\n34\n00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.870\nthe virtual machine itself in\nthe background was deleted.\n\n35\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.760\nFinally, one of the things that we\nleft off on yesterday was creating\n\n36\n00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.020\na RemoteApp template.\n\n37\n00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.980\nNow with the RemoteApp template,\n\n38\n00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.330\nremember that it is gonna be\nassociated with an image that you have.\n\n39\n00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.120\nYou could upload an image if you want.\n\n40\n00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.203\nSome of these images can be very big,\n60 gigs.\n\n41\n00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.723\nIt could take you a while\nto upload it to the cloud.\n\n42\n00:02:18.723 --> 00:02:21.920\nOr you could use the library as well.\n\n43\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.950\nSo what we're gonna do today is, we're\ngonna pick up right where we left off and\n\n44\n00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.230\nwe're gonna jump into the next\nstep in this process,\n\n45\n00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.212\nthis journey that is\nknown as Azure RemoteApp.\n\n46\n00:02:33.212 --> 00:02:36.740\nAnd, Dan, what we're gonna be doing today\nis we're gonna start out with making\n\n47\n00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.690\na RemoteApp collection.\n\n48\n00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.380\nSo let's go ahead, let's dive right in and\nshow you the interface.\n\n49\n00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.440\nRemember that yesterday where we left\noff was this Template Images, right?\n\n50\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.390\nAnd we created a training app.\n\n51\n00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.520\nSo we've got a couple here as well.\n\n52\n00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.530\nBut now, what we need to do is we\nneed to make a RemoteApp collection.\n\n53\n00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.380\nSo that's the next step.\n\n54\n00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.931\nAnd we'll choose\nRemoteApp Collection here.\n\n55\n00:02:59.931 --> 00:03:04.000\nAlmost said, and you know what, let me\nmake sure I'm in the right spot here.\n\n56\n00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.910\nThis was our images,\n\n57\n00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.848\nI was in the RemoteApp collection, some\nof the ones that I already have pre-done.\n\n58\n00:03:08.848 --> 00:03:11.850\nThere's our Test-Template that you'll\nremember from the first episode\n\n59\n00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.730\nthat we made.\n\n60\n00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.280\nAnd now we're gonna import that\ninto our RemoteApp collection.\n\n61\n00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.360\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n62\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.256\nWe'll choose RemoteApp Collection and\nthen, like the interface has had on some\n\n63\n00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:24.691\nof the other things that we've looked at,\nremember it's just a little\n\n64\n00:03:24.691 --> 00:03:27.969\nplus symbol down here on the lower\nleft-hand corner that says New.\n\n65\n00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:30.530\nWe're gonna go ahead and choose this.\n\n66\n00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.130\nAnd then you've seen\nthis interface as well.\n\n67\n00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.378\nAnd you gotta make sure that we\nhave the right selections here, so\n\n68\n00:03:36.378 --> 00:03:41.570\nyou can see scrolling back up towards\nthe top that I do have RemoteApp selected.\n\n69\n00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.500\nWe have App Services, RemoteApp.\n\n70\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.788\nAnd really, they should default to what\nyou need based on a choice you made in\n\n71\n00:03:48.788 --> 00:03:51.160\nthe main interface there.\n\n72\n00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.557\nAnd we're gonna do\na Quick Create on this one.\n\n73\n00:03:53.557 --> 00:03:58.467\nNow, it's important, we kind of\njoked around here about location,\n\n74\n00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:02.350\nyou heard, location, location, location.\n\n75\n00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.170\nWell, when you create one of your images,\nwhen you create one of your virtual\n\n76\n00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.010\nmachines, you have to be mindful\nof the region that you put it in.\n\n77\n00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.480\nAnd one of the reasons I say that is,\nbecause if you go to import one of these\n\n78\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.640\ntemplates to create a RemoteApp\ncollection, and let's say, in fact,\n\n79\n00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.140\nrather than just talk about it,\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n80\n00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.920\nSo if I drop down this list, what are\nthe applications that I have available?\n\n81\n00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.200\nI really want you to just pay\nattention to where the region is.\n\n82\n00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.500\nNotice the region says North Europe,\nright?\n\n83\n00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.270\nAnd if I choose the down arrow,\nnotice something.\n\n84\n00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.760\nThe images that we created yesterday,\nremember it should say Test-Image.\n\n85\n00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.720\nIt's not in this list.\n\n86\n00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.960\nSome of the other ones,\nyou can see one of the other one is,\n\n87\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.835\nthat I already had created.\n\n88\n00:04:46.835 --> 00:04:50.153\nBut the Test-Image isn't there.\n\n89\n00:04:50.153 --> 00:04:52.708\nAnd that's because the region\nis set to Northern Europe, or\n\n90\n00:04:52.708 --> 00:04:54.710\nNorth Europe if you will.\n\n91\n00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.480\nBut if I scroll down, and\nthis is where you have to remember,\n\n92\n00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.330\nwhere did I create this?\n\n93\n00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.150\nWe scroll down to the location of the\nregion that you created that template in.\n\n94\n00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.390\nAnd if I select, in this case\nyou'll remember it was East US,\n\n95\n00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.400\nand now I choose the down arrow, notice\nthat I've got some different images here.\n\n96\n00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.390\nSo that might be something that gives\nyou a little bit of a hard time.\n\n97\n00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.380\nYou'll come in here and\nif it's just the defaults,\n\n98\n00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.600\nit says Northern Europe or North Europe.\n\n99\n00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.075\nAnd I choose down my images aren't there.\n\n100\n00:05:21.075 --> 00:05:25.580\nSo it is region specific to where\nyou've created it, I change it to East.\n\n101\n00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.790\nAnd if I look down here you can see\n\n102\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.710\nthere is that image that we created\nyesterday or the template, excuse me.\n\n103\n00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.610\nSo we're gonna select this one.\n\n104\n00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.372\nAll right, and this remote collection,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n105\n00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:40.354\njust keep the naming\nconvention the same here.\n\n106\n00:05:40.354 --> 00:05:45.651\nWe'll call it Test-Collection.\n\n107\n00:05:45.651 --> 00:05:52.090\nAll right, this is one of the things I\npractice, what I was telling you guys.\n\n108\n00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.550\nLooks like I've already got,\nis it 13 characters?\n\n109\n00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.510\nWe'll make it a little easier.\n\n110\n00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.303\nCollection1, or was it 1?\n\n111\n00:06:00.303 --> 00:06:01.063\nI think I can do that.\n\n112\n00:06:01.063 --> 00:06:02.111\nYeah, you gotta be careful.\n\n113\n00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:05.120\nOne of the big things\nis 3 to 13 characters.\n\n114\n00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.710\nThe other thing is it can't\nend in a special character, so\n\n115\n00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.110\njust be mindful of that.\n\n116\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.570\nAnd I do believe I mentioned\nthat in the first episode there.\n\n117\n00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.020\nAll right, let's go ahead and\ncreate our RemoteApp collection.\n\n118\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.710\nNow this is one of the things that,\n\n119\n00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.760\nas you've seen in Microsoft Azure here,\nthat takes a little bit to be provisioned.\n\n120\n00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.420\nI'd be surprised if it's as fast as the\nimage that we've seen in the first part\n\n121\n00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.190\nhere, where I was like, yeah, this is\ngonna take, okay, it's done, never mind.\n\n122\n00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.460\n>> Sometimes they surprise you.\n\n123\n00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.292\nLike, you're thinking,\nthis is gonna take forever.\n\n124\n00:06:34.292 --> 00:06:36.726\nAnd then you're like,\nwell, nevermind, it's done.\n\n125\n00:06:36.726 --> 00:06:37.664\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n126\n00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:38.940\nthat's what the image was like, too.\n\n127\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.746\nSo they must have put a little bit of hot\nsauce on those machines in the cloud there\n\n128\n00:06:43.746 --> 00:06:45.844\nand spun the image up fairly fast.\n\n129\n00:06:45.844 --> 00:06:49.621\nNow with the RemoteApp collection, keep in\nmind there's a few things that we're gonna\n\n130\n00:06:49.621 --> 00:06:51.920\nhave to deal with, now we've created it.\n\n131\n00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.290\nAnd what this is doing is\nit's essentially creating\n\n132\n00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.990\na collection of the apps\nthat we wanna deploy.\n\n133\n00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.990\nAll right, hence the term, and\n\n134\n00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.780\nit seems obvious after you break down\nthe words RemoteApp collections.\n\n135\n00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.710\nSo if you wanna deploy the Office Suite,\n\n136\n00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.490\ncreate a RemoteApp collection, if I can\nsay that right, for just the Office Suite.\n\n137\n00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.640\nIf you have maybe a couple of line of\nbusiness pieces of software that you want,\n\n138\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.160\nyou can come back in here and you can\ncreate another RemoteApp collection.\n\n139\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.840\nI just wanna remind you of one thing\nthough, do keep in mind that when you\n\n140\n00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.320\ncreate your virtual machines, remember\nwhen you image them, they're deleted.\n\n141\n00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.430\nSo it is a good thing to\nkind of plan out what\n\n142\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.460\napplications that you wanna\nmake available ahead of time.\n\n143\n00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.972\nAnd also plan out how you're gonna\ndivide up RemoteApp collections.\n\n144\n00:07:36.972 --> 00:07:38.995\nAre you gonna load everything\nonto a single server?\n\n145\n00:07:38.995 --> 00:07:44.353\nAnd you certainly could, but\nthere again, for keeping them separated,\n\n146\n00:07:44.353 --> 00:07:49.812\nas you're gonna see here when we deploy\nthese applications to an end user.\n\n147\n00:07:49.812 --> 00:07:54.801\nIf you have all of the applications,\nthe OfficeSuite, you have your line\n\n148\n00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:59.398\nof business applications,\nAll in the same remote app collection.\n\n149\n00:07:59.398 --> 00:08:03.025\nThat means when a user connects to them,\nand we're going to show user access too,\n\n150\n00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:06.026\nthey could potentially have access\nto every single application and\n\n151\n00:08:06.026 --> 00:08:07.150\nyou might not want that.\n\n152\n00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.520\nYou might have a line of business\napplication that is only for\n\n153\n00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.590\nyour marketing staff or\nmaybe for Research and\n\n154\n00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.840\nDevelopment, so\njust plan accordingly to that.\n\n155\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.100\nNow the moment this gets provisioned,\nwe'll be able to go in here and\n\n156\n00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.790\nwe're gonna start to\npublish our applications.\n\n157\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:29.020\nAll right, now again just a given\nthe amount of time that it might take,\n\n158\n00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.970\nwe might go ahead I'll\ntell you what Danny.\n\n159\n00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.650\nLet's go ahead and let's use the magic of\ntelevision here as this is provisioning,\n\n160\n00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.580\nwe'll let this get provisioned and\n\n161\n00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.050\nwhen we come back we'll show\nyou how to publish these apps.\n\n162\n00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.200\nWell it looks like we got our\nRemoteApp collection ready to go here.\n\n163\n00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.690\nIt's finally finished provisioning so lets\ngo ahead and jump into the next step and\n\n164\n00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.710\nlet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n165\n00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.630\nSo you can see that it says that it's\nactive now and that what we want.\n\n166\n00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.860\nNow what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna go back to the same.\n\n167\n00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.790\nNow there's a couple of different\nway that you can do this.\n\n168\n00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.910\nI could just click on\nthe one that I want or\n\n169\n00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.900\nyou could also just go up\nto remote collections here.\n\n170\n00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.000\nSo let's just go ahead we're gonna click\non the RemoteApp collection that we just\n\n171\n00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.390\ncreated here, collection1.\n\n172\n00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.760\nAnd there's a couple things that I have\nto do to set this up in order to give\n\n173\n00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.460\nusers access.\n\n174\n00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.200\nThe first thing I have to do\nis publish the applications.\n\n175\n00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.600\nSo we'll start there and we'll come\nback to the user access part, all right.\n\n176\n00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.390\nNow, when it comes to publishing,\n\n177\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.470\nI kind of clicked that without\ntelling you what I'm doing.\n\n178\n00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.740\nLet's zoom in here guys,\nso publishing here.\n\n179\n00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.730\nAnd it'll take a second, and it's looking\ninto this collection that we just created\n\n180\n00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.430\nand saying okay, what\nare the applications that are inside it?\n\n181\n00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.040\nLet me look inside of\nthis collection here and\n\n182\n00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.320\nthen I'll present those back to you and\nhere we're gonna publish a program.\n\n183\n00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.310\nAll right, and now it's found\nthe programs that it looked at, right?\n\n184\n00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.310\nAnd I can see that I've got\na few of them here right?\n\n185\n00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.800\nYou get some of the basic ones if you\nhave installed your line of business\n\n186\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.200\napplications they would be\nin this location as well.\n\n187\n00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.860\nAnything that installs itself down there\nin the program files would show up here.\n\n188\n00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.456\nBut let's go ahead, I'll tell you what.\n\n189\n00:10:03.456 --> 00:10:09.030\nWe got PowerShell here, let's go ahead and\ndeploy PowerShell as a remote app.\n\n190\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.150\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nselect that and I tell you what,\n\n191\n00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.460\nmaybe even the calculator too, we'll\nthrow that one in there for good measure.\n\n192\n00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.640\nNow we're gonna ahead and\npush the check mark here.\n\n193\n00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.500\nAnd this is one of those ones that again,\nit takes a little bit to\n\n194\n00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.580\npublish the applications and it said,\nsuccessfully started publishing.\n\n195\n00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.800\nNow when you come back to the collection,\n\n196\n00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.150\nyou can see that the status\nhas changed a little bit.\n\n197\n00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.020\nNotice that inside of the collection\nit's letting me know what\n\n198\n00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.900\napplications we're gonna find in it.\n\n199\n00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.920\nI'll go ahead and back out of this\nhere you can see that it's active.\n\n200\n00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:46.400\nAnd let's see here it shouldn't take\ntoo long to publish these applications.\n\n201\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.000\nNow once you've published\nthe applications you have to determine\n\n202\n00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.880\nwho are the users that\nyou're gonna give access to.\n\n203\n00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.200\nSo we'll go ahead and\ngo over here to user access, all right.\n\n204\n00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.140\nAnd you can see that\nmy name's on the list.\n\n205\n00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.900\nI'm the tentative administrator here,\nso I'm definitely gonna show up and\n\n206\n00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.070\nthat's the account that I'm gonna be\nusing but it's kind of interesting here.\n\n207\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.850\nIf you have Azure Active Directory,\n\n208\n00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:13.280\nwe can add additional\nAzure Active Directory users, and\n\n209\n00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.690\nwhat's also really neat about this is,\nI could use Microsoft accounts as well.\n\n210\n00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.760\nYou can publish applications to\nusers that maybe necessarily you\n\n211\n00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.630\ndon't want to have access to your domain\nor maybe they're not in your domain.\n\n212\n00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.500\nMaybe you've got a second team\nthat's going to help you come in,\n\n213\n00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.240\nmaybe test this application out.\n\n214\n00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.050\nYou certainly don't want to make them\na part of your internal infrastructure.\n\n215\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.350\nYou can just have them create\na Microsoft account and\n\n216\n00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.210\nwe can publish that out to their device,\nwherever they are.\n\n217\n00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.760\nThey can run it in an isolated,\ncontained environment.\n\n218\n00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.950\nYou don't have to worry\nabout them interfering\n\n219\n00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.590\nwith your internal infrastructure,\nif you will.\n\n220\n00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.450\nSo let me go ahead, I'm gonna add\nsomebody here and it's gonna check,\n\n221\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.880\nI'm gonna add a Microsoft account.\n\n222\n00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.059\nSo we'll add old Scott Summers here.\n\n223\n00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.310\nYou don't know who that is?\n\n224\n00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.067\n>> Yeah, it sounds like cyclops?\n\n225\n00:12:01.067 --> 00:12:03.668\n>> [LAUGH] That's exactly wow\nthat was a pretty good one Dan.\n\n226\n00:12:03.668 --> 00:12:08.135\n[LAUGH] Right you could tell how much\nwere pretty big geeks around here.\n\n227\n00:12:08.135 --> 00:12:09.685\n>> Just a little.\n\n228\n00:12:09.685 --> 00:12:14.085\n>> So I'm gonna use, it's an Outlook\naccount here, I created this one for\n\n229\n00:12:14.085 --> 00:12:16.125\nthe purposes of this demonstration.\n\n230\n00:12:16.125 --> 00:12:19.155\nNow and let me just double check\non that real quick make sure I,\n\n231\n00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:22.259\ncouldn't resolved the name I\nmight have spelled it out there.\n\n232\n00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.803\nAnd as you can see,\nit will try to reach out to Microsoft and\n\n233\n00:12:28.803 --> 00:12:31.110\nsay hey, is that a valid account?\n\n234\n00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:35.180\nIt doesn't look like that\nis a valid account here.\n\n235\n00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.110\nI think there's Scott Summers.\n\n236\n00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.385\nIt says name, plural.\n\n237\n00:12:38.385 --> 00:12:40.503\n>> [LAUGH] He has multiple sign ins.\n\n238\n00:12:40.503 --> 00:12:42.890\n>> Does he have multiple names,\nand that's it.\n\n239\n00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.605\nYou've got to spell it correctly.\n\n240\n00:12:44.605 --> 00:12:47.260\n[LAUGH] That does help or you're not\nputting the right person in there.\n\n241\n00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.490\nNow once you've got your account there,\nwhether it's internals or\n\n242\n00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.650\nyour active directory, or whether it's\nsomething like a Microsoft account here,\n\n243\n00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.810\nall we have to do is click Save.\n\n244\n00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.950\nDon't make the mistake\nof not saving it after.\n\n245\n00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.470\nJust entering it alone\nis not gonna save it.\n\n246\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.080\nSo come down here and you can click Save.\n\n247\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.090\nAnd it'll update that and\nnow, would could I do?\n\n248\n00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:12.020\nWell, I published this\nPowerShell application, right?\n\n249\n00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.660\nOr maybe it's my internal application.\n\n250\n00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.920\nI could now send,\n\n251\n00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.220\nScott is going to receive an email that\nhe's been invited to this application.\n\n252\n00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.430\nBut now I could send him an email,\nand I could say you know what,\n\n253\n00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.670\nI need you to download\nthe RemoteApp client, all right?\n\n254\n00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.600\nAnd then this user could now,\nif they want,\n\n255\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.480\nlet's say practice\nPowerShell on their devices.\n\n256\n00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.290\nAgain, if it's a line of business\napplication that you're maybe\n\n257\n00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.520\nin development with,\nmaybe you're working with another team.\n\n258\n00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.560\nYou could just publish it out to them\nin the current state that it is, and\n\n259\n00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.850\nsay test it out and\ngive me some feedback here.\n\n260\n00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.600\nAnd it's a really good\nthing to have there.\n\n261\n00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.600\nLet's see, okay so\nDan looks like it's published on that one.\n\n262\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.390\nThat one didn't take quite as\nlong as the RemoteApp collection.\n\n263\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.120\nLet me just give you a piece of advice,\nand\n\n264\n00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.690\nyou will see that in the interface\nit'll warn you about this.\n\n265\n00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.670\nWhen you're publishing a RemoteApp\ncollection, it can take an hour.\n\n266\n00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.330\nPay attention to your service health too,\n\n267\n00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.830\ncuz Azure is, I mean they do a really\ngood job of staying online and\n\n268\n00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.920\na high availability,\nin trying to maximize their uptime.\n\n269\n00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.000\nBut pay attention to service health and\nthe reason I say that is because,\n\n270\n00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.920\nif you're having service health or service\ndegrades could take a little bit longer,\n\n271\n00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.270\nand that would definitely be a problem.\n\n272\n00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.400\nEspecially if you're on a time crunch.\n\n273\n00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.510\nAll right Dan, so you know,\n\n274\n00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:30.470\nwe've, a kind of recap here, we left off\nthe last episode with a template, right?\n\n275\n00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.480\nSo now what do we do?\n\n276\n00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.055\nWe took the templates that we'd already\ncreated in the first episode and\n\n277\n00:14:35.055 --> 00:14:37.535\nwe joined them to a RemoteApp collection.\n\n278\n00:14:37.535 --> 00:14:40.855\nWe came in here, we published that\napplications that we wanted and\n\n279\n00:14:40.855 --> 00:14:42.185\nwe could see that it's published here.\n\n280\n00:14:42.185 --> 00:14:45.150\nAnd it let's me know that hey it's active,\nall right.\n\n281\n00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.850\nAnd then we modified user access.\n\n282\n00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:52.200\nEven if you publish these applications,\njust like any other application,\n\n283\n00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.280\njust like any file.\n\n284\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.980\nIf I have a file and\nwe're in a Windows domain and\n\n285\n00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.430\nI lock it down with\na encrypted file system.\n\n286\n00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.810\nAnd I pass it over to Dan, I say, Dan,\n\n287\n00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.310\nI need you to check these numbers out,\nsomething doesn't see right.\n\n288\n00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.200\nDan goes to click on it and\n\n289\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.210\nhe says, Access denied,\nWes how am I gonna help you?\n\n290\n00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.230\nWell that's the same thing,\n[LAUGH] remember your user access here.\n\n291\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.530\nBecause if you publish an application, the\nperson can download it, they could even\n\n292\n00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:16.040\nhave an account, log in, and\nthey don't have an app available for them.\n\n293\n00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.680\nAnd that would probably not\nbe a good day at the office,\n\n294\n00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.750\nremember it's also about availability.\n\n295\n00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.970\nSo let's go ahead, I'll tell you what,\nand we're gonna deploy,\n\n296\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.940\nwe got a couple of different types of\ndeployments that we're gonna show you.\n\n297\n00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.375\nWe're going to show you deploying out to\na traditional Windows 10 desktop, and\n\n298\n00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:32.686\nthen I want to show you some\nof the other stuff it can do.\n\n299\n00:15:32.686 --> 00:15:36.893\nWe're going to publish an application to\na Windows 8.1 mobile phone as well, and\n\n300\n00:15:36.893 --> 00:15:40.209\nI always thought that would be kind\nof cool to have a full blown power\n\n301\n00:15:40.209 --> 00:15:42.210\nshow right there on your phone.\n\n302\n00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.390\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n303\n00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:46.750\nNow, I've got another machine here,\nlet me go ahead and get logged in here.\n\n304\n00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.968\nAll right, and\nI'm just gonna minimize this guys.\n\n305\n00:15:50.968 --> 00:15:55.462\nI went ahead, before we started\nshooting this and I've connected and\n\n306\n00:15:55.462 --> 00:15:57.756\ngot the Azure RemoteApp download.\n\n307\n00:15:57.756 --> 00:16:02.525\nNow to get there, and just in case, I am\nnot sure if this is gonna be on the exam.\n\n308\n00:16:02.525 --> 00:16:03.910\nLet me show you here.\n\n309\n00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.080\nHopefully you can see that okay.\n\n310\n00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.800\nThat's remoteapp.windows azure.com.\n\n311\n00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.330\nI would probably just remember that\nbecause it might come up on the test if\n\n312\n00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.300\nthey ask you,\nyou need to deploy the client.\n\n313\n00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.800\nWell, that's a pretty big URL when\nit comes to deploying the client.\n\n314\n00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.720\nSo what is the support?\n\n315\n00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.920\nWe talked a little bit about support.\n\n316\n00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.390\nYou can see,\nit supports all of the operating systems.\n\n317\n00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:30.240\nYou can see the app store for your IOS\ndevices out there, you've got Mac there,\n\n318\n00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:36.150\nif you're running OS 10,\nEl Capitan is supported.\n\n319\n00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.240\nAnd then the download for Windows.\n\n320\n00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.856\nAnd you can see the Windows mobile phone.\n\n321\n00:16:39.856 --> 00:16:44.278\nSo I've already clicked that, and\nit does this click to run type deal,\n\n322\n00:16:44.278 --> 00:16:48.150\nwhere it doesn't actually\ninstall anything.\n\n323\n00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.250\nThis window that you see here\nhasn't installed anything locally.\n\n324\n00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.040\nAnd that's the beauty.\n\n325\n00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.380\nNow we're starting to get to some of the,\nwhy would we even go through all this.\n\n326\n00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.370\nAll this setting this up.\n\n327\n00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.290\nBecause it's not running on my\nlocal machine I can have a tablet\n\n328\n00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:07.550\nthat isn't x86 obviously,\nits ARM based, right.\n\n329\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.174\nWell ARM based processors,\nif I’ve got x86 or 32-bit or\n\n330\n00:17:11.174 --> 00:17:15.960\n64-bit implementation of an application,\nguess what, ARM devices must\n\n331\n00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.930\nas well throw them in the garbage, right,\nthey're not gonna do anything with that,\n\n332\n00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.850\nexcept if they're using\nsomething like RemoteApp here.\n\n333\n00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:21.934\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n334\n00:17:21.934 --> 00:17:24.120\nI'm not gonna start a free trial.\n\n335\n00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.990\nAnd when you click the Get Started here,\nit's gonna ask you to sign in.\n\n336\n00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.460\nAll right, so you're just gonna sign in.\n\n337\n00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.510\nWell in my case,\nit's gonna be my Microsoft account.\n\n338\n00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.490\nIf you have an Active Directory Domain,\n\n339\n00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.110\nit's whatever your username\nis inside of the directory.\n\n340\n00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:43.220\nIf it happens to be an imitation that's\ncome through, because you published it to\n\n341\n00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.070\nsomebody like a Microsoft account, they're\ngonna put it on their Microsoft account.\n\n342\n00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.810\nSo, let me go ahead and\ndo that here real quick.\n\n343\n00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.390\nThe joys of logging in.\n\n344\n00:17:53.733 --> 00:17:55.490\nAll right.\n\n345\n00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.400\nNow it says, okay,\nthis is a Microsoft account.\n\n346\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.786\nSo we're gonna just switch it right\nover to what used to be known as\n\n347\n00:18:02.786 --> 00:18:07.242\nthe Windows Live ID login, just know today\nit's an MSA, it's a Microsoft account.\n\n348\n00:18:07.242 --> 00:18:15.180\nAnd we'll go ahead now and\nlog in All right.\n\n349\n00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:20.060\nNow, it's kind of hard to see right there,\nbut it said, finding your applications.\n\n350\n00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.720\nAnd then after it says, finding your\napplications, it says, updating.\n\n351\n00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.000\nAnd you get that little\nellipse at the end,\n\n352\n00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.050\nright, dot dot dot,\nas it's trying to do that.\n\n353\n00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.269\nBut notice what I have here.\n\n354\n00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.470\nAll right, I have PowerShell.\n\n355\n00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:34.045\nNow just so you know that we don't\nhave any tricks up our sleeve\n\n356\n00:18:34.045 --> 00:18:35.890\n[LAUGH] no rabbit in the hat or\nanything like that.\n\n357\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:36.670\nLet me go ahead and\n\n358\n00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.060\nrun my local PowerShell before I even\nlaunch the one that's in remote app.\n\n359\n00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.000\nAnd what I wanna do here just\nreal quick is do a hostname.\n\n360\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.810\nAll right, so\nyou can see what is this running on.\n\n361\n00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.010\nWell this is the virtual\nmachine that I have right here.\n\n362\n00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.020\nThis is my Windows desktop.\n\n363\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.620\nThat's local to this machine.\n\n364\n00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.800\nYou could say it's client 10-2.\n\n365\n00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.550\nAll right.\n\n366\n00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.470\nHowever, and I'll go ahead and\nminimize that.\n\n367\n00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.390\nLet me launch the PowerShell.\n\n368\n00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:02.070\nNow, this is really cool and again,\nthere's more of the geek coming out of me,\n\n369\n00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.720\nI guess then,\nis because when you launch this,\n\n370\n00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.120\nit takes a second because it's\nreaching out over the internet.\n\n371\n00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.630\nAnd well, what is it doing?\n\n372\n00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:11.200\nWell, let me show you.\n\n373\n00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.340\nYou can't see it by detail.\n\n374\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.780\nIt's supposed to be hidden and\ntransparent to the user.\n\n375\n00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:19.150\nBut if I show the details on this, one of\nthe things that you're gonna see is that\n\n376\n00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:22.740\nit's connecting to a full blown\nvirtual machine, all right?\n\n377\n00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.720\nYou're connecting to a server.\n\n378\n00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.830\nNow, one of the things to\nkeep in mind is you are only\n\n379\n00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.440\nconnecting to the application itself\nthat's running on that server.\n\n380\n00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.850\nRemember when, in the first part of this\nepisode, where we made the image and\n\n381\n00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.530\nonce we had made the image it said okay,\n\n382\n00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.470\nwe're gonna delete the virtual\nmachine behind it.\n\n383\n00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.450\nSo that virtual machine doesn't exist.\n\n384\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:42.990\nSo what this does.\n\n385\n00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.320\nHere we go.\nIs it's logging me\n\n386\n00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.260\ninto that virtual machine.\n\n387\n00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.990\nAnd what I'm seeing\nright here is a desktop.\n\n388\n00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.950\nIf somebody of you have ever\nlogged into a server out there,\n\n389\n00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.320\nyou'll notice it gives you that little\nbuilding your profile for a client.\n\n390\n00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.290\nYou get the whole high if you wait\na half hour before it builds it.\n\n391\n00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.940\nBut that's what we see right here.\n\n392\n00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:05.130\nNow, it takes a second here, and [LAUGH]\nI love one of the great things here.\n\n393\n00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:10.660\nLet me go ahead and minimize some of this\nstuff is, it is a full blown PowerShell.\n\n394\n00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:15.370\nI can modify font size, just like\nyou could on your local machines.\n\n395\n00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.340\nLet me do that, make a little easier for\nyou guys to see out there.\n\n396\n00:20:21.453 --> 00:20:22.746\nAnd.\n\n397\n00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.280\nRemember that this is based on\ninternet connectivity speed.\n\n398\n00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.435\nBut look at this here we see,\n\n399\n00:20:29.435 --> 00:20:34.070\nSystem32\\windowsPowerShell\\v1.0, all\nright.\n\n400\n00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.940\nSo let me go ahead and\nget back to the root here.\n\n401\n00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.420\nAnd now let's run a hostname,\njust like we did before.\n\n402\n00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.490\nWell that's not my machine's name, is it?\n\n403\n00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:47.452\nRight?\nMy machine's name was client10-2.\n\n404\n00:20:47.452 --> 00:20:52.111\nSo it lets you know that what I'm seeing\nhere in the PoweShell is actually running\n\n405\n00:20:52.111 --> 00:20:56.429\nin the cloud on that instance of that\nvirtual machine that's been spun up,\n\n406\n00:20:56.429 --> 00:20:59.160\ngiving me access to this application.\n\n407\n00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.280\nNow you might be asking yourself okay,\nso virtual machines,\n\n408\n00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.760\nwhat if I have 500 people connect to this,\nto run my application?\n\n409\n00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.050\nWell, elasticity.\n\n410\n00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.060\nScaling up, on demand, right?\n\n411\n00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:15.420\nAll those cool little cloud terms that we\ntalk about in some of our other episodes.\n\n412\n00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.900\nWhat happens is the more people\nthat connect to this application,\n\n413\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.490\nWindows Azure portal in\nthe background of the platform,\n\n414\n00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.370\njust starts spitting up additional\ninstances in the virtual machine.\n\n415\n00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:29.950\nScaling out to support\nthe workload that you need, right?\n\n416\n00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.150\nWell what's the benefit of that?\n\n417\n00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.340\nWell, think about this, and\nDan I know you've worked for\n\n418\n00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.910\na company where you had\nto spin up servers.\n\n419\n00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.520\nAnd you guys would order servers and\nstuff.\n\n420\n00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.150\nWell, I've got one server, right?\n\n421\n00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:41.920\nI've got one server and\nit's not doing the job.\n\n422\n00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.870\nDan, just a question I'll throw at you?\n\n423\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.010\nHow long do you think roughly,\nit would take to get another server in\n\n424\n00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:51.620\nthere to support additional workloads,\nhaving to expand that application?\n\n425\n00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.390\n>> That's a good question,\nit would, let's see here.\n\n426\n00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.490\nYou got a speck out in your server,\nyou've gotta purchase the server.\n\n427\n00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:57.480\nThey've got to ship the server.\n\n428\n00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.950\nYou've got to receive the server.\n\n429\n00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.280\nThen you've got to the install\noperating system on the server.\n\n430\n00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.830\nWrack the server, don't forget that.\n\n431\n00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:04.500\nThat's always a fun good time.\n\n432\n00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.120\nNever a good day unless you've\nsliced your hands up on those rails.\n\n433\n00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.460\nIt's always a fondness.\n\n434\n00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:14.030\nLet's see here,\ntoday is where to work really.\n\n435\n00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.566\nIf you have the servers there,\n\n436\n00:22:15.566 --> 00:22:18.700\nlet's say they've already shipped it,\nyou've received it.\n\n437\n00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.010\nGetting it rack, getting it install,\nit's gonna have few hours, right?\n\n438\n00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.320\n>> So it takes a while, right?\n\n439\n00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.450\nIt's not something that happens instantly.\n\n440\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.990\nSo imagine in a scenario that maybe Dan\nand I are supporting a company, right, and\n\n441\n00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:30.810\nwe've got this line of\nbusiness application.\n\n442\n00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:35.485\nAnd all of a sudden, we start getting\na lot of hits or something at our website.\n\n443\n00:22:35.485 --> 00:22:40.230\nWe've got more people that maybe need\nto connect like traditional web server\n\n444\n00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.640\nlike this could take a while to spin up.\n\n445\n00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.580\nI don't have to worry about it here.\n\n446\n00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.360\nIt's dynamic.\n\n447\n00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.220\nIt's on demand and when I need it,\nalso based on your subscription.\n\n448\n00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.230\nI might wanna mention that too.\n\n449\n00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:54.810\nYour subscription counts on\nhow far it can scale up but\n\n450\n00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.330\nagain it can do it dynamically.\n\n451\n00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.305\nAnd one of the great things again,\n\n452\n00:22:58.305 --> 00:23:01.918\nis that when I look at these\nPowerShells side by side, let me see\n\n453\n00:23:01.918 --> 00:23:06.670\nif I can show you guys that, notice\nthat there are two different instances.\n\n454\n00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:08.160\nAll right, and you see that little icon.\n\n455\n00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.720\nMy head is kinda covering it up here.\n\n456\n00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.020\nWell you see that little icon there.\n\n457\n00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.460\nThat's the remote app icon, all right.\n\n458\n00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.246\nIf we switch back over to Azure, right,\nand notice the little icon down here.\n\n459\n00:23:18.246 --> 00:23:21.470\nNow there's a reason I'm taking\nthe time to show you icons.\n\n460\n00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.200\nIf they gave you\na question on the exam and\n\n461\n00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.870\nsaid which of these buttons do you\nchoose to start configuring remote app.\n\n462\n00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:28.940\nWould you know?\n\n463\n00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.610\nWell I would pay attention to that icon\nthere, because that will be the right one.\n\n464\n00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.610\nAnd that's another one of these\nways that you can see that, yes,\n\n465\n00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:41.080\nthis is running in the cloud, and\nthis is specifically a remote app there.\n\n466\n00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.830\nAll right, now the next thing\nthat we're gonna go ahead and do,\n\n467\n00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.100\nwe've seen it on a desktop.\n\n468\n00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.420\nHow does this work on a mobile device,\nright?\n\n469\n00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.518\nWell that's what we're gonna do next.\n\n470\n00:23:49.518 --> 00:23:56.187\nHow about we show you how to deploy this\nout to, like, a Windows 8.1 mobile device?\n\n471\n00:23:56.187 --> 00:23:59.179\nAll right, so we've got our\nWindows Phone here ready to go.\n\n472\n00:23:59.179 --> 00:24:01.418\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n473\n00:24:01.418 --> 00:24:04.510\nHere on our Windows Phone,\nI want you to know that\n\n474\n00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.770\nthere's a couple of things that\nyou had to do at first, right.\n\n475\n00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.420\nOne of the things that you had to do\nat first is you have to connect to\n\n476\n00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.180\nthe Windows Store, so it's gonna require\na Microsoft Account anyways to be able\n\n477\n00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.580\nto download the software.\n\n478\n00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.440\nWhat software am I talking about?\n\n479\n00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.480\nNone other than Microsoft's\ntraditional Remote Desktop.\n\n480\n00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.630\nYou can see here I've gone ahead,\nand I went ahead and downloaded it.\n\n481\n00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.700\nIt's right here on the start screen,\nif you will.\n\n482\n00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.813\nNow the next thing that you'll see\nthat it lets us know is, it says hey,\n\n483\n00:24:31.813 --> 00:24:34.100\nyou wanna get started at a remote PC?\n\n484\n00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.400\nYou wanna connect?\n\n485\n00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.600\nDo you wanna use remote resources?\n\n486\n00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.560\nWell, we're not gonna\nconnect to a desktop, but\n\n487\n00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.290\nwe are gonna use some\nremote resources here.\n\n488\n00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.580\nAll right, and that's where this\nlittle plus button comes in.\n\n489\n00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.300\nIf you look at the plus button,\nwe've got remote resources, but\n\n490\n00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.570\nthey've got this right here in the middle.\n\n491\n00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.318\nIt says Azure RemoteApp.\n\n492\n00:24:53.318 --> 00:24:57.170\nIf you wannna get apps that\nare available from Azure RemoteApp?\n\n493\n00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.416\nWell seeing that what's\nthis episode is about,\n\n494\n00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:01.291\nI think that's what we'll do, right?\n\n495\n00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:03.624\n[LAUGH] So we'll go ahead and\nwe'll connect this.\n\n496\n00:25:03.624 --> 00:25:08.492\nAnd it's gonna connect out just like\nwe've seen here on the desktop where\n\n497\n00:25:08.492 --> 00:25:10.330\nI had to log in.\n\n498\n00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.220\nSo it's gonna ask you,\ndown here at the bottom,\n\n499\n00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.390\nit's gonna say hey, do you wanna connect?\n\n500\n00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.409\nWe're gonna say yeah, we wanna connect.\n\n501\n00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.660\nAll right.\nAnd it's gonna reach out to the Azure\n\n502\n00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.410\ninfrastructure, and it's gonna prompt\nme for my username and password.\n\n503\n00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.630\nNow this is a little test\naccount that I had in here.\n\n504\n00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.500\nSo we're not gonna use that one.\n\n505\n00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.470\nAnd through the magic of TV timeout,\n\n506\n00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:33.120\nno social engineering,\nyou don't get to see me type my password.\n\n507\n00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.430\nAll right then,\nlooks like we are logged in.\n\n508\n00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:36.600\nMy password is safe,\n\n509\n00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.120\nno social engineering,\nyou guys didn't get to see that.\n\n510\n00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.890\nAnd the first place when we\nlogin to this remote desktop\n\n511\n00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.590\nAzure Remote App desktop, if you will.\n\n512\n00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.070\nYou'll say I don't have any desktops,\nthat's not what we're looking for, right?\n\n513\n00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.850\nBut what I do wanna do here is I\nwanna swipe to the side, all right.\n\n514\n00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.800\nAnd if we kinda zoom in here, let's see if\nwe can help you out there in seeing that.\n\n515\n00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.270\nYou could see that Powershell is one of\nthe available work resources that I have.\n\n516\n00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.455\nWell let's see what that's about.\n\n517\n00:26:02.455 --> 00:26:05.008\nWe'll go ahead and I'll click on that.\n\n518\n00:26:05.008 --> 00:26:09.903\nNow it's gonna have to connect\njust like it did earlier, right,\n\n519\n00:26:09.903 --> 00:26:14.175\nwhen we connected to\nthe Azure RemoteApp on the desktop,\n\n520\n00:26:14.175 --> 00:26:17.036\nit had to reach out to the Cloud there.\n\n521\n00:26:17.036 --> 00:26:20.867\nIt spins up that virtualized instance,\nor the virtual machine, so that you can\n\n522\n00:26:20.867 --> 00:26:25.070\nconnect to the app, and then finally the\napp is displayed locally on the machine.\n\n523\n00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.190\nSo it could take a little\nbit before you see any\n\n524\n00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:32.920\nsigns of your application being here, but\nI can actually see that it's down here.\n\n525\n00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.251\nLooks like it's been minimized.\n\n526\n00:26:36.251 --> 00:26:38.747\nLet me see here, so we can get to that.\n\n527\n00:26:45.028 --> 00:26:46.240\nAll right.\n\n528\n00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.300\nThere we go.\n\n529\n00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.330\nAll right.\n\n530\n00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.997\nI just needed to, oop, and a little.\n\n531\n00:26:50.997 --> 00:26:53.590\nThere we go, you guys can see that.\n\n532\n00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.810\nSo now, you can see that we have a,\n\n533\n00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.910\nlet me see if I can do this\nwithout glaring it out there.\n\n534\n00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.988\nNotice that we have a fully\nactive Powershell, all right.\n\n535\n00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:05.880\nAnd this Powershell is\nthe same one that you see\n\n536\n00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.850\nthat was running on my desktop, right?\n\n537\n00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.460\nThe difference is,\nnow it's running on a mobile device.\n\n538\n00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.640\nAnd that's really cool.\n\n539\n00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.770\nSo if you have limitations\non maybe the device or\n\n540\n00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.630\nthe platforms that you need to run\nan application on, for instance,\n\n541\n00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.770\nit doesn't even have to be\narchitecturally different.\n\n542\n00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.380\nWhat if your machine doesn't\nhave the resources needed or\n\n543\n00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.570\nto run the application efficiently?\n\n544\n00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.850\nWell, Microsoft can spin up probably\nenough servers that you'd have more power,\n\n545\n00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:32.130\nor horsepower,\nthan you'd need to run any application.\n\n546\n00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.750\nAnd also provided you have the expense,\nthat you could do something like this.\n\n547\n00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:38.670\nYou could deploy these\napplications to devices that\n\n548\n00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:41.039\notherwise wouldn't be running\nin their native environment,\n\n549\n00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.320\ngiving you a little bit more flexibility\nin how people connect to your app.\n\n550\n00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:49.450\nSo Dan, that's pretty much,\nin a nut shell, that's Remote App.\n\n551\n00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.005\nFrom beginning to end,\ncreating the virtual machines,\n\n552\n00:27:52.005 --> 00:27:56.770\nsys prepping the virtual machines,\nthen imaging the machines.\n\n553\n00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:01.190\nRemember your templates, create a\ntemplate, create a Remote App collection.\n\n554\n00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:05.630\nPublish your software, configure user\naccess, and then connect to Azure and\n\n555\n00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.500\ndownload the clients themselves.\n\n556\n00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.790\nIf they're on the mobile devices,\nremember the mobile stores, right?\n\n557\n00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:16.030\nApp Store for iOS devices, your\nGoogle Play for your Android devices and\n\n558\n00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:18.710\nthen, of course, the Windows Store for\nyour Windows Mobile phone.\n\n559\n00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.080\nAnd you have access, and\nthen you can deploy it.\n\n560\n00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.750\nYou have your users log in, they can\nconnect to the applications that you've\n\n561\n00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:28.108\ngiven them access, and like we see,\nthey can run them on multiple platforms.\n\n562\n00:28:28.108 --> 00:28:30.530\n>> Yeah Wes, tnis is a really cool piece\nof technology, to be honest with you.\n\n563\n00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.030\nIt's a smart idea.\n\n564\n00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.330\nThey saw a problem, and\nthey said you know what?\n\n565\n00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.780\nWe gotta take care of this.\n\n566\n00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.890\nMicrosoft, you did it in spades,\nit's very cool to boot.\n\n567\n00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:43.780\nYou can say, watch this, I don't\nhave to install Office on my system,\n\n568\n00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.910\nI can just access it\nthrough the Remote App.\n\n569\n00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:46.620\nWe installed it once.\n\n570\n00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.690\nWe're not paying for, well,\nmaybe we probably are.\n\n571\n00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.720\nThey don't let them get\naway with licenses.\n\n572\n00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:55.890\nYou're paying if you're using our product,\nbut you do get to do one installation.\n\n573\n00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.800\nI do it on the server, I do it into Azure.\n\n574\n00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.080\nAnd then all my remote,\nno matter what they run on,\n\n575\n00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.000\nI don't have to send them disks,\nI don't have to send them USB keys.\n\n576\n00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.800\nIf they are not connected to our network,\nthey don't have to try to access a share.\n\n577\n00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.860\nThey just say, you know what?\n\n578\n00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:14.230\nGo right here using my client, access\nmy resource and it's off to the races.\n\n579\n00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.155\nAnd even with a little mobile phone.\n\n580\n00:29:16.155 --> 00:29:19.520\nIt's actually pretty cool running the\nPowershell from your mobile phone there.\n\n581\n00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.250\n>> Yeah, I do have one thing that I know\nthat Dan's letting me know we're getting\n\n582\n00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.190\nclose to time.\n\n583\n00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:25.640\nBut I did want to point this out.\n\n584\n00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.970\nOne of the things that I didn't\nmention is the do nots, okay?\n\n585\n00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:31.613\nOne of the big do nots is,\nif you're using RemoteApp,\n\n586\n00:29:31.613 --> 00:29:35.878\ndon't be using RemoteApp to store the data\non the server that it's running on, right?\n\n587\n00:29:35.878 --> 00:29:39.178\nYou don't wanna do that,\nbecause the moment you log out and\n\n588\n00:29:39.178 --> 00:29:43.602\neverybody else logs out, that virtualized\ninstance of that application shuts\n\n589\n00:29:43.602 --> 00:29:45.595\nitself down and your data's gone.\n\n590\n00:29:45.595 --> 00:29:47.330\nSo that is one thing\nthat's a big no no there.\n\n591\n00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:50.740\nSo let me make sure that I get that there\njust so you don't lose any of your data.\n\n592\n00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.070\nBut I think that has it, Dan.\n\n593\n00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.490\n>> All right, well Wes, thanks so much for\n\n594\n00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:56.660\nexplaining this for us,\nshowing us how this works.\n\n595\n00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.570\nWe really appreciate it, and we thank you\nguys for watching and joining us today.\n\n596\n00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:03.700\nHopefully you learned something and\nmaybe even had a little bit of fun.\n\n597\n00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.080\nThat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n598\n00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.410\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n599\n00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.330\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n600\n00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:10.465\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n601\n00:30:10.465 --> 00:30:17.544\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

They begin by explaining when/where/why App-V would be utilized and then install the App-V software. Then they look at installing the App-V Sequencer and Client which is where much of the App-V magic happens. Finally, they install an app with App-V and explain some of the benefits and costs associated with an App-V deployment.",

ITProTv.\n\n3\n00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.200\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.730\nIn today's episode we're continuing\non with our Windows 10 series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.910\nJoining us back in the studio\nagain today is our good friend,\n\n6\n00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.530\nan organic star in this little journey\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.490\nWes, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.000\nHow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.830\n>> Thanks as always Dan it's great to be\nhere with the ITProTV crew on set here and\n\n10\n00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.070\nthat's right we're gonna be coming at you\nwith a little bit more of our MCSA on\n\n11\n00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.780\nWindows 10.\n\n12\n00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.710\nAnd today we're gonna be looking at\nsupporting a technology that's been around\n\n13\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.440\nfor a little bit, and\n\n14\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.430\nthat is none other than App V,\nthe application virtualization technology.\n\n15\n00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.010\nAnd this is something that\ncomes up on the exam,\n\n16\n00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.440\nit's specifically mentioned\nby the skills measured, so\n\n17\n00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.840\nit is a good idea to understand what\nit does for us and how it works.\n\n18\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.180\nSo that if you do happen to get any\nof those questions on the exam,\n\n19\n00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.640\nwell hopefully you'll be proficient\nenough in answering them.\n\n20\n00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.620\nSo Dan, one of the scenarios that we have\nis maybe you have a company out there and\n\n21\n00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.630\none of the things that they wanna do is\nthey've bene running a piece of software\n\n22\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.920\nfor a while and it's dated.\n\n23\n00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.460\nAny kind of production software,\nsometimes it can be around for\n\n24\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.620\na little bit because we trust it,\nwe trust the platform.\n\n25\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.520\nBut there does come a certain point where\n\n26\n00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.680\nyou have to think about upgrading\nto the next version of something.\n\n27\n00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.790\nIt doesn't matter if some of you guys out\nthere probably been around Office to what,\n\n28\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.470\n2000, 2003, 2010 and just it's\nlike any other piece of software.\n\n29\n00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.290\nBut what if you're in a testing\nenvironment, what if you don't know.\n\n30\n00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.270\nDo I really wanna move to this version?\n\n31\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.980\nOr, maybe do I wanna wait for\nanother version cuz I'm not sure if it's\n\n32\n00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.070\nreally [INAUDIBLE] give me\nthe totality of what my company needs?\n\n33\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.860\nWell, one of the things that you could\ndo is you could always install the new\n\n34\n00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.480\nsoftware.\n\n35\n00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.580\nBut the problem is, that wouldn't\ngive you any side by side comparison\n\n36\n00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.730\nbetween the old software and\nthe new software.\n\n37\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.130\nSo one of the great things about\napplication virtualization is its\n\n38\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.810\nability to have what would be\nknown as application coexistence.\n\n39\n00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.740\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n40\n00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.250\nSo we're gonna set up the problem here and\nwe'll see if you guys can follow along.\n\n41\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.010\nSo what I've done and\nI've got our Windows 10 machine here, and\n\n42\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.090\nI've got a couple of apps here.\n\n43\n00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.950\nAnd there are a couple of\ndifferent versions of this app.\n\n44\n00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.980\nNow if I was to install 6.8.3 and\n\n45\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.470\nthen turn around and install 6.9.1,\nmost likely, what's gonna happen\n\n46\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.620\nanytime you upgrade or you install a newer\npiece of software over the old one.\n\n47\n00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.830\nYou usually get two things.\n\n48\n00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.880\nAll right.\nOne, the installer stops,\n\n49\n00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.220\nthe MSI pack stops and\n\n50\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.630\nsays we detected an older version of\nthis please uninstall that first.\n\n51\n00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.020\nAnd then install the new one.\n\n52\n00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.080\nHowever, the Windows installer and\nsoftware programmers,\n\n53\n00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.322\nthey've got a lot better today.\n\n54\n00:02:50.322 --> 00:02:52.150\nThey write good programs\nthat'll turn around and\n\n55\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.810\nthey'll just upgrade right in\nthe middle of the installation.\n\n56\n00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.080\nYou don't have to uninstall the old one.\n\n57\n00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.010\nWell that wouldn't give us the ability\nto test them side by side.\n\n58\n00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.880\nLet me show you what I mean by this.\n\n59\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.210\nIf I go in here, and\nwe're gonna take the old one first, right?\n\n60\n00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.340\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nI'll install Note++ here.\n\n61\n00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.150\nAnd we'll go through the installer.\n\n62\n00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.140\nAnd we'll just kinda click through,\naccept the ULA there, Dan.\n\n63\n00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.220\nAnd we will install.\n\n64\n00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.150\n>> You're supposed to read those ULAs.\n\n65\n00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.550\n>> I am and we're not gonna test\nanybody on subsection 3, clause 32 C.\n\n66\n00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.861\nI think, well, maybe I'll just stand.\n\n67\n00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:25.890\n[LAUGH]\n>> It states that you have donated\n\n68\n00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.708\nyour body to science.\n\n69\n00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:29.110\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n70\n00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.977\nSo if I do come back for another episode,\nif the science department allows it,\n\n71\n00:03:33.977 --> 00:03:37.685\nyou could see right here, and\nI'm just gonna zoom on this.\n\n72\n00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:39.860\nNotice that I've got version 6.8.3.\n\n73\n00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.368\nNow, if that is the older app,\nand I decide, maybe I want to,\n\n74\n00:03:43.368 --> 00:03:47.352\nin fact it's telling me,\nhey there's an update available for that,\n\n75\n00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:50.680\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust defer the update a little bit.\n\n76\n00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.955\nBecause well,\nthat would end the show real quick.\n\n77\n00:03:52.955 --> 00:03:56.520\n[LAUGH] But now I have 6.8.3 here and\n\n78\n00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.820\nif I wanted to test 6.9.1,\nwell I'd have an option.\n\n79\n00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.490\nI could overwrite,\nlike we're about to do here.\n\n80\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.110\nI could overwrite by installing this piece\nof software just right over the new one.\n\n81\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.850\nDoesn't give me any warning\nthat we found an older version.\n\n82\n00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.840\nNotice I'm walking right through it here.\n\n83\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.090\nIt looks just like the same installer,\nI go ahead and I install it.\n\n84\n00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.220\nOnce that's done, I'll go ahead and\nclose Notepad down here.\n\n85\n00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.031\nWhat I really want to show\nyou is down in the programs.\n\n86\n00:04:27.031 --> 00:04:31.179\nIf we get down into programs and\nfeatures here, and\n\n87\n00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:35.715\nwe look at the version\ninformation on our Notepad ++,\n\n88\n00:04:35.715 --> 00:04:40.649\nall right, if you'll see right\nhere the Notepad ++ Team.\n\n89\n00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:43.470\nYou can see now it's 6.9.1.\n\n90\n00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.580\nSo I don't have the ability\nto run these side by side.\n\n91\n00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.200\nThe other option that I would\nhave is if I had two machines.\n\n92\n00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.100\nRight?\nI could install one on one machine,\n\n93\n00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.750\ninstall one on another machine but\n\n94\n00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.880\nnow you're talking about having to\nadministrate to two different machines.\n\n95\n00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.660\nYou're talking about an added expense,\nlikewise.\n\n96\n00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.892\nSo this is where something\nlike App V comes in.\n\n97\n00:05:02.892 --> 00:05:07.593\nI'm gonna go ahead real quick and I don't\nthink the uninstall should take too long.\n\n98\n00:05:07.593 --> 00:05:11.110\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nuninstall this whole entire piece of\n\n99\n00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.410\nsoftware and what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna show you how to through App V\n\n100\n00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.560\nfrom the moment you obtain\nthe software itself.\n\n101\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.360\nTo the moment that you sequence and\ndeploy one of these applications out.\n\n102\n00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.410\nAnd we're gonna see if we can run them\nside by side on a single machine,\n\n103\n00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.560\nhence the term application coexistence.\n\n104\n00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.810\nLet's go ahead Dan and\nI say we'll jump right in here and\n\n105\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.270\njust go ahead and do that.\n\n106\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.590\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n107\n00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.520\nI'm gonna close this down, and\nI don't have Notepad++ anymore.\n\n108\n00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.920\nNow, we have a technology out there,\nand I would be familiar with this.\n\n109\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.230\nThis is what's known as\nthe Microsoft Desktop Optimization pack.\n\n110\n00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.430\nYou might see the acronym MDOP out there.\n\n111\n00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.850\nAll right, with MDOP,\n\n112\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.730\nit gives you a suite of utilities that\nyou're gonna see here, coming up.\n\n113\n00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.250\nWe will specifically wanna focus in on the\nApp V product that allows you to do things\n\n114\n00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.690\nlike testing applications,\napplication co-existence if you will.\n\n115\n00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:06.970\nEven things like recovery.\n\n116\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.260\nWe can talk about some of those other\nutilities that it does in another episode.\n\n117\n00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.180\nThe first thing that you have to do,\nyou have to obtain MDOT.\n\n118\n00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.260\nMDOT typically comes in\nyour standard ISO format.\n\n119\n00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.790\nMaybe some of you guys out there have ever\ntried some trial software up at Microsoft\n\n120\n00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.130\nwhen they come out with a new server\noperating system and you can get the ISOs?\n\n121\n00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.320\nIt's no different.\n\n122\n00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.960\nSo what we have to do, first of all,\nis we have to mount the ISO.\n\n123\n00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.390\nAnd one of the great things that's been,\n\n124\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.900\nI believe the Windows 8.1\nbrought this in down.\n\n125\n00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.610\nI could be wrong, it could be Windows 7.\n\n126\n00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.760\nIs the ability to mount ISOs,\nnatively inside the operating system.\n\n127\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.660\nYou probably seen where there's\nother utilities out there,\n\n128\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.690\nright, that'll allow you to mount an ISO.\n\n129\n00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.640\nVirtual Clone Drive's one that's\nbeen around there for a long time.\n\n130\n00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.720\nWe have it right here, right now.\n\n131\n00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.790\nSo if I go ahead, and apparently I\ndidn't do that, if I mount that,\n\n132\n00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.090\nnow you're gonna see that MDOP,\nagain, is not just a single utility.\n\n133\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.960\nIt's got a lot of utilities in here the\nadvanced group policy management, App V,\n\n134\n00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.590\ndiagnostic and recovery tool kit, MBAM,\nMicrosoft bit locker, administration and\n\n135\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:11.640\nmonitoring, MED-V.\n\n136\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.830\nThis one's kind of gone by the wayside.\n\n137\n00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.810\nAnd then you have the user experience\nvirtualization technology.\n\n138\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.860\nThe one that we want is the App V\nright here, and that's just short for\n\n139\n00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.950\napplication virtualization.\n\n140\n00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.870\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ntake that whole entire folder,\n\n141\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.580\ngonna copy it to the desktop, all right.\n\n142\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.940\nNow once that's done, I really don't\nneed MDOP any more from this point.\n\n143\n00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.770\nSo if you're following along out there,\nand\n\n144\n00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.090\nthat'd be great,\nyou can just close that ISO down.\n\n145\n00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.040\nYou really don't need it\nafter you've got the App V.\n\n146\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.140\nNow, inside of App V,\n\n147\n00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.230\nthere's a couple of different type\nways that you can set this up.\n\n148\n00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.919\nAnd it's interesting,\ncuz Dan and I were just talking\n\n149\n00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:50.894\nabout this prior to the show starting,\nis the fact that you could do what's known\n\n150\n00:07:50.894 --> 00:07:55.104\nas a full-blown App V deployment, which\nhas publishing servers and databases, and\n\n151\n00:07:55.104 --> 00:07:58.143\nyou can do click to run and\nyou can stream these applications,\n\n152\n00:07:58.143 --> 00:08:01.456\nthese virtualized applications\nout to your computers on the fly.\n\n153\n00:08:01.456 --> 00:08:02.013\nRight?\n\n154\n00:08:02.013 --> 00:08:04.317\nWell, we've got Office365 today.\n\n155\n00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:08.520\nWe've got things like Azure Remote App\nwhich in this series we'll be looking at.\n\n156\n00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.440\nSo, that type of deployment\n[INAUDIBLE] say obsolete but\n\n157\n00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.100\nyou get a lot more features\nin the Cloud today.\n\n158\n00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.430\nAnd a lot less hassle,\nby the way, on the user side.\n\n159\n00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.530\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna do the local deployment.\n\n160\n00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:25.470\nMaybe you've got a heavily managed\nenvironment and you're not allowed\n\n161\n00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.740\nin this testing environment to have\nInternet connectivity, all right?\n\n162\n00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.730\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n163\n00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.020\nAnd there's a couple of different\nversions you can see obviously here.\n\n164\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.330\nWe're gonna be working with App V 5.1.\n\n165\n00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.160\nThe latest and greatest if you\nwill from the App V series.\n\n166\n00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.430\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm just\ngonna navigate into that folder and\n\n167\n00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:45.482\nthere's a couple of different\nthings that we need.\n\n168\n00:08:45.482 --> 00:08:48.310\nAll right?\nWith these three folders that we see\n\n169\n00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.870\ninside of here,\nwe gotta grab this sequencer out and\n\n170\n00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.090\ninside of that folder you're gonna\nsee that there is the executable.\n\n171\n00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.150\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\npull this down to my desktop here.\n\n172\n00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.720\nAnd I'm gonna minimize that screen cuz\nwe will have to come back to that again,\n\n173\n00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.560\nwhen we decide to run these applications.\n\n174\n00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.480\nWe're gonna have to use that client\nfolder, there's an executable in there,\n\n175\n00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.890\nbut we'll come back to\nthat in a second here.\n\n176\n00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:12.590\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna install the App V Sequencer.\n\n177\n00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.610\nPretty straightforward process on this.\n\n178\n00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.780\nIt's got an install button.\n\n179\n00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.330\nI will say that there are some\nprerequisites that you should\n\n180\n00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:23.310\nknow beforehand just on, what type\nof operating system you have about\n\n181\n00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.970\nthe apps that you're sequencing so you\ncan always look at this information too.\n\n182\n00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.990\n>> What does that mean when they say,\nI mean, what is the App V Sequencer?\n\n183\n00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.370\nWhat do they mean by sequencer?\n\n184\n00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.150\n>> Very good.\nSo\n\n185\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.160\nwhat happens every time you\ninstall an application?\n\n186\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.950\nLet's take the App V Sequencer and just,\n\n187\n00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.510\nwe're gonna not even worry\nabout it here right now, right?\n\n188\n00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:44.660\nAny time I install an application,\nlike we just did with NotePad ++, right?\n\n189\n00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.550\nWhat happens is that you have\nthe Windows Installer service and\n\n190\n00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.130\nyou have an MSI package, right?\n\n191\n00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.680\nIt's a packaged app.\n\n192\n00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.080\nIt's not just an executable,\nit has things like INI files, or\n\n193\n00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.730\nINF files if you will that tells\nthe installer right to the registry here,\n\n194\n00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.770\nset this key here, modify this,\nput a temporary file here.\n\n195\n00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.310\nAnd then once you're done,\nclean out that temporary folder and\n\n196\n00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.460\nclean up those files, right?\n\n197\n00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.560\nAll of these things that it goes through.\n\n198\n00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.920\nIt's a sequence, it's a sequence of steps\nthat every application goes through\n\n199\n00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.490\nin order to install itself.\n\n200\n00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.500\nSo what this is doing is\nthink about it this way.\n\n201\n00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.770\nThis is putting a magnifying\nglass on that process as\n\n202\n00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.228\nthe same time it's putting\na recorder on that process.\n\n203\n00:10:22.228 --> 00:10:25.930\nIt's saying I want to see\nwhat's being modified and\n\n204\n00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:30.960\nI will capture those steps so\nthat when we go to install this in\n\n205\n00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.900\nthis virtualized session, it acts like\nit's native, like it's no different.\n\n206\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.210\nSo the sequencer, to answer your\nquestion directly there Dan, it captures\n\n207\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:44.800\nthe sequence of steps that's involved in\ninstalling an application, and that's\n\n208\n00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.745\ngonna be important when we decide to run\nthe virtualized app on another computer.\n\n209\n00:10:49.745 --> 00:10:54.845\nIt is that sequencer will already\nhave all the steps built into this\n\n210\n00:10:54.845 --> 00:10:59.985\nvirtualized package for us, and we won't\nhave to worry about it anymore after that.\n\n211\n00:10:59.985 --> 00:11:01.885\n>> So kind of an important\nthing when it comes to MP.\n\n212\n00:11:01.885 --> 00:11:03.457\n>> It is really important thing,\nthat's it.\n\n213\n00:11:03.457 --> 00:11:04.381\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:08.180\n>> In fact, we're gonna see they're\ntwo most important concepts.\n\n215\n00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.920\nThe sequencer and\nthen what we install on the client,\n\n216\n00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.760\nand we'll see the client\ncoming up here in a bit.\n\n217\n00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.240\nSo we'll go ahead and\nchoose install on this.\n\n218\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.840\nAnd I'm gonna accept the EOA, and no\nDan I'm not reading it on this one either.\n\n219\n00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.620\nI probably just sold my car.\n\n220\n00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.930\nAnd we'll choose install.\n\n221\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.310\nThat one that I just kinda went\nthrough really quick, guys.\n\n222\n00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.850\nThat was the Customer\nImprovement Experience Program.\n\n223\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.110\nAnd if you wanna send\nthem your information,\n\n224\n00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.180\nyou can, I just opted out of it,\nand that's up to you.\n\n225\n00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.880\nNow, boy wasn't that just amazing.\n\n226\n00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.620\nWhat happened?\n\n227\n00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:43.000\nWell, it's an app that runs now\nnatively on my machine here.\n\n228\n00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.040\nSo if I decide to run this.\n\n229\n00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.999\nYou'll notice something,\nI didn't mention this either.\n\n230\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.270\nKeep in mind on the exam,\nstandard users can't run this.\n\n231\n00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.870\nAll right?\nThis is looking and\n\n232\n00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.670\nmonitoring things like your registering\nyour system files and stuff.\n\n233\n00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:01.430\nSo, for this to run, this is\nan administrative level application.\n\n234\n00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.850\nSo, do keep that in mind.\n\n235\n00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.830\nNow, we've got a couple of options here.\n\n236\n00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.670\nAll right?\n\n237\n00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.549\nOne of the options that we have\nis we could potentially create\n\n238\n00:12:09.549 --> 00:12:13.669\na new virtualization pack or\nwe can modify an existing package.\n\n239\n00:12:13.669 --> 00:12:14.640\nAll right.\n\n240\n00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.420\nNow if I've already created\na virtualized package and\n\n241\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.570\nthat application that I virtualized\ngoes through an update.\n\n242\n00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:21.140\nWell what do I do?\n\n243\n00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.470\nDo I create a completely\nnew virtualized package?\n\n244\n00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.150\nWell, you could.\n\n245\n00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.810\nYou absolutely could.\n\n246\n00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.010\nOr you can just upgrade\nan existing package.\n\n247\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:29.880\nWe're not gonna do that here.\n\n248\n00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.606\nAnd what we're gonna choose is create\na new app package [CROSSTALK].\n\n249\n00:12:33.606 --> 00:12:37.100\n>> Wes, I just thought of something.\n\n250\n00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.690\nWe actually have installed an application\n\n251\n00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.360\nthat allows an application to\nvirtualize an application.\n\n252\n00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.105\n>> That's right.\n\n253\n00:12:43.105 --> 00:12:46.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, talk about redundancy there,\n\n254\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:50.330\nI don't know how deep the rabbit hole goes\nand at a certain point by the end of this\n\n255\n00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.790\nepisode you might be saying why why\ndid I not just take the blue pill.\n\n256\n00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.960\nAnd I'm gonna kind of do this,\n\n257\n00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.612\nI should have had this prepared\nbefore hand I apologize.\n\n258\n00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:03.160\nI wanna make it a little easier for\nyou guys to see out there.\n\n259\n00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.670\nSo we've got a couple of different\ntypes of the way we can create\n\n260\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.950\npackages, all right?\n\n261\n00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:12.730\nIf I wanna automate this, and I want to\neither just have an automated package\n\n262\n00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.580\ncreation, I could use this\npacket accelerator down here.\n\n263\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.900\nAnd that's what it is,\nit automates this process for\n\n264\n00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.650\nyou if you've got a lot of\napplications that you're virtualizing.\n\n265\n00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.780\nWe're not gonna use this one.\n\n266\n00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.200\nWhat we want is just create a package,\nand notice what's happening,\n\n267\n00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.140\nthis is important for the exam.\n\n268\n00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.720\nBy installing an application\non this computer.\n\n269\n00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.540\nRemember Dan asked what the sequence or\ndo.\n\n270\n00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.850\nI have to install the application, and\n\n271\n00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.020\nit's gonna monitor\nthe installation process.\n\n272\n00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.630\nSo let's go ahead we'll move forward here.\n\n273\n00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.946\nNow here is something to keep in mind,\nall right.\n\n274\n00:13:44.946 --> 00:13:50.360\nThis is [LAUGH] a potential security\nrisk and let me show you why.\n\n275\n00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.560\nAll right, your technician computer,\n\n276\n00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.220\nthey do not recommend putting\non a production environment.\n\n277\n00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.940\nIn fact,\nnot even having network connectivity.\n\n278\n00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.250\nBecause, you don't want your\nantivirus software running\n\n279\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.800\nduring the sequencing of an application,\nif I can say that.\n\n280\n00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.180\nOr your antivirus or Defender.\n\n281\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.470\nServices can't even be running, okay?\n\n282\n00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.670\nNow I'm gonna tell you,\nI can turn the Defender service off,\n\n283\n00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.080\nbut it's gonna come back on after a while.\n\n284\n00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:22.130\nNow it's not gonna mess up our application\nvirtualization in this instance, but if\n\n285\n00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.270\nyou do have trouble with the virtualized\npackage, after you create it, you deploy\n\n286\n00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.340\nit, come back here and ensure that the\nWindows Defender Service wasn't turned on.\n\n287\n00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.380\nSo, let's see if we can remedy\nsome of these things here.\n\n288\n00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.190\nI got antivirus software running.\n\n289\n00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:40.270\nI'm gonna turn off the realtime\nprotection in Windows Defender.\n\n290\n00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.980\nAnd again, this would be one of these\nthings that you really shouldn't be doing\n\n291\n00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.980\nthis in a production environment with\na computer that's attached to the network.\n\n292\n00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.890\nAnd it's probably gonna turn it back on.\n\n293\n00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.440\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll go through this.\n\n294\n00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.170\nNow we've got a couple different types\nof applications we wanna create.\n\n295\n00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.260\nIf you got Excel, right,\nExcel has plugins and stuff like that.\n\n296\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.620\nMaybe I want to virtualize plugins,\nyou can do that.\n\n297\n00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.410\nMiddleware, too.\n\n298\n00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.240\nWe're not gonna do that here.\n\n299\n00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.500\nWe're gonna do a standard,\ndefault application.\n\n300\n00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.810\nAnd we're gonna choose next.\n\n301\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.030\nNow this is important.\n\n302\n00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.230\nThe next step here, it's gonna say well,\nwhere's that installer?\n\n303\n00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.110\nWhere's the installer package\nat that I need to monitor?\n\n304\n00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.799\nSo we're gonna browse, and\nit's right here on the desktop.\n\n305\n00:15:21.799 --> 00:15:26.034\nAnd I'm gonna do 6.9.1,\nand I'm gonna choose Open.\n\n306\n00:15:26.034 --> 00:15:28.826\nAnd then we're gonna do it next.\n\n307\n00:15:28.826 --> 00:15:35.055\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna name this whatever I want.\n\n308\n00:15:35.055 --> 00:15:38.410\nRight?\nSo I'm just gonna call it Notepad2.\n\n309\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.521\nI can just call it Notepad2 so\nI can identify it.\n\n310\n00:15:41.521 --> 00:15:44.623\nAnd you're naming convention\nwill be up to your company so\n\n311\n00:15:44.623 --> 00:15:48.548\ndefinitely pay attention to it because\nit will make it difficult to find or\n\n312\n00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:51.934\nhard to find if you don't have\na good naming convention there.\n\n313\n00:15:51.934 --> 00:15:57.036\nNow understand at this point All\nright it says you must complete\n\n314\n00:15:57.036 --> 00:16:01.540\nthe application installation\nbefore you continue.\n\n315\n00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.340\nRight now it's in kinda like a capture\nmode, it's saying go ahead and\n\n316\n00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.550\ndo the installer and\nI'm gonna monitor everything you're doing.\n\n317\n00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.510\nSo we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n318\n00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.860\nAnd we'll choose next just like we did in\nour, notice that the installation of this\n\n319\n00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.545\napplication is no different than it was\nbefore without the none in the mix,\n\n320\n00:16:16.545 --> 00:16:21.130\nnone in the loop, which is next, next,\nand just kinda next all the way through.\n\n321\n00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.980\nAnd we're gonna choose finish and\nit boots up.\n\n322\n00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.790\nNow once that application is started up,\nnow I can close it down.\n\n323\n00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.840\nNow, if I had additional files to run,\nI could hit this run button.\n\n324\n00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.830\nBut notice it says, it gives me an option,\nI've finished installing.\n\n325\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.594\nWell, let's go ahead and click that.\n\n326\n00:16:39.594 --> 00:16:42.276\nAnd we'll choose Next.\n\n327\n00:16:42.276 --> 00:16:42.856\nAll right.\n\n328\n00:16:42.856 --> 00:16:48.520\nSo it shows me the application, all right.\n\n329\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.129\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose Next.\n\n330\n00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.000\nAnd then it says that there are a few\nfiles excluded from the packet.\n\n331\n00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.570\nThis could be some temporary\nfiles in the background.\n\n332\n00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.490\nWhen an application installs, sometimes\nit puts temporary files in there.\n\n333\n00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.210\nAnd then the I and\n\n334\n00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:06.900\nI files that are inside the MSI\npackage say now clean those files out.\n\n335\n00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:11.430\nAll right, so it might of said well we\ndidn't put those temporary files in there.\n\n336\n00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:19.390\nIt is important again, to review your\nvirtualized app after you do install it.\n\n337\n00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.170\nAll right now,\nwe're gonna go head and say next,\n\n338\n00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.770\nstop now and\nwe're gonna create the package.\n\n339\n00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:29.026\nAnd now what it's doing Dan is it's\ncreating our virtualized application\n\n340\n00:17:29.026 --> 00:17:29.540\npackage.\n\n341\n00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:34.380\nAnd we're gonna hope and it gives me some\nthings that package can completed again.\n\n342\n00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.810\nKeep in mind guys that you want\nto try your best to insure\n\n343\n00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.880\nthat those warnings, the configurations\nof your computer are appropriate.\n\n344\n00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.870\nI really don't wanna turn my anti\nvirus software off to do this and\n\n345\n00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.640\nwe're gonna hope that it runs okay.\n\n346\n00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.540\nNow the sequencer,\nwe sequenced an app all right?\n\n347\n00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.840\nSo let's kind of jump back and\n\n348\n00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.570\nrecap what we did because they could\nask you these steps on the exam.\n\n349\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.484\nSo remember, you obtained MDOP, right?\n\n350\n00:17:59.484 --> 00:18:02.565\nYou've taken app V Out,\nyou've looked in the sequencer folder,\n\n351\n00:18:02.565 --> 00:18:04.920\nyou pulled down the sequence app.\n\n352\n00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.520\nAll right?\nYou've installed the sequencer.\n\n353\n00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.010\nAnd then once that's done you've got\nyour business software that you wanna\n\n354\n00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.870\nvirtualize and what your gonna\ndo is your gonna sequence that.\n\n355\n00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:15.550\nRight?\nYour gonna install it and\n\n356\n00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.820\nit's gonna monitor and\ncapture all of that for you.\n\n357\n00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:23.240\n>> Now that we've got our first\nsequence programmer or application.\n\n358\n00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.180\nWhat do we do with it?\n\n359\n00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.260\n>> Yeah, very good.\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n360\n00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.410\nI'm going to do a couple of things here,\nDan.\n\n361\n00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.450\nAnd one of the things I wanna talk about,\nwe've got to install our old application.\n\n362\n00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.050\nRemember, our scenario is that we have\nthe old application already installed.\n\n363\n00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.309\nSo let me go ahead real quick, and\nlet me run through that installer here.\n\n364\n00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.058\nAnd I do wanna talk\nbriefly about the files,\n\n365\n00:18:44.058 --> 00:18:48.835\nthe type of files that you will\nfind inside about v, just so\n\n366\n00:18:48.835 --> 00:18:54.025\nif they ask you okay what are these\nfiles that we have to look at?\n\n367\n00:18:54.025 --> 00:18:57.050\nOr if they ask you about them on the exam,\nyou will be prepared.\n\n368\n00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.910\nSo let me go ahead and\njust run through this installer here.\n\n369\n00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:00.750\nLet it finish.\n\n370\n00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.690\nAnd then we'll close that down, and\nverify with me too Dan, we are on the,\n\n371\n00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.730\nI know it's kinda hard to see there,\n6.8.3.\n\n372\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.820\nThat's installed locally now.\n\n373\n00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.100\nThat's what I've got.\n\n374\n00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.240\nThat's not a virtualized app,\nthat's the old version of the app.\n\n375\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.010\n>> I concur.\n\n376\n00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:15.940\n>> Okay, just making sure.\n\n377\n00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.370\nMaking sure there's no hidden cards\nup your sleeve or anything like that.\n\n378\n00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:25.280\nBut I do wanna spend just a second here\nand I wanna talk about these files.\n\n379\n00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.720\nAgain, Microsoft on their exams,\nthey're notorious for asking you,\n\n380\n00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.760\nyou need to do such and such on the exam,\nwhat file do you need to do whatever with.\n\n381\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.900\nAnd then you have to figure out,\nokay which one do I have.\n\n382\n00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.620\nSo the MSI file,\nthat is the installer file that\n\n383\n00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.520\nis going to be used to virtualize\nthe application for us.\n\n384\n00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.618\nYou notice NotePad2.msi.\n\n385\n00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:50.630\nThe appv that's just above it,\nthat's the virtualization package.\n\n386\n00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.871\nVirtual application file,\nthat's the .appv there.\n\n387\n00:19:56.871 --> 00:20:00.861\nGot a couple of the ones, anytime you see\nxml, Dan I'm sure you're aware of this by\n\n388\n00:20:00.861 --> 00:20:04.742\nnow being around Windows, that's usually\nconfiguration information right?\n\n389\n00:20:04.742 --> 00:20:08.070\nMost things in Windows today\nare configured through XML.\n\n390\n00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.120\nSo we've got a couple of\ndifferent XML documents.\n\n391\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.940\nDeployment Configuration, this tells\nif you're going to let's say push\n\n392\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.476\nthis MSI file out, like maybe group policy\ndeployment, it defines how it's deployed.\n\n393\n00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:20.486\nAll right.\n\n394\n00:20:20.486 --> 00:20:24.053\nThe NotePad2_UserConfig.xml,\n\n395\n00:20:24.053 --> 00:20:28.312\nthat says how is it supposed to run,\nright?\n\n396\n00:20:28.312 --> 00:20:30.171\nSo the first one is how do you deploy it?\n\n397\n00:20:30.171 --> 00:20:31.228\nHow is it deployed it?\n\n398\n00:20:31.228 --> 00:20:32.713\nIs there instruction on how to deploy it?\n\n399\n00:20:32.713 --> 00:20:39.080\nThe second one there instructs on lets\nus know how it's supposed to run.\n\n400\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.400\nNow the last one is the report.xml file,\n\n401\n00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.910\nif you notice some of errors that\nwere populated on the screen after\n\n402\n00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:51.210\nwe virtualized the app well, those errors\nare gonna make it in this report file.\n\n403\n00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.750\nIf it found errors during the installation\nthat we didn't necessarily see in\n\n404\n00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.380\nthe graphical user interface,\nit's gonna write those in there, too.\n\n405\n00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.990\nSo if you're troubleshooting\nafter the fact.\n\n406\n00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.789\nYou need to figure out what happened and\ndid it done virtualize correctly?\n\n407\n00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.250\nPort.xml, that's where it's at.\n\n408\n00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.150\nThat's where you wanna look.\n\n409\n00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.500\nSo that's what we wanna do.\n\n410\n00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.700\nNow, Dan, I think we,\n\n411\n00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:17.980\nit's about time maybe to put this to\nthe test and see if it actually works now.\n\n412\n00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.830\nAll right, remember,\nwe've got the older app is installed.\n\n413\n00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:24.408\nIn fact, if I, I come down here and\nI do Notepad++,\n\n414\n00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:29.595\nthere it is right there, and it opens and\nwe've already looked at it, then.\n\n415\n00:21:29.595 --> 00:21:32.774\nIt's got my back on that, 6.8.3.\n\n416\n00:21:32.774 --> 00:21:37.500\nBut now, what happens if we decide\nwe wanna run this msi file?\n\n417\n00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.870\nAll right,\nwell here is the other piece of the pie.\n\n418\n00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:42.800\nOkay.\n\n419\n00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.150\nThe app sequencer doesn't\nallow you to run the app.\n\n420\n00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:51.820\nIt is the client side,\nthe virtualization client that runs that.\n\n421\n00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.160\nAnd that's where we go\nback to our app B folder.\n\n422\n00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.710\nRemember we said we're gonna go\nback to the client side of this?\n\n423\n00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.090\nNow understand that this is gonna\nbecome the target computer.\n\n424\n00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:03.110\nSo the purposes of this demonstration,\nthis is the technician's computer and\n\n425\n00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.200\nthe target computer.\n\n426\n00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.650\nLet me say that one more time,\njust so you realize.\n\n427\n00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.730\nBoth of these computers are on\nthe same machine right now, typically,\n\n428\n00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.830\nthat's probably not what's gonna\nhappen in a production environment.\n\n429\n00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:15.806\nSo, let's go ahead,\nlet's go back into our App V.\n\n430\n00:22:15.806 --> 00:22:19.161\n>> It's normal that you have\na server-client type of set up where as\n\n431\n00:22:19.161 --> 00:22:21.660\nthe server, which isn't your computer.\n\n432\n00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:25.350\nYours is typically the client computer\nis gonna reach out for the server.\n\n433\n00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.510\n>> Yeah.\nAnd for the exam purposes,\n\n434\n00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.620\ngood question by the way,\nthey call those target computers.\n\n435\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.020\nYou have your technician computer\nwhere you're sequencing your apps and\n\n436\n00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.770\nthen you have your target\ncomputer which targets to deploy.\n\n437\n00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:39.508\nSo, just like you would like OS deployment\ntoo, they call them target computers.\n\n438\n00:22:39.508 --> 00:22:43.150\n>> Now, we're gonna go back into App V,\nwe're gonna go back into client,\n\n439\n00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.520\nand there's a couple of different things.\n\n440\n00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.890\nIf you're using remote desktop services,\nthat's where the second executable is.\n\n441\n00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.630\nAll I want is the client one.\n\n442\n00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:51.230\nAnd I'm gonna pull that\ndown of the desktop.\n\n443\n00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.379\nAnd we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna install this.\n\n444\n00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.630\nAll right, and\nmy third EULA that I signed today and\n\n445\n00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.047\nhaven't read, who knows if you'll\nsee me here tomorrow or not.\n\n446\n00:23:03.047 --> 00:23:04.540\n[LAUGH]\n>> Les is signing his life away.\n\n447\n00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.710\n>> That's right, and\nwe're gonna install this.\n\n448\n00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:11.890\nAnd notice again, it does take at least,\nat least membership of the local\n\n449\n00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.680\nadministrators group, that's another\none that likes to come up on the exam.\n\n450\n00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:19.760\nA lot of times, they'll give you\na question that says choose two answers.\n\n451\n00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.490\nEach answer represents\na complete solution.\n\n452\n00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.130\nWell, you're gonna have to know,\nsequence the app.\n\n453\n00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.490\nYou're gonna have to know things like, for\ninstance, have the client virtualization\n\n454\n00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:35.180\ninstalled, and both processes require an\naccount in the local administrator group.\n\n455\n00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:39.860\nSo now we've got our App V\nclient set up ready to go.\n\n456\n00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.990\nThen what do you say we\nrerun that MSI file?\n\n457\n00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.980\n>> Turn the key and hit the gas.\n\n458\n00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.122\n>> Let's do it, all right.\n\n459\n00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:47.160\nAll right so now, again we got\nthe user account control coming up.\n\n460\n00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.801\nAnd notice it's not warning me, right.\n\n461\n00:23:48.801 --> 00:23:50.281\nIt's not warning me any more.\n\n462\n00:23:50.281 --> 00:23:54.367\nAnd we're going through hopefully\nwhat we will see as an install.\n\n463\n00:23:54.367 --> 00:23:55.969\nOr did it?\n\n464\n00:23:55.969 --> 00:23:57.850\nWell, I don't know.\n\n465\n00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.930\nIt's not installing locally.\n\n466\n00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.970\nAnd that's the beauty of this software.\n\n467\n00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:04.120\nIt's not installing locally.\n\n468\n00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.850\nIt's the virtualized client that\nis communicating with the app.\n\n469\n00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:11.340\nSo just like any virtualization technology\nright, we got a hypervisor that's talking\n\n470\n00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.610\ndown to our operating system,\nor our hardware, excuse me.\n\n471\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:16.670\nSo this is a really good thing\nin the security purpose.\n\n472\n00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.010\nIf you want to test an application and\n\n473\n00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.470\nyou're not really sure if\nthe application itself is secure.\n\n474\n00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.528\nWell, guess what,\nyou run it on Hyper-V, not Hyper-V, or\n\n475\n00:24:22.528 --> 00:24:24.410\nHyper-V would be an option too.\n\n476\n00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.290\nYou run it inside an ADV and\nit isolates it from your hardware, so\n\n477\n00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:30.240\nanother maybe usage scenario for this.\n\n478\n00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.870\n>> Is that a danger for the, well I guess,\nnot the target, the technician's computer.\n\n479\n00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.030\nSo the danger for their computer.\n\n480\n00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:37.708\n>> No.\nNo,\n\n481\n00:24:37.708 --> 00:24:39.490\nI wouldn't say you have to worry about it.\n\n482\n00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:42.280\nThe only danger that, like we've\nmentioned with the technician's computer,\n\n483\n00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.625\nis the fact that they say disable all your\nvirus software in Windows Defender so\n\n484\n00:24:46.625 --> 00:24:48.709\nit in of itself is a danger.\n\n485\n00:24:48.709 --> 00:24:49.269\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n486\n00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:50.735\n>> So we're gonna go ahead and\n\n487\n00:24:50.735 --> 00:24:54.745\nscroll down here and\nI should see a folder in here that doesn't\n\n488\n00:24:54.745 --> 00:24:59.145\nquite have all these nice pretty icons\nlike the application developer would have.\n\n489\n00:24:59.145 --> 00:25:01.995\nAnd here I have a Notepad++ folder and\n\n490\n00:25:01.995 --> 00:25:06.220\nif I launch this well, it doesn't\nlook like it really did much, right?\n\n491\n00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.150\nIt looks like it just [CROSSTALK].\n\n492\n00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.210\nYes, so what've we done here?\n\n493\n00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.820\nHere's where the magic happens, all right.\n\n494\n00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.150\nAnd this is one of the things,\nnotice I have two instances, right?\n\n495\n00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.092\nWell, you might say, well,\nWes that's easy, I do that all the time.\n\n496\n00:25:19.092 --> 00:25:21.890\nI've got five notepads\ncurrently open on my machine,\n\n497\n00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:23.740\nwhat did you do that's any different.\n\n498\n00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:28.390\nWell, here's something to notice,\nnotice the Notepad++\n\n499\n00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:32.990\nversion here is 6.8.3,\nthe one we verified earlier.\n\n500\n00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:37.705\nAnd then if I decide to look\nat the Notepad++ over here,\n\n501\n00:25:37.705 --> 00:25:41.360\nI'm also running 6.9.1, all right?\n\n502\n00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.450\nBut let's not stop there, right?\n\n503\n00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:46.440\nBecause there could be some magic\ntricks going on right here and\n\n504\n00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.070\nyou guys aren't aware of it.\n\n505\n00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:52.590\nWhere the true test comes in,\nremember when we went down to Programs and\n\n506\n00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.510\nFeatures and we looked at\nthe version that it sees here?\n\n507\n00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.450\nI wanna show you something\nthat's kind of interesting.\n\n508\n00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.050\nAnd it's nice, too, Dan,\nbecause these are right side by side.\n\n509\n00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:03.890\nAll right, notice my Notepad++ here?\n\n510\n00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.196\nThat's the one we looked at earlier,\nright?\n\n511\n00:26:07.196 --> 00:26:12.020\nAnd it's Notepad++ team is the endorser or\nthe author if you will.\n\n512\n00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.769\nNotice it says 6.8.3.\n\n513\n00:26:16.769 --> 00:26:19.809\nSo even though I'm running\n6.9.1 on my machine,\n\n514\n00:26:19.809 --> 00:26:23.530\nwell I don't see that on the list,\nwhere'd it go?\n\n515\n00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:27.809\nWell that's because HypeV,\nthe application virtualization.\n\n516\n00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:33.105\nIt's virtualizing this, so\neven though I see my executable here,\n\n517\n00:26:33.105 --> 00:26:38.110\nit's running 6.9.1,\nit's the Microsoft Corporation.\n\n518\n00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:41.601\nBecause what's actually reporting to\nthe operating system right now is App-V,\n\n519\n00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:43.680\nnot Notepad++, and\n\n520\n00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.840\nthen if I look at a versioning\nnumber here I can see it says 1.0.\n\n521\n00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.030\nAnd now that is more of\nan internal number for you.\n\n522\n00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:55.060\nIf you had to update the package,\nlike we said updating an existing package,\n\n523\n00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.450\nyou might call it 1.1, so\nthat's for your own good.\n\n524\n00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:04.100\nBut there you go, now we get the ability\nto run these side by side, and if we're\n\n525\n00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.970\nin a production environment where we have\ntwo different versions of an application.\n\n526\n00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:10.150\nWe've got an old one already existing,\nwe wanna be able to keep that one for\n\n527\n00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:13.190\nourselves until we can\ntest the newer version.\n\n528\n00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:14.890\nWell, we can test it now side by side,\n\n529\n00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.460\nwe get the coexistence between two\napplications that otherwise would have\n\n530\n00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.270\nover written themselves to the new one and\nwe wouldn't be able to test them.\n\n531\n00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.600\n>> That's pretty cool stuff Wes.\n\n532\n00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.420\nNow we've walked through a lot of how to\nget this thing installed, configured, and\n\n533\n00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.360\nactually running\na virtualized application but\n\n534\n00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.270\nI assume you have a little bit\nmore that you want to talk about.\n\n535\n00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.540\nBut I'm looking at the clock and\nthe clock has definitely ticked away,\n\n536\n00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.360\na few minutes ago actually, so looks like\nwe'll have to do a part two on this.\n\n537\n00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.300\n>> Well, you know, I think if we\nran just a couple minutes longer.\n\n538\n00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.370\nI do want to talk about\nsome of the benefits and\n\n539\n00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:47.860\nthe cost of the application itself.\n\n540\n00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.300\nI really don't think it\nwould take too long.\n\n541\n00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.070\n>> All right.\n\n542\n00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:52.040\n>> If that's okay.\n\n543\n00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.020\n>> By all means.\n\n544\n00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.840\nIf it's just a few minutes,\nwe can go over just a couple.\n\n545\n00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.930\n>> Yeah, yeah it's gonna be\njust a couple of minutes here.\n\n546\n00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.110\nSo what are the benefits\nof the application, or\n\n547\n00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.550\napplication virtualization?\n\n548\n00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.180\nAll right, the benefits of\nthe application virtualization is\n\n549\n00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.330\nisolation from the OS, right?\n\n550\n00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:08.640\nIf security is my concern,\nI want a protected platform.\n\n551\n00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.710\nThat's one of the things\nthat helps it out as well.\n\n552\n00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.096\nYou might have to spin up a VM, right.\n\n553\n00:28:16.096 --> 00:28:18.730\nWe can use Hyper-V but\nHyper-V, do you really need to\n\n554\n00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:22.310\nuse an entire virtual machine and all the\nresources that a virtual machine consumes?\n\n555\n00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.960\nWhen you can just virtualize\nthe application and\n\n556\n00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.460\nit's more of a process that's virtualized.\n\n557\n00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:31.310\nSaving some of your resources.\n\n558\n00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.770\nAll right.\nApplication coexistence is another one of\n\n559\n00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:34.780\nthose benefits.\n\n560\n00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.100\nNow what's some of the drawbacks here?\n\n561\n00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.070\nI want you to remember this for the exam.\n\n562\n00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.440\nIt runs locally.\n\n563\n00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.430\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\n564\n00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:46.410\nIt means that the device,\nthe computer that you run this on\n\n565\n00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:50.420\nhas to meet the minimum requirements\nto run the application, all right.\n\n566\n00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.790\nSo that is one of the drawbacks.\n\n567\n00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:55.020\nIf you have an application that\nyou want to test in the platform,\n\n568\n00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.970\nvirtualized or not that you don't run\nit on, or that you run it on doesn't\n\n569\n00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.930\nmeet those minimum requirements,\nwell then guess what?\n\n570\n00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.910\nYou're not gonna be able to run it.\n\n571\n00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:07.520\nSo it runs locally,\nuses local resources and again,\n\n572\n00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.720\nthe application itself must meet\nthose minimum requirements.\n\n573\n00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.460\n>> That was it?\n\n574\n00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:11.980\n>> That was it.\n\n575\n00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.030\nThat was it.\nJust a couple of extra things that\n\n576\n00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:16.860\nI wanted to throw in there and I wanted\nto make sure that you understood just so\n\n577\n00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:17.950\nyou know some of the benefits.\n\n578\n00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:21.140\nNow, we're going to be talking\nabout more application coexistence\n\n579\n00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.230\nlater on in the series.\n\n580\n00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.770\nSo, we definitely have more to come.\n\n581\n00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:24.670\n>> All right.\nWell, awesome.\n\n582\n00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:25.720\nWell, thank you for stopping by.\n\n583\n00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:30.060\nSo to set up work with App-V Support that\nis something we might have to actually do\n\n584\n00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.900\nas a technician from any\nMicrosoft shop anyway.\n\n585\n00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.120\nThat being said we thank you for\ndropping by.\n\n586\n00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.360\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n587\n00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.440\nWe are gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n588\n00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:43.429\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery and\nI'm Wes Bryan.\n\n589\n00:29:43.429 --> 00:29:48.070\nWe'll see you next time.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.190\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n4\n00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.000\nHere with me today.\n\n5\n00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.980\nWell, you guessed it.\n\n6\n00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.900\nIt's Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.840\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n8\n00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.880\n>> It's going great, Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.690\nExcited to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.320\nWe got our Windows 10 content rolling out.\n\n11\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.290\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be taking\na look at ways we can protect our system\n\n12\n00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.070\nin the event of failure because we\nall know it's not a matter of if,\n\n13\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.990\nit's pretty much a matter of when, right?\n\n14\n00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.490\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.910\nThose computer systems,\nafter a while they tend to stop doing\n\n16\n00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.890\nwhatever it is we want them to do and\nstart playing by their own rules.\n\n17\n00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.130\nWhen that happens,\nit's time to whip them back into shape,\n\n18\n00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.630\nget them back into the way\nwe need them to operate.\n\n19\n00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.710\nAnd there's a couple of ways\nthat we have to do that.\n\n20\n00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.140\nMicrosoft has done a great job of\ngiving us a few tools that are ready so\n\n21\n00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.200\nthat when these operating\nsystems get out of hand,\n\n22\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.120\nthey get out of wack a little bit,\nwe can reign them back in.\n\n23\n00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.080\nPull them back into a good\noperating standard and\n\n24\n00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.300\nthat's what we're looking for.\n\n25\n00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.890\nNow Mike,\nwhere are we gonna start with today?\n\n26\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.210\nWhere, what's one of the great\ntools that they've given us?\n\n27\n00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.020\nLet's start with the system recovery or\n\n28\n00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.980\ncreating a recovery drive is really\nwhat the option is about and\n\n29\n00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.140\nthis is going to protect me in the even\nthat I can't boot my system, right?\n\n30\n00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.380\nCan't successfully boot,\nget into the operating system so\n\n31\n00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.980\nthat I can fix something,\nI'm stuck, right?\n\n32\n00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.540\nIf I can't boot, I can't login,\nhow do I go about fixing it?\n\n33\n00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.310\nWell, that's when we\nuse our recovery drive.\n\n34\n00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.580\nNow this is an option that you have\nto be a little bit proactive with.\n\n35\n00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.000\nThis is something you have to create\nwhile your systems still working,\n\n36\n00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.620\nwhile everything's running the way it\nshould, and then you save that, and in\n\n37\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.830\nthe future, if you can't boot, we can boot\nto this recovery drive that we've created.\n\n38\n00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.940\nAnd it's very similar to a lot of these\nsystems that you get nowadays will have\n\n39\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.740\na recovery partition on them.\n\n40\n00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.940\nAnd depending on the manufacturer,\nyou can boot into their recovery mode.\n\n41\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.590\nIt's basically the same thing.\n\n42\n00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.900\nIn fact, you're gonna see when we create\nthis, actually I don't think we'll see it.\n\n43\n00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.960\nBut I'll let you know.\n\n44\n00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.180\nWhen you create it, at the end of it,\n\n45\n00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.870\nif your system does have one of those\nrecovery partitions, Windows will actually\n\n46\n00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.020\nask you if you want to remove it\nbecause you could free up that space.\n\n47\n00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.552\nYou really don't need it anymore.\n\n48\n00:02:11.552 --> 00:02:16.480\nYou now have all of your recovery\ninformation stored on an external drive so\n\n49\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.380\nI can use that disk space for\nsomething else.\n\n50\n00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.560\nSo let's see how we go about\nmaking it in Windows 10.\n\n51\n00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.470\nAnd I'm going to pull up my screen\non my Windows machine here.\n\n52\n00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.840\nAnd I'm simply going to search for\ncreate recovery drive.\n\n53\n00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.540\nIt helps if you spell it correctly,\nand there she is.\n\n54\n00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.360\nI'll go ahead and click on it, and\nsay yes, I want to allow this to happen.\n\n55\n00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.230\nAnd it's going to start this wizard.\n\n56\n00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.650\nAnd this wizard is going to\nwalk me through the process\n\n57\n00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.360\nof creating a recovery drive.\n\n58\n00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.740\nNow on this first screen there's not\na lot of decisions to make here.\n\n59\n00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.370\nThe only one I really have to think about\nis do I want to back up the system files?\n\n60\n00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.480\nAll right?\nIf I don't backup the system files,\n\n61\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.270\nthen I'm going to be reinstalling\nWindows 10 on my own.\n\n62\n00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.140\nI'm going to need different\nmedia to reinstall.\n\n63\n00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.363\nSo I need my original ISO or source\nfiles that I used to install Windows 10.\n\n64\n00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:12.330\nThe only thing the recovery drive will\nhave is my settings and my files.\n\n65\n00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.170\nAnd we'll be able to put that back\nonto a fresh install of Windows 10.\n\n66\n00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.410\nIf you choose to include the system files\n\n67\n00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.260\nthen you don't need any\nadditional recovery media.\n\n68\n00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.740\nEverything you need to reinstall\nthe operating system, input your files and\n\n69\n00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.670\nsettings back,\nis going to be on that external drive.\n\n70\n00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.380\nSo I've got a little thumb\ndrive plugged in here.\n\n71\n00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.470\nI'm going to start it up, we're not\ngoing to- actually I could do it.\n\n72\n00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.530\nI'll tell you what I'll do.\n\n73\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.080\nIf you choose to do the system files,\nit will take a good amount of time.\n\n74\n00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.190\nAt least ten minutes,\nif not longer to run through that.\n\n75\n00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.078\nCuz it's got a lot of files that it has\nto copy over to that removable media.\n\n76\n00:03:48.078 --> 00:03:51.698\nAnd then it's going to depend on\nthe right speeds of that removable media.\n\n77\n00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:55.976\nI've got a USB 3 in here and I want to\nsay it took me at least 15 minutes and\n\n78\n00:03:55.976 --> 00:03:59.288\nthat's pretty good write speeds\nright with that USB 3 so\n\n79\n00:03:59.288 --> 00:04:02.669\nyou get an idea of much it's\nactually copying over there,\n\n80\n00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.127\nbasically everything it needs\nto reinstall Windows 10.\n\n81\n00:04:06.127 --> 00:04:08.570\nI would say you absolutely\nwant to do that, right?\n\n82\n00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.860\nI don't want to have to go\ndig out my Windows 10 ISO, or\n\n83\n00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.210\nwhatever the heck that is.\n\n84\n00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.880\nI want everything I need\nto recover the system\n\n85\n00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.610\nright here on this USB thumb drive, right?\n\n86\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.609\nBut for this example, I'm gonna uncheck\nthat, because it'll go much faster\n\n87\n00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.320\ncuz this is a virtual machine that\ndoes not have a lot of data files or\n\n88\n00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.910\nsettings on it.\n\n89\n00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.240\nSo I'll uncheck that but\n\n90\n00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.610\nunderstand in the real world most likely\nyou're gonna wanna leave that checked.\n\n91\n00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.150\nAnd then I'm gonna click next and\nit's gonna look and\n\n92\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.950\nsee, what I've got on my system,\nwhat it's gonna need to do.\n\n93\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.520\nAnd now you can see because I'm not doing\nthe operating system 512 megabytes is\n\n94\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.660\nreally all I need.\n\n95\n00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.740\nThat's what it's telling me.\n\n96\n00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.350\nIf I had more files and stuff it\nmight tell me I need a little more.\n\n97\n00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.690\nIf you do choose to do the-\nin fact let's go back.\n\n98\n00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.070\nIt will still take a little while\neven just to scan the system.\n\n99\n00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.580\nIt's going to tell me\nI need at least 4 gigs\n\n100\n00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.860\nif I choose to include those system files.\n\n101\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.650\nIt shows me that I have available drive.\n\n102\n00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.270\nI've already got my thumb drive plugged\nin there, so it found it and it says hey,\n\n103\n00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.550\nthat'd be a good drive to use.\n\n104\n00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.920\nDo you want to use that one?\n\n105\n00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.050\nMake sure you pick the right one because\nas we go through this it's gonna warn me,\n\n106\n00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.080\neverything is gonna be wiped\noff of that existing drive.\n\n107\n00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.600\nSo the thumb drive I've got,\n\n108\n00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.010\nif there was any data on there already,\nI would lose that data.\n\n109\n00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.390\nIt's gonna format the drive and\nstart this process.\n\n110\n00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.650\nI'll go ahead and click create, and\n\n111\n00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.805\nit's going to go through\nthe process of preparing the drive,\n\n112\n00:05:30.805 --> 00:05:35.010\nformatting the drive, and\ncreating the drive, and really that's it.\n\n113\n00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.790\nWhen it gets to the end, when this\nfinishes it's just going to say I figured\n\n114\n00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.020\nyour recovery drive is finished, and\nyou click close, and you're good to go.\n\n115\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.730\nNow you take that thumb drive and\nyou put it somewhere safe.\n\n116\n00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.870\nSomewhere you can find it in the future\nbecause I know that's what I always do.\n\n117\n00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.350\nI create it and I throw it, and\nwhere the heck did I put it.\n\n118\n00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.970\nWhen I need it,\nthat's when I can't find it.\n\n119\n00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.380\nIn fact, there we go.\n\n120\n00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.610\nThe drive is ready.\n\n121\n00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.410\nIt didn't ask me if I wanted to remove\nmy recovery partition on my hard drive\n\n122\n00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.300\nbecause I don't have a recovery\npartition on this install.\n\n123\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.900\nIf you did, like it was from Dell or\nHP, again, it would ask you,\n\n124\n00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.130\nhey, do want me to go ahead and remove\nthat because you don't need it anymore.\n\n125\n00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.280\nAnd that can free up some disk space for\nyou, right?\n\n126\n00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.370\nAnd I click Finish, and that's it.\n\n127\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.570\nNow if we go look at that drive at this\npoint, not gonna be a whole lot on it.\n\n128\n00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.820\nThere you can see, there's really nothing.\n\n129\n00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.600\nLike I said, this is a pretty\nclean install of Windows, and\n\n130\n00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.180\nI didn't choose to include\nthe system files themselves.\n\n131\n00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.070\nHad I done that,\nall these folders would be full.\n\n132\n00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.540\nAll the files we need to\nactually install Windows.\n\n133\n00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.410\nSo now if I ever have a problem booting\nthis system, I can boot to the USB.\n\n134\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.630\nAnd it'll start launching\nthe recovery process and\n\n135\n00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.570\nask me if I want to reset my machine.\n\n136\n00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.890\nAnd it'll go about the process\nof reinstalling Windows and\n\n137\n00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.900\nputting my files and settings back.\n\n138\n00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.920\nAnd that's it.\nSo\n\n139\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.180\nnow I've got a way to where if something\nhappens and I can't boot this machine,\n\n140\n00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.730\nI can recover and I don't have to just\nstart from scratch and reinstall.\n\n141\n00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.120\n>> That's a very, very nice option.\n\n142\n00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.400\nActually, a super nice option because, a\nlot of times that's exactly what happens.\n\n143\n00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.920\nSystem files get corrupted at the part\nwhere you can't even boot the system.\n\n144\n00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.160\nAnd so, what do you do?\n\n145\n00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.760\nIf you have this recovery option,\nyou copy those system files over.\n\n146\n00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.130\nYou can boot to that, and it says,\noh, I've got good system files here.\n\n147\n00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.760\nThey go with this machine.\n\n148\n00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.790\nNow, obviously,\nwe need to launch a recovery wizard,\n\n149\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.610\ncuz you're not booting to this for\nthe fun of it.\n\n150\n00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.610\nYou're probably having an issue,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n151\n00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.790\nstart recovering those files for\nyou so you can get back in action.\n\n152\n00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.195\nIt's a very good way to or\na nice preventative measure you can take,\n\n153\n00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:43.575\nshould I say, to keep that system humming\nand drumming the way you expect it to.\n\n154\n00:07:43.575 --> 00:07:46.869\nNow another system that we can use built\ninto the Windows operating system, and\n\n155\n00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:49.179\nthis has actually been around for\na little while now, so\n\n156\n00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:52.447\nif you've used Windows before you're\nprobably a little familiar with this.\n\n157\n00:07:52.447 --> 00:07:54.795\nAnd it's the idea of restore points.\n\n158\n00:07:54.795 --> 00:07:56.551\nI've used this a million times Mike.\n\n159\n00:07:56.551 --> 00:08:01.017\nIt has definitely kept my users\nout of the weeds a million times.\n\n160\n00:08:01.017 --> 00:08:04.814\n[LAUGH] And they called up and\nthey're like, this is completely bad,\n\n161\n00:08:04.814 --> 00:08:08.740\nI can't log in there is some crazy\nstuff going on I need your help.\n\n162\n00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.690\n>> Yeah it has saved me as\nwell several times when\n\n163\n00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.010\nfamily members have called me and said,\noh I don't know what I did to my computer.\n\n164\n00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.730\nWell, I don't either.\n\n165\n00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.700\nI don't know what you\ndid to your computer.\n\n166\n00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.430\nOh, can you help me fix it?\n\n167\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.860\nSure, let's do this.\n\n168\n00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.570\nAnd let's go see if you\ngot a restore point.\n\n169\n00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.830\nAnd as long as they got one, we'll pick\na date before the problem occurred.\n\n170\n00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.310\nWe roll it back, and\nthey're like, oh it's magic.\n\n171\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.170\nYou're so incredible.\n\n172\n00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.090\nNo, not really.\n\n173\n00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.160\nIt's part of Windows.\n\n174\n00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.810\nIt is what we should know.\n\n175\n00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.030\nWell we're going to teach you how to do.\n\n176\n00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.749\nSo a restore point is\njust like Daniel said,\n\n177\n00:08:39.749 --> 00:08:43.881\nit's just a point in time\nthat I can roll back to.\n\n178\n00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:46.597\nSo, let me show you where,\nfirst we're going to turn this on,\n\n179\n00:08:46.597 --> 00:08:48.200\nI'm going to open up File Explorer.\n\n180\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.220\nJust different ways you can get here,\nespecially in Windows 10.\n\n181\n00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.390\nThis is my personal\nfavorite way to get there.\n\n182\n00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.060\nJust gonna pull up the properties\nof this PC or my PC, and\n\n183\n00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:02.310\nthen I'm gonna go to my System Protection,\nwhich is on my System Properties.\n\n184\n00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.760\nSo any way that you can get\nto this screen would work.\n\n185\n00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.870\nAnd so on this System Protection tab,\n\n186\n00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.170\nthis is where I can work\nwith those restore points.\n\n187\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.200\nIt's not turned on by default.\n\n188\n00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.450\nWe're gonna have to come in here and\nturn it on.\n\n189\n00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:20.520\nNow, this is done a per drive basis, so if\nyou have multiple drives in the machine,\n\n190\n00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.990\nyou can turn it on just on a particular\nvolume or a particular drive.\n\n191\n00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.940\nI've only got one in here, so that's\nthe only one that's going to be listed.\n\n192\n00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.630\nYou might, maybe you've got a data\ndrive where all your data is.\n\n193\n00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.410\nAnd maybe that's the only\none you wanna do this on.\n\n194\n00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.690\nI like doing it on my operating system\ndrive, because inevitably it's malware,\n\n195\n00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.930\nsomething like that.\n\n196\n00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.210\nAnd rolling it back to a restore\npoint is the quick and easy fix.\n\n197\n00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.750\nRemember when we talk about trouble\nshooting it's always the easiest,\n\n198\n00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:52.610\nleast invasive first, and then work your\nway through the more complex solutions.\n\n199\n00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.720\nWell this is one of the easiest,\n\n200\n00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.200\nleast invasive ways you can\ntry to fix your machine.\n\n201\n00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.250\nBecause what's really cool\nabout restore points is\n\n202\n00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.730\nit doesn't mess with your user files.\n\n203\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.240\nSo if you have an excel spreadsheet, let's\nsay you made a restore point on Monday,\n\n204\n00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.190\nyou made a new spreadsheet on Wednesday.\n\n205\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.010\nThursday you got a problem with\nyour machine, you roll back to\n\n206\n00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.360\nthat restore point on Monday, your\nspreadsheet's still going to be there.\n\n207\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.230\nRight, it's not actually going to do\nanything to your emails, you documents,\n\n208\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.400\nor anything like that.\n\n209\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.290\nIt's really talking about the system\nitself, the operating system and\n\n210\n00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.440\nthe configuration of\nthat operating system.\n\n211\n00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.900\nNow you will lose applications.\n\n212\n00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.900\nLike if I install an application\nafter the restore point, and\n\n213\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.830\nthen I roll back to a restore point.\n\n214\n00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.290\nWhat's gonna happen is I'm\nrestoring the registry, right?\n\n215\n00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.000\nAll the settings.\n\n216\n00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.870\nSo now the registry no longer has\na record of that application and\n\n217\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.660\nany keys it made in the registry and\nthings like that, so\n\n218\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.960\nthose applications either\nwon't be there at all.\n\n219\n00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.400\nOr if they still have an icon on your\ndesktop it most likely won't work.\n\n220\n00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.510\nSo you probably have to\nreinstall those applications.\n\n221\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.020\nBut it's really cool,\ncuz it does ask you or it'll show you,\n\n222\n00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.540\nsay, these are gonna be\nthe programs that are effective.\n\n223\n00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.050\nAnd I'll show you what I mean.\n\n224\n00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.410\nSo the first thing you wanna do is,\nyou wanna turn it on.\n\n225\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.440\nWe gotta enable the feature\nbecause it's not on by default.\n\n226\n00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:13.140\nSo I'm simply going to select my drive\nthat I want to enable this on and\n\n227\n00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.970\nchoose Configure.\n\n228\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.660\nAnd I've got a couple of options here.\n\n229\n00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.910\nI can turn it on or I can disable it.\n\n230\n00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:19.890\nIf it was already turned on,\n\n231\n00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.710\nI didn't want to use it anymore,\nI could come in here and disable it.\n\n232\n00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.000\nAlso, sometimes if you're trying to\nfree up some space to do something.\n\n233\n00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.040\nI was trying to think of a good reason.\n\n234\n00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.130\nSometimes, you need to get rid\nof the old restore points so\n\n235\n00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:36.700\nthat you can defragment your\ndrive efficiently or effectively.\n\n236\n00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.600\nBecause those restore points\ndon't move they're like those\n\n237\n00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.270\nimmovable files when you're\nde-fragmenting you can't move them around.\n\n238\n00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.690\nSo I'll turn it on and\nthen below here I've got a slider and\n\n239\n00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:51.940\nthis is how much space I wanna make\navailable to store these restore points.\n\n240\n00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.220\nRemember it's capturing an image\nof the state of my system and\n\n241\n00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.280\nstoring that so\nit is gonna take up some disk space.\n\n242\n00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.360\nThe more space you give it.\n\n243\n00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.960\nThe more restore points it can store.\n\n244\n00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.300\nAnd it's basically a first in,\nfirst out or a FIFO type process.\n\n245\n00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.370\nAs I create restore points, it stores\nthem in the space I've allocated.\n\n246\n00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.140\nWhen that space fills up,\n\n247\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.000\nit doesn't stop creating restore points,\none restore point will go in.\n\n248\n00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.590\nAnd it bumps some restore points out.\n\n249\n00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:23.150\nThe oldest ones it will bump them out to\nmake room for the new restore points.\n\n250\n00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.270\nSo the more space you can dedicate to it,\n\n251\n00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.030\nthe more points in time you\ncan choose to roll back to.\n\n252\n00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.650\nIt really just depends on how much\nspace do you really want to allocate\n\n253\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.830\nto restore points.\n\n254\n00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.000\nBe careful with this.\n\n255\n00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.670\nI have seen several times where I have\ncome into a system, and you turn it on and\n\n256\n00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.125\nyou go to this screen, and\nit's slid over like I have it right now.\n\n257\n00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:47.090\n100% of my disk space is available for\nsystem restore points.\n\n258\n00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:50.070\nAnd so if it's creating restore points\nin the background automatically,\n\n259\n00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.500\nall of a sudden I noticed, wow,\nI don't have any disk space.\n\n260\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.375\nWhy am I down to 200\nmegabytes of disk space?\n\n261\n00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:58.130\nI mean, I know I don't have\nthat many files on my system.\n\n262\n00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.810\nBecause resource points were\ntaking up all that space.\n\n263\n00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.270\nSo make sure you adjust this accordingly.\n\n264\n00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.930\nThere's no real hard, fast rule about\nhow much space you should give it.\n\n265\n00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.540\nLike I said, how much to you\nhave that you're willing to say,\n\n266\n00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.970\nI'll let restore points use it,\nI don't need it.\n\n267\n00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.430\nAll right?\nSo once you choose that, I can click OK,\n\n268\n00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.790\nand now the protection is on.\n\n269\n00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.630\nNow, restore points\nare created automatically by\n\n270\n00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.660\nWindows in a couple of instances.\n\n271\n00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.880\nWhen you install an application, Windows\nshould, and I'll explain what I mean by\n\n272\n00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.240\nshould in just a second,\nshould create a restore point for you.\n\n273\n00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:39.190\nWhen you install drivers, Windows\nshould create a restore point for you.\n\n274\n00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.880\nWhat else, Daniel when you, oh, updates.\n\n275\n00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.170\nWindows updates is another one that is\ngonna create restore points automatically.\n\n276\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.880\nYou can also create them manually.\n\n277\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.960\nI will tell you,\nthat if you rely on restore point, if you\n\n278\n00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.800\nuse this as a method to protect your\nsystem, don't rely on the automatic one.\n\n279\n00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.350\nCreate them yourselves whenever you get\nan opportunity or think you might need it.\n\n280\n00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.320\nBecause I've seen too many times\nwhere Windows just doesn't do it.\n\n281\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.540\nAnd then you don't have that point.\n\n282\n00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.410\nSo if I am ever installing\nan application I'll come in here and\n\n283\n00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:14.640\nmanually create a restore point first,\nthen I'll install the application.\n\n284\n00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.520\nOr if I am doing some major update or\nmajor configuration change,\n\n285\n00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.190\nI'll go ahead and create that restore\npoint manually so I know it's there.\n\n286\n00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.790\nI can always delete it or remove it, or\nfree up some space if I've got too many.\n\n287\n00:14:27.122 --> 00:14:30.536\nNow it doesn't create a restore point off\nthe bat, so I'm going to go ahead and\n\n288\n00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:31.272\ncreate one now.\n\n289\n00:14:31.272 --> 00:14:36.919\nI'll go ahead and click create restore\npoint and I'll give it a name, so\n\n290\n00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:42.936\nlet's say I was getting ready to install\nAdobe Suite, I might some in here and\n\n291\n00:14:42.936 --> 00:14:47.500\ncreate a restore point and\ncall it before for Adobe Suite.\n\n292\n00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.690\nAnd I'll click Create.\n\n293\n00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.050\nIt'll whirr and grind for a second.\n\n294\n00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.140\nAnd it's gonna create that restore point.\n\n295\n00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:55.950\nSo I'll let it do its thing.\n\n296\n00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.050\nAnd there we go.\n\n297\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.720\nWe'll click Close and\nI now have a restore point, and just so\n\n298\n00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.860\nwe have something to look at I'm going\nto go ahead and create another one.\n\n299\n00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.599\nI'm going to say this one\nis before service pack.\n\n300\n00:15:11.967 --> 00:15:15.040\nGood golly,\nif I could spell it would help.\n\n301\n00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.083\n>> Mike never got past third grade\nreading level so there is that.\n\n302\n00:15:20.083 --> 00:15:25.300\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so now we'll have\na couple restore points we can look\n\n303\n00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.660\nbecause I want to show you the process\nof rolling back to a restore point.\n\n304\n00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:34.450\nSo, if something ever goes wrong on my\nsystem, like I said I've used this for\n\n305\n00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.500\nsome malware and\n\n306\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.010\nthings like that, I've been able to\njust roll the system back and recover.\n\n307\n00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.730\nAll you've got to do is think about\nwhen did the problem start occurring.\n\n308\n00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.980\nThat's probably one of\nthe more difficult parts,\n\n309\n00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.020\nwhen you're with end users,\nwhen did this start occurring?\n\n310\n00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.242\nWe've got to find a date\nthat we know is good, right?\n\n311\n00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:55.930\nAnd then all you would do is go into\nthe system protection tab of your system\n\n312\n00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:59.430\nproperties, and click on system restore.\n\n313\n00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.075\nThat launches a handy dandy little wizard.\n\n314\n00:16:01.075 --> 00:16:03.060\nI'll click next on the wizard.\n\n315\n00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.910\nAnd there's my restore\npoints that I created.\n\n316\n00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.710\nAnd I would pick the one I wanted.\n\n317\n00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.726\nAnd then I can choose Scan for\naffected programs.\n\n318\n00:16:12.726 --> 00:16:17.170\nAnd what it's gonna do, it's gonna look\nto see if anything's been installed\n\n319\n00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.500\nsince that restore point was created.\n\n320\n00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.560\nNow it really can't help me.\n\n321\n00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.620\nI can't do anything about it.\n\n322\n00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.250\nBut I can get a list, and\nit will actually create a list and\n\n323\n00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.200\nput it on my desktop if there was any\nprograms that were gonna have a problem.\n\n324\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.760\nSo program drivers that will be deleted.\n\n325\n00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.260\nPrograms and\ndrivers that might be restored.\n\n326\n00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.070\nBut they might not work correctly and\nstill need to be reinstalled.\n\n327\n00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:40.800\nAll right?\n\n328\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.170\nBut it's cool that it gives me that list.\n\n329\n00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.680\nThat way at least I've got a good idea\nof what I'm gonna have to go through,\n\n330\n00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.930\nif I choose to do this restore.\n\n331\n00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.240\nIf I'm okay with the results of\nthat I go ahead and click Next.\n\n332\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:56.387\nAnd it tells me, okay,\nthis is the drive I'm gonna roll back,\n\n333\n00:16:56.387 --> 00:17:00.990\nthere is the restore point I'm gonna\nroll back to, and I'll click Finish.\n\n334\n00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.450\nAnd I'll click Yes.\n\n335\n00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.910\nAnd it's gonna go through\nthe process of restoring my system.\n\n336\n00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.740\nIt's gonna reboot that system.\n\n337\n00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:14.060\nAnd at that point it's back to the state\nof when I took that restore point.\n\n338\n00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.480\nAnd that's it.\n\n339\n00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.910\nThe biggest thing is making sure you\nknow where to go to turn them on and\n\n340\n00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:24.440\nthen understanding that it does\ncreate some automatically.\n\n341\n00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.970\nAgain, when you install an application,\nwhen you do a Windows update or\n\n342\n00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.400\nwhen you install a driver.\n\n343\n00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.548\nBut you can also create them manually.\n\n344\n00:17:30.548 --> 00:17:34.940\n>> Yeah, I've definitely had that\nwhere I'm on the phone with the user.\n\n345\n00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.760\nThey're saying,\nI'd like to do this restore point option.\n\n346\n00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.490\nThen you look at the restore points and\nsome of them are from a few days prior or\n\n347\n00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.770\nmaybe even longer.\n\n348\n00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.170\nAnd they're like wow,\nthat's a long time for me to go back.\n\n349\n00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.670\nI was like well you're not going lose\nany files you created, but software and\n\n350\n00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.770\nsettings and stuff, that is gonna\ngo back to the way it was before.\n\n351\n00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.550\nSo if you are installing your software,\nif you're working with this stuff,\n\n352\n00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:01.300\nmake sure you do that manual restore point\nso that you have a fresh nice copy of your\n\n353\n00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.290\noperating system and the way it is so that\nyou can have it just like you'd like it.\n\n354\n00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:11.310\nThat being said, there is another new-ish\nfeature that is in Windows 10 as well.\n\n355\n00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.770\nAnd I love this stuff, Mike.\n\n356\n00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.150\nIt actually reminds me\na lot of Internet Explorer.\n\n357\n00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.260\nInternet Explorer has the option to say,\n\n358\n00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:22.250\nif it's gone berserk on you, you can reset\nthe browser back to your factory defaults.\n\n359\n00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:26.040\nOr if you just wanna try\nto do some basic resetting,\n\n360\n00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.430\nyou don't have to go into each\nindividual setting, do a hard reset,\n\n361\n00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:34.320\nyou can kind of just refresh it,\nas they like to say.\n\n362\n00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:40.950\nNow we can do that with Windows 10 and\noh my goodness this is going to definitely\n\n363\n00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.830\nbe a helpful feature to people on the help\ndesk, Mike I'm sure you're a huge fan.\n\n364\n00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:45.880\n>> Oh absolutely.\n\n365\n00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.870\nIt's a really cool thing,\n\n366\n00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.120\nI think it started in Windows 8 maybe,\npossibly Windows 10.\n\n367\n00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.710\nBut its definitely in Windows 10.\n\n368\n00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:56.000\nAnd as Daniel explained it very well,\nyou've got two options basically.\n\n369\n00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.830\nYou've got refresh and\nreset is what I think they call them now,\n\n370\n00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:01.640\nthey changed it up.\n\n371\n00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:06.360\nIt was recycle, you know Microsoft, they\nlove to change the names of this stuff.\n\n372\n00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.700\nMy system's rebooting after our restore\npoint here, it's almost back up.\n\n373\n00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.680\nBut the two options there, refresh and\n\n374\n00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.840\nreset, depends on what's\ngoing on on your system.\n\n375\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.990\nIf everything's working, and you're able\nto log it but it seems sluggish or slow,\n\n376\n00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:26.540\nand you want to just try to\nget that performance back and\n\n377\n00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.450\nget that set up, you can do the refresh.\n\n378\n00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:37.260\nAnd basically what it's gonna to do is\nit's going to, trying to think of the best\n\n379\n00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.960\nway to describe it Daniel, it puts a lot\nof the settings back to their defaults.\n\n380\n00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.170\nBut it doesn't do anything\nwith your file themselves, and\n\n381\n00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:48.380\nlet me get logged back into\nthis system and I can show you.\n\n382\n00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.380\nOr you can do a reset,\nwhich is when you basically\n\n383\n00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.220\nreinstall Windows 10 back to\nthe default as well as all your files.\n\n384\n00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.170\nYour profile and everything is gone.\n\n385\n00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.340\nSo it kind of depends on\nhow bad the problem is and\n\n386\n00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.090\nwhere you think the problem lies.\n\n387\n00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.160\nThat's gonna determine\nwhich option you use.\n\n388\n00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.010\nNow I kinda talk about them like they're\ntwo different options cuz that's the way\n\n389\n00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.940\nit's been, you're gonna see in Windows\n10 they really combined them into one\n\n390\n00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.220\nsetting and it just ask me what\nI want to do and I'll show you.\n\n391\n00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.290\nSo if we take a peak at my screen here,\n\n392\n00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.750\nthe first thing I'll point\nout is my restore finished.\n\n393\n00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.350\nThis is what would normally happen\nif you had done a system restore,\n\n394\n00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.940\nthe thing will restore and\nthen it reboots.\n\n395\n00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.690\nYou log in and this comes up.\n\n396\n00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.410\nAnd it tells me the system has been\nrestored to such and such date and time,\n\n397\n00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.130\nwhen I took that restore point.\n\n398\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.700\nYour documents have not been affected.\n\n399\n00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.690\nSo I'll close that.\n\n400\n00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.420\nAnd now what I'm gonna do,\nto do the refresh and\n\n401\n00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.790\nreset, I'm gonna go into my Settings,\noff my Start menu here.\n\n402\n00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:49.860\nAnd I'm gonna go down to Update and\nsecurity, and then over to Recovery.\n\n403\n00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:50.730\nAll right?\n\n404\n00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.330\nAnd then I've got the option,\nreset this PC.\n\n405\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.430\nSo again, they don't call it refresh and\nreset anymore.\n\n406\n00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.860\nIt's all one thing.\n\n407\n00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.050\nI'll click Get started.\n\n408\n00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:05.011\nAnd then it asks me, do you want to keep\nyour files, remove absent settings but,\n\n409\n00:21:05.011 --> 00:21:08.679\nkeep your personal files, or do you want\nto remove all of your personal files and\n\n410\n00:21:08.679 --> 00:21:09.594\nabsent settings?\n\n411\n00:21:09.594 --> 00:21:14.382\nSo if you think the problem is, maybe you\ninstalled an application recently and\n\n412\n00:21:14.382 --> 00:21:17.753\never since your machine is\nbeing really chuggy or slow.\n\n413\n00:21:17.753 --> 00:21:22.390\nOr maybe you've made some changes to some\nsettings, you're practicing or trying\n\n414\n00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:27.294\nsomething out or what have you, following\nsome random websites instructions on this,\n\n415\n00:21:27.294 --> 00:21:31.470\nor that, or the other, and\nnow your machine is just chugging along.\n\n416\n00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:32.150\nYou can do this.\n\n417\n00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.330\nThat would keep your files,\nbut restore everything else.\n\n418\n00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.570\nLike I said, it's refreshing your system.\n\n419\n00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:44.050\nOr, if that doesn't work and\nyour thing is still slow,\n\n420\n00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.850\nyour computer is still a little bit\nsluggish, or there's nothing on there that\n\n421\n00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:52.690\nyou're worried about, you don't care,\nyou're gonna lose all your files anyway.\n\n422\n00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.790\nYou can just do remove everything and\n\n423\n00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:58.410\nthat's basically going back to\nthe day you installed Windows 10.\n\n424\n00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.280\nIt's gonna reinstall the operating system.\n\n425\n00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:05.250\nYou're gonna have to recreate everything,\nprofiles, applications, all that stuff.\n\n426\n00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.000\nSo it really just depends\non which one you wanna do.\n\n427\n00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.360\nTry and think if we really\nwanna do this on-screen.\n\n428\n00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.060\nWell, what the heck, right?\n\n429\n00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.430\n>> Right, do the good stuff Mike.\n\n430\n00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.730\n>> Let's do it all right?\n\n431\n00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.480\nSo I'll choose keep my files,\nremove apps, it says it won't take long.\n\n432\n00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:18.360\nAll right.\n\n433\n00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.210\nIn here it tells me that I got a couple\nof apps that are gonna be removed,\n\n434\n00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:26.115\nVisual C++, VMware tools, so\nwe're not really gonna do this right now.\n\n435\n00:22:26.115 --> 00:22:30.940\n[LAUGH] Because I want those apps\nstill here for the rest of the show.\n\n436\n00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.860\nSo we're not actually gonna do that.\n\n437\n00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.460\nBut at least you get to see the option.\n\n438\n00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.930\nAnd it's nice that it tells me these\nare the things that are gonna be affected.\n\n439\n00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:42.070\nAnd again, it shows me this list will be\nsaved to the desktop after you reset.\n\n440\n00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.690\nSo if you need a checklist to go back and\n\n441\n00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.500\nreinstall those applications,\nyou've got it right there.\n\n442\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.370\nYou don't have to think.\n\n443\n00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:48.500\nCuz that's one of my things, Daniel.\n\n444\n00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.290\nI know every time I reinstall my operating\nsystem, which I do all the time.\n\n445\n00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.750\nMy big thing was, all right,\n\n446\n00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.970\nwhat applications did I\nreally need to reinstall.\n\n447\n00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:56.630\nWhich ones do I use?\n\n448\n00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.340\nAnd I typically don't think of it\nuntil I need it and then I'm like,\n\n449\n00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.950\noh yeah gotta reinstall that.\n\n450\n00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:01.450\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n451\n00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.440\nI'm the exact same way.\n\n452\n00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.390\nI was actually telling\nRonnie today about how\n\n453\n00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.300\nin corporate environments\nthat I've worked in,\n\n454\n00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.510\na lot of times the bosses want me spending\ntoo much time trying to troubleshoot a PC.\n\n455\n00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:16.570\nThey're like, you know what, if it's that\nbroken, just replace it with another PC.\n\n456\n00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:17.640\nWell, that costs money.\n\n457\n00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.840\nWe have to have extra PCs laying around.\n\n458\n00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.850\nTo replace that PC with and\nthen that's gotta go back to somebody,\n\n459\n00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:26.200\nthey've to reimage it, recycle it,\nand reuse it somewhere else.\n\n460\n00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.110\nTime, effort, money,\nthis saves me that stuff.\n\n461\n00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.250\nIf I've gotten to the point\nwhere I've tried restore points,\n\n462\n00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.240\nI've tried recovery discs, and\nthings just still aren't working,\n\n463\n00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.570\nI can just hit that reset button and\nsay you know what?\n\n464\n00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:42.540\nWe're gonna save files to a network share,\nand I'm gonna hit that reset button.\n\n465\n00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.720\nWe're gonna go hard back to the way\nthis thing was the day you got it.\n\n466\n00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.650\nAnd then we'll put your files back on and\neverything should work.\n\n467\n00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.305\nIn a corporate environment you\ncan get away with that kind of\n\n468\n00:23:50.305 --> 00:23:53.355\nkind of thing because a lot of\nthe desktops are standardized.\n\n469\n00:23:53.355 --> 00:23:56.130\nYou know exactly what software is supposed\nto go on there, how it's supposed to look.\n\n470\n00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.775\nEverybody is conformity\nthrough out the systems, so\n\n471\n00:23:59.775 --> 00:24:02.045\nwe can use that to our advantage.\n\n472\n00:24:02.045 --> 00:24:02.986\nThat's a really big help.\n\n473\n00:24:02.986 --> 00:24:04.723\nYou spent too much time on something?\n\n474\n00:24:04.723 --> 00:24:05.948\nJust hit that reset button.\n\n475\n00:24:05.948 --> 00:24:06.876\nGet it back into action.\n\n476\n00:24:06.876 --> 00:24:08.240\n>> Absolutely.\n\n477\n00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.351\nNow, one other thing I\ndo want to show you.\n\n478\n00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:12.030\nSo let's pop up my screen here, again.\n\n479\n00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:15.715\nIf I go back, I didn't do the refresh or\nthe Keep my files.\n\n480\n00:24:15.715 --> 00:24:16.985\nI clicked back.\n\n481\n00:24:16.985 --> 00:24:20.600\nAnd I'm gonna click Remove everything and\nshow you the options you get here,\n\n482\n00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.221\ncuz these are kind of cool as well.\n\n483\n00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:25.476\nYou get two options, Just remove my files.\n\n484\n00:24:25.476 --> 00:24:31.283\nSo it says if you're gonna keep using this\nPC, basically again, it's reinstalling\n\n485\n00:24:31.283 --> 00:24:36.540\nthe operating system back to the default,\nremoves all your personal files.\n\n486\n00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.110\nMaybe it's something\nthat you've downloaded or\n\n487\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.950\nsomething that's causing the problem.\n\n488\n00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.350\nThis other option, Remove files and\nclean the drive, right?\n\n489\n00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.970\nThat way,\nI'm going to remove your files, but\n\n490\n00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:49.460\nremember when I remove those files, we're\njust removing the pointers to the files.\n\n491\n00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.389\nThe files are still out\nthere on the hard drive.\n\n492\n00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:52.800\nThe space is available.\n\n493\n00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.580\nIt will be overwritten, but\nif somebody was to get that hard drive,\n\n494\n00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.620\nthey could try to recover\nthat status files.\n\n495\n00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.848\nThis option actually goes through and\nformats the drive, and\n\n496\n00:25:02.848 --> 00:25:07.645\nhopefully makes it more difficult if\nnot impossible for somebody to do\n\n497\n00:25:07.645 --> 00:25:12.785\na recovery using that software that\ndoes the data recovery on hard drives.\n\n498\n00:25:12.785 --> 00:25:14.640\nSo a couple of options there.\n\n499\n00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.760\nIt does warn you, though.\n\n500\n00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.148\nThis will take some time.\n\n501\n00:25:17.148 --> 00:25:19.730\nIt's like doing a slow format, right?\n\n502\n00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:24.192\nSo, if you've got a four terabyte drive\nthere or something like that, go ahead and\n\n503\n00:25:24.192 --> 00:25:26.896\nstart this, wake up in the morning,\ncheck on it.\n\n504\n00:25:26.896 --> 00:25:27.577\nThat kind of thing.\n\n505\n00:25:27.577 --> 00:25:29.240\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n506\n00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.157\nThose large drives could definitely\ntake you a little while, so\n\n507\n00:25:32.157 --> 00:25:33.410\njust be prepared for that.\n\n508\n00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:35.945\nHopefully you don't have anything\nthat large that you need to format.\n\n509\n00:25:35.945 --> 00:25:37.392\nThat would be tough.\n\n510\n00:25:37.392 --> 00:25:39.285\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right Mike, so,\n\n511\n00:25:39.285 --> 00:25:41.372\nanything else with the refresher?\n\n512\n00:25:41.372 --> 00:25:42.660\n>> No, I think that's good with that.\n\n513\n00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.622\nThe big thing to know there, remember,\nis that they've combined that, so\n\n514\n00:25:45.622 --> 00:25:46.891\nthat is different from 8.1.\n\n515\n00:25:46.891 --> 00:25:50.311\nIf you go out and try to do any\nresearch on it now as you're studying,\n\n516\n00:25:50.311 --> 00:25:53.551\nmake sure you're getting Windows\n10 specific information,\n\n517\n00:25:53.551 --> 00:25:55.962\nbecause that has changed from Windows 8.1.\n\n518\n00:25:55.962 --> 00:25:59.136\nI mean, some of this stuff, it doesn't\nreally matter what technet page you're\n\n519\n00:25:59.136 --> 00:26:02.382\nlooking at, this one definitely does,\nbecause the options have changed there.\n\n520\n00:26:02.382 --> 00:26:06.300\n>> All right, well, we definitely have one\nmore thing we need to talk about, Mike,\n\n521\n00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.710\nand that is the idea of drivers.\n\n522\n00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.600\nSometimes you get a new piece of hardware,\nor maybe you have an old piece of\n\n523\n00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.370\nhardware, and you update a driver to it,\nor you install a driver for something.\n\n524\n00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:18.150\nWell, most of the time,\nthat's amazing, right?\n\n525\n00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.890\nNew driver, new feature maybe.\n\n526\n00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:21.360\nOr just better supports.\n\n527\n00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.540\nThat's awesome.\n\n528\n00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.537\nWhat's not awesome is when you install\nthat driver and things stop working.\n\n529\n00:26:25.537 --> 00:26:27.582\nAnd that's what we don't want.\n\n530\n00:26:27.582 --> 00:26:31.669\nAnd when that happens, we need to take\nsome steps to remedy that situation.\n\n531\n00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:33.680\nMike, we can roll back a driver, right?\n\n532\n00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.490\n>> Yeah.\nAnd Windows makes it really easy.\n\n533\n00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.100\nAnd this is again,\nnothing new to Windows 10.\n\n534\n00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.200\nBut let's take a look make sure\nwe're familiar with it, and\n\n535\n00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.071\nthat we know how to do it.\n\n536\n00:26:41.071 --> 00:26:45.578\nI'm simply gonna open Device Manager\non my computer here, and\n\n537\n00:26:45.578 --> 00:26:48.820\nI'm gonna navigate, we'll use the mouse.\n\n538\n00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.540\nThat's usually a good one\nto kind of play with.\n\n539\n00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:56.010\nNot going to cause any major\nissues during our show.\n\n540\n00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:59.190\nSo I'll pull this guy up and\nI'm gonna look at this driver, and\n\n541\n00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.792\nyou'll notice that the Roll Back Driver\nis not available, all right.\n\n542\n00:27:02.792 --> 00:27:07.149\nAnd if you've never updated the driver\nthen there's nothing to roll back to.\n\n543\n00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:11.136\nRight, this is the driver that was\ninstalled originally for this mouse, so\n\n544\n00:27:11.136 --> 00:27:12.902\nthere's no option to roll back.\n\n545\n00:27:12.902 --> 00:27:18.050\nI'm gonna go ahead and choose Update\nDriver and I'm gonna have it search here.\n\n546\n00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.580\nIt should give me something.\n\n547\n00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:25.660\nIt likes the one I have so\nI'm gonna try to do this manually.\n\n548\n00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.070\nWe'll see if we can cheat here.\n\n549\n00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.682\nI'm gonna use this\nPS/2 Compatible Mouse driver.\n\n550\n00:27:30.682 --> 00:27:35.925\nClick Next and Close and Close.\n\n551\n00:27:35.925 --> 00:27:40.097\nAnd of course because I'm changing drivers\nI'm gonna have to reboot the system\n\n552\n00:27:40.097 --> 00:27:43.532\nbecause drivers are loaded up\nduring that initial boot process.\n\n553\n00:27:43.532 --> 00:27:45.270\nSo we'll let this thing reboot.\n\n554\n00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.450\nWhen I go back into Device Manager I\nshould now be using\n\n555\n00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:52.920\nthat PS/2 driver instead\nof that VMware driver.\n\n556\n00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.740\nAnd hopefully it won't cause any problems,\n\n557\n00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.090\nbut that's exactly what\nDaniel said earlier.\n\n558\n00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.480\nThis is the idea, if you install a driver,\n\n559\n00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.581\nyour users, somebody told them that\nthere's a new driver out there, and that\n\n560\n00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:07.500\nit'll make their connection faster if they\ninstall this new network adapter driver.\n\n561\n00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.290\nOr their kid told them that\nthere's a new video card driver.\n\n562\n00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.730\nSo, they tried to install it, and\nthey downloaded the wrong one,\n\n563\n00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.080\nthe wrong version.\n\n564\n00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:15.690\nWho knows?\n\n565\n00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:17.125\nRight?\n\n566\n00:28:17.125 --> 00:28:21.510\nAnd trying to figure out what the old\ndriver was, was always a challenge for me.\n\n567\n00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.130\nI don't know if you had that?\n\n568\n00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.630\nWell, which driver worked?\n\n569\n00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:25.550\nRight?\n\n570\n00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.290\nThat's the issue.\n\n571\n00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:31.450\nSo luckily for us, Microsoft will remember\nthe driver that we had before this one.\n\n572\n00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.926\nSo if the need arises to roll back,\nwe can do that.\n\n573\n00:28:34.926 --> 00:28:39.844\nSo let me log back into this system here,\npull up Device Manager one more time.\n\n574\n00:28:41.807 --> 00:28:45.190\nAnd we'll navigate back\ndown into my mouse, and\n\n575\n00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.924\nthere's my PS/2 Compatible Mouse.\n\n576\n00:28:47.924 --> 00:28:50.774\nAnd if I pull up the properties and\ngo to that driver tab,\n\n577\n00:28:50.774 --> 00:28:54.475\nI will see that roll back\ndriver button is available.\n\n578\n00:28:54.475 --> 00:28:56.605\nBecause I've updated the driver.\n\n579\n00:28:56.605 --> 00:28:59.555\nSo, if that driver wasn't working,\nall of a sudden I had lost the ability to\n\n580\n00:28:59.555 --> 00:29:02.955\nuse my mouse, I go,\noh no I've installed the wrong driver, or\n\n581\n00:29:02.955 --> 00:29:08.420\nI didn't like that driver, I can simply\ncome in here and choose Roll Back Driver.\n\n582\n00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.629\nI'll say yes to the little warning there,\nand\n\n583\n00:29:10.629 --> 00:29:12.845\nit's gonna roll back to\nthe previous driver.\n\n584\n00:29:12.845 --> 00:29:14.220\nAnd again, I'm gonna have to reboot.\n\n585\n00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:18.452\nIf I click close it's gonna say that I've\ngotta reboot in order to start using that\n\n586\n00:29:18.452 --> 00:29:20.062\ndriver that it rolled back to.\n\n587\n00:29:20.062 --> 00:29:23.056\nThe one thing I'll point out here,\nyou can see it's already listed as\n\n588\n00:29:23.056 --> 00:29:26.675\nVMware Pointing Device, doesn't actually\ntake effect until I reboot the system.\n\n589\n00:29:26.675 --> 00:29:29.760\nNow one thing I will point out,\nit doesn't remember every driver.\n\n590\n00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:34.847\nSo if you started with driver A, then\nupgraded to driver B, and then later on\n\n591\n00:29:34.847 --> 00:29:40.310\nupgraded to driver C, and then to driver\nD, well you can go from D back to C.\n\n592\n00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.960\nYou can't go back to B and back to A.\n\n593\n00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.290\nIt only remembers the last Driver.\n\n594\n00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:47.390\nThe driver before the current driver.\n\n595\n00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:51.280\nSo you can't, it doesn't remember all\nof your drivers that you've used.\n\n596\n00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.910\n>> Yes, helpful tip.\n\n597\n00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:54.970\nYou don't wanna get caught\nin the weeds with that one.\n\n598\n00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:58.002\nThink, oh, yeah,\nI'll just haul it back to driver A.\n\n599\n00:29:58.002 --> 00:29:59.810\nI can't so that's a bummer.\n\n600\n00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.440\nBut great recovery options that\nwe have here in Windows 10.\n\n601\n00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.680\nThey've done a great job\nof giving us great tools.\n\n602\n00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.264\nI'm gonna say great at least\none more time because,\n\n603\n00:30:07.264 --> 00:30:09.041\nwell I'm pretty impressed\nwith what they've done here.\n\n604\n00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:10.319\nI've gotta be honest with you.\n\n605\n00:30:10.319 --> 00:30:11.624\nIt's fantastic stuff.\n\n606\n00:30:11.624 --> 00:30:14.172\nIf you're into supporting\na Windows operating system and\n\n607\n00:30:14.172 --> 00:30:17.708\na Windows environment, this is the stuff\nyou gotta know because you're gonna do\n\n608\n00:30:17.708 --> 00:30:19.660\na lot of this, to be honest with you.\n\n609\n00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.930\nStuff like those restore points,\nthat's going to be a weekly occurrence.\n\n610\n00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:27.640\nI guarantee it,\nif you have anything more than 50 users.\n\n611\n00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.904\nSomeone's going to call and say,\nI need your help with this, and\n\n612\n00:30:29.904 --> 00:30:31.477\nit's going to be that\nrestore point option.\n\n613\n00:30:31.477 --> 00:30:36.129\nDoing a little bit of that pre-planning\nkind of thing, using the recovery drive,\n\n614\n00:30:36.129 --> 00:30:39.860\nthat's an excellent feature,\nand of course that refresh.\n\n615\n00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.240\nThat is gonna be, that's awesome.\n\n616\n00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.080\nThat restore is the best ways to go for\n\n617\n00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.230\na lot of very difficult issues\nthat just aren't worth the time.\n\n618\n00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:49.020\nSo Mike, thank you so much for\nshowing us how to use those tools.\n\n619\n00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.111\nThank our users for joining us today.\n\n620\n00:30:51.111 --> 00:30:52.830\nWe always appreciate your viewership.\n\n621\n00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.170\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n622\n00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.668\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowry.\n\n623\n00:30:56.668 --> 00:30:57.606\n>> And I'm Mike

great\nepisode of ITProtv.\n\n4\n00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.850\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.750\nHere with me today,\nnone other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.705\nHow's it going, Mikhail?\n\n7\n00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:23.220\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, it's going great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.170\nI'm excited to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.400\nWe got our great Windows\n10 content coming your way.\n\n10\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.800\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna\ndive into the world of file history,\n\n11\n00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.580\nwhich is a way that we can keep track\nof previous versions of our files.\n\n12\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.900\nAnd we're also gonna take\na look at some Windows Update\n\n13\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.190\nconfigurations and settings.\n\n14\n00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.480\nThings I can do to control how my computer\ngoes through that update process,\n\n15\n00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.330\nboth important parts of\nmaintaining our system,\n\n16\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.400\nmaintaining our files, and\nkeeping us out of trouble.\n\n17\n00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.430\n>> Yeah.\nThat's exactly right.\n\n18\n00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.360\nIt's nice to have those features built\ninto our Windows operating system.\n\n19\n00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.250\nHere in Windows 10, that file history.\n\n20\n00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.700\nMan, that guy can really be a lifesaver.\n\n21\n00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.800\nHe got a file and\nhe made some changes to it.\n\n22\n00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.190\nAll of a sudden things aren't looking so\n\n23\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.400\nhot, you need to get back to a time\nwhen things were a little more pleasant.\n\n24\n00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.710\nThat's gonna help us out there.\n\n25\n00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.550\nAnd then of course Windows updates.\n\n26\n00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.270\nOh my goodness this is a- If we\ncould all just learn to do Windows\n\n27\n00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.890\nupdates in the way they should be done we\nwould be living in a much nicer society.\n\n28\n00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.773\nToday Mike\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n29\n00:01:18.773 --> 00:01:20.295\n>> you're gonna help us out with that\n\n30\n00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:22.398\na little bit because we do\nhave plenty of updates.\n\n31\n00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:26.200\nWe gotta know how to configure that, make\nsure our systems are going down that road,\n\n32\n00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.270\nbut we have a lot to talk about today,\nso where do we begin?\n\n33\n00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.890\n>> I don't know,\nnow you've got the pressure on me.\n\n34\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.880\nI don't know if I can improve\nsociety by doing this, but.\n\n35\n00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.463\n>> It's all on you.\n\n36\n00:01:34.463 --> 00:01:35.000\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm sure gonna try.\n\n37\n00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.950\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nwe're gonna start with file history,\n\n38\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.290\ncuz it's a fun one to play around with.\n\n39\n00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.630\nAnd as Daniel said,\nit really does help us out in the end.\n\n40\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.350\nHow many times have you gone to\na document, made some changes,\n\n41\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.520\nsaved it, closed it, and then go, aw\nshoot, I wish I didn't make that change or\n\n42\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.590\nI ended up doing some\nedits on this document.\n\n43\n00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.790\nI cut a couple paragraphs out, I saved it,\nclosed it, and now my boss is saying hey,\n\n44\n00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.210\nI need that information back.\n\n45\n00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.760\nWhat did that document used to say\nbefore you made those changes?\n\n46\n00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.230\nWell, file history gives us\nthe ability to do just that.\n\n47\n00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.190\nGo back and see what that document\nlooked like, even restore a previous\n\n48\n00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.820\nversion of a document, and\nit's relatively easy to set up.\n\n49\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.220\nIt's been around since Windows 7.\n\n50\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.330\nIt's gone through a couple of different\nchanges over the period on through\n\n51\n00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.370\nour different operating systems.\n\n52\n00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.330\nWith File History now, pretty slick,\npretty easy to set up.\n\n53\n00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.880\nSo let's take a look at how\nwe can do that, all right?\n\n54\n00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.270\nSo on my system, here, I'm simply\ngoing to go to my start screen menu.\n\n55\n00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.080\nWhatever Microsoft wants to call that now.\n\n56\n00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.270\nAnd I'm gonna click on settings.\n\n57\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.810\n>> Microsoft does get a little\nschizophrenic when it comes to the naming\n\n58\n00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.635\nconventions of other stuff.\n\n59\n00:02:42.635 --> 00:02:43.940\nThey're a little strange on that.\n\n60\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.515\n>> But they do.\n\n61\n00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:45.251\n[LAUGH]\n>> We digress.\n\n62\n00:02:45.251 --> 00:02:45.850\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n63\n00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.850\nthat's a whole other episode there, right?\n\n64\n00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.890\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna click on Update and\n\n65\n00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.470\nSecurity, and then I'm gonna\nclick on Backup of all places.\n\n66\n00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.520\nAnd I can see I've got\nBackup using File History.\n\n67\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.220\nAll right.\n\n68\n00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.890\nAnd the first thing I'm gonna do,\nif I wanna turn this on,\n\n69\n00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.470\nI've gotta give it a drive.\n\n70\n00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.620\nIt has to have somewhere to store other\nthan the hard drive I'm working with now.\n\n71\n00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.760\nIt has to have somewhere to store these\nprevious versions of these files.\n\n72\n00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.230\nSo I'm gonna click add drive, and\nhopefully it's gonna find my little thumb\n\n73\n00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.000\ndrive that I have plugged in here, give\nit some place to store this information.\n\n74\n00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.200\nThere it is.\n\n75\n00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.770\nSo I'll go ahead and select that guy.\n\n76\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.030\nAnd now that I've got a drive and told it\nwhere to start putting this, I can see\n\n77\n00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.720\nthat it automatically says, automatically\nsays automatically back up my files.\n\n78\n00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.810\nThat slider kinda moved on over.\n\n79\n00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.330\nI can always come in here and\nturn that off if I want to or\n\n80\n00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.510\ndon't wanna use this anymore, but\n\n81\n00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.460\nit does turn on once you give it a drive,\ntell it where to put the information.\n\n82\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.250\nNow let's take a look at\nwhat it's getting, right?\n\n83\n00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.890\nCuz it's not getting my entire system.\n\n84\n00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.350\nI'm going to click on more options, and\nI'm going to maximize this window so\n\n85\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.810\nwe can see a little more.\n\n86\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.100\nUp here at the top, I can see size of\nbackup currently 0, I've got enough space,\n\n87\n00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.100\ndata's not yet backed up.\n\n88\n00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.170\nI'm going to go ahead and\nclick back up, let that start running.\n\n89\n00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.350\nThis process could take a little while\nif you've been using your system for\n\n90\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.590\nany length of time.\n\n91\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.350\nThis is pretty much a default\ninstall of Windows 10 and\n\n92\n00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.750\njust a couple profiles on it and\nnot a lot of documents.\n\n93\n00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.960\nSo it shouldn't, well in fact,\n\n94\n00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.720\nit's done in the time I rambled\nabout how long it might take.\n\n95\n00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.680\nSo there we go but then again if you're\nusing this on your system at home or\n\n96\n00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.490\nyour laptop and you've been using that for\na few months you've got a lot of\n\n97\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.120\ndocuments, that could take a little\nbit of time so be patient with it.\n\n98\n00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.374\nYou don't have to wait,\nyou can close this,\n\n99\n00:04:27.374 --> 00:04:28.538\nyou don't have to sit there and watch it.\n\n100\n00:04:28.538 --> 00:04:32.598\nYou can continue to use your system while\nit's creating that initial backup of your\n\n101\n00:04:32.598 --> 00:04:33.490\ndocuments.\n\n102\n00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.120\nAll right?\n\n103\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.370\nNow below that I've got Backup My Files.\n\n104\n00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.980\nAnd by default it says, Every Hour.\n\n105\n00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.270\nAnd I can change that.\n\n106\n00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.440\nThat's really gonna depend on how often\ndo you make changes to those documents.\n\n107\n00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.320\nHow often do you wanna go look and see\nIf there's been a change, or whether or\n\n108\n00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.810\nnot I should grab a copy of that document.\n\n109\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.960\nYou could do it daily or you could change\nit all the way down to 10 minutes.\n\n110\n00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.780\nI'm gonna leave it on that default.\n\n111\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.192\nAnd then keep the backups, all right.\n\n112\n00:04:59.192 --> 00:05:02.440\nThis is something that you might\nwanna consider adjusting as well.\n\n113\n00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.910\nBecause you've only got so\nmuch space available on that drive, and\n\n114\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.450\nover time all those backups take up space,\nand\n\n115\n00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.460\ndo I really need to roll back to a version\nof this document from a year ago?\n\n116\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.190\nProbably not.\n\n117\n00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.955\nI can probably clear some of that out or\n\n118\n00:05:16.955 --> 00:05:21.235\nmaybe you're doing this in a regulated\nenvironment, and you've got to keep those.\n\n119\n00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:22.575\nYou don't want to get rid of them.\n\n120\n00:05:22.575 --> 00:05:24.035\nSo the default is forever.\n\n121\n00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:26.385\nRight?\nIt's not going to get rid of anything.\n\n122\n00:05:26.385 --> 00:05:30.139\nIt'll just tell you, hey, it's out of\nspace to store any previous versions.\n\n123\n00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.870\nDown below, back up these folders.\n\n124\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.410\nAnd this is pretty cool that\nwe can now add folders.\n\n125\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.590\nIf I click add folder I can browse around,\n\n126\n00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.480\nin fact let's see if I can go make\na new folder over here on the C drive.\n\n127\n00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.080\nSee if it'll let me add that guy and\nI'll just call it My Stuff.\n\n128\n00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.770\nAll right, then I choose that folder and\nthere's words or grinds, and there we go.\n\n129\n00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.960\nAnd if you're used to using previous\nversions in other older operating systems,\n\n130\n00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.780\nwe were limited.\n\n131\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.790\nIt was only your documents, your pictures,\nthe stuff that was in your profile.\n\n132\n00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.950\nYou couldn't add your own folders to this,\n\n133\n00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.350\nonly if you put them inside\nMy Documents or My Pictures.\n\n134\n00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.570\nSo now you can add folders to this and\nyou can see the list is pretty extensive.\n\n135\n00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.200\nYou could exclude folders as well.\n\n136\n00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.130\nI can go to one of these and\nI can remove it if i I don't want it.\n\n137\n00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.930\nLike taking previous versions of\n\n138\n00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.990\nvideos I mean that might be one of\nwaste of space to have them on there.\n\n139\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.970\nI'm probably never making changes\nto them and editing them so.\n\n140\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.040\nIt's not gonna be doing it very often, but\nthere is gonna be a copy of those videos\n\n141\n00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.850\non that drive and that could take up space\nthat I really don't care about doing.\n\n142\n00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.410\nBut, again, this does replace,\nI shouldn't say replace,\n\n143\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.010\nbut there's no more backup\nlike we used to have.\n\n144\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.200\nSo this is the backup of your files.\n\n145\n00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.902\nRight?\nNow if you want to back up your operating\n\n146\n00:06:52.902 --> 00:06:54.077\nsystem and things like that,\n\n147\n00:06:54.077 --> 00:06:57.290\nthat's where we do that recovery drive\nthat we talked about in another episode.\n\n148\n00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.250\nSo go check that one out.\n\n149\n00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.770\nBut as far as your documents go,\nthis is the way to do it now.\n\n150\n00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.710\nYou can also change drives,\nif you start running out of space or\n\n151\n00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.650\nyou want to move everything\nto a different drive.\n\n152\n00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:10.180\nAll right.\n\n153\n00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.320\nSo that's pretty much the settings\nthat we have for file history.\n\n154\n00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.110\nLet's see how it works.\n\n155\n00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.470\nI'm gonna open up file explorer here, and\nI've actually got a file in My Documents\n\n156\n00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.030\nthat should have call reports, and\nif I open this guy up, this is Version 1,\n\n157\n00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.880\nI'm gonna change that to Version 2.\n\n158\n00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.940\nAnd I'll go ahead and save that document.\n\n159\n00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.250\nNow imagine I've made much\nmore complex changes,\n\n160\n00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.910\nwiped out a whole paragraph of data,\nsomething like that.\n\n161\n00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.480\nAnd I wanna go back to that.\n\n162\n00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.380\nAll I to do is right click on this guy,\ngo to properties.\n\n163\n00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.930\nAnd then to the previous versions tab.\n\n164\n00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:46.470\nRIght?\nAnd\n\n165\n00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.130\nthis will list all the previous versions.\n\n166\n00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.870\nNow mine's taking a snap shot, basically,\nor a copy of these files every hour.\n\n167\n00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.990\nSo that's long I've only had,\nI've got the initial one that I created.\n\n168\n00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.160\nIt won't another one for another hour.\n\n169\n00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.584\nBut some of the cool things I can do\nin here is I can open this document.\n\n170\n00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:07.460\nSo you can see this one was made\na little bit ago, according to my clock,\n\n171\n00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.084\n20 something minutes ago.\n\n172\n00:08:09.084 --> 00:08:13.126\nIf I click open There's version one,\nright?\n\n173\n00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:17.253\nIf I just want to see what the previous\nversion looked like, just make sure\n\n174\n00:08:17.253 --> 00:08:20.982\nI didn't get rid of anything important or\ngrab some data out of it,\n\n175\n00:08:20.982 --> 00:08:25.160\nI can simply open it up, look at it and\nclose it and I'm good to go.\n\n176\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.970\nI've also got the option to open it up\nin file history, which is pretty cool.\n\n177\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.440\nLet's do something here real quick,\nDaniel.\n\n178\n00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.090\nI'm going to go back\nover to file histories.\n\n179\n00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.420\nI want to show you this feature.\n\n180\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.920\nI really like this browse capability\nthat you get, so what I want to do is\n\n181\n00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.380\ncreate another quick, I'm going to\nforce it to do another one right now.\n\n182\n00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:51.300\nNormally it would wait for another\nhour to do that, let's say backup now.\n\n183\n00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.330\nTo give me another couple of that info.\n\n184\n00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.270\nThat should be good.\n\n185\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:09:01.500\nAnd then I'll make another change to this\ndocument, we'll call it version three.\n\n186\n00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.240\nSave it.\n\n187\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.740\nClose it.\n\n188\n00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.360\nAnd then we'll take a look\nat that previous version,\n\n189\n00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.950\nwhat do I got open down there,\nlet's cancel that,\n\n190\n00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:18.110\ntake a look at previous versions now.\n\n191\n00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.450\nAnd again I still only have one,\nwe'll find out what's going on here.\n\n192\n00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.930\nI'll click open and open and file history,\n\n193\n00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.820\nbecause this is what I\nreally want to show you.\n\n194\n00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.680\nIt might only have one copy at this point,\nbut that's okay.\n\n195\n00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.010\nThis is the little browser that\nyou get and it's pretty neat.\n\n196\n00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.940\nYou can see actually if I\nhad more than one copy,\n\n197\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.400\nI could navigate between\nthe different versions.\n\n198\n00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.080\nI might have gone a little too fast and\n\n199\n00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.410\nit hasn't finished up creating that second\nsnapshot that I tried to create, but\n\n200\n00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.570\nnormally if there were multiple copies,\nI could actually browse.\n\n201\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.420\nI notice it's showing me the contents\nof that document right here.\n\n202\n00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.270\nSo in a nice graphical view,\ninstead of having because it used to be,\n\n203\n00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.450\nif anybody played with\nthis back in the day.\n\n204\n00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.670\nYou might have 15 versions listed here.\n\n205\n00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:03.180\nYou would have select one, open it, see if\nthat's the one you wanted, close it, open\n\n206\n00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.310\nthe next one, and see if that's what you\nwanted, close it, and so on and so forth.\n\n207\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.630\nWith this file history browser,\nI can sit here and\n\n208\n00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:14.030\nuse my little navigation tools to\nflip between the different versions.\n\n209\n00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:18.050\nAnd then when I get to the one I like, I\ncan just click on this little green button\n\n210\n00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.900\nhere to restore to the original location.\n\n211\n00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.095\nI'm not going to do it.\n\n212\n00:10:22.095 --> 00:10:24.995\nActually I want to show you\nsomething else before I do that.\n\n213\n00:10:24.995 --> 00:10:26.265\nBut that was all that I would have to do,\n\n214\n00:10:26.265 --> 00:10:30.195\nfind the version I want, click that little\ngreen button and would put it back.\n\n215\n00:10:30.195 --> 00:10:33.365\nI am going to close that and\ncome back over here and\n\n216\n00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:36.580\nshow you this other button,\nwhich is my restore button.\n\n217\n00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.530\nI've got two options.\n\n218\n00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.670\nI've got the restore, which is basically\nwhat that green button would have done had\n\n219\n00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.810\nI clicked on it in there, and\nyou could see the file is still there.\n\n220\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:49.630\nAll it sees is the file name, and it\nsays it exists all ready so do I want to\n\n221\n00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.940\nreplace the file in the destination, or do\nI want to maybe look at the information.\n\n222\n00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.820\nI'll just go ahead and\nsay replace the file.\n\n223\n00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.530\nAnd now when I look at reports,\nI'm back to version one.\n\n224\n00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.630\nNo longer do I have that version two.\n\n225\n00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:09.448\nNow, the other option that we\nhad in there was restore two.\n\n226\n00:11:09.448 --> 00:11:15.770\nSo let's say I didn't want to\noverride the original right?\n\n227\n00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.440\nI've made some changes so my original\ndocument is now different from the past\n\n228\n00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.050\nversion, I want to keep my current\nversion, but I also want to have\n\n229\n00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:28.840\na hard copy or actually have that original\nversion of the previous version as well.\n\n230\n00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.620\nI can do that I just say restore two,\ngive it a different name,\n\n231\n00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.810\nand then it won't overwrite, right?\n\n232\n00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.880\nAnd then I would have two versions\nof that file in file explorer.\n\n233\n00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.510\nA couple of cool options I can\ndo there with that file history.\n\n234\n00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.830\nAnd I tell you Danny,\nit can be a big life saver.\n\n235\n00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.580\nEspecially for some of my end users.\n\n236\n00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.300\n>> Oh yeah, definitely.\n\n237\n00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.050\nI've had those calls come in saying 'oh,\nthe world is crashing down around me,\n\n238\n00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.110\nI've accidentally deleted a file,\nit was super important'.\n\n239\n00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:58.850\nAnd I even emptied my recycling bin, or it\nwas on a network share and now it's gone.\n\n240\n00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:59.440\nWhat do I do?\n\n241\n00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.010\nWe say not a problem, let me take\na look at this file history business,\n\n242\n00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.800\nsee if there's a version, usually there\nis, especially with important stuff.\n\n243\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.570\nYou tend to cram that stuff into where\nfile history is making backups from.\n\n244\n00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.870\nJust go in there,\nrestore the file back and\n\n245\n00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.900\nI'll tell you what, champagne flows and\nthe ticker tape parade goes on.\n\n246\n00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.740\nNo that's not really happens, they\nusually say thanks a lot digit head and\n\n247\n00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.512\nthey hang up the phone.\n\n248\n00:12:23.512 --> 00:12:24.572\n[LAUGH] Anyway cool.\n\n249\n00:12:24.572 --> 00:12:27.270\nNo, they're pretty happy\nwhen you restore the files.\n\n250\n00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.890\nSo it's a great thing to be able to do and\nit really does make you that hero of\n\n251\n00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.410\nthe day to be honest with you, when you\ncan restore a super important file for\n\n252\n00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:39.320\nsomeone that believes that it is gone, you\nreally look like the hero at that point.\n\n253\n00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.100\n>> You know Daniel that's a really\ngood point, I didn't show them whole\n\n254\n00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.610\nprevious version of the folder because\nthat's another thing you can do.\n\n255\n00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:48.340\nI was looking at the files,\nbut say I delete this file.\n\n256\n00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.410\nSo I'll go ahead and\ndelete the file altogether.\n\n257\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.300\nNow it's not even there.\n\n258\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.920\nHow do I right click on it to\ngo back to a previous version?\n\n259\n00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.950\nYou right click on the folder.\n\n260\n00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.600\nJust in the background of\nthe folder itself, and\n\n261\n00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.370\ngo to properties, previous versions.\n\n262\n00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.330\nAnd there I can see I\nhad documents in there.\n\n263\n00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.270\nI could open that up, if it'll let me.\n\n264\n00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:11.130\nMaybe it's not going to,\nopening file history.\n\n265\n00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.580\nAnd there we can see there used to be\na file called reports in this folder.\n\n266\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.200\nI could select that,\nand click restore, and\n\n267\n00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.510\nsure enough it's right back in my\ndocuments there's my file called reports.\n\n268\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.130\nSo not only are we talking about\nbeing able to roll back a document\n\n269\n00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.520\nto a certain point in time,\nif the document's gone, you can look at\n\n270\n00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.320\nthe folder's previous versions and\nyou can restore files that way as well.\n\n271\n00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.100\n>> That's right.\n\n272\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.230\nNow another place that we can store\ndocuments is a nice place to use\n\n273\n00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.510\nas a recovery area is One Drive.\n\n274\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.720\nRight?\nOne Drive is a cloud solution.\n\n275\n00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.570\nIt's not stored locally on my computer.\n\n276\n00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:48.870\nSo if my computer goes dead, or\nanything happens to the file that I have,\n\n277\n00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.670\nan original copy, maybe, on my hard drive,\nOne Drive is there to help us back it up.\n\n278\n00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:53.870\nRight, Mike?\n>> Absolutely.\n\n279\n00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.970\nOne Drive is fantastic.\n\n280\n00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.710\nWhen you install windows 10 Microsoft\nreally wants you to log in with\n\n281\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:03.910\na Microsoft account an at hotmail.com or\nan at outlook.com or something like that,\n\n282\n00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:08.050\nyou can even use other email addresses\nit doesn't have to be an outlook or\n\n283\n00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.340\na hotmail account.\n\n284\n00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.300\nAnd what happens when you do that, when\nyou use an email address to log into this\n\n285\n00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.720\nmachine, it sets you up a Microsoft\naccount whether you like it or not.\n\n286\n00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:22.330\nAnd it's going to give you access to\nOneDrive, which is their cloud storage.\n\n287\n00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.160\nAnd as Daniel said, it is a great way\nto help protect your documents, right?\n\n288\n00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.150\nBecause if my documents are stored\nup there in the cloud and\n\n289\n00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.810\nthen if my hard drive fails or if I need\nto get to it from another machine or\n\n290\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:36.330\nif I delete a document, I could go up\nthere to the cloud and recover it.\n\n291\n00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.820\nThere's really no special technique\nother than to make sure you\n\n292\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.630\nput a copy of the file up\nthere in there in the cloud.\n\n293\n00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.190\nIf you never put it up there,\n\n294\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.900\nthen you're not going to be able\nto use it as a recovery option.\n\n295\n00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:46.920\nAnd let me show you.\n\n296\n00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:53.710\nIf I open up file explorer on this\nmachine, I could go to the One Drive.\n\n297\n00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.090\nAnd I can take a look\ninside my documents and\n\n298\n00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.580\nthere's some files that\nI've created up there.\n\n299\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.880\nAnd if I had, let's say,\nwhat's a good way to do this?\n\n300\n00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.000\nLet's create a new document.\n\n301\n00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.819\nLet's go here and make a new file.\n\n302\n00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:14.370\nAnd I'm gonna call it OneDrive recovery.\n\n303\n00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.020\nI know I made a little typo in there and\nthat's okay right?\n\n304\n00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.350\nAnd now if I want to make sure\nI've got a good copy of this,\n\n305\n00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:25.000\nno matter what happens I can just right\nclick on that guy and choose copy.\n\n306\n00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.420\nI can go to my OneDrive documents,\nand I can paste that guy up there, and\n\n307\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.190\nnow wait for that little green check mark.\n\n308\n00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.970\nLet me it's done synchronizing\nthat file up to the cloud.\n\n309\n00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.190\nAnd there it goes.\n\n310\n00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.110\nNow if I go over to documents.\n\n311\n00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.870\nAnd I accidentally delete my files,\n\n312\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.470\nsomething happens, or\nmy drive fails or something like that.\n\n313\n00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:54.810\nI can simply go to OneDrive, go to\ndocuments, grab those two files there,\n\n314\n00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:59.210\ncopy them, and\nput them back in my documents folder.\n\n315\n00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.230\nThere you go.\n\n316\n00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.740\nIt's that easy.\n\n317\n00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:05.918\nSo, one driver is a big help.\n\n318\n00:16:05.918 --> 00:16:09.694\nI tell you, I like to keep documents\nthere instead of my documents,\n\n319\n00:16:09.694 --> 00:16:12.294\nsome of them,\nit really depends on what it is.\n\n320\n00:16:12.294 --> 00:16:15.002\nAnd I just work with the one that's\nup there on one drive instead of\n\n321\n00:16:15.002 --> 00:16:15.751\ncopying it down.\n\n322\n00:16:15.751 --> 00:16:19.790\nBecause it doesn't, like the one that I\njust put here in my my documents folder.\n\n323\n00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.000\nThat's not going to synchronize.\n\n324\n00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.080\nAny changes I make are not\ngoing up to the cloud.\n\n325\n00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.235\nSo I'm going to have to manually copy.\n\n326\n00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.255\nCopy that file up there again.\n\n327\n00:16:27.255 --> 00:16:30.675\nNow, if I start creating documents here,\nand\n\n328\n00:16:30.675 --> 00:16:36.265\njust working with them here,\nsomething like that, we'll save that guy.\n\n329\n00:16:37.745 --> 00:16:39.290\nWell that's saved up to the cloud.\n\n330\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.550\nSo if I go to another machine and\n\n331\n00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.780\nlog in with that same account,\nI can access that file as well.\n\n332\n00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.780\nSo, just depends on how you wanna work it.\n\n333\n00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.910\n>> Yeah, and the great thing is,\nis that if you go up to a machine.\n\n334\n00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.740\nLet's say that your user, I don't know.\n\n335\n00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.920\nYou're out of town, you need a computer,\nyou don't have one on you, and\n\n336\n00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.560\nyou need access to your file work, or\ngotta make some quick changes, and\n\n337\n00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.800\nno one's running a Windows machine for\nwhatever reason.\n\n338\n00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.660\nIt's a bunch of Mac users, or whatever.\n\n339\n00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.430\nYou can still access OneDrive,\nyou just go to their website.\n\n340\n00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.120\nLog in using your account.\n\n341\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.070\nOne drive gives you\na nice little interface.\n\n342\n00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.990\nThere's all your files and folders.\n\n343\n00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.050\nLog right in, make the changes you\nneed and start, attach it as email,\n\n344\n00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.980\ndo whatever you need to do\nto work with that file.\n\n345\n00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:21.410\nSo, it is not just in your Windows\nmachine, you don't have to be logged in.\n\n346\n00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.490\nSo Windows machine using\nyour Windows account.\n\n347\n00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.720\nAs long as you have access to their\nwebsite, remember this is cloud right?\n\n348\n00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.180\nThis is making sure that no matter what\ndevice you're using, as long as you have\n\n349\n00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.900\naccess to the internet, you have access to\nyour data and that is a very handy thing.\n\n350\n00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.100\n>> Absolutely.\nAll right the next thing Daniel,\n\n351\n00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.190\nI think we wanna take a look at is those\ngood old update settings we were probably,\n\n352\n00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:44.370\nat this point, familiar with Windows\nUpdates, and actually configuring it.\n\n353\n00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.220\nBut let's take a look at it, see some\nof the changes we've got in Windows 10.\n\n354\n00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.360\nMake sure we're clear on how\nwe can configure the settings,\n\n355\n00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.340\ncontrol that update process.\n\n356\n00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.110\nSo what I'm gonna do, is I'm just going\nto come down here to my start menu and\n\n357\n00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:58.320\nchoose Window, or\nsearch for Window's update.\n\n358\n00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:06.810\nAnd I'm gonna go in to my Window's update\nsettings.Wait for that to launch up.\n\n359\n00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.622\nSlowly but surely it's thinking about it.\n\n360\n00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:11.465\n>> Or is it?\n\n361\n00:18:11.465 --> 00:18:13.843\n>> Super slowly surely.\n\n362\n00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:16.550\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or is it?\n\n363\n00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:17.600\nLet's try that again.\n\n364\n00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.910\nWindows update, and\nwe'll just go over here.\n\n365\n00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.920\nCheck for updates.\n\n366\n00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.130\nWe'll let it check.\n\n367\n00:18:28.206 --> 00:18:30.950\nOr, then again,\nmaybe updates are not a good thing.\n\n368\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:31.581\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n369\n00:18:31.581 --> 00:18:32.119\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK].\n\n370\n00:18:32.119 --> 00:18:34.126\n>> That was a good place to go,\nis the control panel.\n\n371\n00:18:34.126 --> 00:18:37.920\nThat usually they might have an area for\nus to updates in there, let's try that.\n\n372\n00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.140\n>> I tell you what,\nwe'll try a few different ways here.\n\n373\n00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.900\nWe'll go into Settings,\nUpdate and security.\n\n374\n00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.351\n>> Now's a good time to mention there's\nmultiple ways to get to updates.\n\n375\n00:18:45.351 --> 00:18:46.697\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n376\n00:18:46.697 --> 00:18:48.314\nAnd there it goes, it opened up.\n\n377\n00:18:48.314 --> 00:18:49.013\nSo who knows.\n\n378\n00:18:49.013 --> 00:18:52.550\nAnyway, so as you saw,\nfew different ways I can get there.\n\n379\n00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.810\nI can see that I've checked for\nupdates recently.\n\n380\n00:18:55.810 --> 00:19:00.160\nIf I wanna check for updates,\nI simply click check for updates.\n\n381\n00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.260\nPretty straightforward, right?\n\n382\n00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.440\nIt's gonna go out, see if there's any.\n\n383\n00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.490\nIt's gonna connect to\nMicrosoft's Internet servers.\n\n384\n00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.300\nIt's gonna check with them and\nsee if there's an update.\n\n385\n00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.090\nAnd sure enough, there is an update.\n\n386\n00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.940\nSo it's going to start downloading that,\nshouldn't take it very long and\n\n387\n00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.860\nit will actually install that update for\nme.\n\n388\n00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.500\nNow I do have some advanced options.\n\n389\n00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.250\nThat was a pretty quick one,\nI didn't even notice.\n\n390\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.980\nWas it a Defender?\n\n391\n00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.290\nI think it was a Defender update.\n\n392\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.120\n>> Yeah, probably.\n\n393\n00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.620\n>> So it downloaded it, installed it and\nits already done with that one, alright?\n\n394\n00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.060\nIf I go into my advanced options though,\n\n395\n00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:32.270\nthis is where we can configure\nmy actual update settings.\n\n396\n00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.810\nHow Windows updates is gonna occur.\n\n397\n00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:36.580\nIt's set to automatic.\n\n398\n00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.920\nI could choose to,\nthis is how they're gonna be installed.\n\n399\n00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.860\nSet to automatic.\n\n400\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.470\nI could change that to\nnotify the scheduled restart\n\n401\n00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.960\nthat way if it has a restart\nit won't do it automatically.\n\n402\n00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.880\nIt's going to say, hey,\nare you ready to restart your computer?\n\n403\n00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.980\nI can also choose to get other updates\nthe same way I get my Windows updates for\n\n404\n00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.990\nlike Office and Internet Explorer.\n\n405\n00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.690\nI can choose to defer upgrade.\n\n406\n00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.620\nThis is a big thing with Windows\n10 now because of the way\n\n407\n00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.020\nthey're pushing out updates\nat the operating system.\n\n408\n00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.900\nIf you're in a corporate environment,\n\n409\n00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.710\nwe don't like to stay on\nthat bleeding edge, right?\n\n410\n00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:11.110\nWe don't want to get that first release,\nand\n\n411\n00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.660\nwe kinda wanna let things\nwork themselves out,\n\n412\n00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.140\nget some of the kinks worked out before\nwe push it out to thousands of machines.\n\n413\n00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.000\nCuz I don't want thousands of\nmachines blue screening or\n\n414\n00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.870\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n415\n00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.770\nSo I can come in here and\nchoose to defer upgrades.\n\n416\n00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:24.690\nIt will actually show you.\n\n417\n00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:25.430\nIt will push it out.\n\n418\n00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.770\nWe're gonna have to\nMicrosoft here real quick.\n\n419\n00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:29.330\nYeah, not good.\n\n420\n00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.680\nI don't want to go ahead and\nread their whole web page.\n\n421\n00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.430\nBut basically it will push you off for\n\n422\n00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.520\na couple of months as far as when\nyou're gonna get that upgrade.\n\n423\n00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.160\nIf there's any Issues,\nthat gives Microsoft time to patch it up,\n\n424\n00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.690\nbefore it gets pushed out to\nyour system automatically.\n\n425\n00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.670\nOther cool things we can do with that\ninterface, we can view our update history.\n\n426\n00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.810\nI love this one, I've come home to my\nsystem before, like my home system.\n\n427\n00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.080\nI've got good physical security, so\n\n428\n00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.490\nI leave myself logged in on my\noffice PC there half the time.\n\n429\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.640\nI'll lock the screen and that's about it.\n\n430\n00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.480\nAnd I'll come home and I'm logged out.\n\n431\n00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.880\nI'm like, what the heck?\n\n432\n00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.030\nAnd a Windows update had occurred and\nit rebooted my system so\n\n433\n00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.870\nI'm back to the log-on screen.\n\n434\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.520\nSo I log on and\n\n435\n00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.000\ntypically you'll get a little message\nthat pops up in the system tray.\n\n436\n00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.340\nOr I can come into here and I can say,\noh look, there was a couple\n\n437\n00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:21.150\nof updates installed today, so\nthat's probably why my system rebooted.\n\n438\n00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.850\nSo I can come in here and look and\nsee what updates were installed.\n\n439\n00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:30.220\nMaybe, help desk is asking me, hey, have\nyou installed kb227602, well I don't know.\n\n440\n00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:35.060\nHey you can come in here and you say look\nsure enough I have installed that update.\n\n441\n00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.380\nAnd then they can help\nwith the troubleshooting.\n\n442\n00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:42.070\nWe can also choose to uninstall updates.\n\n443\n00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.700\nAlright?\n\n444\n00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.960\nNow if I choose uninstall updates it\nopens up my programs and features,\n\n445\n00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.540\nwhere we would normally go in and\nremove programs, and here I can see all of\n\n446\n00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:54.260\nthe updates, and I can simply select\nan update and click uninstall.\n\n447\n00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.810\nAnd that's gonna uninstall that Windows\nupdate, if the update supports removal.\n\n448\n00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:01.190\nNot all of them do.\n\n449\n00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:05.690\nAnd it better not take as long to,\nhopefully it will, there we go good.\n\n450\n00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.870\nIf it only took a second to install it\nbetter only take a second to uninstall.\n\n451\n00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:14.780\nLike this one, I know I've got one,\nnotice this one here,\n\n452\n00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.250\nmy uninstall button went away, right.\n\n453\n00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.240\nSome updates don't support removal.\n\n454\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.980\nOnce they're installed, that's it.\n\n455\n00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.460\nYou can't yank 'em out.\n\n456\n00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.380\nAll right?\n\n457\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.440\nSo, not every update supports it.\n\n458\n00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.320\nIf it does,\n\n459\n00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.140\nthe uninstall option will be there If\nit doesn't, the option won't be there.\n\n460\n00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.080\nIt's that simple.\n\n461\n00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.570\nSo, but if you want to try to uninstall\nand update, simple go into your update\n\n462\n00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.630\nsettings, click on your advanced settings,\nuninstall updates.\n\n463\n00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:39.400\nIt opens that window.\n\n464\n00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.610\nYou could actually,\nyou don't have to go this way.\n\n465\n00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:46.200\nYou could go to your ad remove programs,\nand then windows features, and\n\n466\n00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.500\nyou'll get that same\nlist of all the updates.\n\n467\n00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.650\nIt's nice though because\nif you go this way,\n\n468\n00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.910\nthat list is filtered to just updates,\nright?\n\n469\n00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.760\nIt's not gonna show you all the other\nstuff that's been installed, where you\n\n470\n00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.380\nhave to pick through and try to find the\nupdate you're, you're trying to remove.\n\n471\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.060\nAlright?\n\n472\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.430\nThere's a lot of cool things Danny\nthat I can do with updates there.\n\n473\n00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.220\nI'm trying to think if\nthere's anything else.\n\n474\n00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.290\nOh, choose how updates are delivered.\n\n475\n00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:11.610\nThis one, you know you can turn\nthis off if you don't want them\n\n476\n00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.010\nconnecting out to the internet.\n\n477\n00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.310\nIn other words,\nlike down here PC is in my local.\n\n478\n00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.070\nOh I'm sorry, this is a different option.\n\n479\n00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.560\nWe can share updates.\n\n480\n00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.890\nIn other words,\nother Windows machines can reach out and\n\n481\n00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:28.570\nget part of their update\nfrom your machine.\n\n482\n00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:32.070\nIf you've already downloaded it,\nthey can actually grab some of it.\n\n483\n00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.500\nOther computers that are on\nyour subnet can grab that.\n\n484\n00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.640\nAnd you can see PCs on my local\nnetwork is turned on by default.\n\n485\n00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.750\nI wanted to go to PCs on the Internet,\nI could turn that on.\n\n486\n00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:44.460\nI don't really like that idea,\nbut that could just be me.\n\n487\n00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.020\nAnd I can turn it off altogether, where\nnobody can pull updates from my machine.\n\n488\n00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.250\nSo depending on what you wanna do.\n\n489\n00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.738\nThe other thing I want to\nshow you about the updates,\n\n490\n00:23:57.738 --> 00:24:01.872\nthere's actually gonna be\nsome group policy settings,\n\n491\n00:24:01.872 --> 00:24:05.501\ncuz they do call these out\non the exam objectives.\n\n492\n00:24:05.501 --> 00:24:11.751\nSo I'm gonna do a little gpedit.msc,\nopen up my Local Policy Editor.\n\n493\n00:24:11.751 --> 00:24:15.413\nNow most of these in a corporate\nenvironment are gonna be set at the domain\n\n494\n00:24:15.413 --> 00:24:19.210\nlevel, so we're not gonna be dealing\nwith them locally, but they could.\n\n495\n00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:23.800\nIf you're in a soho or a small office\nwhere you don't have a domain,\n\n496\n00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.630\nmaybe you need to configure\nthe settings this way.\n\n497\n00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:31.140\nSo I can go into my Administrative\nTemplates, Windows Components, and\n\n498\n00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.910\nthen down towards the bottom\nwe're gonna find Windows Update.\n\n499\n00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.560\nAnd there's several settings,\nI won't go over every single one of them.\n\n500\n00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.250\nWhat I would recommend is that you,\nwhen you're studying for\n\n501\n00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:44.000\nthis exam,\ndo go through each one of these.\n\n502\n00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.430\nClick on one and\nthen take a look at the description,\n\n503\n00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.030\nthey give you a great bit\nof information over here.\n\n504\n00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.390\nThis is what's gonna\nhappen if you turn it on.\n\n505\n00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:54.800\nThis is what's going to happen if you\ndisable it or leave it not configured.\n\n506\n00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.960\nSo go do those, and read them and\nsee what's gonna happen.\n\n507\n00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:04.260\nSome of the more common ones that we use,\nconfigure automatic update.\n\n508\n00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.370\nThis one lets me choose, if I go ahead and\n\n509\n00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.030\nenable it,\nhow they're gonna get those updates.\n\n510\n00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:13.010\nAutomatically download and\ninstall, or just download them and\n\n511\n00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.310\ntell me when they're\nready to be installed.\n\n512\n00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.140\nIf I wanted to do that one.\n\n513\n00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.950\nThe other ones, there's a few good ones.\n\n514\n00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:26.250\nIf you're doing a WSUS\nserver on your network,\n\n515\n00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:31.440\nthen you need to point your machine to\nthat WSUS server to get its updates\n\n516\n00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.330\ninstead of getting them\nfrom Microsoft servers.\n\n517\n00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.050\nThis is again covered much more\nheavily in the server classes\n\n518\n00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:40.000\nbecause we'd be setting\nup that WSUS server.\n\n519\n00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.080\nBasically if you're not familiar with\nWSUS windows server update services\n\n520\n00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.240\nI can run a local update server.\n\n521\n00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.975\nBasically copy the updates from\nMicrosoft down to my local server,\n\n522\n00:25:49.975 --> 00:25:52.765\ngives me a chance to approve\nthe updates or deny them.\n\n523\n00:25:52.765 --> 00:25:56.015\nMaybe I wanna test them before all\nthe machines on my network go and\n\n524\n00:25:56.015 --> 00:25:57.455\ninstall them.\n\n525\n00:25:57.455 --> 00:25:59.452\nUsing WSUS I can do that.\n\n526\n00:25:59.452 --> 00:26:01.232\nWell if you're using that in the company,\n\n527\n00:26:01.232 --> 00:26:04.932\nthen your computer by default\nwants to go out to Microsoft.\n\n528\n00:26:04.932 --> 00:26:07.832\nAnd get updates that haven't\nbeen tested by your company,\n\n529\n00:26:07.832 --> 00:26:09.562\nwhich is probably not a good thing.\n\n530\n00:26:09.562 --> 00:26:12.730\nSo this is how you would tell it hey,\ndon't go out to Microsoft.\n\n531\n00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.100\nGo to this local server.\n\n532\n00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:19.452\nYou basically put in the web address for\nyour WSUS server here.\n\n533\n00:26:19.452 --> 00:26:24.350\nAnd it will go there instead and\nonly get approved updates.\n\n534\n00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.870\nAnother one that I like to point out,\n\n535\n00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.800\ndo not connect to any Windows\nupdate internet locations.\n\n536\n00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.490\nIf your company has gone through\nthe trouble of setting up a WSUS server,\n\n537\n00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.162\nthat means they want to\napprove the updates.\n\n538\n00:26:35.162 --> 00:26:37.950\nThey wanna test them and\nthen approve them or\n\n539\n00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.510\ndeny them depending on\nthe results of that test.\n\n540\n00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.350\nWell if I'm not careful, my Windows\nmachines will actually reach out to\n\n541\n00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.980\nMicrosoft every once in a while, even\nthough they've got a local update server.\n\n542\n00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.600\nThis would prevent them from doing that.\n\n543\n00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.740\nIt would say, you can't get updates\nfrom anywhere other than WSUS.\n\n544\n00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.770\nAnother good one that we would probably\nconfigure if we're using WSUS.\n\n545\n00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:05.220\nThere's also some settings that deal with\nwhether non administrators can receive\n\n546\n00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:10.640\nupdate notifications, whether we allow\nimmediate installations of updates or\n\n547\n00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.500\nif we get a little notification that says,\nthis needs to be installed, but\n\n548\n00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.920\nyou can defer the installation for\na few hours.\n\n549\n00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.940\nIf you wanna do recommended updates along\nwith your automatic updates like for\n\n550\n00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.275\nOffice and things like that.\n\n551\n00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:26.327\nIf it should re-prompt you.\n\n552\n00:27:26.327 --> 00:27:28.781\nIf you defer the updates\nto a restart later,\n\n553\n00:27:28.781 --> 00:27:31.380\ndoes it re-prompt you every so often?\n\n554\n00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.590\nIt lets you know you've\ngot updates waiting.\n\n555\n00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.950\nThere's also one in here,\nif you've ever seen this, when you\n\n556\n00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:40.620\nhave an update pending, it needs a reboot,\nand you go to your start menu and you're\n\n557\n00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.950\ngonna try to shut the system down, the\ndefault is actually update and shut down.\n\n558\n00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:47.032\nSo it's like, wait, I'm in a hurry.\n\n559\n00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:48.640\nI wanna shut that machine down, but\n\n560\n00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.620\nthe only thing listed\nthere is update shut down.\n\n561\n00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.890\nNow I've got to click that.\n\n562\n00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.110\nIt's got to finish its' update and\nyou get that nasty thing that says do not\n\n563\n00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:58.720\nturn off your computer or disconnect\nblah blah until this is finished.\n\n564\n00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.760\n>> And let me tell you what.\n\n565\n00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.770\nDon't turn it off until it's finished.\n\n566\n00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.740\nI've been down that road.\n\n567\n00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:03.452\nIt's not pretty.\n\n568\n00:28:03.452 --> 00:28:04.710\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n569\n00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:09.911\nSo, with this option here, where'd I go?\n\n570\n00:28:09.911 --> 00:28:10.411\nI lost it now.\n\n571\n00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.430\nWow, I actually lost the setting.\n\n572\n00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:19.299\nWhere'd it go?\nReschedule automatic updates,\n\n573\n00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:21.536\ndelay restart.\n\n574\n00:28:23.869 --> 00:28:27.661\nWow, there it is.\n\n575\n00:28:27.661 --> 00:28:29.362\nIf we turn these on anyway, sorry,\n\n576\n00:28:29.362 --> 00:28:32.660\nI lost the setting there amongst\nthe myriad of other settings.\n\n577\n00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.430\nAnyway, if we turn this on,\n\n578\n00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:37.250\nwhat will happen is,\nthey can get the shutdown option anyway.\n\n579\n00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.350\nAnd it'll have shut down and\nupdate and shut down,\n\n580\n00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:42.300\nso if I don't wanna start that\nupdate process, I'm in a hurry,\n\n581\n00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.930\nI need to close this laptop down,\nthe airplane is leaving.\n\n582\n00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.040\nI don't have time to wait for this update.\n\n583\n00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.210\nI can say, shutdown,\nit won't start that update process.\n\n584\n00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.930\nSo it just gives me that option,\nwhich I don't normally see, by default.\n\n585\n00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:53.990\nSo there's two of them.\n\n586\n00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.730\nDo not display the install updates and\nshutdown.\n\n587\n00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.680\nAnd adjust the default option\nto install updates and shutdown.\n\n588\n00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.060\nBoth of those would affect\nwhether it shows up,\n\n589\n00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.450\nand whether it's selected automatically.\n\n590\n00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.180\nA lot of different settings that you\ncan configure here with your group\n\n591\n00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.850\npolicy settings.\n\n592\n00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.070\nLike I said most of the time Daniel,\n\n593\n00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:14.520\nit's gonna be done at the corporate\nlevel because I'm not trying to\n\n594\n00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.650\nconfigure one machine,\nI'm configuring thousands of machines.\n\n595\n00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.910\nBut in the event that you need\nto configure one machine,\n\n596\n00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.900\nyou can use your local GPO to do that.\n\n597\n00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.420\n>> Yes it's a very, very handy thing.\n\n598\n00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.260\nIt's always good for us to be able to\nunderstand each of the features that\n\n599\n00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.180\nare built in to our operating systems, so\n\n600\n00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.240\nthat we can better control them\nin the way that we need to.\n\n601\n00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.150\nNow I'll tell you what,\nworking in a corporate environment and\n\n602\n00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:41.500\nin support in general, I'll tell you\nthat file the update history, huge.\n\n603\n00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.340\nThat is gonna help you out a lot\nbecause a lot of people will call and\n\n604\n00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.870\nsay I think one of your\nupdates broke my machine.\n\n605\n00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.170\nAnd then you look in the file history and\ngo well your machine hasn't updated in\n\n606\n00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:54.333\nsix days, so if it happened last night,\nit wasn't an update.\n\n607\n00:29:54.333 --> 00:29:55.990\n[LAUGH] So that's not it.\n\n608\n00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:57.500\nOr the opposite is true.\n\n609\n00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.340\nWell, did an update go out last night?\n\n610\n00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.760\nMaybe it did break your machine.\n\n611\n00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.020\nYou look and you see, oh yes, look.\n\n612\n00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.820\nYou did have an update go out last night.\n\n613\n00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.130\nMaybe it's the culprit.\n\n614\n00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:06.610\nNow we can uninstall that.\n\n615\n00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:08.510\nGo to that uninstall list.\n\n616\n00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.510\nUninstall that update.\n\n617\n00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:11.000\nSee if it fixes the issue.\n\n618\n00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.020\nIf it does, you know you've got\na problem with that update.\n\n619\n00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.370\nAnd you gotta go through the fixing,\nand see what Microsoft and\n\n620\n00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:19.430\nall that rigmarole, or if it doesn't,\nthen it's something else.\n\n621\n00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:20.840\nAnd you can work your way from there.\n\n622\n00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.900\nSo it's nice to have both\nof those features built in.\n\n623\n00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:26.940\nAnd I appreciate it with Windows 10,\nthey are all about updates.\n\n624\n00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:31.230\nSo it is not an option really whether or\nnot, you're going to do updates anymore.\n\n625\n00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.700\nIt's, you're gonna do updates,\nit's just a matter of whether or\n\n626\n00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.470\nnot you want me to tell you\nI'm doing updates or not.\n\n627\n00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.380\nThat's basically how they're getting down.\n\n628\n00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.752\nThe only way to get around\ninstalling updates or\n\n629\n00:30:41.752 --> 00:30:45.770\ndownloading them is to actually be\non a wi-fi network that is metered.\n\n630\n00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:49.160\nThat cause you might be eating up a data\nplan that you don't wanna eat up.\n\n631\n00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.352\nAnd that's the only way to get\nthem to stop downloading updates.\n\n632\n00:30:52.352 --> 00:30:55.580\nOtherwise, they're hard charged and\npushing those updates.\n\n633\n00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.530\nAnd for a very good reason.\n\n634\n00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:57.920\nIt keeps your system safe.\n\n635\n00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.190\nSo learn how to use your updates.\n\n636\n00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.870\nMike, great demonstrations there.\n\n637\n00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:04.800\nShowed us plenty of features that\nyou can sink your teeth into\n\n638\n00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.130\nto understand this system.\n\n639\n00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.910\nSo hopefully you'll do that.\n\n640\n00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.930\nMike, have we left\nanything out of this show?\n\n641\n00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:10.970\n>> I think we covered it all.\n\n642\n00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.090\n>> All right, well thanks for\nwatching today.\n\n643\n00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:14.500\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n644\n00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.410\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n645\n00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:17.260\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n646\n00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.869\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n647\n00:31:20.869 --> 00:31:25.230\n[SOUND]\n\n",
