          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,409\n[NOISE] We want to take a moment to talk\n\n2\n00:00:05,409 --> 00:00:10,254\nabout the 70-680 exam and\n\n3\n00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:14,745\nwhat it means to you, right.\n\n4\n00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:16,102\nSo Windows 7 and you.\n\n5\n00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:16,614\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n6\n00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:19,310\n>> For those of you that are seeking\n\n7\n00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,090\nthe knowledge and\nvalidation that shows that you're aware\n\n8\n00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,910\nof how to work with Windows 7, well, the\nMicrosoft 70-680 exam is the one for you.\n\n9\n00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,960\nThis exam covers a wide variety of\ntopics pertaining to Windows 7,\n\n10\n00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,510\nand not just Windows 7 in terms of\nhow to use it like end user style,\n\n11\n00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,360\nbut network administrator style.\n\n12\n00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,940\nSo how to install and deploy Windows 7,\nhow to manage and maintain Windows 7 and\n\n13\n00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,310\nhow to secure it and\nkeep it operational in your environment.\n\n14\n00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,730\nThis is valuable information that anybody\nis going to need to work in a corporate or\n\n15\n00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,344\nenterprise environment where you're\nsupporting Windows 7 workstations.\n\n16\n00:00:56,602 --> 00:00:58,840\nAll right, so\nto get an idea of what the exam is like,\n\n17\n00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,990\nlet's take a look at the official\nMicrosoft page for the exam.\n\n18\n00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,470\nSo I've got it pulled up right here,\n\n19\n00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,140\nand you'll see some basic\ninformation about it.\n\n20\n00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,210\nThe actual title for\nthe exam is Windows 7, Configuring.\n\n21\n00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,460\nWhy they reversed these\nthings is beyond me.\n\n22\n00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,860\nBut it's nice because it is one set of\nobjectives, one exam, one certification.\n\n23\n00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,010\nWhen you pass this exam,\nyou get the MCTS, or\n\n24\n00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,590\nMicrosoft Certified Technology Specialist,\nin Windows 7.\n\n25\n00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:32,420\nThe exam objectives cover a variety of\nthings, and they break it down here.\n\n26\n00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,950\nLet me just collapse all these so\nwe can get the overviews.\n\n27\n00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,730\nAnd what you'll see looking at the list,\nis we've got things,\n\n28\n00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,700\nvery basic, installing, upgrading and\nmigrating to Windows 7.\n\n29\n00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,670\nAll right, well,\ninstalling Windows 7 is not very hard.\n\n30\n00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,120\nBut we'll see there's a variety of\nways to do it, and a variety of\n\n31\n00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,700\nconcerns we have depending on what\noperating system we may be coming from.\n\n32\n00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,657\nIf we're coming from Windows XP or\nVista or wherever, right?\n\n33\n00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,610\nWe'll also see other things\nlike Deploying Windows 7.\n\n34\n00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,140\nThis is talking about\nimage-based deployment.\n\n35\n00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,220\nSo if you've got a thousand workstations\nyou need to install Windows 7 on,\n\n36\n00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,920\nhow can we do that.\n\n37\n00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,560\n>> We also have the idea\nof configuring hardware and\n\n38\n00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,340\nother compatibility issues for us too.\n\n39\n00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,000\nA lot of times when you are actually\na network administrator,\n\n40\n00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,580\nyou're moving from earlier operating\nsystems and earlier applications and\n\n41\n00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,650\nwe need to make sure that we can\nensure that they work with Windows 7.\n\n42\n00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,471\nAnd so it gives us some different ways\nto be able to troubleshoot them and\n\n43\n00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:31,270\nto evaluate them and\n\n44\n00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,430\nsee if they're actually gonna be\nappropriate for our Windows 7 environment.\n\n45\n00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:37,650\n>> Yep.\n\n46\n00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,385\nAs well as we continue to move on.\n\n47\n00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:41,340\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yep, sorry.\n\n48\n00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,830\n>> I have no idea what's happened here.\n\n49\n00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,390\nBut my mouse is no longer working.\n\n50\n00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:50,730\n[LAUGH] It's lighting up, but it's not-\n>> Oh, yeah, it's not letting you click.\n\n51\n00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,345\n>> Yeah, I don't understand what I've\ndone, and I can't scroll anymore.\n\n52\n00:02:54,345 --> 00:03:01,715\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like that web page locked up.\n\n53\n00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,450\nCuz outside of the browser\nit's working just fine, but\n\n54\n00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,890\ninside of the browser it was dead.\n\n55\n00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,689\nYou know what I might do?\n\n56\n00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,013\nI could probably just pull up,\nwell, no those are our own notes.\n\n57\n00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:13,230\nAll right.\n\n58\n00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,495\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:24,184\n>> Okay, Jason.\n\n60\n00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,740\nWe were only what,\nlike a minute or two into that?\n\n61\n00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,770\nWhy don't we just restart?\n\n62\n00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,270\n>> All right.\n\n63\n00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:40,200\n[COUGH] [LAUGH]\n>> Do you have it sorted out, or\n\n64\n00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,093\nwere you gonna?\n\n65\n00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:43,438\n>> Well, yeah it's working now.\n\n66\n00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:45,615\nWe'll see if it [CROSSTALK]\n>> If not,\n\n67\n00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:47,815\nI've got mine up on the same page so.\n\n68\n00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:48,419\n>> Okay, all right.\n\n69\n00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,011\n>> Maybe we can.\n\n70\n00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:52,052\n>> So, if I do like a thumbs down or\nwhatever,\n\n71\n00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:55,942\nwe'll cut to Ronnie's,\nbut otherwise I've got it.\n\n72\n00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:57,022\nOkay.\n\n73\n00:03:57,022 --> 00:03:58,496\nTake two.\n\n74\n00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:06,819\n[MUSIC]\n\n75\n00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:11,574\nIn this video we're gonna take\na look at the Microsoft 70-680 exam,\n\n76\n00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:14,800\nwhich is the Windows 7 configuring exam.\n\n77\n00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,190\nI like to refer to this as the show\nthat almost wasn't, right?\n\n78\n00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,680\nWhen ITProTV launched,\nwe launched in October of 2013,\n\n79\n00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,510\nand Windows 8 had just come out, and\nwe launched our Windows 8 training, and\n\n80\n00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,980\nwe said, you know what,\nlet's not go backwards.\n\n81\n00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,620\nLet's not do older software, older shows.\n\n82\n00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,190\nLet's just focus on\nthe newer technologies.\n\n83\n00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,250\nBut we've gotten such a demand for\nWindows 7, there's so\n\n84\n00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,455\nmany people out there\nthat still use it and\n\n85\n00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:47,530\nit's their mainstream OS that we really\ndo need to go back and cover it.\n\n86\n00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,860\nAnd so to do that we've brought in this\nshow right here, the Windows 7 show.\n\n87\n00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,230\nWe're gonna be tackling the 70-680 exam,\nwhich is one of the nicer ones because\n\n88\n00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,600\nit's one set of objectives,\none exam, one certification.\n\n89\n00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,930\nWhen you pass the 70-680 exam,\nyou get the MCTS in Windows 7 configuring.\n\n90\n00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,300\nThat's the Microsoft Certified\nTechnology Specialist.\n\n91\n00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,840\nIt's a quick certification.\n\n92\n00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,740\nYou jump in, you pass it,\nyou get it on your resume.\n\n93\n00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,720\nIt's a real benefit.\n\n94\n00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,570\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat some of the objectives that\n\n95\n00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,460\nare on this exam that are things that\nwe're gonna be covering in this show.\n\n96\n00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,780\nWell, the exam itself starts out where\nyou would logically think it would,\n\n97\n00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,850\ninstalling and upgrading, well,\nand migrating, to Windows 7.\n\n98\n00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,280\nIf you've got Windows XP,\nWindows Vista and\n\n99\n00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,940\nyou want to get on Windows 7,\nhow do you do it?\n\n100\n00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,640\nHow do you install it, how do you upgrade?\n\n101\n00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,920\nAnd so\nthat's were we kind of begin the show.\n\n102\n00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,240\n>> The second objective that you\nactually talk about here is the idea of\n\n103\n00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,600\ndeploying Windows 7.\n\n104\n00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,960\nNow if you're a standalone user you may\nnot have heard this term before, but\n\n105\n00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,860\nif you've been working in\nthe IT industry at all\n\n106\n00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,600\nwe tend to actually do what we\ncall image-based deployment.\n\n107\n00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,470\nAnd so in here we actually show\nhow to actually create an image.\n\n108\n00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,870\nHow do we add in information\nto that image, and\n\n109\n00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,370\nhow do we actually end up\npushing it out to computers.\n\n110\n00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:04,970\n>> Yeah.\n\n111\n00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,820\nAnd you know, the first one,\nthe first module,\n\n112\n00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,850\nthat's really talking about one machine.\n\n113\n00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,510\nBut the second module, that is hundreds,\nthousands of machines, right?\n\n114\n00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,160\nYou may have a very,\nvery large environment.\n\n115\n00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,350\nThe third section is configuring\nhardware and applications.\n\n116\n00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,720\nSo you've got Windows 7 installed,\nwhat do you do now?\n\n117\n00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,820\nWell, you likely have unique hardware,\nno two computers, well that's\n\n118\n00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,910\nnot necessarily true, but most computers\nhave [LAUGH] various configurations.\n\n119\n00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,310\nBut you also have various applications\nthat you use as part of your business and\n\n120\n00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,700\nyour day to day operations.\n\n121\n00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,230\nSo how do we get those configured,\n\n122\n00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,330\nhow do we get them running,\nand how do we support them?\n\n123\n00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,180\n>> And the next session here on\nconfiguring network connectivity.\n\n124\n00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,040\nThis is basic networking to ensure that\nour Windows 7 environment will again run\n\n125\n00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,450\non top of our infrastructure, making sure\nthat we're familiar not only with the IPv4\n\n126\n00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,490\ntechnologies, but as well as getting\nintroduced to the IPv6 technologies as\n\n127\n00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,770\nwell since we're actually moving fast\ntoward that particular migration.\n\n128\n00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,600\n>> All right, the next section is\nconfiguring access to resources.\n\n129\n00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,910\nIf you have files on your computer and\n\n130\n00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,960\nyou wanna share them with other people,\nhow do you do it?\n\n131\n00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,170\nIf you have a printer and\n\n132\n00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,820\nyou wanna make that printer available to\nmore than one machine, how do you do that?\n\n133\n00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,393\nSo we take a look at Windows 7 in\na workgroup or domain environment,\n\n134\n00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:23,470\nwhere we're sharing resources between\nsystems, and whenever you do that,\n\n135\n00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,014\nyou need to control access, so how do you\nlimit people's access to those resources?\n\n136\n00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,935\n>> Our next bigger objective here,\n\n137\n00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:34,395\non configuring mobile computing really\ndives into the world of a couple of new\n\n138\n00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:38,729\ntechnologies that again introduced\nwith Windows 7 and Server 2008.\n\n139\n00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:42,550\nWe talk a little bit about a technology\nthat we call BitLocker and\n\n140\n00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,410\nBitLocker To Go, as well as the idea\nof actually using direct access too.\n\n141\n00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,061\nAnd so along with that,\nof course, is the fast moving and\n\n142\n00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:53,685\nfast diving world of Windows mobility.\n\n143\n00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:54,875\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n144\n00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,460\nYeah, these are all topics that\nreally pertain to laptop users.\n\n145\n00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,190\nPeople who might not be at the office,\nthey might be at home or out in the field.\n\n146\n00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,400\nMore and more people have laptops\ninstead of desktops, and so\n\n147\n00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,520\nMicrosoft has a dedicated\nsection addressing that.\n\n148\n00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,230\nAll right, next is monitoring and\nmaintaining systems that run Windows 7.\n\n149\n00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,290\nOnce we get everything set up and\noperational, how do we keep it that way?\n\n150\n00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,740\nHow do we recognize when\nthere's problems on the system?\n\n151\n00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,770\nHow do we know if our system is\nrunning slower than it used to or\n\n152\n00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,040\nif we just feel like it's running slower?\n\n153\n00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,210\nSo how do we monitor that,\n\n154\n00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,330\nhow do we maintain, how do we keep\nthat system running in tip-top shape?\n\n155\n00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,130\n>> Yeah.\n\n156\n00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,760\nAnd lastly of course is actually\nrealizing that at some point sometime,\n\n157\n00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,300\nhardware may fail us,\nif not will fail us here.\n\n158\n00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,870\nAnd so here we talk about the idea of\nactually being able to take a look\n\n159\n00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,620\nat some of the recovery options that have\nalways again been inside of Windows, and\n\n160\n00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,950\nespecially focusing in on the idea\nof backing up our computers.\n\n161\n00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,970\n>> Yeah, probably one of\nthe most important topics, right?\n\n162\n00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,370\nBecause when things fail and\n\n163\n00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,920\nthings go south, how fast can you get\nthem back up and operational again?\n\n164\n00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,600\nThat's what we tackle right up there.\n\n165\n00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,240\nAll right?\n\n166\n00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,330\nSo that's kind of a highlight\nof the Windows 7 objectives, and\n\n167\n00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,520\nyou'll see that these are these\nare a lot more than just,\n\n168\n00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,530\nhow do you fire up Internet Explorer,\nhow do you do end user stuff?\n\n169\n00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,760\nThis is, how do we run Windows 7 in\na corporate or enterprise environment?\n\n170\n00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,720\nThis is valuable knowledge for anybody\nwho wants to be a network administrator,\n\n171\n00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,290\na desktop engineer, even help desk.\n\n172\n00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,750\nThis is really where you get\nyour foundational knowledge for\n\n173\n00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,100\nhelp desk operations.\n\n174\n00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,340\nSo really good information\nto be found here.\n\n175\n00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,820\nIt's a great certification and it does\ngive you that foundational knowledge you\n\n176\n00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,090\nneed to deploy Windows 7 in a business.\n\n177\n00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,873\n>> Right.\n\n178\n00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,865\n>> All right, well, if that sounds like\nsomething that you're interested in,\n\n179\n00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:40,464\nstay tuned because we've\ngot more shows coming for\n\n180\n00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:43,138\nWindows 7 as we jump through\nall of our objectives.\n\n181\n00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:44,522\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening, and\n\n5\n00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:38,610\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,360\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\nToday with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,520\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,530\n>> I'm quite sad this morning.\n\n9\n00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,150\n>> I hear.\n\n10\n00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:51,320\n>> And I was not invited to\nKim Kardashian's son's birthday party.\n\n11\n00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,120\n>> Wasn't he just born?\n\n12\n00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,970\n>> Yes.\n\n13\n00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,000\nThey already had a birthday party?\n\n14\n00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,585\n>> Yes.\n>> They got him on the fast track.\n\n15\n00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:57,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna have four birthday parties\n\n16\n00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,400\na year, every quarter.\n\n17\n00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,540\nWell you know what Ronnie?\n\n18\n00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,900\nI wasn't invited either.\n\n19\n00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,960\n>> Yeah well, we're not on the in.\n\n20\n00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,000\n>> [LAUGH] Well that's all right\nbecause had we been at the Kardashian's\n\n21\n00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,490\nwe would not had time to have gotten\nready for today's amazing show.\n\n22\n00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,620\nWe are launching,\nthis is our first episode of Windows 7.\n\n23\n00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,447\nWindows 7 configuring I suppose, and\n\n24\n00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:23,110\nI said it in our little\nintro we shot earlier.\n\n25\n00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,830\nThis is like the show that almost wasn't.\n\n26\n00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,380\nWe really didn't have any intention on\ngoing back and filming some of the older\n\n27\n00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,860\noperating systems when we launched\nWindows 8 was already out and\n\n28\n00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,700\nwe figured people want to learn\nthe new stuff, not the old stuff.\n\n29\n00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,400\nBut Windows 7 is so\nprevalent in business environments,\n\n30\n00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,880\nit is the most common operating\nsystem out there in businesses.\n\n31\n00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,660\nAnd with Windows XP going end of life and\n\n32\n00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,040\nend of support,\npeople are moving to Windows 7 in droves.\n\n33\n00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,510\nSo it's big, it's important.\n\n34\n00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,210\nAnd so, here we are.\n\n35\n00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,330\nWe're going to make sure we cover it so\nyou guys get the information you need.\n\n36\n00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,260\n>> If it wasn't for the very fact that\nwe were getting a lot of emails on this,\n\n37\n00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,442\nwe probably would've said yeah,\nwe'll just let it fade,\n\n38\n00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:07,140\nbut because of viewers like you asking for\nmore\n\n39\n00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,890\nwe've decided that this is a good time and\ngood opportunity for us to cover it.\n\n40\n00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:17,066\nAnd to help us out to really help you\nout is what we want, so there we go.\n\n41\n00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:22,113\n>> So when the amount of requests for\na show exceeds the amount\n\n42\n00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:26,972\nof Nate hate mail that's when [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] we start to tip the scales\n\n43\n00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:28,740\na little bit, that's right.\n\n44\n00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,272\n>> Or Don hate mail, I suppose.\n\n45\n00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:31,890\nAnyhow.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n46\n00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,520\n>> All right, so\n\n47\n00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,360\nlet's take a look at Windows 7.\n\n48\n00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,840\nWe're gonna be jumping right off in\nthe first set of objectives today which is\n\n49\n00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,110\ninstalling, upgrading, and\nmigrating to Windows 7.\n\n50\n00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,230\nSo, let's just do a high-level\nlook at this objective real quick\n\n51\n00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,050\nbecause it's kind of\nbroken into three pieces.\n\n52\n00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,570\nWe start off with what's\nprobably the most important,\n\n53\n00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,280\nwhich is performing a clean installation,\njust how do we install Windows 7 and\n\n54\n00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,730\nget it up and running on a new machine or\na blank machine?\n\n55\n00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,240\nThen we're going to tackle upgrading\nto Windows 7, because you're likely\n\n56\n00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,970\ncoming from some previous operating\nsystem, and so what are some of the things\n\n57\n00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,070\nwe need to be aware of there, and\nother kind of issues that creep up.\n\n58\n00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,420\nAnd then lastly we're gonna talk\nabout migrating our user profiles.\n\n59\n00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,600\nWhen we talk an upgrade, we're\ntalking about taking one computer and\n\n60\n00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,420\nupgrading it to Windows 7 basically,\nchanging the operating system on it.\n\n61\n00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,165\nWhen we talk about migrating that's moving\nfrom one physical computer to another\n\n62\n00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:25,965\nphysical computer.\n\n63\n00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:29,805\nSo, you've got this old,\nantiquated Windows XP machine and\n\n64\n00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:32,345\nyou're replacing it with a nice,\nnew Windows 7 machine.\n\n65\n00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,355\nTwo separate computers.\n\n66\n00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:34,325\nHow do you get your data between them?\n\n67\n00:03:35,535 --> 00:03:38,765\nSo, those are the three things\nthat we're likely gonna tackle in\n\n68\n00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:41,175\nthis episode unless I ramble on too much.\n\n69\n00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:42,385\nSo, that's kinda our plan.\n\n70\n00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:46,730\n>> All right so, as we begin here we want\nto make sure that we understand that,\n\n71\n00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,260\neven though we might say, Ronnie,\n\n72\n00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,940\nwhat we're about to talk about is\nthe easiest thing ever, right?\n\n73\n00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,430\nWe just have to get the Windows 7 DVD,\ntoss it in the machine, and\n\n74\n00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,590\nwe're ready to go.\n\n75\n00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,300\nAnd, really,\nthere's not a lot more to that, except for\n\n76\n00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,560\nthe very fact that sometimes you may\nactually have machines in your environment\n\n77\n00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,020\nthat may not actually have the hardware\nport requirements to support it.\n\n78\n00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,468\nYou gotta make sure at least we\nsupport these hardware requirements.\n\n79\n00:04:09,468 --> 00:04:12,430\n>> And I've got the hardware requirements\npulled up right here and like always,\n\n80\n00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,650\nMicrosoft releases kind of\ntwo sets of information.\n\n81\n00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,890\nThere's the minimum requirements and\nthe recommended requirements.\n\n82\n00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,440\nSo at a bare minimum what do you need\njust to get Windows 7 installed?\n\n83\n00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,448\nNow, I'll tell you guys for the exam\nyou need to know to the minimum, but\n\n84\n00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:30,737\nin real life land the minimum\nIt's literally the minimum,\n\n85\n00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,010\nwhat you need to run Windows 7,\nand no other software.\n\n86\n00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,600\n>> Nothing.\n\n87\n00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,830\n>> So when you look at this you'll\nsee pretty low requirements, right?\n\n88\n00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,010\nRequirements that they don't even make\ncomputers that are these low anymore, so\n\n89\n00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,660\na 1 gigaHertz CPU or faster.\n\n90\n00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,895\nAnd they're talking about single-core\nThey're not even talking about\n\n91\n00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:49,220\nmulti-core here.\n\n92\n00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,660\nAnd basically they want it to be 32-bit or\n64-bit.\n\n93\n00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,010\nWindows 7 comes in both editions.\n\n94\n00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,030\nThey also want you have at\nleast one gigabyte of RAM for\n\n95\n00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,180\na 32-bit system, two gigabytes of RAM for\na 64-bit system.\n\n96\n00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,780\nKeep in mind here that on the 32-bit side,\n\n97\n00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,850\nyou'll only be able to address\nup to three gigabytes of RAM.\n\n98\n00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,630\nIf you want more than three,\nyou pretty much have to go 64-bit anyway.\n\n99\n00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,720\nAll right, we've also got 16\ngigabytes of hard drive space for\n\n100\n00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,500\nthe 32-bit OS, and\n20 gigabytes for the 64-bit OS.\n\n101\n00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,680\nSo you need some hard drive space.\n\n102\n00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,700\nNow those are pretty small, 16,\n20 gigs, it's not really much anymore.\n\n103\n00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,510\nBut if you've got an older computer you\nmight not have a ton of hard drive space.\n\n104\n00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,310\nAnd then lastly they recommend\na video card that has\n\n105\n00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:42,230\nDirectX 9 graphics capabilities\nwith a WDDM 1.0 or higher driver.\n\n106\n00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,840\nThat's the Windows Device Driver or\nmanagement or something like that.\n\n107\n00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,790\nThe WDDM the standard driver\ndefinitions set that Microsoft releases\n\n108\n00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,200\nYou need to have a driver\nthat's compatible with that.\n\n109\n00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,680\nIt doesn't mean you need\na 3D graphics card.\n\n110\n00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,120\nIf you do, there are some things\nyou can take advantage of.\n\n111\n00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,150\nBut if you have an older,\njust 2D business graphics card, or\n\n112\n00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,350\nan integrated, like Intel usually has\nit integrated with the processors,\n\n113\n00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,530\nthen those will work fine, too.\n\n114\n00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,520\n>> Yeah, just about any computer\nthat you would buy today\n\n115\n00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,620\nwill probably meet these\nbigger requirements.\n\n116\n00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,840\nAnd so we're not really focusing in so\nmuch on that but remember for\n\n117\n00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,600\nthe exam though, if you are actually\ngoing to be doing some of the installing,\n\n118\n00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,330\nespecially migrating from machines that\nmay have been running previous editions\n\n119\n00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,970\nsuch as Windows XP, you may actually\nhave to take the challenge here and\n\n120\n00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,330\nmake sure that you know these to ensure\nfor a smooth installation of what we have.\n\n121\n00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,660\nSo don't overlook it for the sake of the\nexam, but if you have purchased computers\n\n122\n00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,980\nin the last I'm going to say five years,\nyou probably will need these.\n\n123\n00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,270\n>> Now, Ronnie, let's talk for a minute on\nthe difference between 32 and and 64-bit.\n\n124\n00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,420\nMore and more today,\n\n125\n00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,430\nsystems are being moved over to 64-bit, so\nthat's pretty much become the standard.\n\n126\n00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,410\nBut let's say you're at that tipping\npoint, you're trying to make a decision.\n\n127\n00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,380\nWhat's the difference?\n\n128\n00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,070\nWell when we talk about the bits,\nwe're talking about\n\n129\n00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,570\nhow many simultaneous bits can be\nsent into your CPU at the same time.\n\n130\n00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,470\nAnd this determines the largest\nnumber that you can address and\n\n131\n00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,740\nseveral other things.\n\n132\n00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,000\nIn a 32 bit system you basically\nhave 32 bits of data that you can\n\n133\n00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,240\nsend into your CPU at once.\n\n134\n00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,210\nA 64-bit system, like the name implies,\nis twice as much.\n\n135\n00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,510\nSo 64-bit processors\ngive us the ability to\n\n136\n00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,950\nhandle much larger addressing\nsizes than previous versions.\n\n137\n00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:30,379\nThe main place we see the difference is\nthe amount of RAM that we can handle.\n\n138\n00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:36,077\nA 32-bit system, well,\nif we take Microsoft out of picture\n\n139\n00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:42,109\na 32-bit system can actually\naddress up to 4 gigabytes of RAM.\n\n140\n00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:46,113\nBut in the Microsoft world, some of that\nRAM is assigned to other things, and\n\n141\n00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:48,530\nso they actually trim\nit down to 3 gigabytes.\n\n142\n00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:54,667\nSo on the exam, the 32-bit system\ncan only address 3 gigabytes of RAM.\n\n143\n00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:58,681\nIf you want more,\nyou have to go to a 64-bit OS, and\n\n144\n00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:02,083\na 64-bit OS can address Terabytes of RAM.\n\n145\n00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:06,320\nI think it's artificially set at 1TB.\n\n146\n00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,080\nMicrosoft just says,\n\n147\n00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,140\nhey we've tested up to 1TB of RAM,\nwithe haven't tested beyond that.\n\n148\n00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,710\nSo they set this arbitrary limit,\nbut it is a ton of memory.\n\n149\n00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,770\nMore than what you can\nreally buy right now.\n\n150\n00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,980\nWell without going completely broke.\n\n151\n00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,894\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's our primary difference,\n\n152\n00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:26,688\nthere are a few other differences, right?\n\n153\n00:08:26,688 --> 00:08:27,900\n>> Go ahead.\n\n154\n00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,340\n>> So 64 bit, with the 64-bit OS,\nMicrosoft had to rewrite the kernel,\n\n155\n00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,410\nthe Windows kernel.\n\n156\n00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,920\nSo they created a special 64bit kernel and\n\n157\n00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,580\nthat's that underlying piece\nthat drives all of Windows.\n\n158\n00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,480\nWindows really all kind of focuses\ndown into this one little piece\n\n159\n00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,780\ncalled the kernel.\n\n160\n00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,540\nWhen they rewrote it for\n64-bit architectures, they said,\n\n161\n00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,690\nhey while we're in here,\nlet's bump up some security.\n\n162\n00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,540\nAnd they put some neat new security\nfeatures in the 64 bit kernel that make it\n\n163\n00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:59,510\na lot more resilient to viruses,\nboot sector attacks, Trojans, rootkits.\n\n164\n00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,980\nRootkits, very difficult to\npull off on the 64-bit OS.\n\n165\n00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,240\nSo it is a much more secure\nversion of the operating system,\n\n166\n00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,910\nbut there is a downside to it.\n\n167\n00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,259\nHardware manufacturers,\nfor years and years,\n\n168\n00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:17,330\nhave been releasing drivers\nthat have been 32 bit drivers.\n\n169\n00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,070\nWith the 64-bit OS,\nthey have to release 64-bit drivers.\n\n170\n00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,680\nSeparate drivers, right, and\n\n171\n00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,350\nsome hardware manufacturers\nare still catching up to that.\n\n172\n00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,147\nSo if you have legacy hardware, old\nhardware that you're trying to support,\n\n173\n00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:31,230\nyou may not have 64-bit drivers.\n\n174\n00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,360\nYou may have to go with\nthe 32-bit version of Windows.\n\n175\n00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,070\nBut if you don't,\nif you've got newer hardware,\n\n176\n00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,260\nif it's your choice,\nyou really should go with 64 bit.\n\n177\n00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,240\nThat's the way that Microsoft is going,\nthat's the way that you should go.\n\n178\n00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,912\n>> Now, Don, I've seen, though, when you\nactually do take a look at the Windows 7\n\n179\n00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:53,146\nrequirements, you see something\ncalled an IA64 and an X86, X64.\n\n180\n00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:54,840\nIs there a real big difference?\n\n181\n00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,965\nI know that we're moving\naway from that IA64.\n\n182\n00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,480\n>> Yeah, IA64 is the Intel Itanium\nprocessors, right?\n\n183\n00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,528\nSo Intel had this 64-bit processor,\nthey put it in the market in 2003 or\n\n184\n00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:11,315\nsomething like that and\nit did not do well.\n\n185\n00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:14,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You do not see many Itanium systems out\n\n186\n00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,646\nthere, it just didn't sell very well\n>> So it kind of collapsed.\n\n187\n00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:22,870\nAnd then AMD released their own 64-bit\narchitecture and that did sell well.\n\n188\n00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,650\nThat really did skyrocket.\n\n189\n00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:31,060\nSo when you look at requirements like this\nwhere you see 32-bit and then it says x86,\n\n190\n00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:39,020\nthat's indicating the Intel X86 or\n386, 486, and so on.\n\n191\n00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,328\nThat's their standard Intel architecture.\n\n192\n00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:43,710\nBut with 64-bit, they say x64,\n\n193\n00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,870\nand that's kind of a misnomer\nbecause it's actually AMD64.\n\n194\n00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,480\nAnd so any CPU out there that's\nAMD64-compatible will work with this.\n\n195\n00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,510\nWell, Intel licensed the AMD 64\narchitecture from AMD, and so\n\n196\n00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,480\npretty much any Intel processor's going to\nfall in that unless it's labeled Itanium,\n\n197\n00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,850\nso watch out for that.\n\n198\n00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,100\nTo my knowledge, I don't think they\never did release an Itanium version of\n\n199\n00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,440\nthe desktop operating system,\nthey did of the server ones though.\n\n200\n00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,850\nSo just be aware if your physical\nprocessor is an Itanium It's not going to\n\n201\n00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:19,320\nwork with the 64-bit version of Windows 7.\n\n202\n00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,480\nHardware wise, what do we really need?\n\n203\n00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,030\nLet's just kind of boil it down.\n\n204\n00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:27,340\nWe need a processor that's a gig or\nhigher, we need at least a gig of RAM.\n\n205\n00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,070\nWe need a hard drive with 20GB\nof hard drive space on it,\n\n206\n00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,110\nand we need some way to install our media.\n\n207\n00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,970\nSo down here,\n\n208\n00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,690\nunder additional requirements, you'll see\nDVD/CD, well they're saying authoring.\n\n209\n00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,040\nBut somewhere in here\nit'll mention DVD and\n\n210\n00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,330\nCD, just to do the install,\njust to install the operating system.\n\n211\n00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,635\nYou can install Windows 7 through a number\nof other media, we'll talk about it later,\n\n212\n00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:56,396\nlike network, USB, or whatever.\n\n213\n00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:58,850\nBut the default way is with a DVD.\n\n214\n00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,800\nPop a DVD in your drive,\nand do the install.\n\n215\n00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,210\n>> Yeah.\nNow here at the bottom,\n\n216\n00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,320\nthey also mention the idea of\nmulti-core processors as well.\n\n217\n00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,990\nRemember that really, for us,\n\n218\n00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,700\nwe kind of set the minimum requirements\nat single-core processors.\n\n219\n00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,000\nMost of the time today, though, you're\ngonna find multiple core processors for\n\n220\n00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,980\nus as well.\n\n221\n00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,730\nAnd so Windows 7 does support\nmultiple core processors.\n\n222\n00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,640\nSome of the editions will\nactually support, I think,\n\n223\n00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,510\nup to physical processors.\n\n224\n00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,950\nI think the earlier, the more entry level,\nonly support one physical processor\n\n225\n00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,260\nin what we'll see\n>> Yeah and\n\n226\n00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,390\na lot of these are artificial\nlimits that Microsoft does set.\n\n227\n00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,760\nYeah, they kind of hold those desktop\nOS systems to two physical processors.\n\n228\n00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,272\nNot such a big deal anymore\nthanks to these multi-core ones.\n\n229\n00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:38,847\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n230\n00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:43,945\nyou'll see a 32-bit version of Windows 7\nthat can support up to 32 processor cores,\n\n231\n00:12:43,945 --> 00:12:45,563\nwhich not many people have.\n\n232\n00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:48,600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The 64-bit version can go to 256\n\n233\n00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,050\nprocessor cores,\nthey're ridiculous numbers.\n\n234\n00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,105\nOn the market today you'll\ncommonly find dual-core, so two.\n\n235\n00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:59,410\nYou'll find quad-core, and you'll find\neight-way, the eight-core systems.\n\n236\n00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,730\nAnd there's some six-core,\nhave you seen those Ronnie?\n\n237\n00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,313\nSo there's a few of those.\n\n238\n00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:03,950\n>> Yes, a few AMDs with six cores.\n\n239\n00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,000\n>> But you're really not seeing any\nwith more than eight on the market,\n\n240\n00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,910\nat least not for consumer and desktop use.\n\n241\n00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,860\nSo keep that in mind, they mention the\nmultiple physical processors down here.\n\n242\n00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,800\nAnd it says, like commercial servers,\n\n243\n00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,050\nand workstations, may have more than one\nphysical CPU, but most people don't.\n\n244\n00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,210\nThen right here, is what Ronnie was\nsaying, Windows 7 Starter Home Basic, and\n\n245\n00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:31,240\nHome Premium, will recognize only\none physical processor, right?\n\n246\n00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,430\nIf you have more than\none they'll ignore it.\n\n247\n00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,000\nYou really have to go up to Windows 7,\nthe Business or Enterprise,\n\n248\n00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,418\nto be able to get multiple ones,\nso little bit of variety there.\n\n249\n00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:44,230\nAnd that kinda makes me think,\n\n250\n00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,490\nlet me make sure we're not getting\nout of order with the objectives.\n\n251\n00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,060\nYou know they don't really mention\nit here, so let's do this, Ronnie.\n\n252\n00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,540\nThere is more than one\nedition of Windows 7, right?\n\n253\n00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,410\nSo when you go to buy Windows 7, you walk\ninto the store, you go to that shelf.\n\n254\n00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,500\nWell, they're probably not\nselling it right now, right,\n\n255\n00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,330\nbecause Windows 8 is the current version.\n\n256\n00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,621\nBut if you go online,\ngo to Microsoft's volume license site or\n\n257\n00:14:05,621 --> 00:14:09,355\nwherever you go to buy it,\nyou'll see several editions of Windows 7.\n\n258\n00:14:09,355 --> 00:14:10,896\nAnd it gets kind of confusing, doesn't it?\n\n259\n00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:12,770\n>> Yeah.\nThere are six different editions of\n\n260\n00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,360\nWindows 7.\n\n261\n00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,610\nAnd they really are actually\nranging inside of the marketplace,\n\n262\n00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,020\ndepending on where you actually are,\nand also, of course, what you need.\n\n263\n00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,350\nThey range from the idea of entry level,\nkind of very basic hardware\n\n264\n00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,780\nthat will run Windows 7 all the way up\nin to what they call the enthusiast.\n\n265\n00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,330\nIn other words,\n\n266\n00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,720\nthe person wants everything there\nis on the operating system itself.\n\n267\n00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720\nAnd again of course,\n\n268\n00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,170\nthe higher the additions go in terms of\nfeatures that you have the more hardware\n\n269\n00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,200\nrequirements you're gonna actually have\nto go beyond the minimum requirement.\n\n270\n00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,760\n>> Yep.\n\n271\n00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,380\nAnd you know it gets kind of confusing.\n\n272\n00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,630\nI was trying to find real quick\nwhere Microsoft had it listed.\n\n273\n00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,625\nBut of course you go to any Windows 7\npage and it pushes you to Windows 8 now.\n\n274\n00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n275\n00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,750\nbasically let's see if we can just\nrattle some of these off here.\n\n276\n00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,060\nI'll fire up Notepad or something and\nwe'll just kind of write em out.\n\n277\n00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,530\nAnd basically it kind of varies\nbased on what it is you want, so\n\n278\n00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,720\nwhen we talk about Windows 7,\nthere's Windows 7 Starter.\n\n279\n00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,590\nLet me just bump this font\nup just a little bit so\n\n280\n00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,730\nwe can read it better\n>> Yeah,\n\n281\n00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:19,360\nthe Windows 7 Starter edition for\nus is for those that have entry level PCs.\n\n282\n00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,950\nIn other words,\nthe economy type of hardware.\n\n283\n00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,730\nThe one where they go, hey,\nwe want you to get this computer and\n\n284\n00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,110\nit's running Windows 7.\n\n285\n00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,940\nAnd so the starter edition\nwas actually put out there\n\n286\n00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,690\nto ensure that it would have as much\ncompatibility as possible with the lower\n\n287\n00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,020\nend types of machines\nthat we have out there.\n\n288\n00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,850\nAnd that's where you had that.\n\n289\n00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,670\nNow even though this edition\nprobably did get out there in\n\n290\n00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,400\nthe marketplace right at the beginning\n>> Nobody\n\n291\n00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,600\nreally ever put it on\ntheir particular machines,\n\n292\n00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,410\nunless they were really running\nthat very low-level hardware.\n\n293\n00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,584\nThat next edition we\nhave is that Home Basic.\n\n294\n00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:57,845\nThe Home Basic Edition, it depends on\nwhere you get the information from,\n\n295\n00:15:57,845 --> 00:16:02,459\nbut this is the one where you'd think that\nthis would be the next higher edition.\n\n296\n00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:06,339\nBut Windows 7 was introduced with\nthe Home Basic in the same way that\n\n297\n00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:10,697\nVista Home Basic was, and it was actually\nintroduced in the kind of emerging\n\n298\n00:16:10,697 --> 00:16:14,920\nmarkets idea for them, in other words,\nplaces really outside the U.S.\n\n299\n00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,688\nin which the hardware again is limited and\nthey set an artificial limit at some point\n\n300\n00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:24,318\non it where they said there's only three\napplications allowed to be able to run on\n\n301\n00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,485\nthis\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n302\n00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,895\n>> But, people got a little\n\n303\n00:16:26,895 --> 00:16:27,635\nbit offended and\n\n304\n00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:32,475\nso before the release they said no we've\ntaken that particular limitation away.\n\n305\n00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:36,045\nSo, in that Home Basic edition,\nit again runs again on that kind of\n\n306\n00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,080\nemerging market, or\nthe entry level types of PCs.\n\n307\n00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,240\nNow from that point, the standard edition\nthat you saw released in the United States\n\n308\n00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,470\nthough, was Home Premium.\n\n309\n00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,660\n>> Actually, it gets kind of confusing,\ncause it changed over time.\n\n310\n00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,460\nSo let me, I want to clarify to you guys\nmake sure you understand how it's going to\n\n311\n00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,330\nbe on the exam.\n\n312\n00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,010\n>> Okay.\n\n313\n00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,280\n>> So, everything Ronnie said,\nabsolutely true, but\n\n314\n00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,800\nit did change during\nthe production of Windows 7.\n\n315\n00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,900\nSo, the exam is still kind of\nreflecting the older ways.\n\n316\n00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,460\nSo, let me just set out a quick\nkind of clarification for\n\n317\n00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,720\nhow it'll be on the exam.\n\n318\n00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,770\nWindows 7 Starter Edition was the one\nthat was crippled only to run\n\n319\n00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,100\nthree applications at a time, and it was\ndesigned for those emerging markets.\n\n320\n00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,300\n>> Okay.\n>> It was priced at either three or\n\n321\n00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,270\nextremely inexpensive.\n\n322\n00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,760\nAnd it was really designed for\nultrabooks and\n\n323\n00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,360\nso things that were very limited already\nare running more than three applications\n\n324\n00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,630\nat once on a ultrabook was tough because\nthey didn't have a lot of RAM and so\n\n325\n00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,800\nthat was how that one was positioned.\n\n326\n00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,550\nAnd then Home Basic, in the beginning,\nwas actually what was sold in the U.S.\n\n327\n00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,606\non standard laptops and it didn't\nhave the three application limit.\n\n328\n00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,570\nAnd they kind of changed\nthat down the road, but\n\n329\n00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,380\non the exam it'll still\nreflect the old way.\n\n330\n00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,870\nBasically, you had two editions for\nhome users.\n\n331\n00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,600\nWindows Home Basic and\nWindows Home Premium and\n\n332\n00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,490\nthe difference between them was\nreally a couple of simple things.\n\n333\n00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,640\nHome Basic had well the basic\ncore of Windows 7 but\n\n334\n00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,960\nHome Premium had a few extra things like\nit had Windows Media Center edition or\n\n335\n00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,530\njust Windows Media Center.\n\n336\n00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:16,140\nIf you used Windows Media Center to pause\nand record TV, and kind of show your\n\n337\n00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,550\nmovies, and music, and stuff like that,\nwell, it wasn't included in Home Basic.\n\n338\n00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,840\nYou had to go up to Windows Home Premium.\n\n339\n00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,185\nAnd other things like remote desktop.\n\n340\n00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:29,655\nIf you use remote desktop to remotely\nconnect your Windows 7 machine to see\n\n341\n00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:32,035\nthe screen you could do\nthat in Home Premium.\n\n342\n00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:34,195\nYou couldn't do that in Home Basics.\n\n343\n00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:36,485\nThat was a pretty big difference there.\n\n344\n00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:38,995\nAnd some of the other additions\nit's kinds of the same thing.\n\n345\n00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:41,765\nThere's different features with each one.\n\n346\n00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:44,245\nAnd it's really hard\nto keep them straight.\n\n347\n00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:47,655\nAnd then what made it even\nharder was Microsoft changed it!\n\n348\n00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:50,980\nThey changed it as time went on, and they\ndecided, Starter Edition is kind of dead\n\n349\n00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,080\non arrival, and so\nthey kind of killed that one off,\n\n350\n00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,560\nand they started phasing Home Basic in,\nand it just got kind of messy.\n\n351\n00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,100\nYou know, Paul Thurrott, let me see if I\ncan find Paul Thurrott's article on this,\n\n352\n00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,150\nbecause he had a good one,\n\n353\n00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:07,610\nin fact it might have even turned up here,\nthe win supersite, here we go.\n\n354\n00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:12,090\nWhere he broke down some of\nthese different additions and\n\n355\n00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,160\nyou'll see where he's got\nthe home basic starter,\n\n356\n00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,550\nhome premium professional, I called it\nbusiness it's actually professional.\n\n357\n00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,930\nUnder Vista, it was business.\n\n358\n00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,610\nUnder Windows 7, it was Professional, and\n\n359\n00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,690\nthen Enterprise covered up by\nthe advertisements there, but\n\n360\n00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,670\nwhat you'll see is it kind of listed\nare variations in what supported and so\n\n361\n00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,920\nyou'll see some of the different\nthings like the arrow user interface.\n\n362\n00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,780\nThe arrow user interface was\na big deal for Microsoft, but\n\n363\n00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,890\nit gave you 3-D optimization\non your user interface so\n\n364\n00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,810\nyour title bars, your start menu,\nthey looked pretty.\n\n365\n00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,730\nThey called it glass where you\ncould kind of see through them\n\n366\n00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,330\nto see things that were behind it.\n\n367\n00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,320\nAnd that stuff,\n\n368\n00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,300\nthat Arrow user interface was not\nsupported in Home Basic and Started.\n\n369\n00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,110\nYou'll see here Arrow UI, they weren't\nsupported, but in Home Premium they were.\n\n370\n00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,480\nIf you were Dell, or HP,\nor somebody like that and\n\n371\n00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,080\nyou're selling a laptop, you want\nit to look nice so people like it.\n\n372\n00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,540\nSo those vendors would just immediately\nstart selling Home Premium.\n\n373\n00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,200\nThey really weren't selling Home Basic.\n\n374\n00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,850\nSo that's where we started to\nsee these things kind of change.\n\n375\n00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,380\nWhere Starter got killed off and\nHome Basic kind of took over.\n\n376\n00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,340\nSo there were those.\n\n377\n00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,540\nThen you'll see like Professional and\nHome Premium.\n\n378\n00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,500\nSee how they basically have\nthe same list of options?\n\n379\n00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,360\nWell, these are all just\nuser interface options.\n\n380\n00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,560\nThere were other things, and Paul\nlists them kind of broken out in here.\n\n381\n00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,380\nSomewhere in here you'll see\nthe domain information which\n\n382\n00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,740\nis buried in here somewhere.\n\n383\n00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,700\nI'll post the link to this article\nwith the episode because it is\n\n384\n00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,650\na really good one.\n\n385\n00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,880\nBut just to save time I'm just going\nto type it because I already know.\n\n386\n00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,130\nWindows Home Basic, and\nWindows Home Premium, those guys,\n\n387\n00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,760\nthey work perfectly good, for home, right?\n\n388\n00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,510\nIf you were setting up a workgroup,\nor whatever, right.\n\n389\n00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:08,530\nSo these were workgroup support,\nbut they could not join a domain.\n\n390\n00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:13,300\nSo if you had a Windows active directory\ndomain, a home machine, Home Basic or\n\n391\n00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,280\nPremium, could not join it, right?\n\n392\n00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,680\nThese were designed to be used in work\ngroups, small amounts of computers, right?\n\n393\n00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:26,760\nNot anything big, but\nwhen you got into Windows 7 Professional.\n\n394\n00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,960\nHere you could join a domain.\n\n395\n00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,780\nAnd these were designed for\nbeing used in businesses.\n\n396\n00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,840\nIn businesses where you had hundreds,\nthousands of computers, whatever,\n\n397\n00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,840\nyou had an active directory\ndomain they could join in.\n\n398\n00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,850\nThey had support for remote desktop and\nfeatures like that so we had that present.\n\n399\n00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,740\nAnd they're really designed that way.\n\n400\n00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,000\nNow you might ask yourself, what's\nthe difference between professional and\n\n401\n00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,110\nenterprise?\n\n402\n00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,400\nAnd the answer is, surprisingly, not much.\n\n403\n00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:06,360\nThe big difference was Windows 7\nProfessional, you could buy at retail.\n\n404\n00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,090\nSo you could go to a store, you could\nbuy it, you could get it from Dell,\n\n405\n00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,190\nyou can get it from HP, whatever.\n\n406\n00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:16,140\nBut Windows 7 Enterprise only able to be\n\n407\n00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,485\npurchased with a VLE or\n\n408\n00:22:20,485 --> 00:22:27,340\na Volume Licensed Agreement and VLE\nstands for Volume License Enterprise so\n\n409\n00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,940\nif you have a volume license\nenterprise account with Microsoft.\n\n410\n00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,880\nIn other words you're buying\nthousands of copies of Windows, and\n\n411\n00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,230\nthey gave you Windows\n7 Enterprise edition.\n\n412\n00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,420\nSo those were the basic ones,\nwhat am I leaving out here Ronnie?\n\n413\n00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:42,990\n>> Ultimate.\n\n414\n00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,425\nThat's the only-\n>> Oh, ultimate.\n\n415\n00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:48,820\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now with the Windows 7 Enterprise,\n\n416\n00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,220\nright, it gives you everything\nthat you actually can have\n\n417\n00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,540\nin the addition of Windows, and\n\n418\n00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,750\nactually that includes all of the features\nof Windows 7 Ultimate as well.\n\n419\n00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,520\nThe big difference between Ultimate and\nEnterprise is that even though Windows 7\n\n420\n00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,500\nEnterprise has everything., Windows 7\nUltimate thought you can actually go out\n\n421\n00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,400\nto a store and purchase or\ngo online and purchase this one.\n\n422\n00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,340\nWhereas, again, in the Enterprise edition,\n\n423\n00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,910\nyou have to have that volume\nlicense Enterprise agreement.\n\n424\n00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:22,340\n>> All right, so here's the breakdown\nof our, they call them SKUs, S-K-Us.\n\n425\n00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,590\nAnd I forget what that stands for but\nbasically it's the UPC or bar code for\n\n426\n00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,560\nwhen you buy them.\n\n427\n00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,430\nSo these were the primary versions.\n\n428\n00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:36,220\nNow keep in mind that everyone of\nthese came in a 32-bit and a 64-bit.\n\n429\n00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,410\nDid Starter Edition come in 64-bit?\n\n430\n00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,510\n>> Starter Home Basic only came in 32.\n\n431\n00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,760\nNow I remember.\n\n432\n00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,350\n>> Okay.\n\n433\n00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,170\nSo I might be wrong on those two.\n\n434\n00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,530\nThe lower edition one.\n\n435\n00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,960\nBecause they were designed to run on\nlow-end machines I'm not entirely sure\n\n436\n00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,380\nwhether they released a 64-bit\nversion there or not.\n\n437\n00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,834\nBut all the other ones had a 64 bit\nversion as well as a 32 bit version.\n\n438\n00:23:57,834 --> 00:24:00,787\nAnd that meant that you had that choice,\nso\n\n439\n00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:05,805\nit's six editions to pick from and\na processor architecture to choose.\n\n440\n00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:08,750\nIt made things kind of confusing\nwhen it came to buying Windows 7.\n\n441\n00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,875\nMicrosoft recognized that and\nthey fixed that in Windows 8.\n\n442\n00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:16,849\nThey reduced it down to just two skews,\ntwo different versions, try and\n\n443\n00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:19,280\nmake life a little more simple.\n\n444\n00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,818\nBut for Windows 7 and for what's on\nthe exam, you'll see all of these.\n\n445\n00:24:23,818 --> 00:24:26,288\nAll right.\n\n446\n00:24:26,288 --> 00:24:29,690\nSo, Ronnie, I go to the store,\nand I go to buy Windows 7.\n\n447\n00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,710\nAll right?\n\n448\n00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,760\nThe first thing I need to be aware of\nis that Windows 7 shipped on a DVD.\n\n449\n00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,800\nIt was the first Windows operating\nsystem to be too big to fit on a CD.\n\n450\n00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,830\nNow, Vista, actually, it did ship on a\nDVD, but it was able to fit on a CD also.\n\n451\n00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,950\nBut Windows 7 could and\nit was over 2 gigs.\n\n452\n00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,130\nIt was just too big.\n\n453\n00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,950\nSo to install Windows 7 you\ndon't just need a CD drive.\n\n454\n00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,910\nYou need a DVD drive to install it.\n\n455\n00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,945\nAnd that actually,\nback when it came out, keep in mind,\n\n456\n00:24:58,945 --> 00:25:02,001\nWindows 7 came out,\nwhat year did it come out, Ronnie?\n\n457\n00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:02,512\n>> 2009, I think.\n\n458\n00:25:02,512 --> 00:25:06,955\n>> Okay, so, several years ago back then,\nDVD drives, they were inexpensive, but\n\n459\n00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:10,966\nthey weren't commonplace in the typical\nmachines that were in the field.\n\n460\n00:25:10,966 --> 00:25:15,503\nSo you just had to be aware of them,\nknow that you needed a DVD drive.\n\n461\n00:25:15,503 --> 00:25:20,322\nAll right, so I go out, I get my\nDVD drive, I've got all that stuff,\n\n462\n00:25:20,322 --> 00:25:25,192\nand I'm ready to rock,\nI'm ready to get Windows 7 installed.\n\n463\n00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:27,317\nLet's see, am I forgetting anything?\n\n464\n00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,460\nNo.\nI'm ready to install.\n\n465\n00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,020\nRight?\n\n466\n00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,020\nI meet my hardware requirements.\n\n467\n00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,860\nWhat do I do?\n\n468\n00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,700\n>> Yep.\n\n469\n00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,577\nOnce we actually now have the DVD, all\nwe do again is we make sure that we can\n\n470\n00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:44,547\nput it into the actual machine and\nget it ready for our install that we have.\n\n471\n00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:48,470\nSo for us here, again either purchasing\nit or through your volume license here.\n\n472\n00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,950\nNow, on the volume license a lot of\ntimes you have to download it and\n\n473\n00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,590\nthen make a copy of your DVD to do so.\n\n474\n00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,443\nAnd of course you also need\nan activation key, right,\n\n475\n00:25:56,443 --> 00:25:59,620\nto make sure that everything is\nactually ready to go as well.\n\n476\n00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,334\nNow it doesn't mean you have to install\nthat right away like the earlier editions,\n\n477\n00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,050\nbut you do need that.\n\n478\n00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,360\nOkay.\n\n479\n00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,770\n>> And then, you know, Ronnie,\nyou mentioned downloads so\n\n480\n00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,520\nit just reminded me.\n\n481\n00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:14,670\nMicrosoft actually has a utility,\nlet's see if I can find it real quick.\n\n482\n00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,060\nThat when you download, here it is,\n\n483\n00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,540\nthe Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool,\nthis guy right here.\n\n484\n00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,800\nI brought several of these\nthings up during the show.\n\n485\n00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,450\nI'll post the links to all these with\nthe episode, so you guys have them.\n\n486\n00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,580\nDon't worry about trying\nto jot down the URLs.\n\n487\n00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,190\nBut basically what this\ntool does is two things.\n\n488\n00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,820\nOne, it lets you take the image\nyou downloaded from Microsoft and\n\n489\n00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,050\nburn it to a CD or DVD.\n\n490\n00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,990\nAnd that's the typical way for\ninstalling it.\n\n491\n00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:45,040\nBut two,\nit lets you burn it to a USB thumb drive.\n\n492\n00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,490\nSo if you have a thumb drive that's\n4 gigs or bigger, then you can\n\n493\n00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,230\nwrite the Windows 7 install media to it\nand you can install from the thumb drive.\n\n494\n00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,190\nThat's really handy if you\nhave a laptop like Ronnie's or\n\n495\n00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,560\nactually mine, both of ours.\n\n496\n00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,210\nWe don't have CD drives.\n\n497\n00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,590\nSo, how are you gonna install Windows 7?\n\n498\n00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,750\n>> Now, a lot of times,\nif you haven't seen this tool,\n\n499\n00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,270\nit's actually quite a neat tool.\n\n500\n00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,640\nSo, over on my computer I went ahead and\ndownloaded it.\n\n501\n00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,205\n>> Oh, look at you.\n\n502\n00:27:08,205 --> 00:27:09,460\nOverachiever.\n\n503\n00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,272\n>> So, the problem is I don't have\na USB thumb drive right here.\n\n504\n00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:13,140\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n505\n00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,560\n>> But I forgot to bring it on set, here.\n\n506\n00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,960\nBut, for us here.\n\n507\n00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,330\nRight, once you actually download that\nISO, that image of the DVD, you can then\n\n508\n00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:27,520\nselect that particular file if I browse\nto it and let me see if I can find it.\n\n509\n00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,880\n>> Buried away on your computer\n>> Yeah, I've got it stored in my software\n\n510\n00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,890\nfolder here\n>> So there's my Windows 7 ISOs here.\n\n511\n00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,570\nSo I would do that and\nyou just simply click Next here.\n\n512\n00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,150\nMaybe.\n\n513\n00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,920\n>> Well, it's gonna get angry at you,\nisn't it?\n\n514\n00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,630\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n515\n00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,270\nthis is where you have your options here,\nright?\n\n516\n00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,256\nYou can then burn it to a DVD or\nyou can use your USB device here.\n\n517\n00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:52,938\nAnd at that point you have your blank DVD,\nget it ready to roll, or\n\n518\n00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:56,560\nyour USB, and\nit's gonna wipe your USB drive.\n\n519\n00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,540\nIt will tell you, it'll say, hey look,\nwe're about to wipe this clean,\n\n520\n00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,880\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n521\n00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,570\nSo you've gotta make\nsure that you do that.\n\n522\n00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:06,671\nThe only minimum requirement is that it\nhas to be at least 4 gigs on the actual\n\n523\n00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:08,606\nUSB drive if you're gonna do that.\n\n524\n00:28:08,606 --> 00:28:11,394\n>> And you can use this even\nif you went to retail and\n\n525\n00:28:11,394 --> 00:28:15,714\nbought Windows 7 Home on DVD from\nthe store, if you want to make a USB key,\n\n526\n00:28:15,714 --> 00:28:20,850\nyou can use a utility, like I see it on\nyour desktop there Ronnie, Image Burn.\n\n527\n00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,190\nImage Burn is free software, I don't\nknow if it's open source or not but\n\n528\n00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,050\nI know it's free,\nyou can go and download it.\n\n529\n00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:30,380\nAnd it can make an ISO image\nout of a DVD for you so\n\n530\n00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,030\nyou can point it at the Windows 7 DVD that\nyou bought and it will create the ISO.\n\n531\n00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,390\nYou can then feed that ISO into\nthis application here, and\n\n532\n00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,610\nwrite it to a USB key.\n\n533\n00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,190\nSo you can make your own\nbootable USB key if you want.\n\n534\n00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:46,800\nAgain, really handy when you have these\nnewer laptops that just don't have CD and\n\n535\n00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,760\nDVD drives anymore.\n\n536\n00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,190\nIt's getting to be less and less common.\n\n537\n00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,432\n>> Yeah, no, when we first started,\nright, trying to do this,\n\n538\n00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:56,537\nyou had to try to figure out how the heck\nto ensure that that USB was bootable, and\n\n539\n00:28:56,537 --> 00:28:59,310\nthen to copy the files over,\nand so you had to do a lot.\n\n540\n00:29:00,892 --> 00:29:02,410\n>> All right, well, Ronnie,\nlooking at the time,\n\n541\n00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,670\nwe're running a little short on this\nsegment, so why don't we do this.\n\n542\n00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,814\nWhy don't we stop and take a break,\nand when we get back,\n\n543\n00:29:06,814 --> 00:29:08,345\nwe'll install Windows 7 on a machine.\n\n544\n00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:09,850\n>> Sure.\nSounds great.\n\n545\n00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:10,560\n>> Take a stab at that.\n\n546\n00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,720\nSo it'll be a good time.\n\n547\n00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,270\nAll right.\n\n548\n00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,360\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n549\n00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,350\nWhen we get back, we'll actually\nsee Windows 7 get installed.\n\n550\n00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:16,907\nStay tuned.\n\n551\n00:29:16,907 --> 00:29:17,848\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n552\n00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:24,369\n[MUSIC]\n\n553\n00:29:25,404 --> 00:29:27,100\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n554\n00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,820\nSo, now we're ready to\npull the trigger and\n\n555\n00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,770\nwe're gonna get a chance to\nsee installing Windows 7.\n\n556\n00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,000\nAnd Ronnie and\nI were talking during the break,\n\n557\n00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,330\nI actually want to show you guys a wrong\nway first before we do it the right way.\n\n558\n00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,636\nOne of the questions I get from\ntime to time is, all right, Don,\n\n559\n00:29:42,636 --> 00:29:47,246\nI don't know if my processor is 32-bit or\n64-bit, how can I figure it out, right?\n\n560\n00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:51,273\nWell, the best thing to do is to find\nthe model of your processor and go and\n\n561\n00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:52,310\nlook it up.\n\n562\n00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:55,790\nIntel and AMD both have great\ndocumentation on their website\n\n563\n00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,650\nif you know your processor, all right.\n\n564\n00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,350\nSo the follow up question I get is,\nwell, what if I just try it?\n\n565\n00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,500\nWhat if I just try and install the 64-bit\nversion on a 32-bit machine or vice versa?\n\n566\n00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,267\nWell, first off,\nyou can install the 32-bit version of\n\n567\n00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:12,328\nWindows 7 on a 64-bit processor.\n\n568\n00:30:12,328 --> 00:30:15,864\nThe 64-bit processors\nare backwards compatible, so\n\n569\n00:30:15,864 --> 00:30:17,930\nthey can run either 32 or 64.\n\n570\n00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,730\nBut the reverse is not true, right.\n\n571\n00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,980\nAnd Ronnie, you're gonna demonstrate this.\n\n572\n00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:29,470\nSo if we try and install a 64-bit OS on a\n32-bit processor, it gets pretty unhappy.\n\n573\n00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,000\n>> Yeah.\n\n574\n00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,251\nNow, what we've done is we've set up\na virtual machine to tell it that, hey,\n\n575\n00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:35,400\nyou're gonna be a 32-bit processor.\n\n576\n00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:41,680\nOkay, so by doing this here we've also\ntaken an ISO that's a Windows 7 64-bit and\n\n577\n00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,370\nwe're essentially gonna install it.\n\n578\n00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:48,315\nSo on my machine here, I have my\n32-bit Windows machine ready to go.\n\n579\n00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:49,355\nAnd I'm simply gonna start it.\n\n580\n00:30:49,355 --> 00:30:51,815\nI went ahead and\nloaded up the ISO into it.\n\n581\n00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:53,775\nAnd so here, we should see it.\n\n582\n00:30:53,775 --> 00:30:57,055\nIt's gonna continue to load\nup Windows at this point,\n\n583\n00:30:57,055 --> 00:31:00,665\nto again, copy all the operating\nsystem files over into RAM.\n\n584\n00:31:01,715 --> 00:31:04,245\nAnd it takes a little bit of time,\ncuz we didn't give it a ton of RAM.\n\n585\n00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:07,405\n>> And, you know, the boot loader\nthat's on that disc, it's 32-bits, so\n\n586\n00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:10,165\nyou don't notice\na difference at this stage.\n\n587\n00:31:10,165 --> 00:31:11,504\n>> But you do here.\n\n588\n00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:12,290\nOkay, so.\n\n589\n00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:16,560\n[LAUGH] So hopefully you've spotted it by\nnow that you're on the wrong processor.\n\n590\n00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,740\nIf you haven't looked at the bottom\nedge of my ticker screen here and\n\n591\n00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,760\nyou see where it says attempting\nto load 64-bit application,\n\n592\n00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,670\nhowever this CPU though is not\ncompatible with the 64-bit mode.\n\n593\n00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:34,040\nSo the operating system itself, it says,\nlook, I'm 64-bit, your processor's 32.\n\n594\n00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,750\nLet me go and\nthrow an error at this point, so\n\n595\n00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,980\nyou don't continue to\ntry to do anything else.\n\n596\n00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,720\n>> So you cannot install\na 64-bit OS on 32-bit hardware.\n\n597\n00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,520\nBut, like I said, you can do the opposite.\n\n598\n00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,660\nYou can install the 32-bit OS on a 64-bit\nhardware, it'll just run in 32-bit mode.\n\n599\n00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,750\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nwhy would I wanna do that, right?\n\n600\n00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,400\nWell, there's really one good scenario.\n\n601\n00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,350\nMaybe you have some software or\n\n602\n00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:02,230\nhardware that's not 64-bit compatible but\nyou have to use it.\n\n603\n00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:02,740\nAll right?\n\n604\n00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,000\nYou see this in business all the time.\n\n605\n00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,195\nThere's some receipt printer,\nor bar code scanner or\n\n606\n00:32:07,195 --> 00:32:10,470\nsomething that you have to\nuse as part of your business.\n\n607\n00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,500\nAnd the vendor hasn't\nreleased 64-bit drivers.\n\n608\n00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,084\nAll right?\n\n609\n00:32:13,084 --> 00:32:16,644\nIf that's the case,\neven though you've got 64-bit hardware,\n\n610\n00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:21,201\nyou might still choose to run the 32-bit\nOS because you've got driver support, and\n\n611\n00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:24,425\nthat's the most common scenario\nof when you deal with that.\n\n612\n00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:25,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n613\n00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160\n>> Yep.\n>> Yep.\n\n614\n00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,900\n>> But otherwise if you're running, and\n\n615\n00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,400\nhere's where it gets even more confusing,\nright?\n\n616\n00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,620\nI'm talking about the OS.\n\n617\n00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,500\n>> Right.\n>> When you're running a 64-bit OS\n\n618\n00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,845\n>> You could run 64 and\n\n619\n00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:39,640\n32-bit applications,\nyou just can't use 32-bit drivers anymore.\n\n620\n00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,700\nSo your applications could be all over\nthe place, 32, 64-bit, who knows.\n\n621\n00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,330\nBut that OS is tied to the hardware.\n\n622\n00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,790\n>> Yeah.\n\n623\n00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:52,474\nSo there's our first install here and\na wrong install that we have.\n\n624\n00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:54,540\n>> [LAUGH] So\nlet's see the right way Ronnie.\n\n625\n00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,640\nSo we take a DVD and\nwe're gonna do, what, 64-bit?\n\n626\n00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,404\n>> We are gonna do 64-bit.\n\n627\n00:32:59,404 --> 00:33:02,110\n>> So we've got a 64-bit Windows 7 DVD.\n\n628\n00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:07,030\nWe pop it into our machine and\nit's a 64-bit capable machine, and\n\n629\n00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,280\nwe fire it up, right.\n\n630\n00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,740\nAnd that's when the magic happens.\n\n631\n00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,960\n>> Yeah.\nFor us here, again, same scenario but\n\n632\n00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,170\nthis time we've matched\neverything up here.\n\n633\n00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,550\nAnd I've just switched over to\nmy Hyper-V machine instead.\n\n634\n00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,070\nAnd I'm just going to click\non the start button, or for\n\n635\n00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,000\nus we'd turn the power\non on a real machine.\n\n636\n00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,510\nAnd here I go.\n\n637\n00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,950\nIt's just going to load right up for us.\n\n638\n00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,690\nI've given it a little bit more RAM.\n\n639\n00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,990\nSo this thing should go a little\nbit faster and loads up faster.\n\n640\n00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:36,060\n>> Now if it is a brand new completely\nblank hard drive, if the hard\n\n641\n00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,740\ndrive is blank, you're going to boot up\nand you're going to see exactly this.\n\n642\n00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,900\nBut if your hard drive already\nhas a version of Windows on it,\n\n643\n00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,780\nwhen you boot off of that disk you're\ngoing to see a message that says\n\n644\n00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,590\nPress any key to boot from DVD, and\n\n645\n00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,020\nif you press a key, you'll boot to\nthe DVD and you'll see exactly this.\n\n646\n00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,710\nIf you don't press a key, after five\nseconds the message will go away and\n\n647\n00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,990\nit will boot the operating\nsystem from the hard drive.\n\n648\n00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,950\nMicrosoft does that in case you forget\nthis disk and leave it in the computer.\n\n649\n00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,610\nThey want to make it where it boots\nup to the hard drive by default.\n\n650\n00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,420\nJust be aware that.\n\n651\n00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,390\nIf you have a previously existing OS\non there, you'll get a message saying,\n\n652\n00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,530\nPress any key to boot from DVD.\n\n653\n00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,210\nAnd you'll need to hit that.\n\n654\n00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,050\nAnd then you'll go to\nthis screen right here.\n\n655\n00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,350\nRonnie's went straight to it\nbecause his hard drive was blank.\n\n656\n00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,220\n>> So at this point here's\nwhere the magic begins, right?\n\n657\n00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,110\nNotice that when we install it,\nunlike what we saw on previous editions of\n\n658\n00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:32,850\nthe operating system where it's just kind\nof very basic GUI or very basic text,\n\n659\n00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,740\nI should say.\n\n660\n00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,500\nThis one has a very nice little start\nscreen that walks us through it here and\n\n661\n00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,430\nso all we have to do is follow\nthe actual commands and\n\n662\n00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,980\nnow we get three different\noptions as well, right?\n\n663\n00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,100\nInstall, What to know before installing,\nso if you're not sure,\n\n664\n00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,520\nprobably something good.\n\n665\n00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,860\nAnd then this option Repair which we'll\nprobably talk about a little bit later on,\n\n666\n00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,290\nbut the option I want is right here.\n\n667\n00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,600\n>> Now the second option,\nWhat to know before installing Windows.\n\n668\n00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,050\nIf you're not certain that your hardware\nmeets the requirements for Windows 7,\n\n669\n00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:03,400\nyou can go in there and it's got\nthe list of hardware requirements, and\n\n670\n00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,600\nit even has a little tester\nthat can check your hardware.\n\n671\n00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,620\nIt's kind of nice.\n\n672\n00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,420\nYou can actually download that from\nMicrosoft's website ahead of time,\n\n673\n00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,890\neven before you buy Windows.\n\n674\n00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,780\nThey have the,\ndo you remember what's called Ronnie?\n\n675\n00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,610\nThe upgrade checker?\n\n676\n00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,630\n>> Yeah.\nWindows Upgrade Advisor.\n\n677\n00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,330\n>> Upgrade Advisor.\n\n678\n00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:16,970\nThat's it.\n\n679\n00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,745\nYou can download the Upgrade Advisor and\nit'll check your hardware and\n\n680\n00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:22,350\nyour drivers and everything to make\nsure you're ready for Windows 7.\n\n681\n00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,310\nSo that's really what\nthe purpose of that link is.\n\n682\n00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,850\nBut like you said Ronnie, Install Now,\nthat's usually where we're going.\n\n683\n00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:29,930\nThat's why it's a giant button.\n\n684\n00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,400\n>> That's right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n685\n00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,200\n>> So as the setup is actually starting\n\n686\n00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,070\nhere we still have a couple of\noptions that we need to make sure\n\n687\n00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,460\nthat we choose correctly here.\n\n688\n00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,860\nSo what it's doing, of course is, it is\ngathering all the information it needs.\n\n689\n00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,200\nAnd now here it is, okay?\n\n690\n00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,290\nSo of course we are going to accept\nthe licensing agreement here.\n\n691\n00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,910\nThis is the shortest EULA I've ever seen.\n\n692\n00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,120\n>> Well, that's because this is\nthe Enterprise edition, right?\n\n693\n00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,970\nThe Enterprise edition is tied to a volume\nlicense agreement, which is a many,\n\n694\n00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:00,060\nmany page contract, so\nthe EULAs very short.\n\n695\n00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,930\nIf you buy the retail copy of Windows,\nthere would be a lot more in here, and\n\n696\n00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:09,030\nyou're supposed to read it, word for\nword, it's thrilling stuff,\n\n697\n00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,052\nright, I don't know\nthat I've ever read it.\n\n698\n00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:13,673\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Action-packed,\n\n699\n00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,060\njust like an Alex Cross novel.\n\n700\n00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,560\n>> There we go.\n\n701\n00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,530\n>> Here's our two options that we have.\n\n702\n00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,590\nSo, if we're going to do and upgrade,\nin other words we already have a previous\n\n703\n00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,160\noperating system on this and\nwe want to again go ahead and\n\n704\n00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,590\nload Windows 7 on top of that,\nwe would choose the upgrade path.\n\n705\n00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:34,520\nBut a fresh install, and strangely it's\ncalled custom, and not new install.\n\n706\n00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,430\n>> Now the reason Microsoft\nhas labeled it this way is if\n\n707\n00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,400\nyou already have a version of Windows,\nthey wanna make it easy for\n\n708\n00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,150\nyou to upgrade which retains\nall of your settings.\n\n709\n00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,850\nThey wanna make that simple for you.\n\n710\n00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:48,080\nBut as an IT professional,\nI'll tell you right now.\n\n711\n00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,200\nUpgrades are a bad idea.\n\n712\n00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,560\nThat you get a lot of stuff left behind\nfrom the previous operating system.\n\n713\n00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,500\nAny problems you have with the old OS\nare likely still there once you go\n\n714\n00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,155\nthe the new one.\n\n715\n00:36:59,155 --> 00:37:00,670\nYou've just upgraded your problem.\n\n716\n00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,460\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n717\n00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,620\n>> So I always prefer to do fresh and\n\n718\n00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,980\nclean installs, which is what\nMicrosoft has labelled as custom.\n\n719\n00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,620\nWe're gonna talk a little bit\nmore about upgrades later so for\n\n720\n00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,510\nright now we'll just do a custom one.\n\n721\n00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,460\nThis is what we would do\nif we want a nice, fresh,\n\n722\n00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,080\nclean version of Windows 7 without\nretaining any previous settings.\n\n723\n00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,220\nEverything gets wiped out.\n\n724\n00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,610\n>> Yep.\n\n725\n00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:25,640\nSo once we select our custom here,\nthis is where we may actually have to make\n\n726\n00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,330\na decision depending on the size\nof our hard drive, right.\n\n727\n00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:33,100\nSo I've just created a small virtual\nhard drive here, just of 48 gigs, and\n\n728\n00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,260\nnotice that the entire hard drive is\npretty much not partitioned at all.\n\n729\n00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,200\nSo at this point, and it still gives\nme some other options down here.\n\n730\n00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,360\nThe load driver, yeah\n>> Yeah, if you fire up your computer, you\n\n731\n00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,210\nboot off the DVD, you get to this screen,\nand there's no hard drives listed, right?\n\n732\n00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,455\nThis happens all the time in systems\nthat have RAID controllers, but\n\n733\n00:37:53,455 --> 00:37:57,495\nyou might just have a laptop or something\nwith a proprietary storage controller and\n\n734\n00:37:57,495 --> 00:37:58,655\nthe drives don't show up.\n\n735\n00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:01,975\nSo you've got the load driver option\nwhere you can provide the driver for\n\n736\n00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:06,085\nthe RAID controller or the driver for\nyour SATAID, whatever it is, so\n\n737\n00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:09,245\nthat the system can recognize it, and\nthen the drives will start to show up.\n\n738\n00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,080\nSo very useful to have that.\n\n739\n00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,490\nThat's also why there's a refresh\nbutton in case you've made changes.\n\n740\n00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,260\nYou can refresh it and\nit'll re-detect the disks.\n\n741\n00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,360\nFor most people if you're doing a clean\ninstall here you just pick the hard drive\n\n742\n00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,960\nand Windows will erase the hard drive and\n\n743\n00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,910\nbuild one big,\nwell actually it builds two partitions.\n\n744\n00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,820\nBut one tiny little service partition and\nthen the whole rest of the drive.\n\n745\n00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,680\nBecomes one big partition for\nWindows to be installed on.\n\n746\n00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,560\nIf you don't want that, if you want to\ninstall Windows in a smaller partition\n\n747\n00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,730\nspace, that's where that\nDrive Options button comes in handy.\n\n748\n00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:45,940\nIf you click on that you'll see where\nyou can create and delete partitions,\n\n749\n00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,490\nyou can format drives.\n\n750\n00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,200\nSo you can actually work\nwith the disks a bit, and\n\n751\n00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,940\nkind of manipulate them to meet\nthe needs of your install.\n\n752\n00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,190\n>> And here's where you can choose\n\n753\n00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,800\nthe size of the actual\npartition that you want.\n\n754\n00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,030\nRemember that for us, though, when we're\ndoing this, especially with 64-bit, we'll\n\n755\n00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,840\nneed at least a 20-gig drive, we're just\ngoing to do an install on the whole thing.\n\n756\n00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,465\nBut you can do this, or you wanna keep\nsome space, on partition, maybe for\n\n757\n00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:11,060\ndual boot at some other point as well.\n\n758\n00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,000\n>> Another thing worth mentioning here,\nRonnie, in a later episode,\n\n759\n00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,860\nwe're gonna talk about\nBitLocker drive encryption.\n\n760\n00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:21,055\nAnd if you want to do BitLocker drive\nencryption, you need a very small,\n\n761\n00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:26,050\n200-megabyte partition at the beginning\nof your drive that is FAT32.\n\n762\n00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,020\nYou've got to have that.\n\n763\n00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,870\nThe whole rest of the drive can be NTFS,\n\n764\n00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,860\nbut that first little bit has\nto be a special partition.\n\n765\n00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:36,830\nNow, if you manually create the partitions\nyourself, you need to remember to do that.\n\n766\n00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:40,375\nIf you just choose the drive here and\nlet WIndows handle it for\n\n767\n00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:44,775\nyou where it says Unallocated Space and\nhit Next, it will automatically make that\n\n768\n00:39:44,775 --> 00:39:47,915\nlittle partition for you and\nyou'll be set up for BitLocker.\n\n769\n00:39:47,915 --> 00:39:52,095\nIf you just partition out the whole drive\nas one big NTFS partition, well, you're\n\n770\n00:39:52,095 --> 00:39:56,292\nnot going to be able to do BitLocker later\non because the drive's been set up wrong.\n\n771\n00:39:56,292 --> 00:40:01,284\nSo this is a mistake we can make early\non that's very difficult to correct,\n\n772\n00:40:01,284 --> 00:40:05,582\nso I generally like to let Windows\nlay out the partitions for me.\n\n773\n00:40:05,582 --> 00:40:09,487\n>> Let's see if I can click on this\nthing with my incredible mouse pad\n\n774\n00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:12,180\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH]\n>> And that's basically it.\n\n775\n00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,692\nWindows 7 builds off of\nthe Windows Vista installer, and\n\n776\n00:40:15,692 --> 00:40:19,080\nit does what's called\nan image based install.\n\n777\n00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,920\nIn previous versions of Windows, like\nWindows 2000 and even Windows XP, when you\n\n778\n00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,980\nstarted this installer, you would see it\ncopying hundreds, thousands of files.\n\n779\n00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,380\nYou'd see the little file\nnames pop up on the screen.\n\n780\n00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,620\nIt would take a while.\n\n781\n00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,670\nWith Windows 7,\nit's not doing individual files.\n\n782\n00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:39,720\nIt has one big image that it's\ncopying over to the hard drive.\n\n783\n00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,200\nAnd so, it doesn't have to ask us\na bunch of questions about that setup.\n\n784\n00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,950\nIt's already got it configured,\nit's already ready to rock.\n\n785\n00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,680\nWhen we boot up the first time, it'll\nask us if we want to change some things.\n\n786\n00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,310\nBut for the most part,\nit's already gonna be set up.\n\n787\n00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,810\nIt's gonna cruise through and\nknock out the install.\n\n788\n00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right.\n\n789\n00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,360\n>> That's pretty much the install process,\nuntil it actually boots up.\n\n790\n00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,529\nAnd normally at that point we go into,\nagain,\n\n791\n00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:05,035\nconfiguring the simple\nthings it asks us to put in.\n\n792\n00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:06,750\n>> Now we're going to\nleave that one installing.\n\n793\n00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,290\nThe install takes, well I guess it\ndepends on the speed of your drive and\n\n794\n00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,150\nthings like that.\n\n795\n00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,170\nBut it usually only takes\nabout 15 minutes, right?\n\n796\n00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,930\nIt doesn't take a terribly long time.\n\n797\n00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,030\nIt's copying two and a half gigs of stuff,\nwhich is compressed.\n\n798\n00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,520\nSo it expands to about 10\ngigs to your hard drive.\n\n799\n00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,510\nAnd so, that process just takes time.\n\n800\n00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,490\nIt churns along.\n\n801\n00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,230\nIt's already 20% of\nthe way through expanding.\n\n802\n00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,370\nSo moving pretty quick.\n\n803\n00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:32,340\n>> Yeah.\nThis is as fast as I remember, right?\n\n804\n00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,450\nThis was the first operating\nsystem where I didn't have to sit\n\n805\n00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:39,040\nthere at the 39 minute screen and just go,\nokay, when is this going to be done?\n\n806\n00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,200\nI remember walking out of the room coming\nback, and I was surprised that it was 98%.\n\n807\n00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,410\nAnd it was actually installing very quick.\n\n808\n00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,580\n>> Yeah.\n\n809\n00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,324\nThe old way where we're just\ncopying all those little files,\n\n810\n00:41:48,324 --> 00:41:50,633\nevery file would be read from the DVD,\n>> Yeah.\n\n811\n00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:55,580\n>> Copied into RAM, a CRC,\na check sum would be calculated on it.\n\n812\n00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,690\nCompare it to the check\nsum against the DVD,\n\n813\n00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,820\nand if they match, then it will\nbe written to the drive, right?\n\n814\n00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,948\nSo there was this delay while it did\nCRC checks on every individual file.\n\n815\n00:42:03,948 --> 00:42:06,400\nWith the image-based installer,\n\n816\n00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,630\nit only calculates one CRC versus\nthousands upon thousands of CRCs.\n\n817\n00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,990\nAnd it speeds up the process considerably,\nso\n\n818\n00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,240\nit does make the install go much,\nmuch more quickly.\n\n819\n00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,716\nAll right.\nWell, while that's churning along,\n\n820\n00:42:19,716 --> 00:42:24,368\nlet's talk about the next objective,\nwhich is if we want to do dual-boot.\n\n821\n00:42:24,368 --> 00:42:27,010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, what we just did right there,\n\n822\n00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:31,086\nwe set ourselves up where Windows 7 is\ngoing to be the only operating system on\n\n823\n00:42:31,086 --> 00:42:31,790\nthat drive.\n\n824\n00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:36,161\nWe formatted that drive effectively, and\nnow it's just going to have Windows 7.\n\n825\n00:42:36,161 --> 00:42:40,125\nBut what if I've already got\nan operating system on there,\n\n826\n00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:43,170\nand I don't want Windows 7 to wipe it out?\n\n827\n00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:49,060\nI want Windows 7 to run side by side with\nthe operating system I've already got.\n\n828\n00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,355\nSo for example, maybe I'm the IT guy for\n\n829\n00:42:52,355 --> 00:42:56,695\na hospital, and\nall of our machines run Windows XP.\n\n830\n00:42:56,695 --> 00:43:00,575\nAnd I know that Microsoft, they've ended\nthe life, end of supported Windows XP.\n\n831\n00:43:00,575 --> 00:43:01,975\nI need to move to something new.\n\n832\n00:43:01,975 --> 00:43:03,380\nI need to try out Windows 7.\n\n833\n00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:03,980\nAll right?\n\n834\n00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,200\nSo, I wanna install it and\nsee if my applications are compatible, but\n\n835\n00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,930\nI don't have an extra computer.\n\n836\n00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:13,885\nSo, what I wanna do is,\nI wanna get my computer to run both.\n\n837\n00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:16,340\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Windows XP and Windows 7.\n\n838\n00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,375\nWell, that's called dual-booting.\n\n839\n00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:18,958\nMm-hm.\n\n840\n00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:20,550\n>> And with dual-booting, you set it up so\n\n841\n00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,730\nthat when your computer turns on,\nyou get a menu.\n\n842\n00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:28,360\nAnd it asks you, do you wanna boot Windows\nXP, or do you wanna boot Windows 7?\n\n843\n00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,630\nAnd both operating systems can be\nsitting there on the same hard drive,\n\n844\n00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:34,620\nwith access to the same data files,\nbut they're separate.\n\n845\n00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,905\nTwo separate operating systems\non the same hard drive.\n\n846\n00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:41,640\nDual-booting is really useful for\ntesting and research.\n\n847\n00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,350\nNot so useful for production, right?\n\n848\n00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,260\nThere's some problems that can creep up,\n\n849\n00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,990\nand not to mention that when you\ninstall an application in one,\n\n850\n00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,990\nyou've got to turn around and reinstall\nthe application in the other, right?\n\n851\n00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,861\nYou can't install them\nboth at the same time.\n\n852\n00:43:52,861 --> 00:43:57,218\nSo it's a little bit difficult to maintain\nand keep up to date, but for testing and\n\n853\n00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:59,450\npracticing, very, very useful.\n\n854\n00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,470\nRight?\n\n855\n00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,030\nOr as Nate would say,\nfor video games, right?\n\n856\n00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,133\n>> Yeah, for video games.\n\n857\n00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:06,044\n>> [LAUGH] You might want to have one\noperating system that you use for work and\n\n858\n00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:08,764\nbusiness stuff, and another one\nthat you use that's optimized for\n\n859\n00:44:08,764 --> 00:44:10,605\ngaming applications or whatever.\n\n860\n00:44:10,605 --> 00:44:12,270\nDual-boot is perfect for that.\n\n861\n00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,662\n>> Yep.\n\n862\n00:44:13,662 --> 00:44:16,600\n>> All right, so\nhow do we set up for dual-boot?\n\n863\n00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,670\nIt's really easy, okay?\n\n864\n00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:23,400\nWhen you boot off of that Windows 7\ndisk to do the install, if there's\n\n865\n00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,180\nalready an existing Windows operating\nsystem on the drive, it will see that.\n\n866\n00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,400\nAnd it will ask you if you want to\noverwrite the existing operating system,\n\n867\n00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,680\nor if you want to install\nin a different directory.\n\n868\n00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,900\nAnd all you have to do is pick\na different directory, right?\n\n869\n00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:44,730\nSo if you installed Windows XP,\nit installs into C:\\Windows by default.\n\n870\n00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:49,425\nSo when you go to install Windows 7,\nyou could just install it in\n\n871\n00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:53,870\nC:\\Windows7 or Win7 or whatever you\nwanted to call it, a different name.\n\n872\n00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:58,210\nAnd when it finishes, Windows 7 will\nbe installed in that second drive, or\n\n873\n00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,180\nthat second folder.\n\n874\n00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,400\nIt could be a second drive.\n\n875\n00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,120\nIt normally is just a second folder.\n\n876\n00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,890\nAnd now whenever you boot up,\n\n877\n00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:07,470\nyou'll get that choice to pick\nbetween the two operating systems.\n\n878\n00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,590\nMicrosoft fully supports this,\nand they support it.\n\n879\n00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:13,500\nWell, they support it with\nWindows operating systems.\n\n880\n00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,860\nYou can dual-boot with Linux.\n\n881\n00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:20,200\nUbuntu has really good support for\nthat, so does Red Hat.\n\n882\n00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,250\nYou can also dual-boot with other\noperating systems that are out there.\n\n883\n00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,925\nBut Microsoft doesn't support that.\n\n884\n00:45:24,925 --> 00:45:27,535\nThey just support it with\nthe Windows operating systems.\n\n885\n00:45:28,805 --> 00:45:33,025\nAll right, and there's other things,\ndo we talk about Windows XP mode?\n\n886\n00:45:34,355 --> 00:45:36,970\n>> It's not specifically mentioned,\nbut we should probably.\n\n887\n00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,241\n>> So, Microsoft said,\nall right, dual-boot it.\n\n888\n00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:41,480\nIt's fine, but it's not the greatest.\n\n889\n00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,390\nAnd there's some difficulties with\nmaintaining it, so they actually released\n\n890\n00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:48,290\nwhat was called Windows XP mode,\nwhich says you can install Windows 7,\n\n891\n00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:53,120\nand then easily run Windows XP\nin a virtual machine.\n\n892\n00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,601\nThey didn't do this for\nthe Home versions of Windows 7,\n\n893\n00:45:55,601 --> 00:45:58,200\nit was just Windows 7 Enterprise and\nUltimate that had it.\n\n894\n00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,273\nBut it allowed you to run Windows XP on\ntop of Windows 7, so they're actually\n\n895\n00:46:02,273 --> 00:46:06,800\nrunning at the same time, versus dual-boot\nwhere you're running one or the other.\n\n896\n00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,090\nYou pick at boot time.\n\n897\n00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,730\nWith Windows XP Mode,\nthey ran at the same time.\n\n898\n00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:15,110\nSo you could have your Legacy applications\nrunning inside of your Windows XP machine.\n\n899\n00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:15,930\nIt's a useful thing.\n\n900\n00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:17,770\nIt's not in the exam objectives,\n\n901\n00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:21,480\nbut let me see if I can find\nthe Microsoft website for that.\n\n902\n00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,960\nSo, but yeah,\nit's just called Windows XP mode.\n\n903\n00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,694\nAnd it's not included with Windows 7,\nyou have to go and download it.\n\n904\n00:46:30,694 --> 00:46:33,280\nOh, they end of supported that too,\nhaven't they?\n\n905\n00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,190\n>> Oh, yep.\n\n906\n00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,300\n>> Windows XP is no longer\nsupported on Microsoft,\n\n907\n00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,290\nso they've end of supported XP Mode also.\n\n908\n00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:43,240\nBut I'm surprised you can't\neven download it anymore.\n\n909\n00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,940\nYeah, they've completely killed it off.\n\n910\n00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,990\nWell, hmm.\n\n911\n00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:52,130\nInteresting.\n\n912\n00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:54,850\nWell, let's see if we can\nstill download it here.\n\n913\n00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:58,900\nDownload Windows XP Mode\npage in the download center.\n\n914\n00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,627\nYeah, you can still download it.\n\n915\n00:47:00,627 --> 00:47:04,360\nI'm going to put these links in the notes.\n\n916\n00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,288\nAgain, it's not supported anymore, so\n\n917\n00:47:08,288 --> 00:47:13,572\nthat's why Microsoft is kind\nof making it hard to find.\n\n918\n00:47:13,572 --> 00:47:15,682\nSo here's the download link, and\n\n919\n00:47:15,682 --> 00:47:19,240\nthen I'll get to the notes\npage there on how to do it.\n\n920\n00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,910\nBut it just kinda lets you\nrun it at the same time.\n\n921\n00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:27,980\nSo it's an alternative to using dual-boot,\nand it's kinda what Microsoft recommends.\n\n922\n00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,776\n>> Yeah, it is by far one of the ways\nwe get around that issue where we have\n\n923\n00:47:32,776 --> 00:47:38,074\nan application that let's say only runs\nin the 32 bit operating system and\n\n924\n00:47:38,074 --> 00:47:40,178\nmay not install of a 64 bit.\n\n925\n00:47:40,178 --> 00:47:42,760\nLet's say like a 16 bit application.\n\n926\n00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,440\nYou can instead install\nin that Windows XP Mode.\n\n927\n00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,240\nAnd even in Windows 7 when you bring up\nit will, that application will look like\n\n928\n00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,130\nanother menu item in your start menu,\nand you'll select it.\n\n929\n00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,530\nAnd when it boots up, the neat thing,\nor the weird thing about,\n\n930\n00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:59,220\nit is that it actually look likes\na Windows XP window that comes up, and\n\n931\n00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,700\nthen you use it like normal.\n\n932\n00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,075\nYou don't even have to see\nthe underlying Windows XP.\n\n933\n00:48:03,075 --> 00:48:05,125\n>> Yep.\n>> Yep, It's pretty cool.\n\n934\n00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:08,250\n>> All right, Ronnie, do we have a-\n>> We do.\n\n935\n00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,542\n>> A machine we can\nshow dual-booting with?\n\n936\n00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:11,126\nOr-\n>> At least, we're going to try.\n\n937\n00:48:11,126 --> 00:48:11,917\n>> Okay.\n\n938\n00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:15,071\nIt's running a little bit slowly because\nwe have that other machine trying to\n\n939\n00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:16,790\nfinish in the background here.\n\n940\n00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:21,150\nSo what I've got is I've got a machine\nhere that I've installed with Windows XP\n\n941\n00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:23,960\non it, and it does run, and\neverything's going here.\n\n942\n00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,740\nAnd so now, I went ahead and\nI created a partition.\n\n943\n00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,320\nOkay.\n\n944\n00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,270\nSo I put that Windows XP in\na 20-gigabyte partition and\n\n945\n00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:37,010\nI've left the rest of the hard drive\nfree here for us to be able to do this.\n\n946\n00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,240\nLet me verify that the, yep, so\n\n947\n00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,480\nthe Windows XP DVD is\nactually in the machine here.\n\n948\n00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,740\nAnd now I click on the Start and this is\nwhere it was taking a little bit of time\n\n949\n00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,710\nand looks like it's gonna take\na little bit of time here.\n\n950\n00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:49,530\n>> It's just getting booted up.\n\n951\n00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:52,000\n>> Yeah,\nit's just getting booted up in terms.\n\n952\n00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,080\nAnd so there is where we should see,\nwhen it does see the operating system.\n\n953\n00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:59,010\nIt's going to tell us we need\nto either Press any key for\n\n954\n00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:02,260\nboot up to a CD or a DVD, and\nwe've got to make sure we select it,\n\n955\n00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,450\nif not it's just going to\nstart XP all over again.\n\n956\n00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,760\n>> All right so there it is,\nPress any key to boot from CD or DVD.\n\n957\n00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,610\n>> Hopefully I did it.\n\n958\n00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:10,550\nThere we go.\n\n959\n00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,050\nOops.\n\n960\n00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,790\nApparently I didn't, did I get it?\n\n961\n00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:19,086\nIt doesn't look like I got\nto it [LAUGH] fast enough.\n\n962\n00:49:19,086 --> 00:49:20,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, there we go.\n\n963\n00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,150\n>> Why is doing the Windows\nmemory diagnostic?\n\n964\n00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:22,900\n>> I don't know.\n>> I guess it\n\n965\n00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,880\npicked that up as a F8 or something.\n\n966\n00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,060\n>> Yep.\n>> There we go.\n\n967\n00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,200\n>> Well, that's weird.\n\n968\n00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,330\nYep.\n>> You know, when you boot,\n\n969\n00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:32,140\nthere's a brief moment where you can\nhit F8 to get to the testing menu, so\n\n970\n00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,180\nI guess it picked that up.\n\n971\n00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,620\nYou're gonna have to restart.\n\n972\n00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,019\n>> Yep.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n973\n00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:37,467\n>> It booted off of the hard drive instead\n\n974\n00:49:37,467 --> 00:49:38,060\nof the disk so.\n\n975\n00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:38,860\n>> Select shutdown.\n\n976\n00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:43,750\nJust when I think that I've selected,\noh, there it is.\n\n977\n00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,976\nI've probably just messed\nup our virtual machine.\n\n978\n00:49:45,976 --> 00:49:47,047\n>> Everything is ruined.\n\n979\n00:49:47,047 --> 00:49:47,980\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know.\n\n980\n00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,840\nWhere is my reset?\n\n981\n00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:52,650\nReset?\n\n982\n00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:55,950\n>> There we go.\n\n983\n00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:56,610\nAll right.\nSo\n\n984\n00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,564\nbasically what he's gonna\ndo is he's gonna boot up\n\n985\n00:49:58,564 --> 00:49:59,410\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n986\n00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:01,220\n>> Or try to boot up off the DVD.\n\n987\n00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,350\nAnd when he boots up it's just\nlike installing Windows 7 except\n\n988\n00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,310\nsome of the screens are gonna be\na little different cause it will\n\n989\n00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:10,950\nrecognize that there's already\na copy of Windows on the machine.\n\n990\n00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:13,750\n>> So this is going to be annoying.\n\n991\n00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:14,785\n>> After it prompts you a hundred times.\n\n992\n00:50:16,925 --> 00:50:17,910\nThere we go.\n\n993\n00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,520\nSo we're going right\nback into the installer.\n\n994\n00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,470\nThings still look the same.\n\n995\n00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:23,980\nThat's because it hasn't really\nscanned the hard drives at this point.\n\n996\n00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,310\n>> The installation process\nis pretty much the same here.\n\n997\n00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:29,680\nLooks like we're going to a regular,\nbrand new install.\n\n998\n00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,440\nSo click Next, and\nwe're gonna select Install now.\n\n999\n00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:37,330\nAnd, once again, it should bring us\nup to that menu that's gonna give us\n\n1000\n00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:41,010\nthe partition again, and we'll see\nan existing partition on ours this time.\n\n1001\n00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,920\n>> Yeah, now we do have to be careful\ncuz we're gonna see that screen where it\n\n1002\n00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,850\nasked us if we wanna upgrade,\nor do a custom install.\n\n1003\n00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:51,560\nIf you choose upgrade, it is going to try\nand replace replace the version of Windows\n\n1004\n00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,510\nthat's already there, and if you're trying\nto dual-boot, that's not what you want,\n\n1005\n00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,010\nyou don't want to replace\nwhat you've already go,\n\n1006\n00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:58,140\nyou want to go in addition to it.\n\n1007\n00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:02,150\nSo you'll see in the description\nof that bottom option how it says,\n\n1008\n00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,630\nInstall a new copy of Windows.\n\n1009\n00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:07,000\nThis option does not keep your files and\nsettings and so on.\n\n1010\n00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,490\nThen it says like, the option to\nmake changes to disk will be there.\n\n1011\n00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:10,690\nBack up your files.\n\n1012\n00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,520\nBut if you'll look at the top one,\nupgrade to a newer version of Windows and\n\n1013\n00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,140\nkeep your files and settings.\n\n1014\n00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,120\nThis option to upgrade is only available\nwhen existing version of Windows\n\n1015\n00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,940\nis running.\n\n1016\n00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,180\nWe recommend backing up your files.\n\n1017\n00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,505\nSo either way they're saying\nyou might lose some stuff.\n\n1018\n00:51:25,074 --> 00:51:28,672\n>> So now here's where we\nhave that Disk 0 Partition 1.\n\n1019\n00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:32,000\nThat 20-gig hard drive is the one\nthat I've installed XP on, and\n\n1020\n00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,260\nnow I'm gonna choose to actually\nuninstall it on this other partition.\n\n1021\n00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,200\n>> Not uninstall.\n\n1022\n00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,069\n>> Oh, not uninstall.\n>> Install.\n\n1023\n00:51:37,069 --> 00:51:37,889\n>> Install.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1024\n00:51:37,889 --> 00:51:38,629\n>> I read unallocated.\n\n1025\n00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:40,178\nI don't know why I said that.\n\n1026\n00:51:40,178 --> 00:51:41,670\nThat's just the way my mind works.\n\n1027\n00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:44,410\nYeah, install it in the unallocated space.\n\n1028\n00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:45,050\nLet me click Next.\n\n1029\n00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,570\nMaybe.\n\n1030\n00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:48,310\n>> I'm gonna try.\n\n1031\n00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:51,150\nYeah.\n>> And then what happens is Windows 7\n\n1032\n00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:55,710\nhas an all-new boot loader, a boot loader\nthat is different than the Windows XP one.\n\n1033\n00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:59,130\nBut the Windows 7 boot loader\ndoes support Windows XP so\n\n1034\n00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:02,830\nit will see that XP install and\nadd it as a second boot option.\n\n1035\n00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:06,246\nSo when this is done, when this machine\nboots up we'll have the two choice.\n\n1036\n00:52:06,246 --> 00:52:08,320\nSo Ronnie,\nyou got two VMs running right now.\n\n1037\n00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,235\nThis is gonna run slow since they're\nboth thrashing your hard drive.\n\n1038\n00:52:11,235 --> 00:52:11,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n1039\n00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:14,320\nthe first one is just running Windows 7.\n\n1040\n00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,470\nSo when we turn it on it's gonna go\nstraight into Windows 7 and that's it.\n\n1041\n00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:21,300\nThis one's gonna have Windows 7 and\nWindows XP, so\n\n1042\n00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,580\nwhen we turn it on we'll get\na choice between the two.\n\n1043\n00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,800\n>> Now, so Don mentioned\nsomething very important for us.\n\n1044\n00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,340\nThe key to remember this is that the older\noperating system needs to be the one\n\n1045\n00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:34,330\nthat's installed first when we do this and\n\n1046\n00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:37,550\nthen the newer operating system is\nthe one that we want to install next.\n\n1047\n00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:40,390\nSecondly, because of what Don\njust mentioned here about\n\n1048\n00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,680\nthe way that the boot loader actually\nworks and it can recognize the old one,\n\n1049\n00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,610\nwhereas the old one might not recognize\nthe new Windows 7 boot loader.\n\n1050\n00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:50,367\n>> Yeah, if you install Windows XP second,\nits boot\n\n1051\n00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:55,170\nloader will replace Windows 7 and you'll\nno longer be able to boot Windows 7.\n\n1052\n00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,840\nNow you can still boot\noff a Windows 7 DVD, and\n\n1053\n00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,120\nuse that repair option and it will\nfix its boot loader and put it back.\n\n1054\n00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,530\nSo all is not lost.\n\n1055\n00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:05,920\nBut the recommended procedure is to have\nthe older operating system installed\n\n1056\n00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,750\nfirst, Then install the newer\noperating system and\n\n1057\n00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:11,240\nit'll pick it up automatically and\nadd it in.\n\n1058\n00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:11,940\nAll right, well Ronnie,\n\n1059\n00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,210\nwatching status percentages tick along\non the screen is pretty boring stuff.\n\n1060\n00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:16,700\n>> Yes.\n>> So, why don't we stop here and\n\n1061\n00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,490\ntake a break, and\nwhen we get back we'll take a look at the.\n\n1062\n00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,600\nThe final result, right.\n\n1063\n00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,150\nWe'll have our regular Windows\n7 install finished and\n\n1064\n00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:26,090\nour dual boot install finished and\nwe'll take a look at how those function.\n\n1065\n00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:26,810\n>> Sounds great.\n\n1066\n00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:31,612\n>> Stay tuned, we'll be back in a few.\n\n1067\n00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:36,350\n[MUSIC]\n\n1068\n00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,258\nAll right, so,\nthrough the magic of television, right,\n\n1069\n00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:42,240\ntime has elapsed and\nthe Windows 7 installs have finished.\n\n1070\n00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,750\nActually we didn't really have to\nstall much more than we normally do.\n\n1071\n00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,745\nBut the installs are done,\nso let's take a look.\n\n1072\n00:53:47,745 --> 00:53:51,530\nLet's start with just\nthe standard Windows 7 install,\n\n1073\n00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:52,790\nRonnie, let's see where that one ended up.\n\n1074\n00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:59,260\n>> All right, so here on my machine,\nas we take a look at here,\n\n1075\n00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:00,820\nthis is what happens of course.\n\n1076\n00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,290\nWe install everything that needs\nto be installed, and of course,\n\n1077\n00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:07,990\nthere's a little bit of a finishing up the\ninstallation here by choosing a username,\n\n1078\n00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:10,020\nas well as the actual name of the PC.\n\n1079\n00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:13,170\nSo, I'm just going to go ahead and\ntype in my name.\n\n1080\n00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:17,225\nFor the computer name, I'm real original\nhere, I'm just going to call it CL4.\n\n1081\n00:54:17,225 --> 00:54:18,010\nI don't know.\n\n1082\n00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:20,525\n>> Yeah,\nit was an image-based install, and\n\n1083\n00:54:20,525 --> 00:54:23,135\nMicrosoft doesn't want everybody's\nmachine set up the same way.\n\n1084\n00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:25,345\nSo what we're doing here,\nis going through and\n\n1085\n00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:29,365\nproviding the unique information that\nidentifies this computer on our network.\n\n1086\n00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:33,672\nRight, so name, you'll do your password,\nbasic information, and\n\n1087\n00:54:33,672 --> 00:54:36,872\nthen it's gonna take us into\nthe Windows 7 operating system.\n\n1088\n00:54:36,872 --> 00:54:39,852\nFor all intents and purposes,\nthe install itself is done.\n\n1089\n00:54:39,852 --> 00:54:41,932\nWe're running Windows 7 right now.\n\n1090\n00:54:41,932 --> 00:54:43,752\nThis isn't a installer,\n\n1091\n00:54:43,752 --> 00:54:46,752\nthis is actually just an application\nrunning on top of Windows 7.\n\n1092\n00:54:46,752 --> 00:54:50,722\n>> Now I skipped over the actual\nupdates cuz we're only doing this for\n\n1093\n00:54:50,722 --> 00:54:51,922\na lab machine.\n\n1094\n00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:56,190\nSo set the right time for\nmy instance here and then,\n\n1095\n00:54:56,190 --> 00:55:00,690\nI get to choose what particular location\nthat I want to actually set this up for,\n\n1096\n00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,360\nso, in terms of my network connections.\n\n1097\n00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,820\nSo, I'm just gonna set it up for work,\nand let it finalize and install.\n\n1098\n00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,990\n>> And those networks, we're gonna\ntalk about those more later, but\n\n1099\n00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:12,290\nthey're just determining the level\nof security on our interfaces.\n\n1100\n00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:15,560\nSo, if you choose public, the firewall\nrules will all be set up very,\n\n1101\n00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,580\nvery strict.\n\n1102\n00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,430\nIf you choose Home the firewall\nrules will be set up a little more\n\n1103\n00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:22,380\nloosely to allow communications\nlike file sharing.\n\n1104\n00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,410\nAll right, now when it says preparing\nyour desktop it's not actually preparing\n\n1105\n00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:29,050\nWindows 7,\nit's preparing your user profile.\n\n1106\n00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:33,360\nSo every user on Windows 7 has\ntheir own documents folder, videos,\n\n1107\n00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,240\nall the different folders you\nhave as part of your account.\n\n1108\n00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,330\nAnd so\nthat's what it's creating right here.\n\n1109\n00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:41,920\nAs soon as that's done, we'll be logged\nin and we'll see a Windows 7 desktop.\n\n1110\n00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,410\nWe're now running Windows 7.\n\n1111\n00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,570\nAll right.\n\n1112\n00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:48,190\nSo while that one's finishing\nrunning let's take a look at\n\n1113\n00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,150\nthe dual boot machine.\n\n1114\n00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,900\nNow it looks a bit different-\n>> It does.\n\n1115\n00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,125\n>> When you turn it on.\n\n1116\n00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:54,965\n>> When we actually went ahead and\nre-rebooted the machine,\n\n1117\n00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:58,823\none of the first options it gives me now\nis in the Windows boot manager itself, and\n\n1118\n00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:02,512\ninstead of actually going directly in,\nit gives me this option, of course,\n\n1119\n00:56:02,512 --> 00:56:03,740\nto now choose which one.\n\n1120\n00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:07,382\nNow I actually had to stop it because\nit gave me a three-second one right at\n\n1121\n00:56:07,382 --> 00:56:08,458\nthe beginning here.\n\n1122\n00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:09,333\nNow to stop it.\n\n1123\n00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:12,645\nBut once you stop it,\nyou now have the choice to go back and\n\n1124\n00:56:12,645 --> 00:56:17,100\nforth between which edition of the\noperating system you really want to run.\n\n1125\n00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,750\n>> Both OSs are there.\n\n1126\n00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,410\nIf Ronnie were to choose Windows 7,\nit would continue on and\n\n1127\n00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:25,160\nboot Windows 7 just like\nwe're seeing in the other VM.\n\n1128\n00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,820\nIt'd be asking him for his user name,\nand computer name, pick a password.\n\n1129\n00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,570\nAnd you'd have a version of Windows 7.\n\n1130\n00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:34,850\nBut if he choses that earlier version of\nWindows, let's go that route, Ronnie.\n\n1131\n00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:39,620\nWhen you choose that earlier version of\nWindows, it's now gonna boot Windows XP.\n\n1132\n00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:44,220\nSo he still has Windows XP on here and\nhe's got Windows 7 and at boot time he\n\n1133\n00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:48,670\njust picks which one he wants to boot,\nso So that choice is available.\n\n1134\n00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:52,710\nAnd it called it, the name of it\nwas earlier version of Windows.\n\n1135\n00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,890\nYou can actually go and edit that and\nchange the name if you want.\n\n1136\n00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,810\nIt doesn't really matter,\nyou only see it at boot time.\n\n1137\n00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:02,650\nBut that's basically the premise\nbehind dual booting, very useful.\n\n1138\n00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:05,860\nIf Ronnie were to reboot right now,\nhe'd go back and\n\n1139\n00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,430\nsee that menu where it asked\nhim which OS he wanted to run.\n\n1140\n00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:13,070\nAnd you could pick Windows 7, and\nkinda boot right back into that one.\n\n1141\n00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:16,540\nSo you do it at boot time,\nboot to whichever one you need.\n\n1142\n00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,180\nAll right?\n\n1143\n00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,930\nSo getting Windows 7 installed.\n\n1144\n00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:20,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> Pretty straightforward, right?\n\n1145\n00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,450\nNot a whole heck of a lot to it.\n\n1146\n00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:25,050\nWe're gonna learn, in a later episode,\n\n1147\n00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:27,760\nabout some of the advanced deployment\noptions that are out there.\n\n1148\n00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,910\nFor example,\nif we wanna do a network installations and\n\n1149\n00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,740\nthings where it can get\na lot more complex.\n\n1150\n00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,980\nBut as far as the basic install,\nthat's really about it right there.\n\n1151\n00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,508\n>> I chose the CUDD.\n\n1152\n00:57:38,508 --> 00:57:39,923\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1153\n00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,140\n>> It's so automatic.\n\n1154\n00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,460\nI see it, I just wanna press it.\n\n1155\n00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,710\n>> That was might fault.\n\n1156\n00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,470\nI've been there.\n\n1157\n00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,120\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right,\n\n1158\n00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,910\nwell some of the other things\nthat I want to talk about.\n\n1159\n00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,460\nLet me bring up our objective list here.\n\n1160\n00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:54,090\nSo we just took a look at installing\nWindows There are several\n\n1161\n00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:56,040\nother ways that we can install Windows.\n\n1162\n00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,340\nNow we just did it from a DVD, or CD/DVD.\n\n1163\n00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,630\nI mentioned a USB key.\n\n1164\n00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:04,340\nHow we can prepare a USB\ninstallation media if we want.\n\n1165\n00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,230\nThere are two other methods.\n\n1166\n00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:08,750\nThere's installing from a network share,\nor\n\n1167\n00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:13,040\ninstalling from\nWindows Deployment Services, or WDS.\n\n1168\n00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:18,640\nThose last two involve having your copy\nof Windows stored in a network location,\n\n1169\n00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,480\nand you actually install\nthe operating system via the network.\n\n1170\n00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,300\nThat means that you don't need a CD or\n\n1171\n00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,970\nDVD drive that your entire installation\nhappens via a network connection.\n\n1172\n00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:31,990\nFor a home user, even for\na small business, this is not realistic,\n\n1173\n00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,820\nit's not something you're gonna do.\n\n1174\n00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,380\nBut if you're about to set\nup 1,000 Windows 7 machines,\n\n1175\n00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,570\nyou don't wanna have to have 1,000 disks.\n\n1176\n00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:41,630\nYou don't wanna pay somebody to go and\ninsert it into each of these machines.\n\n1177\n00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:45,200\nyou want to be able to do a network\ninstall, and WDS can help with that.\n\n1178\n00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,530\nNow, I don't want to dive to\ndeep into that right now,\n\n1179\n00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:52,300\nbecause if you look at our next set\nof objectives, if you look down here\n\n1180\n00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,345\nyou'll see creating a system image,\npreparing it for, Deployment.\n\n1181\n00:58:55,345 --> 00:58:57,675\nWell that's all WDS,\nWindows Deployment Services.\n\n1182\n00:58:57,675 --> 00:59:02,065\nWe'll get a chance to see how that works\ndown there in the second objective.\n\n1183\n00:59:02,065 --> 00:59:08,349\nNow, what Ronnie just showed us was\ndual-booting Windows 7 and Windows XP.\n\n1184\n00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,466\nBut, what if I didn't want do that?\n\n1185\n00:59:11,466 --> 00:59:12,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What if I just wanted to\n\n1186\n00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:16,050\nreplace my old install with Windows 7?\n\n1187\n00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:20,110\nBut we need to talk a little\nabout how we upgrade Windows and\n\n1188\n00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:21,810\nsome of the stuff that's involved in it.\n\n1189\n00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:23,340\nIt's a little confusing.\n\n1190\n00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:27,360\nIt's so confusing that Microsoft actually\nhad to create a web page about it which\n\n1191\n00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,990\nI've got bookmarked around here somewhere,\nthe Windows 7 upgrade paths.\n\n1192\n00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:38,130\nSo if we want to upgrade Windows 7\nwe need to be aware that there's\n\n1193\n00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:40,470\nspecific scenarios that are supported.\n\n1194\n00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:42,620\nNot every scenario is supported.\n\n1195\n00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,560\nAnd so, right here on Microsoft's upgrade\npage they call out just right away,\n\n1196\n00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,060\nupgrades to Windows 7 from the following\noperating systems are not supported.\n\n1197\n00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,650\nAnd then they start to\ngive us a nice big list.\n\n1198\n00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:56,230\nWindows 95, 98, Millennium edition,\n\n1199\n00:59:56,230 --> 01:00:00,930\nWindows XP, Windows Vista released to\nmanufacturer, the first version of Vista.\n\n1200\n01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,430\nSo there's a lot of operating\nsystem that are here in this list\n\n1201\n01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:06,810\nthat we cannot upgrade to Windows 7.\n\n1202\n01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:10,090\nSo does that mean I'm out of luck?\n\n1203\n01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:11,850\nNot necessarily.\n\n1204\n01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:13,400\nRemember there's a difference and\n\n1205\n01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,940\non the exam there's a big difference\nbetween an upgrade and a migration.\n\n1206\n01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:18,630\nOkay.\n\n1207\n01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:22,040\nAn upgrade is where I take\nan operating system and\n\n1208\n01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,930\nWindows 7 replaces\nthe operating system but\n\n1209\n01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:30,090\nretains all the applications,\nall the settings, and all the documents.\n\n1210\n01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,100\nThat's an upgrade.\n\n1211\n01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:39,300\nA migration Is where I completely\nremove the old operating system.\n\n1212\n01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,260\nI install the new operating system.\n\n1213\n01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:46,630\nAnd then I restore my documents and\nmy applications somehow.\n\n1214\n01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:48,480\nRight.\nThat's a migration, alright?\n\n1215\n01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,570\nSo there's a difference.\n\n1216\n01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:52,120\nOne requires a restore, one doesn't.\n\n1217\n01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:57,450\nIf I want to upgrade, it's actually\na very, very small list scenario.\n\n1218\n01:00:57,450 --> 01:01:01,600\nYou can only upgrade to\nWindows 7 if you're running\n\n1219\n01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,470\nWindows Vista Service Pack 1 or\nWindows Vista Service Pack 2.\n\n1220\n01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:09,500\nIf you're running Windows Vista with\nno service pack, you can't upgrade.\n\n1221\n01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,520\nYou gotta deploy Service Pack 1 at least.\n\n1222\n01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,460\nAll right?\n\n1223\n01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,480\nBut if you're running Windows Vista\nwith Service Pack 1 or 2,\n\n1224\n01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,870\nyou can do an in-place\nupgrade to Windows 7.\n\n1225\n01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,620\nAll your applications, documents and\nstuff like that will be saved.\n\n1226\n01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,310\nAll right.\n\n1227\n01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:24,550\nAny other scenario what do we do?\n\n1228\n01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:25,290\n>> Yeah.\n\n1229\n01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:28,100\nMigrate.\n>> We've gotta do a migration.\n\n1230\n01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:31,730\nAll right so with the migration\nyou're gonna lose your data, right?\n\n1231\n01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,535\nAnd now migration can really\ntake two different forms.\n\n1232\n01:01:34,535 --> 01:01:37,515\nOne form of migration is\nwhere I buy a new computer.\n\n1233\n01:01:37,515 --> 01:01:41,445\nSo I've got my old computer sitting right\nhere, my new computer sitting next to it.\n\n1234\n01:01:41,445 --> 01:01:43,375\nMy old computer is running,\nlet's say, Windows XP,\n\n1235\n01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:45,750\nmy new computer is running Windows 7.\n\n1236\n01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,320\nAll I need to do is get my data over,\nright?\n\n1237\n01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,090\nThat's the easiest migration, and\n\n1238\n01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:53,400\nMicrosoft calls that\na side by side migration.\n\n1239\n01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:59,130\nBut what if I want to do an in-place\nupgrade, an upgrade on the same machine?\n\n1240\n01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:03,710\nI have one machine, and I want to\nmove from Windows XP to Windows 7.\n\n1241\n01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:04,440\nI can't do an upgrade.\n\n1242\n01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,850\nI gotta do a migration.\n\n1243\n01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:10,250\nSo I need to backup my data,\nformat the machine,\n\n1244\n01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:15,190\ninstall Windows 7, and\nthen restore my data.\n\n1245\n01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,828\nAnd then I'm back in business, and\nnow I've migrated to Windows 7.\n\n1246\n01:02:18,828 --> 01:02:19,585\n>> Right.\n\n1247\n01:02:19,585 --> 01:02:20,800\n>> All right.\n\n1248\n01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,320\nSo that's basically what they're\nhighlighting here on this upgrade\n\n1249\n01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,840\narticle is when you\nhave to do a migration.\n\n1250\n01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,840\nSo all of these guys,\nthat would be a migration\n\n1251\n01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,640\nversus if you're doing Windows Vista\nthen you can do an upgrade.\n\n1252\n01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,580\nSo when we look at supported\nupgraded scenarios.\n\n1253\n01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:41,020\nAnd you look here,\nfrom Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and\n\n1254\n01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:43,960\nService Pack 2 to Windows 7.\n\n1255\n01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,820\nAnd you'll see the editions.\n\n1256\n01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:48,570\nBecause Windows Vista had\nBusiness Enterprise, Home Basic, and\n\n1257\n01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:52,320\nHome Premium, and so\nthey can upgrade into Windows 7.\n\n1258\n01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,810\nUsually you pick the same edition, but\nyou can actually upgrade up if you want.\n\n1259\n01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:58,330\nIf you're running Home Premium,\nfor example,\n\n1260\n01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:01,140\nyou could upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate.\n\n1261\n01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:01,730\nOops.\n\n1262\n01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:05,403\nIf you chose, but you don't have to.\n\n1263\n01:03:05,403 --> 01:03:07,430\nAll right.\n\n1264\n01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,320\nIf I'm going to do a in place upgrade.\n\n1265\n01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:14,460\nIf I'm running Vista Service Pack 1 and\nI upgraded Windows 7, it's really,\n\n1266\n01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,080\nreally easy.\n\n1267\n01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:21,160\nYou boot up into Windows Vista, so\nyou're up and running Windows Vista,\n\n1268\n01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:25,140\nyou pop in your Windows 7 disk, a window\npops up on the screen and says, hey,\n\n1269\n01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,400\nyou're running Windows Vista,\nare you ready to upgrade, right?\n\n1270\n01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,620\nAnd you click Install Now.\n\n1271\n01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:32,020\nIt's actually that same screen we\nsaw when we booted off the disk,\n\n1272\n01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:36,970\nit's just running inside of Vista When you\nclick install now it copies the Windows 7\n\n1273\n01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:43,050\ninformation to the hard drive, it reboots,\nruns through a little automated installer.\n\n1274\n01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:46,649\nAnd then it reboots again into\nWindows 7 with all your applications,\n\n1275\n01:03:46,649 --> 01:03:50,920\nall you documents, your user accounts\nall that stuff still there, you're done.\n\n1276\n01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,140\nIt's really,\nreally easy takes a long time.\n\n1277\n01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:55,940\nThe last time I did it,\nit took like two hours.\n\n1278\n01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,500\nHow about you?\n\n1279\n01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,458\n>> Yeah, it takes a long time.\n\n1280\n01:03:58,458 --> 01:04:01,557\nAnd some of the things that you do want\nto remember if you're doing this upgrade,\n\n1281\n01:04:01,557 --> 01:04:02,980\nyou want to turn off your antivirus.\n\n1282\n01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:06,390\nI know that sounds weird,\ndisconnect it from the network here.\n\n1283\n01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:09,318\nBecause if not it's gonna take\na look at that upgrade and go, hey,\n\n1284\n01:04:09,318 --> 01:04:12,562\nI don't recognize these files and\nit may think it's actually a virus, or\n\n1285\n01:04:12,562 --> 01:04:16,310\nat least it's going to take a long time\nto scan every individual file here.\n\n1286\n01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:20,588\nSo to help it along you may wanna do that,\nbut it's still gonna take a long time that\n\n1287\n01:04:20,588 --> 01:04:23,398\nyou do the upgrade cuz it has\nto convert a lot of files.\n\n1288\n01:04:23,398 --> 01:04:26,652\n>> Yep, so keep that in mind\ndisabling your antivirus is one.\n\n1289\n01:04:26,652 --> 01:04:29,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Another one is update all your hardware\n\n1290\n01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:32,140\ndrivers prior to doing the upgrade.\n\n1291\n01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:35,790\nThat often times vendors will release\nupdated drivers that add the support for\n\n1292\n01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:41,140\nWindows 7, so you need to update all your\ndrivers prior to the upgrade, all right?\n\n1293\n01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:44,380\nOnce that's done, you run through\nthe upgrade and you're in business, right?\n\n1294\n01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:48,670\nSo Vista to Windows 7 is possible as long\nas you're running service pack one or\n\n1295\n01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,280\nservice pack two.\n\n1296\n01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,560\nYou can also upgrade from\nWindows 7 to Windows 7.\n\n1297\n01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,273\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now, wait a minute.\n\n1298\n01:04:55,273 --> 01:04:55,850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Why\n\n1299\n01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,620\nwould I upgrade from\nWindows 7 to Windows 7?\n\n1300\n01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:02,170\nWell, what you're doing is\nwhat's called a Anytime Upgrade,\n\n1301\n01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:04,240\nand you'll see it right\nhere on Microsoft's site.\n\n1302\n01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,180\nAn Anytime Upgrade, and\n\n1303\n01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:10,880\nthat's where we upgrade from one\nedition of Windows 7 to another.\n\n1304\n01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:16,770\nSo maybe I'm running Home Basic, and\nI want to upgrade to Home Premium or\n\n1305\n01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:18,570\nProfessional, or Ultimate,\nfor that matter.\n\n1306\n01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:22,840\nSo you can upgrade from any\naddition to a higher edition.\n\n1307\n01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:27,260\nYou can't upgrade to the same edition,\nthat doesn't make any sense, and you can't\n\n1308\n01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:30,660\ndowngrade to a lower edition, so you can\nonly upgrade to the higher editions.\n\n1309\n01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:34,970\n>> Yeah now where you might find this\noption, I don't have it because I have\n\n1310\n01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:38,230\nan enterprise, which of course you\nsee isn't even on the list here.\n\n1311\n01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:41,110\nBut on my machine if you go\nto the system properties and\n\n1312\n01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:44,870\nnormally right under here is where\nyou'll get a link that says hey,\n\n1313\n01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:47,490\non your edition here,\nthis is the addition your running, you\n\n1314\n01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:52,620\nwanna do an anytime upgrade then they'll\ngive you that paths that you can choose.\n\n1315\n01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,930\nAnd of course you'll pay for\nit and you'll be ready to go.\n\n1316\n01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:59,820\n>> Yeah, so that's definitely useful if\nyou want to move to a higher edition,\n\n1317\n01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:02,610\nyou can do that upgrade,\nnot many people do that.\n\n1318\n01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:08,180\nThe upgrade is actually very similar\nto doing the upgrade from Vista to 7,\n\n1319\n01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:12,330\nbecause it will actually reboot, copy over\nfiles, and stuff like that as part of that\n\n1320\n01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:15,630\nprocess and then you'll finish but\nyou've retained all your data.\n\n1321\n01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:16,330\n>> All right.\n\n1322\n01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:19,600\n>> All right, so the upgrade\nprocess is pretty straight forward.\n\n1323\n01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,390\nLet's talk about the weird part, though.\n\n1324\n01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:25,420\nSo if I'm upgrading from one\nof these other guys here, so\n\n1325\n01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:29,275\nfrom Windows XP or\nfrom Windows ME, God forbid.\n\n1326\n01:06:29,275 --> 01:06:29,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I'm\n\n1327\n01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,200\nupgrading from one of these things\n>> And\n\n1328\n01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,700\nMicrosoft doesn't give me a path, they\ntell me nope, there's no upgrade path,\n\n1329\n01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,730\nyou can't, you've got to do a migration,\nyou've got to wipe and reinstall.\n\n1330\n01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:40,470\nSo, what do I do?\n\n1331\n01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:43,880\nWell, Microsoft hasn't\ncompletely abandoned us.\n\n1332\n01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,760\nThey've actually given us two tools\nthat help us bring over our user data.\n\n1333\n01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,580\nRemember I said you need to back\nup your data and then restore it?\n\n1334\n01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,440\nThey give us two tools that make that easy\n\n1335\n01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,820\nto be able to get our systems back up and\nrunning.\n\n1336\n01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:00,030\n>> Those particular tools,\none is actually for\n\n1337\n01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:04,950\nof course the idea of doing a small number\nof migrations or just a single migration.\n\n1338\n01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:08,300\nAnd then they actually give us\nanother tool that actually is for\n\n1339\n01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,840\nenterprise migrations here.\n\n1340\n01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,770\nThe tool that's used for\n\n1341\n01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:15,240\na single migration is actually what\nwe call the Windows Easy Transfer.\n\n1342\n01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:19,280\nOkay, the Windows Easy Transfer kit\nhas actually been around for a while.\n\n1343\n01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:24,010\nIn XP it's called the Windows files and\nsomething, or yeah.\n\n1344\n01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:26,288\n>> File and\nsettings transfer wizard, yeah.\n\n1345\n01:07:26,288 --> 01:07:26,820\n>> And then beginning\n\n1346\n01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:29,940\nin Vista they started calling\nit the Windows Easy Transfer.\n\n1347\n01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:34,185\nIf you're going to, again, do a migration\nfrom earlier operating systems to Windows\n\n1348\n01:07:34,185 --> 01:07:39,010\n7 the key is to make sure that you're\nusing the actual Windows Easy Transfer\n\n1349\n01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:41,960\nfrom Windows 7 to migrate to Windows 7.\n\n1350\n01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:44,680\nSo that's the key to doing it.\n\n1351\n01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,525\n>> And so I've got pulled up right here\nthe Windows Easy Transfer web page from\n\n1352\n01:07:47,525 --> 01:07:50,955\nMicrosoft and what they do is they let\nyou download a notice they have for\n\n1353\n01:07:50,955 --> 01:07:52,925\nWindows Vista if you wanna go that route.\n\n1354\n01:07:52,925 --> 01:07:54,395\nThey also have for Windows XP.\n\n1355\n01:07:54,395 --> 01:07:57,735\nSo even though there's no direct\nupgrade path from Windows XP\n\n1356\n01:07:57,735 --> 01:08:00,245\nthey do give you\nthe Easy Transfer software.\n\n1357\n01:08:00,245 --> 01:08:04,445\nAnd what you do is you download the Easy\nTransfer software to your Windows XP\n\n1358\n01:08:04,445 --> 01:08:10,880\nmachine and you run it and when you run\nit It will collect all of your documents.\n\n1359\n01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,180\nIt'll collect all of you settings,\nyour wallpaper, your screen saver timeout,\n\n1360\n01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,430\nyour user name.\n\n1361\n01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:20,240\nIt'll gather all the stuff that's\nrelated to your account and\n\n1362\n01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,800\nstick it into a migration file.\n\n1363\n01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:26,630\nYou can then take that file,\ncopy it to your new machine,\n\n1364\n01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:30,075\ncopy it to your Windows 7 machine,\nand Windows Easy Transfer is\n\n1365\n01:08:30,075 --> 01:08:32,460\nbuilt-in in Windows 7, so\nyou don't have to download it.\n\n1366\n01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:35,010\nSo, you run Windows Easy Transfer\non Windows 7 and\n\n1367\n01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:37,820\nyou tell it to import that migration file.\n\n1368\n01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:41,400\nAnd it imports it, bringing in all\nof your documents, your bookmarks,\n\n1369\n01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,860\nyour wallpaper, all that stuff,\nputs it in place in Windows 7.\n\n1370\n01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:47,570\nIt gets almost everything.\n\n1371\n01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:48,710\nNow, I say almost.\n\n1372\n01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:49,920\nWhat doesn't it get?\n\n1373\n01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,460\nYour applications.\n\n1374\n01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,510\nIf you've installed any applications,\nMicrosoft Office, Google Chrome, whatever.\n\n1375\n01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:57,250\nIt can't move entire applications.\n\n1376\n01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:00,570\nIt can move their settings but\nnot the application itself.\n\n1377\n01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:04,070\nSo, you'll still need to reinstall your\napplications on the new system, but\n\n1378\n01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:06,340\notherwise their data will come right over.\n\n1379\n01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:09,480\n>> Yeah, the recommended idea is if\nyou are doing this migration, right?\n\n1380\n01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,620\nOnce you do have your files ready and\n\n1381\n01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:14,970\nyou install Windows 7 on there\nthey want you to install your new\n\n1382\n01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:19,720\napplications first before putting\nthat migration data back in place.\n\n1383\n01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,090\nSo that way it actually\nsees the migration file\n\n1384\n01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:25,580\nas able to see that those\napplications are in place and\n\n1385\n01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:29,920\nattached to those particular hooks into\nthose applications where they need to.\n\n1386\n01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,950\nYeah.\n\n1387\n01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:33,420\n>> So pretty cool, pretty straightforward.\n\n1388\n01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:37,340\nI mentioned the USMT,\nthe user state migration tool, well,\n\n1389\n01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:41,850\nthat one does the same thing, it does the\nsame thing as Windows Easy Transfer does.\n\n1390\n01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:44,570\nThe difference is two things.\n\n1391\n01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:47,930\nDifference number 1,\nthe Windows Easy Transfer\n\n1392\n01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:51,730\nhas a nice wizard-driven user interface,\nit's graphical, right?\n\n1393\n01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:54,190\nYou walk through that little\nwizard to do your settings.\n\n1394\n01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:58,592\nThe USMT is command line only, so\nyou're dropping your command line and\n\n1395\n01:09:58,592 --> 01:09:59,970\nrunning stuff there.\n\n1396\n01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:02,980\nNow you might say why would\nI want to do that, right?\n\n1397\n01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:07,530\nWell if you're scripting and automating\nthis migration you want command line,\n\n1398\n01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:09,090\nyou don't want a GUI.\n\n1399\n01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:12,310\nAnd so the USMT is designed for\nmore industrial uses.\n\n1400\n01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:16,240\nThe other thing is, Windows Easy Transfer,\nwhen Ronnie runs it later,\n\n1401\n01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:22,420\nit's gonna back up just his account, just\nhis desktop, his favorites and whenever.\n\n1402\n01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,640\nWhat if it's a shared computer?\n\n1403\n01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,450\nWhat if 10 different people\nall use that same computer?\n\n1404\n01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:27,330\nWell they're out of luck.\n\n1405\n01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:29,700\nIt's only backing up him, right?\n\n1406\n01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:34,090\nUSMT on the on the hand will back up\nall of the users on that computer,\n\n1407\n01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:36,310\nall the users desktops,\nall their documents,\n\n1408\n01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:40,670\nall their favorites, and\nback them up creating migration files for\n\n1409\n01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:44,100\neach one and then we can import\nall of them in the new system.\n\n1410\n01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:48,440\nSo really Windows Easy Transfer\nis designed for home users and\n\n1411\n01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:53,110\nsmall businesses that have single people,\nyou know, single users on a machine.\n\n1412\n01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:55,730\nUSMT is designed for corporate and\n\n1413\n01:10:55,730 --> 01:11:00,120\nenterprise environments that are trying\nto migrate large portions of users.\n\n1414\n01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,820\nOkay, but\nthe both work the same basic way.\n\n1415\n01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:06,470\nThey scan across the user's account,\ngather their data, store it, so\n\n1416\n01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,560\nwe can copy it over and\nbring it to another system.\n\n1417\n01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,489\nAll right well I'm stepping in for\n\n1418\n01:11:11,489 --> 01:11:16,741\nDon Pezet to run this demo on USMT,\nthe scan state load state,\n\n1419\n01:11:16,741 --> 01:11:21,691\nand Ronnie is going to be doing\nthe Windows Easy Transfer.\n\n1420\n01:11:21,691 --> 01:11:27,125\nAll right, so we're going to start off\nwith using the scan state load state with\n\n1421\n01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:32,641\nthe user state migration tool, a pretty\nfancy tool to migrate a bunch of profiles\n\n1422\n01:11:32,641 --> 01:11:38,020\nthat we can script and push out across\nall of our systems, a pretty fancy tool.\n\n1423\n01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:42,231\nAll right, so- [CROSSTALK] No, go ahead.\n\n1424\n01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:45,220\n>> The idea of user state migration\nremember is when you have multiple users\n\n1425\n01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:47,082\nthat you wanna actually,\ntheir profiles and\n\n1426\n01:11:47,082 --> 01:11:50,023\ntheir settings that you wanna be able\nto transfer over to the machines.\n\n1427\n01:11:50,023 --> 01:11:53,338\nAnd Nate's gonna show us how to actually\nto do that by using these command line\n\n1428\n01:11:53,338 --> 01:11:55,530\ntools that can be used to be scripted out.\n\n1429\n01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:56,042\nAll right, Nate.\n\n1430\n01:11:56,042 --> 01:11:57,083\n>> All right, okay.\n\n1431\n01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:58,875\nSo first things first.\n\n1432\n01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:03,510\nSo to get started, see here on\nthis machine we need to open up\n\n1433\n01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:07,700\na command prompt where our\nuser tools are going to be.\n\n1434\n01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,932\nSo instead of typing,\nI'm gonna go the easy way.\n\n1435\n01:12:10,932 --> 01:12:15,210\nI'm gonna browse into my Program Files,\nWindows AIK,\n\n1436\n01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,800\nand in Tools, and finally USMT.\n\n1437\n01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:25,580\nAnd, then whichever architects you were\nworking with, which this one is 64-bit.\n\n1438\n01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:29,950\nAnd the tool that we need is ScanState.\n\n1439\n01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:30,870\nWas it the first tool.\n\n1440\n01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:32,460\nRight?\nSo that's down there.\n\n1441\n01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,560\nSo I'm just going to copy all that stuff.\n\n1442\n01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:40,740\nAnd then open a administrative\ncommand prompt.\n\n1443\n01:12:43,097 --> 01:12:44,420\nDrag this up.\n\n1444\n01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:47,450\nAnd then I will change\ndirectory to that long path I\n\n1445\n01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:53,620\ncopied, paste.\n\n1446\n01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,260\nAll right.\n\n1447\n01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:57,990\nAnd so here, I will just run\nscanstate just straight up.\n\n1448\n01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:59,490\nAll right, now, with scanstate, and\n\n1449\n01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:04,250\nthe same with loadstate, there are a lot\nof modifiers, a lot of switches\n\n1450\n01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:09,620\nthat we can use to pull over\ncertain bits of user profiles.\n\n1451\n01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:12,080\nAnd exclude certain items.\n\n1452\n01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,480\nIt's a really powerful command.\n\n1453\n01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:19,718\nAnd I mean these commands,\nif you need to migrate users across,\n\n1454\n01:13:19,718 --> 01:13:24,450\nI mean just enterprise wide,\nthis is the tool to do it.\n\n1455\n01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:26,486\nAnd so, depending on what\nkind of environments, and\n\n1456\n01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:28,950\nwhatever it is your company is after,\nthere's a switch for it.\n\n1457\n01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,715\nThere's a switch for that.\n\n1458\n01:13:30,715 --> 01:13:32,166\nRight, Ronnie?\n\n1459\n01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:33,100\n>> Right.\n\n1460\n01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,690\nAll right, okay.\nAll right, but for our case,\n\n1461\n01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:39,730\nwe're gonna use it in\na bit more general state.\n\n1462\n01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:40,590\nAll right.\n\n1463\n01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:45,520\nSo to start this thing off,\nwe'll put it in scanstate.\n\n1464\n01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,840\nAnd then, we need to put where our\nuser profiles are going to go.\n\n1465\n01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,340\nAll right.\n\n1466\n01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:53,503\nSo, there is a share.\n\n1467\n01:13:53,503 --> 01:14:00,240\nSo, 10.1.230.223 and\na folder called Migration.\n\n1468\n01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:02,360\nAll right.\n\n1469\n01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,707\nAnd then, %username%.\n\n1470\n01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:06,195\nAll right.\n\n1471\n01:14:06,195 --> 01:14:10,875\nSo, with those percents in there, so\nthere's %username%, it's a variable.\n\n1472\n01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:15,295\nRight?\nSo whatever the user profile is called.\n\n1473\n01:14:15,295 --> 01:14:19,560\nRight?\nSo for us I'm logged in as Nathan.\n\n1474\n01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,340\nThen it's gonna put in that,\nyeah, name in there,\n\n1475\n01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:26,770\nand all those profiles\nwill be logged under that.\n\n1476\n01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:30,030\nSo, whatever username is logged in,\nthat's what it'll be.\n\n1477\n01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:32,970\nSo, pretty nice that you can have\nyou folders organized that way and\n\n1478\n01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:36,450\nnot have to go and manually name things or\nhave it name like User01,\n\n1479\n01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:38,340\nlike oh crap dude, who's User01?\n\n1480\n01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,330\nI don't know.\n\n1481\n01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:41,107\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right.\n\n1482\n01:14:41,107 --> 01:14:44,839\nSo we'll use a couple of switches,\nwe'll use the C switch, for\n\n1483\n01:14:44,839 --> 01:14:48,440\nwhich the C means Continue,\neven if you have errors.\n\n1484\n01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:53,030\nNow we'll probably will get some errors,\nbecause we're currently logged in.\n\n1485\n01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:56,110\nNow the ideally this scan state/load,\n\n1486\n01:14:56,110 --> 01:15:01,550\nstate would be run from Windows PE\nas a part of that migration process.\n\n1487\n01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:05,480\nSo certain files are open and\nbeing written to and what not.\n\n1488\n01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,349\nSo we'll probably run into some errors so\nwe'll use that.\n\n1489\n01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:10,930\nWe will also use the O switch.\n\n1490\n01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:12,510\nAnd O is for Overwrite.\n\n1491\n01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:17,720\nIf this profile exists, in the share,\nthen we'll overwrite it.\n\n1492\n01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,370\nAll right, so, it could be good.\n\n1493\n01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:19,900\n>> Right.\n\n1494\n01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:23,150\n>> If we run this command before,\nor if this is a network\n\n1495\n01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:28,090\nshare that has been out there for a while\nand we're migrating again or something.\n\n1496\n01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,450\nEither way, we will override it.\n\n1497\n01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:31,990\nAnd that's that.\n\n1498\n01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:34,165\nSo let's go ahead and run this process.\n\n1499\n01:15:34,165 --> 01:15:39,882\nAnd what it's gonna do is it will gather\nall the profiles that are on the system.\n\n1500\n01:15:39,882 --> 01:15:43,600\nAll right, and so\nit's found six different profiles.\n\n1501\n01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,890\nAnd it's gonna go and\ngrab all these profiles and\n\n1502\n01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:51,140\nstick it right there in that\n230.223 migration store.\n\n1503\n01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:52,270\n>> Yeah.\n\n1504\n01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:55,410\nNow remember that for us,\nwe didn't actually mention this yet but\n\n1505\n01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:57,160\nthere is something called the Windows AIK.\n\n1506\n01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:01,615\nThe Automated Installation Kit that\nyou can download from Microsoft here.\n\n1507\n01:16:01,615 --> 01:16:05,240\nAnd you need to download this\nspecific version for Windows 7.\n\n1508\n01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:09,820\nThat is where you'll find the USMT, and\nit needs to be version 4.0 on Windows 7.\n\n1509\n01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:13,480\nThe earlier version that you can\ndownload directly from Microsoft.\n\n1510\n01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,590\nEven though you can do that,\ntry and run it on Windows 7.\n\n1511\n01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:18,130\nYou may find out that you'll get errors.\n\n1512\n01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:21,510\nThis is the easiest way to ensure\nthat you're not gonna get errors,\n\n1513\n01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:25,310\nis to ensure that you're actually running\nthe correct version for Windows 7.\n\n1514\n01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:28,650\nSo once you download that and\nyou install the Windows AIK.\n\n1515\n01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:32,780\nThat's when you'll be able to gain access\ninto that particular folder that Nate\n\n1516\n01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:37,100\nnavigated to the run the scanstate\ncommand on this particular computer.\n\n1517\n01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:37,680\nOkay?\n\n1518\n01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,530\nSo Nate, what's the process\nthat we're actually doing now?\n\n1519\n01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:43,562\nIs that we're now doing what we're\ngathering all the user profile\n\n1520\n01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:44,501\ninformation?\n\n1521\n01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:45,110\n>> Yep, so.\n\n1522\n01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:46,441\n>> Okay.\n\n1523\n01:16:46,441 --> 01:16:49,300\n>> Yep, so on the first set it goes and\n\n1524\n01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:53,840\nit scans everything that look at what\ndata it needs to grab and pull over.\n\n1525\n01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:57,740\nAnd so\nnow after it's built those files up.\n\n1526\n01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:02,360\nNow it's copy them over to that network\nshare, and gathering all of that stuff up.\n\n1527\n01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,497\n>> Yeah.\n\n1528\n01:17:03,497 --> 01:17:07,245\nSo, now all of these profile are now being\ntransferred up to our network share.\n\n1529\n01:17:07,245 --> 01:17:08,150\nOkay.\n\n1530\n01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:10,040\nFrom there, you have two options.\n\n1531\n01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,850\nRight?\n\n1532\n01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:13,853\nWe talked about the idea of\ndoing a wipe and load migration.\n\n1533\n01:17:13,853 --> 01:17:16,850\nOkay?\nA wipe and load migration at this point,\n\n1534\n01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:19,840\nis now that we have all of\nthe user settings and files up,\n\n1535\n01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,130\nwe can now format this computer,\nreinstall Windows 7,\n\n1536\n01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:28,680\ngo ahead and install back our applications\nthat we would normally run on this.\n\n1537\n01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:32,490\nAnd then we can run the next command\nto essentially bring that information\n\n1538\n01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:33,500\nback down.\n\n1539\n01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,670\nAnd that computer will be ready for\nany user that's actually coming in.\n\n1540\n01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:37,960\nThe other one is that side by side,\n\n1541\n01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:41,050\nwhere we would actually go from\nmaybe an earlier edition of Windows.\n\n1542\n01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:45,820\nSuch as Vista or XP, and\nthen be able to come back in, and\n\n1543\n01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:50,320\nsimply pull those files back down\nonto the new Windows 7 machine.\n\n1544\n01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,972\nSo either way it's actually\ngonna be workable.\n\n1545\n01:17:51,972 --> 01:17:53,280\n>> All right.\n\n1546\n01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:58,070\nSo what we're gonna do, so\nall of our profiles have been backed up.\n\n1547\n01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:01,638\nAnd so then what we'll do is\nlet's get into Control Panel >\n\n1548\n01:18:01,638 --> 01:18:07,442\nUser Accounts > Manage Another Account.\n\n1549\n01:18:07,442 --> 01:18:10,300\nAll right, so\nhere's all of our accounts and\n\n1550\n01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,746\nI wonder why Don got a different\npicture than all of us.\n\n1551\n01:18:12,746 --> 01:18:15,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know.\n\n1552\n01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:19,810\nAll right, so what we're gonna do is we're\ngoing to delete everybody's account.\n\n1553\n01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:22,890\nWell except mine since I'm logged in.\n\n1554\n01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:24,270\nSo we'll delete Don's account.\n\n1555\n01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:25,790\nWe'll delete Mike's account.\n\n1556\n01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:28,880\nSo Ronnie, are you nervous?\n\n1557\n01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,500\n>> No.\n\n1558\n01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,710\n>> I'm deleting all your stuff.\n\n1559\n01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:32,647\n>> Yeah, go ahead and delete it.\n\n1560\n01:18:32,647 --> 01:18:34,560\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n1561\n01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,327\nwe're gonna delete Wes's account.\n\n1562\n01:18:38,509 --> 01:18:39,550\nAll right, everybody's good.\n\n1563\n01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:40,930\nSo we'll go back into User Accounts.\n\n1564\n01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:41,690\nLet's just check it.\n\n1565\n01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:43,240\nManage another account.\n\n1566\n01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:43,930\nAll right.\n\n1567\n01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:49,750\nSo now just my account remains and it has\nto, of course, cuz I'm logged in with it.\n\n1568\n01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:51,303\nAll right, so then what we'll do.\n\n1569\n01:18:51,303 --> 01:18:56,150\nAll right,\nis we will then run the loadstate command.\n\n1570\n01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:58,260\nAnd so\nwhere are we loading our stuff from?\n\n1571\n01:18:58,260 --> 01:18:59,735\nWell that network share.\n\n1572\n01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:03,260\n10.1.230.223, and it is in Migration.\n\n1573\n01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:08,220\nAll right, and then Nathan,\n\n1574\n01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:14,500\nbecause we put in that percent username,\n\n1575\n01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:19,640\nand so now it's gonna be\nchanged to the Nathan folder.\n\n1576\n01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,249\nAnd in there we are going to\nuse a couple of switches.\n\n1577\n01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:27,320\nWe'll use the C switch to continue\nin case you run into any errors.\n\n1578\n01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:30,870\nAnd then we also use the LAC command.\n\n1579\n01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:36,730\nLAC account creation, I believe the L\nis for local but the account creation.\n\n1580\n01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:41,151\nSo if the user account does\nnot exist on this machine,\n\n1581\n01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:45,193\nfrom that network share\nthat we're pulling in.\n\n1582\n01:19:45,193 --> 01:19:47,190\nGo ahead and create it.\n\n1583\n01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:47,925\nIt's kind of important to them.\n\n1584\n01:19:47,925 --> 01:19:49,490\nAll right?\nBecause chances are if\n\n1585\n01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:52,910\nyou're migrating it in,\nthis is gonna be a fresh computer.\n\n1586\n01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:55,125\nNot always, but typically.\n\n1587\n01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:59,320\nNow, those user accounts as they\nare migrated into the machine,\n\n1588\n01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,542\nthey will be disabled by default.\n\n1589\n01:20:01,542 --> 01:20:05,792\nAll right, because it doesn't migrate over\nany passwords or anything of that sort.\n\n1590\n01:20:05,792 --> 01:20:11,180\nNow I believe there's a switch to do that,\nbut in our case we didn't pull any in.\n\n1591\n01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:14,750\nSo now we need to do\nthe account enable switch.\n\n1592\n01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:19,160\nSo now if the account doesn't exist,\nLAC it will create it,\n\n1593\n01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,060\nit will be disabled by default.\n\n1594\n01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:25,902\nSo we'll use that LAE\nto enable this account.\n\n1595\n01:20:25,902 --> 01:20:32,568\nAll right, then we will run this\nswitch again as it go and guess.\n\n1596\n01:20:32,568 --> 01:20:34,624\nThat same process as before will go and\n\n1597\n01:20:34,624 --> 01:20:37,590\nwill inventory the stuff that\nis in our network share.\n\n1598\n01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:43,260\nAnd it will grab those user accounts,\nimport those guys and enable them.\n\n1599\n01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:48,500\nAnd after this guy is done,\nwe'll go back into the family safety and\n\n1600\n01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:53,820\nuser accounts and we'll see that\neverybody's account is back in there.\n\n1601\n01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:56,650\n>> Now remember, you might go, well Rod,\nI am not going to remember all this.\n\n1602\n01:20:56,650 --> 01:20:59,717\nRight?\nWell, you do have access, again,\n\n1603\n01:20:59,717 --> 01:21:04,110\nto the Internet,\nwhich is actually very helpful for us.\n\n1604\n01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:06,549\nAnd so, you actually want to take\na look at some of those commands,\n\n1605\n01:21:06,549 --> 01:21:07,870\nif I can actually type in anything.\n\n1606\n01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:17,000\nSo you may do usmt 4.0 and go ahead and\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n1607\n01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:23,060\nAnd that will give you the TechNet User's\nGuide and then you can actually see oops,\n\n1608\n01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:26,310\nI keep trying to use my touch screen\ninside the remote desktop connection.\n\n1609\n01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:27,260\nThat's not gonna work here.\n\n1610\n01:21:28,290 --> 01:21:30,380\nAnd you actually see some\nof the different links for\n\n1611\n01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:34,010\nyou that will help you to actually\ngo through some of those commands.\n\n1612\n01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:36,930\nA lot of times, for us and\nthe way that we did this,\n\n1613\n01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:39,130\nwe want to add some of those\nextra checks in there.\n\n1614\n01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:42,980\nA lot of times you can actually run\nthe simple scan state and load state and\n\n1615\n01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:45,420\nthat will actually gather your\nparticular individual profile.\n\n1616\n01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:47,870\nAnd they'd actually went a little\nbit further than that to try and\n\n1617\n01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:49,960\ndemonstrate that there's\nsome of the other options.\n\n1618\n01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,430\nSo take a look at that when you actually\ndo and we'll try and include some links in\n\n1619\n01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:58,180\nhere to both Scan State and Load State to\nhelp you out as well in our show notes.\n\n1620\n01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:03,770\n>> Now over here the process\nis just about finished, so\n\n1621\n01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:07,120\nin the first little slot it's\nexamining the system, so\n\n1622\n01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:11,540\nit's discovering the stuff on\nwhat it needs to pull over.\n\n1623\n01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:14,570\nAnd then in the second block,\nright, is now applying that data.\n\n1624\n01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:17,860\nIt's copying it over and\ncreating those user accounts.\n\n1625\n01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:23,770\nAnd in 1%, yeah,\nwhich it's kind of stalled there on 1%.\n\n1626\n01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:29,920\nBut once it's done, we'll browse into\nthat intro bound and all right sweet.\n\n1627\n01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:34,170\nThere we go, success that is always nice.\n\n1628\n01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:39,980\nSo we'll go into our start, control panel,\nuser accounts, family safety,\n\n1629\n01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:43,988\nuser accounts, and\nwe'll go into manage another account.\n\n1630\n01:22:43,988 --> 01:22:48,970\nAnd voila, and Don got his little picture\nback, I wonder why it's different.\n\n1631\n01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:51,840\nWe'll have to quiz them on that.\n\n1632\n01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,880\n>> Yeah.\n>> Anyhow, so there we go.\n\n1633\n01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,950\nSo now we can backup all of our user\naccounts, or we can script this guy.\n\n1634\n01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:00,930\nWe're gonna wipe out our machine.\n\n1635\n01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:03,060\nReinstall Windows, right?\n\n1636\n01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:07,600\nAnd run that command again, and\npull all of our accounts over.\n\n1637\n01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,043\n>> So this is a really great tool,\n\n1638\n01:23:09,043 --> 01:23:11,770\nagain if you do have a ton of\nusers that you're migrating.\n\n1639\n01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:14,856\nSo normally you're going to see this more\ninside of a business network than you're\n\n1640\n01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:16,276\ngonna see inside of the home network.\n\n1641\n01:23:16,276 --> 01:23:18,610\nNow, what if you're\nactually at home though?\n\n1642\n01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:24,770\nWhat if you are on a older\nversion of Windows for us.\n\n1643\n01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:30,440\nFor example let me see if I can bring up\nhere an older version of Windows as well.\n\n1644\n01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,530\nThis is my homage to Don.\n\n1645\n01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:34,080\nHe loves the Thundercats.\n\n1646\n01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,060\nSo there it is.\n\n1647\n01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:40,230\nHere is his particular machine and\nhe is ready to go up to Windows 7.\n\n1648\n01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:43,320\nHe is ready to migrate\nto Windows 7 here but\n\n1649\n01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,470\nhe doesn't actually need\nthe ID of the USMT.\n\n1650\n01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:47,710\nDon't get me wrong,\nhe can do it if he wants to.\n\n1651\n01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:50,880\nBut, at this point,\nwhat's built into Windows 7,\n\n1652\n01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,840\nlet me go ahead and change machines here.\n\n1653\n01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,820\nWhat's built into Windows 7 for\n\n1654\n01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:58,151\nus is actually a tool called\nthe Windows Easy Transfer.\n\n1655\n01:23:58,151 --> 01:24:01,324\nAnd the easiest way I know how to actually\nget access to it is to simply go to\n\n1656\n01:24:01,324 --> 01:24:03,930\nStart menu and\nthen to search programs and files.\n\n1657\n01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:05,880\nOops, well maybe.\n\n1658\n01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:10,090\nType in the word Easy, and\nright at the top of the list,\n\n1659\n01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:13,720\nyou actually see right there,\nwhere it says Windows Easy Transfer.\n\n1660\n01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:17,910\nNow this essentially is really\nusing the same commands.\n\n1661\n01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:18,680\nOkay.\n\n1662\n01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:23,920\nBut is actually done in a GUI format, in\na G-U-I format, graphical user interface.\n\n1663\n01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,980\nSo instead, the user doesn't have to\nhave all the technical skills and\n\n1664\n01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:31,910\nknowledge to do this and can do it\nrelatively quickly here instead, right.\n\n1665\n01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:33,780\nSo in this it's doing the same things.\n\n1666\n01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:35,290\nYou can see where it\nsays let's you copy and\n\n1667\n01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:40,470\ntransfer files from one particular\ncomputer to another one here.\n\n1668\n01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:43,630\nIf you are actually migrating\nwhat you want to do, though,\n\n1669\n01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:47,651\nis that if you're using the Windows Easy\nTransfer is you wanna make sure that\n\n1670\n01:24:47,651 --> 01:24:53,130\nyou're running the Easy Transfer\nfrom the new computer.\n\n1671\n01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:56,600\nSo, in Windows XP,\nthis type of thing existed, but\n\n1672\n01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:00,440\nit was called the Files and\nSettings Transfer Wizard, okay?\n\n1673\n01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,050\nWe used to call it FAST.\n\n1674\n01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:06,938\nBut in that one, you can actually use that\nto transfer files from XP to XP, but you\n\n1675\n01:25:06,938 --> 01:25:12,010\ndon't want to actually do this if you're\nactually going from XP to Windows 7.\n\n1676\n01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:13,080\nSo, what we want to do is,\n\n1677\n01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:16,960\nwe want to run this tool on our\ndestination computer here, okay?\n\n1678\n01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:21,210\nAnd then from there, when we run it,\nif we go through, click Next.\n\n1679\n01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:24,140\nNow it actually gives me the options\non how I want to transfer\n\n1680\n01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:25,520\nthe actually files here.\n\n1681\n01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,780\nThere is something out there called\nthe Windows easy transfer cable.\n\n1682\n01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:31,740\nA bit expensive, but\nyou can actually buy one if you want to.\n\n1683\n01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:32,710\n>> You know what, Ronnie.\n\n1684\n01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:34,000\nSorry, I don't mean to interrupt.\n\n1685\n01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,830\nSo on my machine, right,\nI pulled up from the Microsoft store\n\n1686\n01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:43,220\nThe Easy Transfer Cable for Windows 8.\n\n1687\n01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:46,070\nIt's a USB cable and\n\n1688\n01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:51,660\nsure enough you can just plug it in\nPC to PC with this fancy USB cable.\n\n1689\n01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:53,690\nIt's on sale right now.\n\n1690\n01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,390\nIt was $30 bucks.\n\n1691\n01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:58,860\nYou can save $10 and\nyou can now only get it for $20.\n\n1692\n01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:00,050\n>> That's right.\n\n1693\n01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:04,360\n>> With a one star, from one user review.\n\n1694\n01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,150\nThat's really all it is, just a USB cable.\n\n1695\n01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:12,100\n>> Yeah, that's a USB cable,\nthat's such a USB crossover cable,\n\n1696\n01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,840\nis what it's actually doing for us here.\n\n1697\n01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,840\nSo that easy transfer cable, will actually\nwork for you, if you want to do that.\n\n1698\n01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,650\nOf course if you have\naccess to a network share,\n\n1699\n01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:25,190\nagain another location that you can store\nthis to a cross-network you can do that.\n\n1700\n01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:30,280\nBut what if I just had a USB thumb\ndrive or a portable hard drive?\n\n1701\n01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,135\nWell I could use that as well.\n\n1702\n01:26:32,135 --> 01:26:36,936\nSo, we're just gonna select this external\nhard drive or USB flash drive here, and\n\n1703\n01:26:36,936 --> 01:26:38,525\nwe're gonna create this.\n\n1704\n01:26:38,525 --> 01:26:41,655\nNotice this is asking me,\nwhich computer am I using right now?\n\n1705\n01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:46,500\nWell, this is gonna my new computer and\nnow has Windows Easy Transfer already\n\n1706\n01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:50,680\nsaved your files from your old computer\nto an external drive or USB drive?\n\n1707\n01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,980\nWell, I have to admit, it hasn't.\n\n1708\n01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:55,570\nSo I'm gonna click No at this point,\nor maybe.\n\n1709\n01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:56,340\nOkay?\n\n1710\n01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:58,212\nNow it's gonna ask me, well,\n\n1711\n01:26:58,212 --> 01:27:02,980\nhow am I gonna get the Windows Easy\nTransfer over onto my old computer?\n\n1712\n01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:07,750\nWell what I want is, I'm gonna actually go\nahead and select I need to install it now.\n\n1713\n01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:12,990\nSo I'm gonna select that and it's gonna\nask me, where do I want to save this?\n\n1714\n01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:15,320\nWell I could save it to\na USB thumb drive and\n\n1715\n01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,394\nthat would actually work perfectly for us.\n\n1716\n01:27:17,394 --> 01:27:20,420\nBut I'm gonna select this one because I've\nalready created a network shared folder\n\n1717\n01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:21,170\nfor us to save it to.\n\n1718\n01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:23,907\nI'm going to select here and\nnow it's gonna say, hey,\n\n1719\n01:27:23,907 --> 01:27:25,840\nwhere in the world do I wanna save it to?\n\n1720\n01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,663\nIf I click My Computer and\n\n1721\n01:27:28,663 --> 01:27:31,740\nI'm gonna select the Application Share\nif it'll let me.\n\n1722\n01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:35,685\nOh, of course,\nwhy can't it be installed there?\n\n1723\n01:27:35,685 --> 01:27:39,907\n[LAUGH] All right, yeah, so\n\n1724\n01:27:39,907 --> 01:27:44,318\nwe'll go ahead and save it.\n\n1725\n01:27:44,318 --> 01:27:46,290\nI don't know why it can't\nbe installed there.\n\n1726\n01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:47,060\nIt should be.\nLet's see now.\n\n1727\n01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:49,861\nIt actually is showing up now.\n\n1728\n01:27:49,861 --> 01:27:50,650\nThere it goes.\n\n1729\n01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:52,040\n>> These crazy computers.\n\n1730\n01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:52,901\n>> Yeah, it just took a moment.\n\n1731\n01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:55,720\nI was like,\nwhen did it show up as a red X?\n\n1732\n01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,780\nSo, now it's actually copying over\nto that particular network share.\n\n1733\n01:27:58,780 --> 01:27:59,280\nOkay?\n\n1734\n01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:03,802\nAll right, so\n\n1735\n01:28:03,802 --> 01:28:07,480\nnow I'm going to leave this up because\nit tells me exactly what to do, right?\n\n1736\n01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,790\nSo I can open the folder\nwhere it saved it to.\n\n1737\n01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:12,833\nAnd, so now,\nif I go back over to my old computer,\n\n1738\n01:28:12,833 --> 01:28:15,930\nto Don's old computer, let's do this.\n\n1739\n01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:17,040\nDon is now logged in.\n\n1740\n01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:21,200\nNow I do have to be logged in as\nthe administrator to run this, right?\n\n1741\n01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:24,240\nSo when I do the easy transfer,\nI need to do that on the other machine.\n\n1742\n01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,470\nAnd, on this one,\nDon is actually the administrator here.\n\n1743\n01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:30,560\nIf I click on Start, and I go to Computer.\n\n1744\n01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:34,898\nAnd on the shared folder here.\n\n1745\n01:28:34,898 --> 01:28:35,815\nOh, did I not save?\n\n1746\n01:28:35,815 --> 01:28:37,812\nI didn't save it in the same location,\ndid I?\n\n1747\n01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:40,412\nI have to browse that location now.\n\n1748\n01:28:40,412 --> 01:28:48,794\nThat's vmhost\\applicationshare.\n\n1749\n01:28:48,794 --> 01:28:51,616\nSee if it gives me the ability\nto get access in there.\n\n1750\n01:28:57,212 --> 01:29:00,717\nAll right, so this time it of\ncourse is balking at me again.\n\n1751\n01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:06,858\nOh, I know what I can do.\n\n1752\n01:29:10,690 --> 01:29:16,455\nI created another shared folder, let me\nsave that again to another location here.\n\n1753\n01:29:16,455 --> 01:29:20,845\nInstead, let me just\nre-save this to another\n\n1754\n01:29:20,845 --> 01:29:25,470\nlocation that I created\nto make it easier for us.\n\n1755\n01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:34,931\nI just have to remember\nwhere I save things.\n\n1756\n01:29:34,931 --> 01:29:37,050\nAnd my new computer.\n\n1757\n01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:39,103\nNo.\nI need to install it now.\n\n1758\n01:29:46,148 --> 01:29:49,690\nI created a shared folder so the XP\nmachine could actually see this one.\n\n1759\n01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:52,359\nSo I just saved it in the wrong location.\n\n1760\n01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:59,957\nSo now if I go back to the XP machine, I\ncan see it here on this shared folder now,\n\n1761\n01:29:59,957 --> 01:30:02,650\nthere we go, so\nthat's the one that we need.\n\n1762\n01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:06,400\nSo from this shared folder, Okay.\n\n1763\n01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,770\nI just saved it in\nthe wrong location earlier.\n\n1764\n01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:14,962\nI can just select the Windows Easy\nTransfer and now it begins to run.\n\n1765\n01:30:14,962 --> 01:30:18,304\nSo notice it actually looks\nessentially the same.\n\n1766\n01:30:18,304 --> 01:30:21,941\nAnd I can go ahead and\nclick Next and now it says hey,\n\n1767\n01:30:21,941 --> 01:30:25,930\nWhat items do you want to use\nto transfer your computer?\n\n1768\n01:30:25,930 --> 01:30:29,540\nLet's go ahead and save the external\nhard disk or flash drive, and\n\n1769\n01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:31,050\nthis is the old computer.\n\n1770\n01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:35,610\nAnd now it's beginning to scan for\nDon's particular profile.\n\n1771\n01:30:35,610 --> 01:30:38,990\nNow here in this profile we not only\nhave the desktop background, but\n\n1772\n01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:42,780\nthere are some documents inside\nthe My Documents folder as well, so\n\n1773\n01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:45,830\nthis should all transfer over to the\nWindows 7 computer when we get it ready.\n\n1774\n01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:51,600\nSo, it's gonna actually transfer, not only\nDon's this idea of the shared items, here.\n\n1775\n01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,760\nAnd then in a moment,\nwe'll see how big this actually turns out.\n\n1776\n01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,570\nIt shouldn't be too big.\n\n1777\n01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:58,610\nBut remember that this is the situation\nthat we would use if we only have just\n\n1778\n01:30:58,610 --> 01:31:04,780\na few, or maybe just one or\ntwo computers that we're taking here.\n\n1779\n01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:08,940\nSo it looks like it went ahead and\nsaved everything in about three and\n\n1780\n01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:12,700\na half megabytes,\nit is the actual overall profile, so\n\n1781\n01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:16,230\nit's not gigantic, so\nI'm gonna click Next.\n\n1782\n01:31:16,230 --> 01:31:17,560\n>> Okay, pretty small profile.\n\n1783\n01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,060\n>> Yep.\n\n1784\n01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:23,010\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\nadd in a password.\n\n1785\n01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:26,530\nIf I'm saving this across the network\nshare we don't want anybody getting access\n\n1786\n01:31:26,530 --> 01:31:28,210\nto our own files here.\n\n1787\n01:31:28,210 --> 01:31:30,180\nSo putting on a password\nis pretty important.\n\n1788\n01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:32,330\nOops.\n\n1789\n01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:34,802\nIf I can type in the right password,\nhow's that.\n\n1790\n01:31:40,967 --> 01:31:43,960\nAnd now, again,\nI'm gonna save it to that T drive.\n\n1791\n01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:47,430\nThat is actually a file share\nover on the Windows 7 computer.\n\n1792\n01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:50,270\nAnd just gonna name it here.\n\n1793\n01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:51,360\nI'm just gonna go ahead and rename it.\n\n1794\n01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,865\nI'm gonna call it DonProfile.\n\n1795\n01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,100\nAnd save it there.\n\n1796\n01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:01,340\nAnd now it's going to begin the idea\nof transferring that picker file over\n\n1797\n01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:02,990\ninto that share.\n\n1798\n01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:05,120\nNow it says they've been saved for\nour transfer.\n\n1799\n01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,580\nAnd there we go.\n\n1800\n01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:09,510\nAll right?\n\n1801\n01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:16,060\nNow on this machine, if this machine\nagain, was me doing the idea of a wipe and\n\n1802\n01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:19,920\nload, in other words, not a brand new\ncomputer, I would reinstall Windows 7,\n\n1803\n01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,680\nreinstall my applications, and do the same\nthing that we were talking about before.\n\n1804\n01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,520\nAll right.\n\n1805\n01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,990\nNow, if it's a brand new computer,\nhere it is.\n\n1806\n01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:30,695\nSo at this point I can just click Next,\n\n1807\n01:32:30,695 --> 01:32:35,440\nhas Windows Easy Transfer already saved\nyour files from your old computer?\n\n1808\n01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:41,975\nI can say Yes, and then,\nI simply search into that folder,\n\n1809\n01:32:41,975 --> 01:32:47,489\nand there's the Don profile,\nI can select Open,\n\n1810\n01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:57,120\nand click Next here, and\nlet the actual transfer continue to go on.\n\n1811\n01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:57,890\nOkay.\n\n1812\n01:32:57,890 --> 01:33:00,960\nFrom this point it shows\nme his picker profile.\n\n1813\n01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:04,570\nIf I wanted to exclude some I could\nclick on these customize here and\n\n1814\n01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:06,300\nexclude some of these\nitems if I wanted to.\n\n1815\n01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:09,520\nBut we're simply going to\nbring everything over.\n\n1816\n01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,727\nAnd click Transfer.\n\n1817\n01:33:13,142 --> 01:33:13,642\nAll right?\n\n1818\n01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:17,620\n>> So you know what, Ronnie?\n\n1819\n01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:19,870\nIt's kind of interesting.\n\n1820\n01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:22,580\nSo that profile that it saved,\nthat little icon on there, and\n\n1821\n01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:25,740\nit was a .mig that it saved.\n\n1822\n01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:26,610\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n1823\n01:33:26,610 --> 01:33:32,740\nThe same kind of process with the USMT.\n\n1824\n01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:36,670\nOn this machine, let's go over here.\n\n1825\n01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:41,285\nSo in that migration folder that we had\nmapped on there, in the migration, so\n\n1826\n01:33:41,285 --> 01:33:42,810\nwe saved it %username.\n\n1827\n01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:44,120\nSo it was Nathan.\n\n1828\n01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:48,420\nIf we browse in there and\ninto this USMT folder.\n\n1829\n01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:51,560\nSure enough, look what it says there.\n\n1830\n01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:53,210\nAn easy transfer file.\n\n1831\n01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:56,260\n>> That's it.\n>> So in the back end, it's a USMT,\n\n1832\n01:33:56,260 --> 01:34:01,390\nit created a .mig,\nright, a migration file.\n\n1833\n01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:04,502\nAnd if I double click on this\nis it gonna launch, yeah.\n\n1834\n01:34:04,502 --> 01:34:05,576\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is.\n\n1835\n01:34:05,576 --> 01:34:10,147\n>> So essentially I just double\nclicked on it, and sure enough, so\n\n1836\n01:34:10,147 --> 01:34:15,750\nit's launching Windows Easy Transfer so,\nkind of a neat way, USMT, right?\n\n1837\n01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:20,190\nScriptable to push out the,\nha, look at that, 63 or\n\n1838\n01:34:20,190 --> 01:34:25,060\n61 megs in mine yep, so sure enough.\n\n1839\n01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:28,670\nAll right, so, Easy Transfer USMT,\nsame on the back-end.\n\n1840\n01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:29,580\n>> Yeah, cool.\n\n1841\n01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:32,070\nNow the only thing that's really\nleft in terms of Easy Transfer is,\n\n1842\n01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:34,140\nnow that it's done on my computer here,\n\n1843\n01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:37,170\nyou can actually see that\nthe background has already changed.\n\n1844\n01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:39,050\nBut notice it's telling me I\nneed to restart the computer to\n\n1845\n01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:39,730\ncomplete everything.\n\n1846\n01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:41,750\nI'm just gonna restart it later.\n\n1847\n01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:45,790\nNow at this point here,\nif I got into Documents,\n\n1848\n01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:49,010\nI can see the stuff that transferred\nover from Don's computer as well.\n\n1849\n01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:52,795\nNow, you may be going, well, why is it\nnamed Ronnie instead of Don here, well,\n\n1850\n01:34:52,795 --> 01:34:56,694\nhe was actually the original administrator\naccount that I just renamed as Don, and\n\n1851\n01:34:56,694 --> 01:35:00,259\nthis one was the same way, mine was\nthe original administrator account, so\n\n1852\n01:35:00,259 --> 01:35:02,570\nit pulled the files right in for\nus is what it did.\n\n1853\n01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:06,849\nSo when we have this again it's gonna\nreboot and do everything else and\n\n1854\n01:35:06,849 --> 01:35:09,395\nDon should be ready to transfer right in.\n\n1855\n01:35:09,395 --> 01:35:10,637\nOkay?\n\n1856\n01:35:10,637 --> 01:35:11,532\nAll right.\n\n1857\n01:35:11,532 --> 01:35:14,671\nSo are our two particular\nconcepts that we wanted to\n\n1858\n01:35:14,671 --> 01:35:18,248\nactually make sure that we could\ndo as we are installing and\n\n1859\n01:35:18,248 --> 01:35:22,350\nalso migrating in from another\noperating system into Windows 7.\n\n1860\n01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:27,150\nSo make sure you're familiar with both\nthe Windows Easy Transfer as well as Using\n\n1861\n01:35:27,150 --> 01:35:31,820\nthe USMT here and those two particular\ncommands, ScanState and LoadState.\n\n1862\n01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:33,240\n>> All right, Ronnie,\nI think that about wraps it up.\n\n1863\n01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:34,570\nDo you have anything else to throw in?\n\n1864\n01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:35,140\n>> I do not.\n\n1865\n01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:39,720\nAgain, just keep in mind\nsome of the details here.\n\n1866\n01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:43,100\nIn configuring, they expect you again to\nactually just know how everything kind of\n\n1867\n01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:45,280\nfits together and what is required of you,\n\n1868\n01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,460\nand the installation is not the most\ndifficult part of our exam,\n\n1869\n01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:50,389\nbut it is actually worth a pretty good\npercentage so make sure you pay attention.\n\n1870\n01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:55,567\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen, let\nme just remind you guys if you ever have\n\n1871\n01:35:55,567 --> 01:35:59,489\nany questions on this stuff live during\nthe show, you can go to itpro.tv/live

right good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:38,463\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:41,871\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\ntoday with Mr. Nate Copeland.\n\n7\n00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:42,550\nHow's it going, Nate?\n\n8\n00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,390\n>> Pretty good, Don.\n\n9\n00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,120\nPretty good today.\n\n10\n00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,650\n>> I had to put on my somber voice.\n\n11\n00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,250\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:46,950\nI noticed that.\n\n13\n00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,400\nI was wondering what kind of lead\nup that was gonna be for, but\n\n14\n00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,755\nI guess we'll soon find out.\n\n15\n00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:54,910\n>> [LAUGH]\nAll right, well,\n\n16\n00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,080\nwe got a fun episode ahead of us.\n\n17\n00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,010\nWe've got more Windows 7 action.\n\n18\n00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,140\nWe launched our Windows 7 show.\n\n19\n00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,780\nAnd in our first episode we got\na chance to see how to install Windows\n\n20\n00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,840\n7 as far as just like a single machine\ndeployment and in a few other things.\n\n21\n00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,360\nAnd we mentioned in there hey, everything\nwe're doing in this episode is great\n\n22\n00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,670\nif you just got a handful\nof machines to work on.\n\n23\n00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,450\nBut what if you've got hundreds, or even\nthousands of Windows 7 machines to deploy?\n\n24\n00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,590\nWell, the stuff we talked about in the\nlast episode just doesn't scale very well.\n\n25\n00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,550\nIt's too much work.\n\n26\n00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,511\n>> Unless you have a limitless\nsupply of underpaid labor which,\n\n27\n00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:30,190\nat ITProTV we do, but you guys might not.\n\n28\n00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,030\n[LAUGH] So\n\n29\n00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,210\nwe're gonna take a look at some stuff\ntoday that helps with mass deployments.\n\n30\n00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,260\nDeploying Windows 7 on huge amounts\nof machines and to do it very simply.\n\n31\n00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,240\nMicrosoft has a few little goals like LTE.\n\n32\n00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,450\nWhat is it, LTI and ZTI?\n\n33\n00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,410\nDo we cover those in this episode?\n\n34\n00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,410\n>> Yes.\n\n35\n00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,520\nSort of.\n\n36\n00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,086\nWe mentioned the concept of it.\n\n37\n00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:56,380\nWe won't jump into z tear or anything.\n\n38\n00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,160\n>> Okay.\n>> But yeah.\n\n39\n00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,590\nWe mention it.\n\n40\n00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,120\n>> So just so you're not on the edge\nof your seat with anticipation.\n\n41\n00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,080\nLTI is a light touch install and that's\nnormally what a lot of us do is where\n\n42\n00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,510\nthe install really just requires some\nlimited interaction with a human being to\n\n43\n00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,300\nactually do the install, light touch,\nyou just hit a few keys and that's it.\n\n44\n00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,500\nA ZTI is a zero touch install.\n\n45\n00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,890\nAnd the stuff we're gonna show you\ntoday will not allow for that.\n\n46\n00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,770\nThat's where things like system\ncenter configuration manager,\n\n47\n00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,020\nthe really high end Microsoft\ndeployment products,\n\n48\n00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,720\nthe expensive Microsoft\ndeployment products come in.\n\n49\n00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,100\nThey can do a zero touch installation\nwhere you get a new machine and\n\n50\n00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,160\nyou plug it into the network and\nit automatically formats it,\n\n51\n00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,001\ninstalls Windows 7, gets it set up,\njoins [INAUDIBLE] domain.\n\n52\n00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:42,370\nDoes the whole shebang.\n\n53\n00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,650\nWithout you having to do anything\nother than press a power button.\n\n54\n00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,060\nYou can't get away from that, right?\n\n55\n00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,350\nGotta press the power button.\n\n56\n00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,550\nSo but on the LTI, the light touch side,\nwe're gonna see how to do that with\n\n57\n00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,760\ntools that are readily and\nfreely available from Microsoft.\n\n58\n00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,211\nIn fact I think this whole episode,\nthis is a $0 episode.\n\n59\n00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:03,170\nWe don't have to buy any extra software\nto do what we showed today, right?\n\n60\n00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,280\n>> Correct, yep.\n\n61\n00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,980\nEverything, all the tools,\neverything that we'll be using today,\n\n62\n00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,710\nall free downloads from Microsoft\nwith the Automatic Installation Kit.\n\n63\n00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,729\nThat's going to be the focus of\nthe tools that we'll be using today.\n\n64\n00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,450\n>> All right.\nSo, just a quick skim over the objectives.\n\n65\n00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,590\nLet me pull up this,\nit's objective two, deploying Windows.\n\n66\n00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,130\nWe're gonna take a look at some things and\nwe're gonna do it in a slightly\n\n67\n00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,800\ndifferent order than the way\nthe objectives are listed.\n\n68\n00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,340\nBecause they're listed just,\nhere's stuff Microsoft wants you to know.\n\n69\n00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,481\nBut they're not like in chronological\norder of how you would actually do this\n\n70\n00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:37,020\noperation.\n\n71\n00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,730\nSo we're gonna rearrange it by time.\n\n72\n00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,440\nSo we're gonna talk about how to\ntake a computer and get it set up\n\n73\n00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,095\nthe way that we want and then create\nan image basically clone that machine.\n\n74\n00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:49,445\nIt's called capturing that system image.\n\n75\n00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:52,355\nFrom there,\nwe'll see how to deploy that out,\n\n76\n00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:55,005\nhow to push that out to our other systems.\n\n77\n00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:58,395\nBut there's some things that we might\nwant to do beforehand, some tweaks,\n\n78\n00:03:58,395 --> 00:03:59,355\nsome modifications.\n\n79\n00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:01,365\nAnd so we'll see that process also.\n\n80\n00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:04,795\nSo that's all involved in the imaging and\ndeployment and\n\n81\n00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:06,530\nwhat we would use on a daily basis.\n\n82\n00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,670\nAnd then we're gonna wrap up with just\na little bit extra here configuring VHD's,\n\n83\n00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,930\nwhich are virtual hard drives, and that's\nsomething that's new and exciting in\n\n84\n00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,490\nWindows 7 and kind of a fun feature that I\nknow a lot of us here in the office use.\n\n85\n00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,586\nSo, we'll take a look at those also.\n\n86\n00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:21,420\n>> Yeah.\n\n87\n00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,277\nAnd with that VHD stuff, Windows 7,\naretty sweet little thing it can do,\n\n88\n00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:28,780\nand it's called a native boot.\n\n89\n00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,940\nAnd you can take a VHD file,\nright, and when you look at it,\n\n90\n00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,210\nit's just a file, right?\n\n91\n00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,890\nBut to Windows,\nit looks like an entire hard drive,\n\n92\n00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,180\neverything inside,\nyou install Windows to it.\n\n93\n00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,430\nAnd then Windows can boot off of that VHD.\n\n94\n00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,770\nYou don't have to have a pre-existing\noperating system installed.\n\n95\n00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,211\nSo that's native boot.\n\n96\n00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:50,198\nYou can just throw that VHD on\nthrough a bare metal computer and\n\n97\n00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:51,760\njust boot straight up off that.\n\n98\n00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,560\nAnd to the user using it, it doesn't look\nany different than a typical DVD install.\n\n99\n00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,305\n>> Yep.\nYep, it's very cool.\n\n100\n00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:00,580\nSo some neat stuff there.\n\n101\n00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,420\nSo we're gonna take a look at all of that,\nbut\n\n102\n00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,380\nto start with let's just go to the very\nbeginning and talk about system images.\n\n103\n00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,320\nAll right?\n\n104\n00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,100\nIf you have to deploy,\nlet's just say, a thousand, right?\n\n105\n00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,128\nThat's gonna be my number of the day.\n\n106\n00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:14,550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We need to deploy 1000\n\n107\n00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,500\nWindows 7 machines.\n\n108\n00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,550\nWe just bought a new batch of laptops for\nour company so I've got\n\n109\n00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,230\na thousand Windows laptops and I need to\nget them imaged and ready for my company.\n\n110\n00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,500\nNow, what do I mean by imaged?\n\n111\n00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,640\nWell, I mean that I\nneed Windows installed.\n\n112\n00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,980\nI need them joined to my domain.\n\n113\n00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,540\nMaybe I need a certain set of applications\ninstalled on them, Microsoft Office, or\n\n114\n00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,780\nwhatever my line of\nbusiness application is.\n\n115\n00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,980\nThird party software.\n\n116\n00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,240\nIt could be Adobe Acrobat,\n\n117\n00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,800\nwhatever it is that we need installed,\nwe want it on those machines.\n\n118\n00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,090\nWe want it on all 1000 of them.\n\n119\n00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,770\nWell, I don't wanna pay\nsomebody to turn on each and\n\n120\n00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,440\nevery machine, install Windows, install\nthe applications, join it to the domain.\n\n121\n00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,310\nThat's a lot manual labor, so\nif we can shorten that, all the better.\n\n122\n00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,999\nSo the idea of cloning a system\nis you take one computer,\n\n123\n00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:05,628\nyou get it set up exactly the way that\nyou want it with all the software,\n\n124\n00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:10,808\nall the configuration exactly how you\nwant it, and then you clone it, you take\n\n125\n00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:15,796\na snapshot of it, you take a picture\nof how that hard drive looks right now.\n\n126\n00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:20,055\nAnd then you copy that and deploy it\nto all of the other hard drives for\n\n127\n00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:22,140\nall of the other machines.\n\n128\n00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,610\nSo now when they turn on,\nthey've got the same operating system,\n\n129\n00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,090\nthey've got the same applications,\nthey've got the same configuration.\n\n130\n00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,370\nThe only problem is they also have\nthe same name, they have the same security\n\n131\n00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,770\nidentifier, they have a lot of things\nthat are the same that can't be the same.\n\n132\n00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,940\nYou can't have two computers\nwith the same name.\n\n133\n00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,950\nYou can't have two computers with\nthe same security identifier.\n\n134\n00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,500\nIt breaks things.\n\n135\n00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,800\nSo if you just try and\nclone the machines like a mirror image,\n\n136\n00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,658\nyou're going to have one big\nfat broken network, right.\n\n137\n00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:57,210\nSo we've gotta do some extra stuff\nto have the systems ready and\n\n138\n00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,430\nMicrosoft has us covered.\n\n139\n00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,125\nThey have a suite of tools\nthat take care of this, and\n\n140\n00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,795\nthat's what you're gonna show off,\nright Nate?\n\n141\n00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:02,421\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n142\n00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,220\nYeah so just that, right?\n\n143\n00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,045\nSo we've got a computer, a PC here.\n\n144\n00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:10,380\nAnd it's all set up with all\nof our stuff onto there.\n\n145\n00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,780\nAnd we want to roll this guy\nout to all of our machines.\n\n146\n00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,040\nWell, we need to strip out\nthat unique information.\n\n147\n00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,890\nSo the secure identifiers and\nthe stuff that Don mentioned.\n\n148\n00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,810\n>> Computer name.\n\n149\n00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,248\n>> The name and all that stuff.\n\n150\n00:07:22,248 --> 00:07:23,930\nSo we're gonna strip it out and\n\n151\n00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,230\nto generalize this installation\nof that copy of Windows.\n\n152\n00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,430\nMake it so there's no unique information\nin there at all and then we'll take\n\n153\n00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,380\nthat snapshot of it and so\nthat right there we can then push out.\n\n154\n00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,340\nSo are we just gonna start the process\nthen and just get cracking?\n\n155\n00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,470\n>> Well let's talk a little bit about the\ntwo main tools that we're gonna use here\n\n156\n00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,540\nin the beginning.\n\n157\n00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,470\nSo Nate's gonna show\nus how all this works.\n\n158\n00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,090\nAnd there's two tools he's\nreally gonna make use of.\n\n159\n00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,290\nThe first tool is called sysprep okay?\n\n160\n00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,280\nWhich is just short for\nsystem preparation.\n\n161\n00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,840\nIt's a tool that Microsoft has supported\nfor years and years and years.\n\n162\n00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,875\nAnd what it does is exactly\nwhat Nate mentioned.\n\n163\n00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,208\nIt generalizes your system.\n\n164\n00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,310\nIt strips out that unique data.\n\n165\n00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,233\nSo he's going to use that tool\nto uniqueify a machine, right.\n\n166\n00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't think that's a word.\n\n167\n00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,292\nBut to make that machine,\ni guess, de uniq-\n\n168\n00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:16,000\n>> deuniquify [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,570\n>> See, I screwed up my fake word.\n\n170\n00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,130\nWe need to make it not unique anymore.\n\n171\n00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,860\nWe need that to take away\nthe unique information, all right?\n\n172\n00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,830\nThen he's gonna use a second\ntool which is called ImageX and\n\n173\n00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,660\nhe's gonna use ImageX to take\nthe snapshot, to, clone that system.\n\n174\n00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,640\nSo those are our first couple of steps.\n\n175\n00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,990\nNow, Microsoft makes both of these tools\navailable to us, free of charge, but\n\n176\n00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,820\nthey're not quite usable in the format\nthey give them to you cause\n\n177\n00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,020\nthat would be too easy.\n\n178\n00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,690\nSo, there are a few hoops we\nhave to jump through first.\n\n179\n00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,280\nAnd Nate, that's where you come in.\n\n180\n00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,906\nYou're our professional hoop jumper.\n\n181\n00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:48,835\n>> [CROSSTALK] All right.\n\n182\n00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:49,360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll see.\n\n183\n00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,930\nWell, good deal.\n\n184\n00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,210\nFirst thing's first.\n\n185\n00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:57,060\nI've got this virtual machine here.\n\n186\n00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,800\nIt's a pretty stripped down\nedition of Windows here.\n\n187\n00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,650\nSo we'll say that it's been prepped\nwith all of our company's software,\n\n188\n00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,470\nall of our line of business apps,\nand things all the settings and\n\n189\n00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,892\nwhatever that we want is\nset up on to this machine.\n\n190\n00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,880\nAfter, we Sysprep it.\n\n191\n00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,090\nSo a little command will run\nit will generalize everything.\n\n192\n00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,840\nIt will strip out all\nthe unique information.\n\n193\n00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,980\nAnd then after that we'll have to reboot\nthis machine into Windows PE, right?\n\n194\n00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,540\nOr the pre execution environment.\n\n195\n00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,340\nTo where we can then use that tool,\nImageX,\n\n196\n00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,080\nto then take an image of that PC,\nall right.\n\n197\n00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,860\nSo the first things before we Sysprep it,\nwe have to get that Windows PE disk.\n\n198\n00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,710\nNow there is a tool in here that\nwe can use to make that image.\n\n199\n00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,400\nAll right.\n\n200\n00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,220\nSo the first thing's first.\n\n201\n00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,310\nAll right, we'll click on here.\n\n202\n00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,230\nNow I already installed\nthe Windows AIK beforehand.\n\n203\n00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,450\nIt is a free download from Microsoft.\n\n204\n00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,130\n>> You know, and I'm gonna grab\nthe download link for that, so\n\n205\n00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,500\nwe can post it along with the show.\n\n206\n00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,000\nBut the Windows AIK, you can just do\na Google search for it or whatever.\n\n207\n00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,750\nIt'll be your first link if you search for\nWindows IAK.\n\n208\n00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,230\nYou can download it right from\nMicrosoft free of charge.\n\n209\n00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,780\nHas most of what you need in it.\n\n210\n00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,890\n>> You want me to just pull it up?\n\n211\n00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,510\n>> Yeah, go ahead.\nI'm getting the downloading here in\n\n212\n00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,460\nthe background.\n\n213\n00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,290\nI got it.\n\n214\n00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,800\n>> Oh, like on the internet or whatever?\n\n215\n00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,870\n>> On the internet, that's right.\n\n216\n00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,458\nAll right, okay.\n\n217\n00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:20,968\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll [INAUDIBLE].\n\n218\n00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:22,888\nYeah, we'll throw that link in there, and,\n\n219\n00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:23,712\nall right, we'll get going.\n\n220\n00:10:23,712 --> 00:10:25,750\nAll right, so really, first thing's first.\n\n221\n00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,520\nSo that deployment tools command prompt.\n\n222\n00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,870\nSo after the tools are installed,\n\n223\n00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,910\nwe can go to All Programs, all right,\nMicrosoft AIK, right there.\n\n224\n00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,820\nAnd that's the tool that we launched.\n\n225\n00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,200\nDeployment Tools Command Prompt.\n\n226\n00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,360\nAnd in here, right,\nthere is a little command.\n\n227\n00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,546\nSo, we'll go to copy P E dot C M D.\n\n228\n00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,445\nAll right.\n\n229\n00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:52,000\nAnd then we have to pick what\narchitecture we're after.\n\n230\n00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,345\nSo whether it's 64 bit.\n\n231\n00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:59,480\n32 bit, for us we're going to do 64 bit,\nso AMD64, all right?\n\n232\n00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,380\nAnd then where we want to put these files.\n\n233\n00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,130\nSo we'll go to C:/winp.\n\n234\n00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,950\nAll right, already exists.\n\n235\n00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,590\nYou know what,\nlet's go ahead and run this guy.\n\n236\n00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,220\nStraight up, so\n\n237\n00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,200\nlet's just go ahead and delete that\nfolder since it already exists.\n\n238\n00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,900\nAnd we will run that again.\n\n239\n00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,720\nNow it's going to take all those files\nthat we need to make that Windows PE,\n\n240\n00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,670\nand stick it all in that folder.\n\n241\n00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,400\nWe are done with that tool right now.\n\n242\n00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,110\nNow what we need to do is,\nthat ImageX tool.\n\n243\n00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,480\nThat tool that we're going to\nuse to take that snapshot,\n\n244\n00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,420\nright the image, we need that tool.\n\n245\n00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,520\nWhat we will do then, is we will head\nin there, and go find that tool.\n\n246\n00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,840\nWe will go into our program files...\n\n247\n00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,990\nAnd our Windows AIK in to our tools.\n\n248\n00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,240\nAnd then here's 64.\n\n249\n00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,630\nSo there's an ImageX tool.\n\n250\n00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,700\nI'm just gonna copy that guy.\n\n251\n00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,480\nAnd we'll go back to our Windows PE.\n\n252\n00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,080\nAll right.\n\n253\n00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,410\nSo this ISO folder,\nthis is going to be our Windows PE disk.\n\n254\n00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,500\nSo whatever goes in here,\nwe then go on our disk, so,\n\n255\n00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,010\nwe browse in there and we just paste in\nthere because we will need this tool.\n\n256\n00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,010\n>> I've seen some people on the internet\nwhere they make Windows PE disks\n\n257\n00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,200\nthat are just chock-a-block full of third\nparty utilities that do all sorts of crazy\n\n258\n00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,150\nstuff, and this is exactly what they're\ndoing, they're just throwing it right into\n\n259\n00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,850\nthat ISO folder and compiling it\n>> In our case, for the exam,\n\n260\n00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,940\nwe just need to know\nthe official Microsoft stuff.\n\n261\n00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,530\nAnd so ImageX is gonna be the one we want,\nbut if you're curious,\n\n262\n00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,730\ngo out on the internet and take a look.\n\n263\n00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,030\nYou'll find that Ultimate Boot CD and\n\n264\n00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,240\npeople like that that make\nsome really impressive ones.\n\n265\n00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,650\n>> So now, the other thing\nthat we need is this WIM file.\n\n266\n00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:52,060\nSo we've got this WinPE WIM file right\nhere and depending on other stuff\n\n267\n00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:58,210\nthat we want to with Windows PE into kind\nof a company stuff, utilities or anything.\n\n268\n00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,990\nWe can mount this WIM right here and\nwe can customize it and save it now, for\n\n269\n00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,280\nus and our purposes here it's\ngoing to be pretty generic so,\n\n270\n00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:11,390\nwe're going to just copy that straight\nup and we'll stick it in our sources.\n\n271\n00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,190\nWe'll paste it.\n\n272\n00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,020\nNow, we do need to rename this guy.\n\n273\n00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,270\nWe'll just call it boot.\n\n274\n00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,020\nIt has to be called boot.\n\n275\n00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,260\n>> Yup, boot.wim.\n\n276\n00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,310\nYeah, if you're not familiar with WIM\nfiles, that is a Windows Image file.\n\n277\n00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,550\nWhen you install Windows\n7 on your computer,\n\n278\n00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,590\nit's actually copying an image\nfrom the DVD to the hard drive.\n\n279\n00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,190\n>> In that you can find\nit right on the disk.\n\n280\n00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,000\nIt's called Install.wim and that's\nwhat's got the entire Windows 7 image or\n\n281\n00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,070\ninstallation in it.\n\n282\n00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,201\nSo this one here,\nnotice that it's only 132 megs or\n\n283\n00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:45,150\nlet's compress it's actually\nmore like 250 megs or so.\n\n284\n00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,800\nIt's a very stripped\ndown version of Windows\n\n285\n00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,830\nthat just has the basic elements needed to\nboot the system up and use drivers, and\n\n286\n00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,000\nso that's why we need\nthat file right there.\n\n287\n00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,360\nThat's the OS we're going to boot,\n\n288\n00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,170\nand then we'll have the utilities\nthat we copied over.\n\n289\n00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,370\n>> All right, so now that we've got\nthat guy right there, so now, so\n\n290\n00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,590\nfor our Windows PE disk\n>> So these files right here.\n\n291\n00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,500\nRight now as it exists it is just a file.\n\n292\n00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,290\nJust a straight up file.\n\n293\n00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,790\nSo now we need to take these files and\nmake an ISO out of it.\n\n294\n00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,320\nA CD, virtual CD.\n\n295\n00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,100\nSo we'll jump back over here\nto this Command prompt.\n\n296\n00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,770\nAnd, so part of that AIK,\nthere's a tool, right?\n\n297\n00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,605\nThat will make a nice [INAUDIBLE]\nout of files.\n\n298\n00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:31,670\nOsdimg is that tool.\n\n299\n00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,220\nAnd I'm not sure exactly what\nthe acronym for it stands for.\n\n300\n00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,000\nOr off the top of my head,\nwith that tool, right?\n\n301\n00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,650\nSo I'll go Osdimg, all right,\nand we need a couple switches.\n\n302\n00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:52,290\nAll right, so we need a hyphen N,\nwhich the hyphen N allows long file names.\n\n303\n00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:52,880\nSo we need that guy.\n\n304\n00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,060\n>> You know I just pulled up the syntax\nfor the command and they don't list what\n\n305\n00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,070\nit stands for, but if I had to guess\nit would be offline servicing CD image.\n\n306\n00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,380\nCause at most of this is part of\nan offline servicing tool kit, so\n\n307\n00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,420\nyou'll like when your doing stuff like\nthis it's not on the network it's not\n\n308\n00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,540\nan active operating system.\n\n309\n00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,780\nIt's done offline.\n\n310\n00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,730\nProbably what it stands for.\n\n311\n00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,080\nBut they don't mention it here on\nthe website what it stands for.\n\n312\n00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,480\n>> All right.\n\n313\n00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,990\nWell, there we go.\n\n314\n00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,580\nSo we got the dash in right,\nallows long file names.\n\n315\n00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,440\nAnd then we need the hyphen B,\nwhich hyphen B,\n\n316\n00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,660\nthat points to the location of the boot\nsector that we need for this CD.\n\n317\n00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,990\nNow for that one, so\nwe'll put in C colon and\n\n318\n00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,850\nstrangely enough there is no space\nbetween the path, there's no space colon\n\n319\n00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,940\nanything there's just the dash B and\nthen straight up into that path.\n\n320\n00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,919\nWhich our was c:/winpe.\n\n321\n00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:53,293\nAnd then the file that we need is,\nwe'll go back one.\n\n322\n00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:58,625\nIs that guy right there, et, etfsboot.\n\n323\n00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:04,083\nSo we'll type that in, etfsboot.com.\n\n324\n00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:04,963\nAll right?\nAnd so\n\n325\n00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:09,130\nnow when you put in the path\nof our ISO folder, right?\n\n326\n00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,340\nThe files that we want to make into a CD.\n\n327\n00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,210\nThat is C:\\winpe\\iso,\n\n328\n00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:19,740\nand then the path of where we want\nthis completed ISO to be placed.\n\n329\n00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,590\nAll right?\n\n330\n00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,729\nSo we'll just stick with\nthat regular folder, Win PE.\n\n331\n00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:28,364\nWe'll call it, [NOISE],\n\n332\n00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:33,390\nlet's call it help Win 7 PE.7.\n\n333\n00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:39,728\nSo, there it goes, pretty quick,\nso our Windows PE image, right?\n\n334\n00:16:39,728 --> 00:16:43,205\nWe didn't stick a whole lot of\nextra utilities and stuff into it.\n\n335\n00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:45,185\nSo, yeah, took pretty quick.\n\n336\n00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:49,010\nThere you go.\nSo now we have our Windows PE ISO,\n\n337\n00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,330\nWindows 7 PE, okay, right there.\n\n338\n00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:58,110\nAlso so we'll boot off of this CD\nto capture that sysprep image.\n\n339\n00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,800\nOkay?\n>> Yeah so now you would take that ISO and\n\n340\n00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,900\nyou would burn it to a CD.\n\n341\n00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,190\nAnd when you are ready to\ncapture an image of a computer,\n\n342\n00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,700\ninstead of booting off of its hard\ndrive you would boot off of the CD,\n\n343\n00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,900\nand that would give you the opportunity\nto capture the hard drive.\n\n344\n00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,680\nYou don't want to capture the hard\ndrive while the system is running\n\n345\n00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,150\nbecause it's going to have all its unique\nvalues, which we'll see here in a minute.\n\n346\n00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,450\n>> All right, so now,\nwith that PE disk right there.\n\n347\n00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:26,140\nSo what we're gonna do now, I don't have a\nCD burner connected to this PC right now.\n\n348\n00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,220\nSo we're just gonna copy this, and we'll\nstick it into a folder where have a lot of\n\n349\n00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,890\nimages that we use for\nall of our lab files.\n\n350\n00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,400\nAnd we'll just copy that guy over.\n\n351\n00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,282\nAll right, so\nthat guy's looking pretty good.\n\n352\n00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:44,020\nAll right, and so now, we've got our disk,\nand we've offloaded our disk so\n\n353\n00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,620\nthat we can boot off of it.\n\n354\n00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,940\nSo now it's time to sysprep our PC.\n\n355\n00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,770\nAnd for that right, so we'll just\ngo ahead and close this guy out and\n\n356\n00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,080\nthen we'll go into good\nold command prompt.\n\n357\n00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,410\nLet's make that administrative\ncommand prompt.\n\n358\n00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:12,259\nAll right now for sysprep there's\na quite a few modifiers for sysprep.\n\n359\n00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,850\nSo go ahead and browse into the sysprep\nfolder and we just do a sysprep.\n\n360\n00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,020\nKinda funny here,\n\n361\n00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,090\nwe don't you know normally when you run\na question mark on other commands right?\n\n362\n00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,860\nIt will list everything out\nwithin the command window.\n\n363\n00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,080\nBut good old sysprep gives us\na little pop up window here.\n\n364\n00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,750\nAnd there are a number of modifiers\nthat we can use with sysprep\n\n365\n00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,100\nto where we can really capture an image\ndepending on whatever our businesses need.\n\n366\n00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,690\nWe've got a Quiet Switch here which\nquiet doesn't give off any prompts or\n\n367\n00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,370\nanything like that.\n\n368\n00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,890\nNo visual indicators of it moving along.\n\n369\n00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,390\nWe have the generalized switch and\n\n370\n00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,830\nthat will strip out all of\nthe unique information and\n\n371\n00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,740\nmake this image, I guess just real\nbasic and plain, something that we can\n\n372\n00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,920\nthen push out to all of our desktops and\nlaptops and those sorts of things.\n\n373\n00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,420\nWe have an audit switch, an audit mode.\n\n374\n00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:15,600\nIt allows us to take one of our sysprep,\nyou can\n\n375\n00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,960\nonly sysprep a machine three times before\nyou just have to tear it down and redo it.\n\n376\n00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,400\nAudit mode will allow you to test\nit out without taking one of those\n\n377\n00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,960\na little SIS prep numbers away.\n\n378\n00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,550\nWe can test our image,\nmakes sure everything looks good.\n\n379\n00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,310\nWe have this OOBE modifier,\nwhich is the Out Of Box Experience,\n\n380\n00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,137\nthis right here,\nwill start that Windows welcome screen.\n\n381\n00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,845\nAll right, so when you boot this guy up,\nit'll ask for your name,\n\n382\n00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:45,185\nand your time zone, and\nall that sort of thing.\n\n383\n00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,315\nJust as if Windows was brand new.\n\n384\n00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:53,122\nAll right, now with this reboot,\nshut down, and quit modifiers,\n\n385\n00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:57,330\nafter sysprep is done we can\nchoose to reboot the machine.\n\n386\n00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,300\nWhen it's done,\nthe PC will automatically reboot.\n\n387\n00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,940\nYou'd use the shut down switch to\nwhere it will shut the PC down, or\n\n388\n00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,710\nthe quit modify right here which will\njust quick sysprep all together.\n\n389\n00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,120\nAnd it will just dump us\nright back to our PC.\n\n390\n00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,600\nNow we have this last one here.\n\n391\n00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,510\nThis unattend and a file name.\n\n392\n00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:24,350\nNow for here we won't dive real deep\ninto the Windows System Image Manager,\n\n393\n00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,310\nbut it's Windows sim,\nit's part of the AIK.\n\n394\n00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,600\nAnd what this does is it allows us to\ncreate what's called an unattend file,\n\n395\n00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,240\nso, Don, you've met these guys, right?\n\n396\n00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,570\n>> Absolutely,\nyou mentioned the out of box experience.\n\n397\n00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,920\nWhen we sysprep a machine, we generalize\nit, we take away the unique stuff.\n\n398\n00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,190\nSo when the machine boots back up, you\nhave to give it the unique stuff, right?\n\n399\n00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,880\nSo what's unique?\n\n400\n00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,530\nThe computer name,\n\n401\n00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,700\nwhether it's joined to a domain, what\nthe product key is for Windows, right?\n\n402\n00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,210\nThose are unique values that\nwe need to give the machine.\n\n403\n00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,100\nWell, it's gonna ask that in\na little wizard that happens when\n\n404\n00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,320\nthe system boots up.\n\n405\n00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,250\nThat means whoever the user is sitting\nat that machine is still gonna have to\n\n406\n00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,430\ntype some things in.\n\n407\n00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,210\nWell, with an unattend file you\ncan provide that information.\n\n408\n00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,260\nYou can say here's what I want\nthis computer to be named.\n\n409\n00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,490\nHere's what product key\nyou're going to use.\n\n410\n00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,210\nGo ahead and\naccept the end user license agreement.\n\n411\n00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,760\nYou can make it so\nthat when this computer reboots and\n\n412\n00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,050\nthat Windows Welcome Wizard pops\nup it just moves right past it.\n\n413\n00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,685\nIt already knows the answer,\nto all of the questions to get through it.\n\n414\n00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:29,985\nThat's what an unattend file does,\nand you can create very complex ones.\n\n415\n00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:33,965\nYou can have it, where it's got\na database, packed full of computer names,\n\n416\n00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:37,625\nso that when the computer boots up, and\nyou tell it which computer name to use,\n\n417\n00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:41,115\nand it'll tie that to the right\nproduct key, and so on.\n\n418\n00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:44,325\nIt can get a lot of information,\nright there, from an unattend file.\n\n419\n00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:47,546\nThe XML files, you can write them by hand,\nif you're crazy.\n\n420\n00:21:47,546 --> 00:21:49,530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Or\n\n421\n00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,560\nyou can use the System Image Manager\nto generate it that way.\n\n422\n00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,080\nWindows Deployment Server, which I think\nwe'll see a little bit later in this\n\n423\n00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,140\nepisode, it actually has a way to generate\nthese too without us having to get super\n\n424\n00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,930\ninvolved in the creation of them.\n\n425\n00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,460\nThis tag here is really more for backwards\ncompatibility with people who have old\n\n426\n00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,015\nunattend files that they want\nto tie in can still use this.\n\n427\n00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:10,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n428\n00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,900\nAnd one thing I thought was pretty\ncool about this unattend file\n\n429\n00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,410\nis that it can partition\nout the hard drive.\n\n430\n00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:17,980\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n431\n00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,460\n>> So if you have a blank hard drive and\n\n432\n00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,910\nas it rolls out\n>> I make.\n\n433\n00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,820\nAnd it can split it up out of\nthat 300MB system partition, and\n\n434\n00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,450\nthen I guess use the rest of the disk for\nyour regular drive.\n\n435\n00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,420\nYeah, pretty fancy stuff.\n\n436\n00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,330\n>> And it can even call scripts, so if you\nhave custom scripts that you want to run.\n\n437\n00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,335\nAnd once you call scripts, you can\ndo whatever your mind can think of.\n\n438\n00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:40,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can kick off all sorts of\n\n439\n00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,671\nactivities after this thing finishes.\n\n440\n00:22:41,671 --> 00:22:42,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n441\n00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,730\n>> Well,\nwhatever the mind can think of, right?\n\n442\n00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,530\n>> That's it man.\n\n443\n00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,835\nThe scripts no limit, right?\n\n444\n00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:48,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As you don't run\n\n445\n00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,990\nit as an administrator, right?\n\n446\n00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,580\n>> Yeah.\n\n447\n00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,300\nThere you go.\n\n448\n00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,160\nSo there we go.\n\n449\n00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,510\nNow down here it says if no command\nline arguments are provided\n\n450\n00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,950\nthen a little GUI window will\npop up which is what we'll do.\n\n451\n00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,660\nSo, sysprep\n>> While you're running that, Nate.\n\n452\n00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,130\nSysprep is not actually installed\nwith Windows 7 by default.\n\n453\n00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,830\nSo when you install Windows 7, it does\nthis funny thing where it actually creates\n\n454\n00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,000\nthat sysprep folder but it's empty,\nthere's not anything in there.\n\n455\n00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,240\nIt's included on the Windows DVD though,\nso\n\n456\n00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,060\nyou can copy right from there onto\nthe hard drive to have that available.\n\n457\n00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,962\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n458\n00:23:21,962 --> 00:23:26,210\nIf sysprep is not already on your machine,\nif you got your machine from Dell or\n\n459\n00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,200\nHP, a lot of times it'll already be there.\n\n460\n00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,090\nBut if this is one that you set\nup yourself, it may not be there.\n\n461\n00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,600\nIn that case you need to jump\nto the DVD and it's on there.\n\n462\n00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,110\nIf you take a look at a Windows 7 DVD,\nthere's a folder called Tools, and\n\n463\n00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,925\nit's in the Tools folder\nyou'll find Sysprep.\n\n464\n00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:40,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n465\n00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,090\nNice.\n\n466\n00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,850\nAll right, thank you Don.\n\n467\n00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,800\nSo right here, on our first\nlittle box here, System Cleanup.\n\n468\n00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,411\nAll right.\nSo\n\n469\n00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:51,083\nwe can either go in audit mode\nto test those things out.\n\n470\n00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:55,480\nOr we can enter the OOBE,\nwhich is what we will chose.\n\n471\n00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,723\nAnd then we'll check this\nbox to generalize, right,\n\n472\n00:23:57,723 --> 00:24:00,450\nto strip out all that unique information.\n\n473\n00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,840\nAnd then now,\nthe options of what to do when we're done.\n\n474\n00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,770\nNow, if this machine,\n\n475\n00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,248\nso let's say if we choose the reboot,\nwhich is there by default.\n\n476\n00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:13,015\nIf we choose to reboot when this guy\nis done, the machine will reboot.\n\n477\n00:24:13,015 --> 00:24:17,865\nWell, if we don't stop it or load a disk\nin there to boot off from that disk and\n\n478\n00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:20,905\nit boots into Windows, or\neven starts to boot into Windows,\n\n479\n00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:25,480\nit's already starting to write\nunique information back onto our PC.\n\n480\n00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,310\nAt that point, we've already lost\nour generalised image there,\n\n481\n00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,240\nwe'll have to run this process over again.\n\n482\n00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,790\nSo for us, what we'll do,\nto make sure that we can catch this guy,\n\n483\n00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,860\nwe'll just choose to shut down.\n\n484\n00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,400\nAll right, we'll just click OK,\nand we'll just let this guy run.\n\n485\n00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,870\nAnd now if we did include\nany other switches,\n\n486\n00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,180\nit would get to that stuff at this point.\n\n487\n00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,050\nBut yeah,\nit's just gonna run through the stuff and\n\n488\n00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:54,730\ngeneralize this installation of Windows,\nand when this guy is done,\n\n489\n00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,570\nthis machine will, it should log me\nout of this remote desktop session.\n\n490\n00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,980\nBut then it will shut down.\n\n491\n00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,030\n>> Now when we reboot this machine.\n\n492\n00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,100\nWell, we don't reboot it, right?\n\n493\n00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,880\nWe shut it down and then we're gonna\nboot it up off of that Windows PE disk.\n\n494\n00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,170\nSo we can grab an image of it\nwhile it's still generalized.\n\n495\n00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,960\nWe're gonna use ImageX because\nthat's what's on the exam.\n\n496\n00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,410\nBut in real life you can use any of\na wide variety of imaging software.\n\n497\n00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,150\nImageX is free, so why not use that?\n\n498\n00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,178\nBut you could also use Symantec Ghost,\n\n499\n00:25:24,178 --> 00:25:28,510\nAcronis True Image,\nParagon Drive Backup, any of those guys.\n\n500\n00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:34,230\nOnce this guy is generalized, once it\nis made non-unique, you can clone it\n\n501\n00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,910\nwith anything, throw it out to all of your\nmachines, and then bring it back up, and\n\n502\n00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:42,980\nit'll run through this process, so ImageX\nis nice though just because it's free.\n\n503\n00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,270\nAnother thing worth mentioning,\nnot on the exams so\n\n504\n00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:49,100\nmuch, is that in Windows 8 they've\nmoved away from ImageX and\n\n505\n00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:54,000\nthey've moved to using a utility called\nDISM, or the Disk Image Servicing manager.\n\n506\n00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,870\nWhat is it, DISM?\n\n507\n00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,550\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n508\n00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,202\nYep. Yeah. >> I'm right, wow.\n\n509\n00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:56,747\n>> Service manager.\n\n510\n00:25:56,747 --> 00:25:57,913\nYeah.\n>> [LAUGH] Okay, so\n\n511\n00:25:57,913 --> 00:26:01,512\nif you're dealing with newer machines and\nyou're wondering,\n\n512\n00:26:01,512 --> 00:26:03,200\nwhere the heck did ImageX go?\n\n513\n00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,400\nWell it's kinda gone.\n\n514\n00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,600\nIt's just been replaced by a new command.\n\n515\n00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,010\nBut the exam for Windows 7, ImageX is\nstill the utility you want to use and\n\n516\n00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,335\nit's still available so you might as well.\n\n517\n00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:13,960\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n518\n00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,770\nAll right, Don so\nwe do have a few minutes left on here.\n\n519\n00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:21,080\nBut the Sysprep does take a little\nbit of time to grind away.\n\n520\n00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,480\nThe next step that we have it to,\noh, look there it goes.\n\n521\n00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,510\n>> Perfect timing, right?\n\n522\n00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,680\n>> Perfect timing.\n\n523\n00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,280\nSo should we jump in,\nfire this guy up and jump into ImageX?\n\n524\n00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,960\nYeah why don't we do that?\n\n525\n00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,800\nCuz that's gonna take a long time, so\n\n526\n00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,330\nthat'll be a perfect time to stop and\ntake a break.\n\n527\n00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,890\nLet's fire it up and\nsee if we can grab that image.\n\n528\n00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,390\n>> All right.\n\n529\n00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,600\nFor us right now,\nit is a virtual machine I'm going into.\n\n530\n00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,030\nLet me just jump over there and\nload that ISO.\n\n531\n00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,585\nRight click.\n\n532\n00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,370\nYeah, so what he's doing is he's gonna put\nthat Windows PE disc in the disc drive on\n\n533\n00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,180\nthis machine.\n\n534\n00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,900\nSo he's picking the one that he made.\n\n535\n00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,550\nAnd we're gonna boot off of that CD.\n\n536\n00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,946\nThat's really important.\n\n537\n00:27:01,946 --> 00:27:07,180\nIf we screw it up and don't boot from\nthe CD, then it's going to de-generalize,\n\n538\n00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,678\nit's going to become unique again.\n\n539\n00:27:08,678 --> 00:27:12,180\nSo see he just changed the boot order\nto ensure that he's gonna boot off\n\n540\n00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,790\nthat CD drive.\n\n541\n00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,600\nYou definitely don't wanna miss that,\n\n542\n00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,750\notherwise you'll have\nto run Sysprep again.\n\n543\n00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,150\nAnd Nate mentioned it, you can only\nrun Sysprep on a machine three times.\n\n544\n00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,920\nAfter that Microsoft makes\nyou do a reinstall, right?\n\n545\n00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,897\nBecause every time you Sysprep it's kinda\nresetting the grace period of the product\n\n546\n00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,534\nkey and that's why they limit it.\n\n547\n00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:36,080\nAll right, so here he goes\nbooting off the Windows PE disk.\n\n548\n00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,850\nAnd what we should see is, it boots up\nin a limited Windows type environment.\n\n549\n00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,116\nAnd drops us to a command prompt, right?\n\n550\n00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:45,936\nNot the most user-friendly thing in\nthe world, but it's not really made for\n\n551\n00:27:45,936 --> 00:27:46,952\nyour average user.\n\n552\n00:27:46,952 --> 00:27:47,452\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n553\n00:27:52,277 --> 00:27:53,240\nAll right, yep.\n\n554\n00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,740\nAnd, so I just got it sitting\nhere thinking and sure enough.\n\n555\n00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,040\nSo now it'll be a time to push\noff those ImageX commands and\n\n556\n00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,670\nthen capture our image.\n\n557\n00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,720\nImageX also has a number of switches and\ndifferent things that we can\n\n558\n00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:12,500\nuse to really get down granular on\nwhat it is you want to capture and\n\n559\n00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,580\nthose sorts of items there.\n\n560\n00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,810\nFor us,\nit'll be a little more of a generic one.\n\n561\n00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,790\nOh and you know,\nyou are also going to need,\n\n562\n00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,550\neither a second hard drive,\nor a USB drive of some sort,\n\n563\n00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,890\nbecause when you capture this image,\nyou've got to put it somewhere.\n\n564\n00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,600\nIt'll actually let you capture the image,\nand stick it back on the same drive,\n\n565\n00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,830\nbut there's not a whole lot\nof point in doing that.\n\n566\n00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,979\nSo normally you'd be popping\nthis Windows PE disk in and\n\n567\n00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:39,731\nyou'd have a USB hard drive or\nsomething like that attached to it so\n\n568\n00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:42,619\nthat you could grab the image and\ndeposit it there.\n\n569\n00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:45,496\nWpeinit, what it's sitting on right now,\n\n570\n00:28:45,496 --> 00:28:50,170\nthat's where it's initializing\nthe drivers that Windows PE has.\n\n571\n00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,850\nSo it's usually initializing\nthe network controller and so on,\n\n572\n00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:58,470\nand when it stalls like this, a lot of\ntimes that means it's trying to get a DHCP\n\n573\n00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,340\naddress or something and\nwe just have to wait for it to time out.\n\n574\n00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,920\nSo it can take a moment, it does seem to\nbe taking a little extra long this time,\n\n575\n00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,610\ndoesn't it\n>> Yeah.\n\n576\n00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,030\nAt least, I mean,\nit's still blinking, though.\n\n577\n00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,460\nIt's not frozen,\nit's just taking its little time.\n\n578\n00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,030\n>> It's been a long time since\nI've had to mess with it.\n\n579\n00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:21,470\nBut there's a keyboard shortcut you\ncan hit to run another command prompt.\n\n580\n00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,920\nYou can do things while\nWpeinit is running.\n\n581\n00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,030\nJust cuz it's stuck on waiting for\n\n582\n00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,180\na network adapter to come up doesn't\nmean you have to wait on it.\n\n583\n00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,150\nI'm trying to remember what\nthe keyboard shortcut is though.\n\n584\n00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:37,600\nI can't, it's something weird like\nCtrl+Shift+R, something crazy like that.\n\n585\n00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,130\nLet me see if I can find it real quick.\n\n586\n00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,510\n>> All right well I just pushed\nthe Enter key for the fun of it.\n\n587\n00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,545\n>> Well, there we go.\n\n588\n00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:46,408\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n589\n00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:49,029\nSo now we're at a command prompt and\nwe can get to business, right?\n\n590\n00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,931\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n591\n00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:51,990\nYep.\nAll right, so first thing's first.\n\n592\n00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,920\nSo, yes, this machine it does have,\nI have two hard drives.\n\n593\n00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:59,230\nActually I'm pretty sure it\ndoes have two hard drives.\n\n594\n00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:04,120\nLet's just, Yep.\n\n595\n00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,990\nTwo disks, that's right.\n\n596\n00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,180\nAll right, good deal.\n\n597\n00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:12,070\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n598\n00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,194\nNow, for ImageX.\n\n599\n00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,266\nAll right we've got to switch to our CD,\nlet's see,\n\n600\n00:30:25,266 --> 00:30:29,251\nD: that one is going to be-\n>> That's probably the second hard drive.\n\n601\n00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:31,537\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n602\n00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:34,070\n>> Windows PE does some weird\nstuff with your drive letters.\n\n603\n00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,110\nYou'll notice that it\nstarted with drive X.\n\n604\n00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,970\nX is called a RAM drive.\n\n605\n00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,670\nIt created a fake hard drive in your\nRAM where it loaded the Windows PE\n\n606\n00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,410\noperating system.\n\n607\n00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,250\nSo it's actually running from RAM.\n\n608\n00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,910\nThen you still have your hard drives and\nyour DVD drives.\n\n609\n00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,700\nSo it'll have C and D and E and\n\n610\n00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,380\neven F in this case as that points\nto the actual boot disk itself.\n\n611\n00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,520\nSo, you may have to kind of bounce around\nbetween your drive letters before you find\n\n612\n00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,348\nwhat you're looking for.\n\n613\n00:31:01,348 --> 00:31:03,280\nThere's that ImageX right there so for\n\n614\n00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,150\nyou it ended up being F because\nyou have two hard drives.\n\n615\n00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,080\nIf you only had one hard\ndrive it might have been E.\n\n616\n00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,222\n>> All right, so, with this ImageX, right,\n\n617\n00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:15,670\ndid a little question\nmark at the end of that.\n\n618\n00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,395\nAnd you can see all the little different\nswitches that it has on there now.\n\n619\n00:31:18,395 --> 00:31:22,700\nImageX, not only can it capture\nimages it can apply images.\n\n620\n00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,710\nWe can use it for servicing and\ndo other items such as that.\n\n621\n00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:30,030\nAnd so, we have a number of\nswitches that we can use.\n\n622\n00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,300\nBut, what we will do, let's see.\n\n623\n00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,491\nNow, the letter of, I will scroll\nback to it when we get to it.\n\n624\n00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:43,298\nAll right.\nSo we'll do, imagex and we'll run\n\n625\n00:31:43,298 --> 00:31:48,400\nthe flags command with enterprise.\n\n626\n00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,488\nWhat this will do,\n\n627\n00:31:49,488 --> 00:31:53,500\nthis will tell ImageX what edition\nof Windows that we're capturing.\n\n628\n00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,793\nWe're going to put an image enterprise,\nwe could put in Home Basic, Home Premium,\n\n629\n00:31:57,793 --> 00:31:58,770\nthings like that.\n\n630\n00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,080\nSo we'll put in enterprise right here.\n\n631\n00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,320\nAnd then what we want to do is to capture.\n\n632\n00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:12,550\nAnd then of the drive that we want\nto capture our sysprepped drive,\n\n633\n00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,220\nwhich that one will be on E.\n\n634\n00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,800\nSo there's a program\nfile is in that E drive.\n\n635\n00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,140\nLet's go back down.\n\n636\n00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:29,540\nE: and then the destination path, so\nwhere we want to stick this stuff.\n\n637\n00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,030\nWhich will be on our second drive.\n\n638\n00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:35,280\nWhich I believe we found was the D drive,\ncorrect?\n\n639\n00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,780\nYep.\n\n640\n00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:43,560\nWe're gonna stick that in D:/ and\n\n641\n00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,516\nwe'll call it win7.win.\n\n642\n00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:49,267\nAll right?\n\n643\n00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:54,016\nAnd then we want some kind of name\nthat we're going to name this guy, so\n\n644\n00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,330\nwe'll just put in how about just Win7,\nright?\n\n645\n00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,090\n>> Sure.\n\n646\n00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,062\nAnd he had to give it a name there because\nyou can actually have more than one image\n\n647\n00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:07,391\nIn the same WIM file.\n\n648\n00:33:07,391 --> 00:33:11,725\nAnd the idea is that WIMs can be very\nmodular so you could have an image for\n\n649\n00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:15,916\nyour accounting laptops, an image for\nyour marketing laptops, and\n\n650\n00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:19,110\neven your sales desktops\nall inside of one WIM file.\n\n651\n00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,170\nSo everything is wrapped up and\npackaged nice and neat.\n\n652\n00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,070\nSo you have to give it a name,\n\n653\n00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,665\nso you can identify which image\ninside of the WIM you want to deploy.\n\n654\n00:33:25,665 --> 00:33:29,757\n>> Now at this point here,\nnow it's gonna capture,\n\n655\n00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:36,384\ncapture that sysprepped installation\nof Windows, and it's gonna take it all,\n\n656\n00:33:36,384 --> 00:33:42,080\nand roll it into one file,\nthat Win7.wim, that image file.\n\n657\n00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,750\nSo that can then use that image file to\npush out to all of our other machines\n\n658\n00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,350\nthrough DWS or some other means.\n\n659\n00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,540\n>> And you'll see it's pretty smart, it's\nexcluding some files that are pointless,\n\n660\n00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,360\nlike your page file and your hibernation\nfile, those two can be really big.\n\n661\n00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,190\nIf you have eight gigs of RAM,\n\n662\n00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:00,710\nyour hibernation file will often\ntimes be close to eight gigs in size.\n\n663\n00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,280\nSame thing with the page file.\n\n664\n00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,930\nOther ones, the recycle bin,\nthere's no point in backing those up, and\n\n665\n00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,870\nso it trims those out and\ndoesn't get them.\n\n666\n00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,140\nSo it's pretty smart about that,\npretty efficient.\n\n667\n00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,090\nIt's gonna gather that data and\ncompress it.\n\n668\n00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:16,020\nBut, judging by the fact that we're\nonly at 1%, it's gonna take a while.\n\n669\n00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,950\nSo why don't we take this opportunity\nto stop and take a break.\n\n670\n00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:23,320\nAnd when we get back, through the magic\nof television, the image will be done and\n\n671\n00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,400\nwe will take it and\nsee how to then deploy it onto a machine.\n\n672\n00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,340\nThe second piece of the whole operation.\n\n673\n00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,726\nSound good, Nick?\n>> Yep, sounds great.\n\n674\n00:34:30,726 --> 00:34:33,059\n>> All right, stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in a few.\n\n675\n00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:43,058\n>> [NOISE]\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n676\n00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:45,890\nWell, through the magic of television\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n677\n00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,326\n>> We left our ImageX utility running,\n\n678\n00:34:48,326 --> 00:34:52,350\nbuilding that WIM file,\nbuilding that image of our source machine.\n\n679\n00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,070\nNow it's done and\nwe're ready to deploy it, right.\n\n680\n00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:59,200\n>> Well, we could, if you were ready to\ndeploy right now you could throw the image\n\n681\n00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,710\none, ten, a hundred,\na thousand machines no big deal, right.\n\n682\n00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,920\nBut most companies are constantly\nadding new computers, so you might have\n\n683\n00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,280\nten new computers this week and ten\nmore next week and ten more next month.\n\n684\n00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,250\nWell, what happens is the image file\nwe created, the WIM, becomes outdated.\n\n685\n00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,140\nIt doesn't take long,\nnew Windows updates come out all the time.\n\n686\n00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,830\nYou may have new hardware come in\nthat requires different drivers.\n\n687\n00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,860\nEven when you're buying\nthe same model of PC,\n\n688\n00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,480\noccasionally the vendors\nwill change out hardware.\n\n689\n00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,960\nSo you have to deal with new drivers,\nnew updates,\n\n690\n00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,900\nupdates to your application, maybe we've\ninstalled, some line of business app,\n\n691\n00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,610\nin our image, and overtime new versions\nof that line of business app come out.\n\n692\n00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:44,790\nWell in the past,\nyou'd have to go to your source machine,\n\n693\n00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,160\ndo all the updates, and\nrebuild your image.\n\n694\n00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,640\nSo every time a Windows update came out,\nyou had to rebuild, your image.\n\n695\n00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,200\nAnd that's kind of a hassle right?\n\n696\n00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,270\nSo one of the nice things we can do\nwith these WIM files is what's called\n\n697\n00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,240\noffline servicing.\n\n698\n00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,710\nOffline servicing is where we take that\nWIM file and we mount it, we basically\n\n699\n00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:07,320\ncrack it open and then we can inject\nfiles, updates, entire applications.\n\n700\n00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,960\nYou can inject things into the WIM and\nthen close it off.\n\n701\n00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,940\nAnd off you go,\nthe image is now updated without\n\n702\n00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,690\nhaving to go back to the source machine,\nwithout having to bring a machine online.\n\n703\n00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,740\nThat's why they call it offline servicing,\n\n704\n00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,570\ncuz we do all of this without\nbringing up a new source machine.\n\n705\n00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,120\nAll right?\n\n706\n00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,390\nSo it's very cool, at a minimum you'll\nwant to do it for Windows updates, right?\n\n707\n00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:32,310\nI know, if you take like Windows XP\nright now and install the latest and\n\n708\n00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,580\ngreatest version of Windows XP on CD.\n\n709\n00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,760\nAnd you go to do Windows Updates, there's\nover a hundred updates that have to apply.\n\n710\n00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,430\nAnd it's a nightmare,\n\n711\n00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:43,250\ntakes forever, so it's nice to have\nan image that already has all the updates.\n\n712\n00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,900\nNow, we're not gonna do Windows XP,\nobviously.\n\n713\n00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,400\nI just use that as an example.\n\n714\n00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,210\nBut even with Windows 7, even with\nWindows 8, updates are coming out daily.\n\n715\n00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:55,280\nThey release them on patch Tuesday, but\nthey actually slowly leak them out so\n\n716\n00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,800\nyou can get them on\na regular basis if you want.\n\n717\n00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,825\nKeeping your image up to\ndate is pretty important.\n\n718\n00:36:59,825 --> 00:37:01,965\nSo, Nate's gonna give us\na little example here.\n\n719\n00:37:01,965 --> 00:37:05,365\nYou're gonna take that WIM we made,\nand crack it open, right?\n\n720\n00:37:05,365 --> 00:37:06,055\n>> Yep.\n\n721\n00:37:06,055 --> 00:37:10,051\nAll right, so yeah, the tool that we're\ngonna use to mount this guy, DISM,\n\n722\n00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:13,590\nD-I-S-M, that tool.\n\n723\n00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:19,790\nNow, so on this machine here, so that\nimage file we've got over on the D drive\n\n724\n00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:25,610\n> Image folder > Win7pe.wim.\n\n725\n00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,390\nSo now the first thing we need\nto do is mount this image.\n\n726\n00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:34,710\nWe need to mount it up so\nthat we are able to load stuff in there.\n\n727\n00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,439\nAnd for that,\nwe'll go back into our Windows AIK,\n\n728\n00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:41,020\nin the deployment tools command.\n\n729\n00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,650\nWe'll just run that guy as administrator.\n\n730\n00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,610\nAll right now we need a directory.\n\n731\n00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:54,420\nSo we need some folder to\nmount this WIM file in there.\n\n732\n00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,001\nSo then we'll just go and\nmake directory c:\\mount,\n\n733\n00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:03,391\nwhich already exists, but\nthere's that command.\n\n734\n00:38:03,391 --> 00:38:08,384\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so we got the folder in\n\n735\n00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:14,003\nthere, and so\nnow the command that we use to mount,\n\n736\n00:38:14,003 --> 00:38:18,708\ndism, and then we want to mount-wim, and\n\n737\n00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:23,413\nwimfile and\nthen the path to that WIM file,\n\n738\n00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:28,720\nwhich is gonna be d:\\images,\nor just image?\n\n739\n00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,891\n>> I think it was just image.\n\n740\n00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,110\n>> Yep, correct.\n\n741\n00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,784\n/win7pe.wim, all right, and\n\n742\n00:38:36,784 --> 00:38:41,663\nthen we need to tell it where to mount it,\nright?\n\n743\n00:38:41,663 --> 00:38:46,453\nSo then /mountdir and\nthen C:\\mount, right,\n\n744\n00:38:46,453 --> 00:38:51,141\nwhatever folder it was that we created for\nthat.\n\n745\n00:38:51,141 --> 00:38:53,769\nNow, so we mentioned before,\n\n746\n00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:58,933\nthat we can have multiple images,\nwithin a single WIM file.\n\n747\n00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:03,772\nNow there's different ways,\nthat we can separate them out,\n\n748\n00:39:03,772 --> 00:39:06,090\none is by an index number.\n\n749\n00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:10,140\nNow, our WIM file,\nwe only have one in there.\n\n750\n00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,516\nAnd so it is the index:1.\n\n751\n00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:19,306\nNow you can run a command, get-wiminfo\nto break all that stuff down, but\n\n752\n00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:21,450\nfor us we just have one.\n\n753\n00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,950\nAnd so it is index one.\n\n754\n00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,850\nNow if there was a,\nif you want to work with like the fourth\n\n755\n00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:30,470\nfile in there would be index:four or\nwhatever index number it has there.\n\n756\n00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:34,141\nBut we'll just do this index 1.\n\n757\n00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:38,844\nAnd then we'll run it and it'll take just\na minute, it's gonna grab that WIM file\n\n758\n00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:43,017\nand mount it up to this directory,\nwhere then we can push stuff out to it.\n\n759\n00:39:43,017 --> 00:39:47,125\n>> Yeah the cool part here is when it's\ndone we'll be able to browse to c:\\mount\n\n760\n00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:50,260\nand we're going to be looking\ninside of that WIN file.\n\n761\n00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:54,458\nYou'll basically be seeing the C drive or\nwhatever for that computer.\n\n762\n00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:58,830\nSo now that you've got access to the hard\ndrive of this non-existent machine,\n\n763\n00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,710\nyou can start to copy files in and\nchange things out.\n\n764\n00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:05,480\nAnd there's even some command line\nutilities that help to inject things if we\n\n765\n00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,640\nwanna inject a driver.\n\n766\n00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,636\nBecause having a driver,\n\n767\n00:40:07,636 --> 00:40:10,400\nit's not just a matter of copying\nfiles onto the hard drive.\n\n768\n00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,030\nYou've got to make sure that\nWindows is aware the driver exists,\n\n769\n00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,535\nthat it's registered and that the INF\nfiles are in one directory and the sys and\n\n770\n00:40:17,535 --> 00:40:19,275\nDLL files are in another directory.\n\n771\n00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:20,965\nThat stuff is hard to keep track of so\n\n772\n00:40:20,965 --> 00:40:25,555\nMicrosoft has some utilities\nwe can use for that.\n\n773\n00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:28,525\n>> And so then browsing into\nthat mount directory, so\n\n774\n00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:32,860\nthere's that mount directory right\nthere Program files, Users, right?\n\n775\n00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,710\nIt looks just like the C drive, right?\n\n776\n00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:39,590\nSo if we click back one and this one's\na little bit different but we've got Perf,\n\n777\n00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:46,880\nLogs, Program Files, User's folder,\nthat same thing in there.\n\n778\n00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,220\nSo, Don, we've got some drivers,\nwe've got some updates.\n\n779\n00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:55,520\nI'll leave you the choice,\nwhat do you want to load first into it?\n\n780\n00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,550\n>> Let's do drivers,\n\n781\n00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,540\nbecause drivers are the one that\nI pretty much always have to do.\n\n782\n00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,340\nThe cool thing here,\n\n783\n00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,480\nis with these Windows 7 images,\nif you include drivers for all of your\n\n784\n00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,980\ndifferent machines you can have one image\nthat works on all your different hardware.\n\n785\n00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,240\nSo it's pretty cool.\n\n786\n00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,960\nYou might have five different\nvideo cards in your environment so\n\n787\n00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,370\nyou can load the drivers for\nall five video cards.\n\n788\n00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,549\nThis is something I do regularly.\n\n789\n00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,190\n>> So we do have a folder on our C drive,\nright.\n\n790\n00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,120\nIt's right here called Drivers.\n\n791\n00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,420\nAnd inside our Drivers we've got some\ndrivers in here that we can then push out\n\n792\n00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,600\nin there.\n\n793\n00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,160\nAnd so then the command to do that, so\nwe're still working with the DISM tool.\n\n794\n00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:41,542\nAnd then it is dism and\nthen /image:c:\\mount.\n\n795\n00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:45,443\nSo then, I guess,\nthe image that we're working with,\n\n796\n00:41:45,443 --> 00:41:49,040\nwe're working with the one\nthat is in c:\\mount.\n\n797\n00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,586\nAnd then add a driver, right?\n\n798\n00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:58,410\nAnd then we need to do driver: and\n\n799\n00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:01,880\nthen where that folder is, so that is\n\n800\n00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:09,210\ngonna be in c:\\drivers.\n\n801\n00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:14,070\nNow what we can do is we can\nspecify a single file in there,\n\n802\n00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:18,150\na single INF file, or\nif we have a bunch of drivers in a folder,\n\n803\n00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,972\nwhich in this one that we do,\nthere is a command, /recurse.\n\n804\n00:42:22,972 --> 00:42:27,160\nAnd /recurse will then take all\nthose files and dump them in so\n\n805\n00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,510\nyou don't have to name them out One,\none by one.\n\n806\n00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:34,000\nWe'll go ahead and run that command,\nat it should go out and\n\n807\n00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,560\nstick all those files into our image.\n\n808\n00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,380\n>> And, remember, it's not just copying\nthe files, it's also registering them, and\n\n809\n00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,940\ngetting them updated with the system.\n\n810\n00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,220\nAnd, Nate, yours,\nyou just had the INF files, and,\n\n811\n00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,600\noh I guess it's just complaining\nabout signatures there.\n\n812\n00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,590\nBut a lot of times there's also DLL and\nsys files attached that it'll\n\n813\n00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:56,500\nbring those over also if they're in\nthe directory if they normally would be.\n\n814\n00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,020\n>> So this one right, so\nit did throw out a bunch of errors, so\n\n815\n00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,550\nit's saying hey this stuff is not signed.\n\n816\n00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,820\nWell let's say, we're like okay, you\nknow what, don't worry about it, right.\n\n817\n00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,510\n>> You know what, it's okay.\n\n818\n00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:14,970\n>> So there's, yep\n>> forceunsigned.\n\n819\n00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,680\n>> Unsigned.\n\n820\n00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,300\n>> Unsinged.\n\n821\n00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,500\n>> Don't used the burned one.\n\n822\n00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,050\n>> Nope, not that burned ones.\n\n823\n00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:21,900\nSo I think we're done.\n\n824\n00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,455\nAll right, so, force, force-unsigned.\n\n825\n00:43:24,455 --> 00:43:26,175\nAnd there we go, right?\n\n826\n00:43:26,175 --> 00:43:30,465\nA bunch of successfully\nadded drivers into our file.\n\n827\n00:43:30,465 --> 00:43:32,045\nSo what about some updates?\n\n828\n00:43:33,225 --> 00:43:34,495\nThrow some updates in there.\n\n829\n00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:38,150\nNow there is a website that we\ncan go to to grab these updates.\n\n830\n00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:43,820\nNow, I did download some earlier,\nbut if we go over to,\n\n831\n00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,922\nlet's just do, let's go over to Bing,\n\n832\n00:43:47,922 --> 00:43:55,500\nthen go to Windows Update Catalog\n>> You actually use Bing.\n\n833\n00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,040\n>> For everything.\n\n834\n00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,110\n>> Pretty impressive.\n\n835\n00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,675\nIt's a really great engine.\n\n836\n00:43:59,675 --> 00:44:01,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n837\n00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,050\nMicrosoft Update Catalog, right?\n\n838\n00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:08,150\nSo we can go in here and we'll just\nsay we want Drivers for Windows 7.\n\n839\n00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:12,650\nAnd after it does its little thing,\nthere we go.\n\n840\n00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,850\nHere's all the drivers.\n\n841\n00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,770\nSo, we'll just do and\nclick on last updated to sort by date.\n\n842\n00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,540\nAnd so we're gonna, now here's all\nthese drivers, so what we can do-\n\n843\n00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,020\n>> Update, not necessarily drivers, right?\n\n844\n00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,390\n>> I'm sorry, I kept saying drivers.\n\n845\n00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,810\nUpdates, correct.\n\n846\n00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:32,430\nUpdates, and we can go in and\nwe can add stuff.\n\n847\n00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:35,960\nWe can view the basket clicking this link.\n\n848\n00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,740\nWe can download stuff and\npick a folder to download.\n\n849\n00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,350\nUpdates, not drivers.\n\n850\n00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:45,410\nWhich I've download some before the show.\n\n851\n00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:48,540\nSo we'll just close this out and so\n\n852\n00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:53,100\nthen those updates are in\na folder called Updates.\n\n853\n00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,160\nAnd there are three updates in here,\nwhich we will then take these and\n\n854\n00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,510\nstick them into our image.\n\n855\n00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:05,940\nSo then we'll come back over here and\nwe'll do the same DISM tool.\n\n856\n00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,517\nAnd we've got to tell it what\nimage we're working with.\n\n857\n00:45:08,517 --> 00:45:11,683\nSo image, and so\n\n858\n00:45:11,683 --> 00:45:16,434\nthat is in c:\\mount and\n\n859\n00:45:16,434 --> 00:45:22,768\nthen we want to /add-package,\n\n860\n00:45:22,768 --> 00:45:27,068\nand then the /package\n\n861\n00:45:27,068 --> 00:45:33,418\npath:c:\\update or updates.\n\n862\n00:45:33,418 --> 00:45:37,360\nUpdates with an s.\n\n863\n00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,950\nAnd then it'll go in and\ntake those updates, process those guys and\n\n864\n00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,760\nstick em into our Image.\n\n865\n00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,480\n>> Yeah, so\nnow when this machine boots up and\n\n866\n00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,130\nit goes to do its own Windows updates\nit's already got these, right?\n\n867\n00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,540\nSo you've given it kinda a leg up,\n\n868\n00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,470\nmoved it along, all without having\nto restore to another machine.\n\n869\n00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,080\nYou can actually automate this.\n\n870\n00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:59,290\nIf you have WSUS,\na Windows Server Update Services.\n\n871\n00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:02,890\nThat server can download those updates\nautomatically, and you can script and\n\n872\n00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:03,450\nautomate this.\n\n873\n00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:07,602\nI've seen some automated environments\nthat really perfect this.\n\n874\n00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:11,670\nIt's kinda an art, where the updates\nautomatically roll out, it grabs them,\n\n875\n00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,120\nrolls them into the images.\n\n876\n00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,890\nSo everyday they deploy that image they\nknow that it's the latest and greatest.\n\n877\n00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,890\nIt's already up to date when they deploy.\n\n878\n00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,020\n>> Now let's say that's done, right.\n\n879\n00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,390\nSo let's say that for this image that\nwe're preparing we're gonna go and\n\n880\n00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:27,780\npush this guy out.\n\n881\n00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,250\nAnd that now we decide we want\nthe TelnetClient in there, right?\n\n882\n00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:36,870\nWell it's not an update, it's not\na driver, but a Windows feature, right?\n\n883\n00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:41,530\nAnd so using this DSIM tool\nwe can enable that feature.\n\n884\n00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:42,070\nAll right?\nSo,\n\n885\n00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:45,820\nwe don't have to know when to\nblow this image back up and\n\n886\n00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,680\nsys prep it all over again.\n\n887\n00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,310\nSo, you wanna turn on the Telnet Planet?\n\n888\n00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,440\n>> Sure, absolutely.\n\n889\n00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,440\nI know that's one I do end up\nturning on a lot of times.\n\n890\n00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,470\n>> Telnet Planet?\n\n891\n00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:55,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n892\n00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:55,770\n>> Oh, right.\n\n893\n00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,440\nSo, it's I'm glad I picked it for\nthe demo.\n\n894\n00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,360\n>> If you're troubleshooting\na mail server, like an SMTP.\n\n895\n00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,690\nYou wanna telnet into port 25 see if\nyou get that email server message,\n\n896\n00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,510\nso you know it's something I use.\n\n897\n00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,210\n>> 425?\nWhat do you do with DNS?\n\n898\n00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:10,430\n>> SMTP 25.\n\n899\n00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:11,620\n>> Just kidding.\n\n900\n00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,222\n>> Good thing this isn't the.\n\n901\n00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:16,473\n>> Right oops.\n\n902\n00:47:16,473 --> 00:47:18,450\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n903\n00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:24,610\nDISN, and then once again we got to\ntell it what image we're working with.\n\n904\n00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:28,600\nAnd we're working it\nthrough oneNsequel/mount.\n\n905\n00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,280\nLet's do this.\n\n906\n00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,010\nWe'll just do a get dash features and\n\n907\n00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:38,555\nwe'll use the pipe more, oops, mount.\n\n908\n00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,860\nM-O-R-E.\n\n909\n00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,890\nIt's going to fly by.\n\n910\n00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:45,580\nIt doesn't recognize, get features.\n\n911\n00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,490\nI've got an idea.\n\n912\n00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,813\nLet's put a slash right there.\n\n913\n00:47:50,813 --> 00:47:53,390\n>> [LAUGH] I've got an idea.\n\n914\n00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:55,020\nLet's type it right.\n\n915\n00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,944\n>> Right.\nSo I did the more and\n\n916\n00:47:56,944 --> 00:48:01,290\nas it goes by it scans\nthrough a whole bunch there.\n\n917\n00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,833\nNow we can see these feature names.\n\n918\n00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:05,167\nThere's that one up there.\n\n919\n00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:08,080\nThe second from the top, the TelnetClient.\n\n920\n00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,322\nNow it is case sensitive, so\nwe can't just do all lowercase.\n\n921\n00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:14,230\nThat TelnetClient, that feature,\nthat is what we want.\n\n922\n00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,430\nLet's go ahead and break out of that.\n\n923\n00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:23,800\nNow what we can do is dism /imagec\n\n924\n00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,970\nThe one that is in c:\\mount.\n\n925\n00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:34,990\nAnd then we want to /enable-feature.\n\n926\n00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:41,540\nAnd then the /featurename that we\nwant is going to be TelnetClient.\n\n927\n00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,310\n>> All it's really doing is reaching in\nthere and flipping a little switch to say,\n\n928\n00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,740\nall right, when you install this machine,\nmake sure that feature is enabled.\n\n929\n00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:59,715\n>> All right and\njust to make sure that things went well,\n\n930\n00:48:59,715 --> 00:49:04,320\ndism/image:c:\\mount.\n\n931\n00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,775\nAnd now what we're gonna\ndo is get featureinfo.\n\n932\n00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,610\nAnd the featurename TelnetClient.\n\n933\n00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:20,820\nAnd so there we go.\n\n934\n00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:25,160\nSo now in our feature information right,\nthe state, enable pending.\n\n935\n00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,970\nSo we've gotta commit our changes and\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n936\n00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:29,988\nSo it's not hanging out there,\n\n937\n00:49:29,988 --> 00:49:34,050\nit's kinda in limbo,waiting to\nbe fully enabled, what not.\n\n938\n00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,440\n>> Waiting for it's time.\n\n939\n00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,150\nTime to shine.\n\n940\n00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:36,710\n>> Yep, time to shine.\n\n941\n00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:41,140\nAll right, so yeah, any other service\nthing that we want to do at this point?\n\n942\n00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,390\nWe've got our drivers, we got our updates,\nwe've checked our Windows features.\n\n943\n00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:49,090\nAnd so now it's time to I\nguess unmount this image.\n\n944\n00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:53,460\nWe have to commit our changes, so\nsave our changes to it, unmount it, and\n\n945\n00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,590\nthen we've got an updated, a good file.\n\n946\n00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,360\n>> I know I've mentioned that earlier.\n\n947\n00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,890\nIt's really important,\ndo not forget to commit your changes.\n\n948\n00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:04,940\nThe changes we've made, all these\ndifferent changes are not saved yet.\n\n949\n00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,170\nSo, if we unmount or dismount or\nwhatever is the right\n\n950\n00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,910\nword [LAUGH] if we unmount this image,\nwe're gonna lose the changes that we made.\n\n951\n00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:12,960\nNow maybe that's what we want.\n\n952\n00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,660\nMaybe we screwed something up.\n\n953\n00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,490\nThat's cool.\n\n954\n00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,660\nBut in this case, everything loaded fine.\n\n955\n00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,870\nWe're pretty happy with it.\n\n956\n00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,390\nIt's time to lock those changes down.\n\n957\n00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,250\n>> All right.\nSo go back to our dism and\n\n958\n00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:31,820\nthis time we will unmount the wim, and\n\n959\n00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,145\nthe mount directory, c:\\mount.\n\n960\n00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,885\nSo let's say if we had made,\nif we're just checking things our right?\n\n961\n00:50:41,885 --> 00:50:46,125\nLet's say we mounted this guy up because\nwe wanted to browse into the folder.\n\n962\n00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:48,535\nIf we actually wanted to\ninclude other stuff in there,\n\n963\n00:50:48,535 --> 00:50:54,345\nlet's just say we want\nto go back in there,\n\n964\n00:50:54,345 --> 00:51:00,295\ninto our mount directory and\nwe'll just put a folder here.\n\n965\n00:51:00,295 --> 00:51:01,890\nWe'll just call it games.\n\n966\n00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:06,750\nSo in a way we can go and we can stick\ngames and what not into this image.\n\n967\n00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,670\nWe can do stuff in there.\n\n968\n00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,570\nLet's say we changed our minds.\n\n969\n00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,950\nWell, there is the discard command.\n\n970\n00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:16,000\nSo we can discard all of our changes.\n\n971\n00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,220\nJust unmount the WIM,\nthrow all that stuff out.\n\n972\n00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:26,460\nWe want it back the way, but\nif not then we want to commit, right?\n\n973\n00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,970\nTo commit our changes.\n\n974\n00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:30,810\nWe'll smash Enter.\n\n975\n00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:34,730\nNow it will save those changes and\nit will unmount our WIM file.\n\n976\n00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:38,810\nSo then we can then push that one\nfile out through I guess whatever\n\n977\n00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:41,980\nmethod we wanna do, WDS or\nany other way like that.\n\n978\n00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,220\n>> Yeah, important step, and if you're\nmaking a lot of changes to this image\n\n979\n00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,470\nyou can actually commit\nthe changes while it's mounted.\n\n980\n00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:53,130\nSo if you know, you're going to\nbe working in it all day, and\n\n981\n00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,150\nyou're half way through the day.\n\n982\n00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:57,480\nAnd you're like oh, I really want to\nsave it right now, just to make sure,\n\n983\n00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,230\nin case something happens while\nI'm out to lunch, or whatever.\n\n984\n00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:05,193\nYou can use the DISM utility, and\nuse the, what it's like /commit-image.\n\n985\n00:52:05,193 --> 00:52:08,814\nThat will let you commit the changes,\nbut keep the image mounted, so\n\n986\n00:52:08,814 --> 00:52:10,445\nyou can continue to work on it.\n\n987\n00:52:10,445 --> 00:52:13,062\nSo you do have a couple\nof options right there.\n\n988\n00:52:13,062 --> 00:52:17,930\n>> All right, so,\nyeah we've got that part now.\n\n989\n00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:21,170\nWe've done all of our\nservicing out of this image.\n\n990\n00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:24,720\nAnd so now it comes time to\ndeploy our new image out.\n\n991\n00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,900\nSo we do have a couple\nof different options\n\n992\n00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,800\nthat we have to push this image out.\n\n993\n00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,790\nOne through, Don you mentioned with that,\nthe ZTI Systems Center and\n\n994\n00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,360\nall that crazy fancy stuff.\n\n995\n00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:41,160\nWe also have WDS,\nwe can load this image up\n\n996\n00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,360\ninto the Windows Deployment Server and\npush it out that way.\n\n997\n00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,910\n>> You have it here.\n\n998\n00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,898\nI think you still have an Explorer window\nin the background of that games folder.\n\n999\n00:52:50,898 --> 00:52:51,890\n>> Oh.\n\n1000\n00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:56,800\n>> So just you're in SQL and \\mount.\n\n1001\n00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,540\nBut you saw where mount was empty so\nit actually did dismount, so it's fine.\n\n1002\n00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,320\nNow as far as the test is concerned,\n\n1003\n00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,790\nwhat you'll normally do at this point\nis you've got the WIM file, right?\n\n1004\n00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:11,180\nAnd so if it's small enough\nyou can take a Windows PE\n\n1005\n00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:15,730\ndisk like the one we made earlier in\nthe show put this WIM file on it.\n\n1006\n00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,880\nGo to a computer,\nboot up off of that disk, and\n\n1007\n00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,310\nuse ImageX to reapply\nthe image to a new machine.\n\n1008\n00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,480\nSo ImageX,\nwhat we use to capture the image,\n\n1009\n00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,270\ncan be used to apply the image also.\n\n1010\n00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:31,540\nSo can dism, and in fact, in Windows 8 and\nhigher, you just use DISM for all of this.\n\n1011\n00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:35,610\nBut ImageX in Windows 7 is what we\nuse to capture and deploy the image.\n\n1012\n00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,740\nWDS is the slickest way to go about it.\n\n1013\n00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,910\nNate, you know we use that here\nin house for imaging machines.\n\n1014\n00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:42,660\nBut there are other things that we can do.\n\n1015\n00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,380\nAnd we're goIng to see some\nneat ways to apply it.\n\n1016\n00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,360\nNate, we've only got what,\nabout five minutes left in this segment.\n\n1017\n00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,260\nIs that enough time to show any of that,\nor\n\n1018\n00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,720\nshould we just wait\nuntil the next segment?\n\n1019\n00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,120\n>> Yeah, we can fire up a rebooted\nmachine and PXE boot it, and\n\n1020\n00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,890\njust start the process on that.\n\n1021\n00:53:58,890 --> 00:53:59,490\n>> Sure, sure.\n\n1022\n00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,020\n>> All right, well, sweet.\n\n1023\n00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:07,580\nSo we do have a virtual machine here that,\nwe'll reboot that guy and we'll\n\n1024\n00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,130\nsee that PXE image or that the picture\nboot, we're gonna push it off that way.\n\n1025\n00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,190\n>> Let me just talk\nvery briefly about PXE.\n\n1026\n00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:17,900\nIf you never heard of that, PXE,\nit's Pre-Execution Environment.\n\n1027\n00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,230\nAnd what it is is booting\na computer off of the network.\n\n1028\n00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:26,130\nMany computers have BIOS that supports\nloading their operating system\n\n1029\n00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,110\nfrom the network.\n\n1030\n00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:29,600\nAnd many computers have network\nadapters that support it too.\n\n1031\n00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,230\nYou kinda have to have both.\n\n1032\n00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:34,470\nIf you have both,\nthe computer can boot up and\n\n1033\n00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:38,020\nit can send out a broadcast message on the\nnetwork saying, hey is anybody out there?\n\n1034\n00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,248\nI need an operating system.\n\n1035\n00:54:40,248 --> 00:54:44,530\nAnd a PXE server that's listening for\nthis can capture that message and respond\n\n1036\n00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:48,810\nback and say, yep I'm here, I have an\noperating system for you, and off you go.\n\n1037\n00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:51,460\nIt's a key element for zero touch install.\n\n1038\n00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:55,118\nIt's even a key element for\nlight touch, and we use it here.\n\n1039\n00:54:55,118 --> 00:55:00,340\nTypically, that PXE server is going to\nbe Windows Deployment Services, or WDS.\n\n1040\n00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,600\nNow, we've already got WDS set up and\n\n1041\n00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,770\nyou don't really see a whole\nheck a lot of WDS on the exam.\n\n1042\n00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,750\nIf you wanna learn more about it, though,\n\n1043\n00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:11,040\nI really encourage you to\njump over to our 7411 show.\n\n1044\n00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,700\nIt's the Windows Server 2012 R2 exam, and\n\n1045\n00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,280\nwe show how to set up a WDS,\nand how to deploy and stuff.\n\n1046\n00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,340\nAnd really WDS under 2012 is pretty\nmuch the same as under 2008,\n\n1047\n00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,840\nnot much change there.\n\n1048\n00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,480\nBut it shows how to set that server\nup to respond to these requests.\n\n1049\n00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,980\nSo Nate's gonna fire up a machine and\ngrab an image from that.\n\n1050\n00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,110\nAnd this is an image that we've created\nusing the same techniques we've seen\n\n1051\n00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:34,620\nduring the show.\n\n1052\n00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:37,870\n>> All right, so\nI've got this machine right here,\n\n1053\n00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,570\nthis guy I loaded up right here.\n\n1054\n00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,618\nAnd what we'll do,\nwe'll just restart this guy.\n\n1055\n00:55:44,153 --> 00:55:48,706\nAnd as it restarts,\nit's gonna listen out for\n\n1056\n00:55:48,706 --> 00:55:53,042\nthat WDS server and\nto pull that image down.\n\n1057\n00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:56,194\nSo you can see right here, so\nit goes, it's now reaching out,\n\n1058\n00:55:56,194 --> 00:56:00,121\nit's getting that information And so now\nif we want to press a key to cancel it,\n\n1059\n00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:02,520\nwhich we don't, so\nwe won't press anything.\n\n1060\n00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,540\nAnd then it'll go down,\n\n1061\n00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:09,420\nand it'll pull down that, basically\nthat winPE that we created earlier.\n\n1062\n00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,147\nIt's gonna pull down a, yeah.\n\n1063\n00:56:11,147 --> 00:56:13,590\nSo, All right, yeah, pull that down.\n\n1064\n00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:15,732\nSo now we have a couple of choices here.\n\n1065\n00:56:15,732 --> 00:56:18,270\nAll right, we've got setup,\nwe've got a capture one.\n\n1066\n00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:21,110\nNow we used the image acts, Right?\n\n1067\n00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,540\nTo capture that sysprep image.\n\n1068\n00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,640\nNow, we don't have to use image X.\n\n1069\n00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,600\nWe could also use WDS to do that as well.\n\n1070\n00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:33,270\nSo if I, Windows 8 capture,\nthen if this machine was Sysprepped,\n\n1071\n00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,910\nthen we could capture it that way.\n\n1072\n00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:38,150\nOr we could just use our Windows 7 Setup.\n\n1073\n00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,850\nAnd as it starts, it'll pull that,\n\n1074\n00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:46,500\nyeah, file down and\nI guess continue on with our installation.\n\n1075\n00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:51,280\n>> Yeah, and when it's loading here if you\nlook boot-2-win, it's just pulling up that\n\n1076\n00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:57,890\nminor operating system that 200 MB Windows\nPE environment is gonna bring that up.\n\n1077\n00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:00,640\nBut WDS is gonna stick\na graphical user interface on it.\n\n1078\n00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,390\nSo instead of just giving\nus command line and\n\n1079\n00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,500\nleaving us to our own devices,\nthis one's gonna take us to a nice GUI,\n\n1080\n00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,480\nwhere we can pick what image we\nwant to deploy to our machine.\n\n1081\n00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,170\nThat's really the shining part of WDS,\nthat it really,\n\n1082\n00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:14,910\nit simplifies the whole environment.\n\n1083\n00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:18,800\nSo again, like I said,\nif you want to learn more about WDS,\n\n1084\n00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,860\ndefinitely jump over to the 7411 show.\n\n1085\n00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,770\nBut this one is firing up here,\nit's gonna boot up, and\n\n1086\n00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:26,010\nthen, how many Windows\n7 images do we have?\n\n1087\n00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:26,950\nDo we just Just have the one now?\n\n1088\n00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,310\nWe used to have several.\n\n1089\n00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:30,170\n>> I think there's three or four.\n\n1090\n00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:31,860\n>> Okay.\n>> On there to pick from.\n\n1091\n00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,180\n>> We have a couple,\nbased on what softwares installed.\n\n1092\n00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,290\nSome of them might have,\nthe Adobe Graphics Design Suite,\n\n1093\n00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,410\nother ones might have Microsoft Office.\n\n1094\n00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:43,240\nIt just kind of depends,\non what that workstation needs.\n\n1095\n00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,020\nSo we'll get that choice to pick\nbetween those here in just a moment.\n\n1096\n00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:49,720\n>> All right, so\nthere it goes, it's starting.\n\n1097\n00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,040\nYep, starting right on up there.\n\n1098\n00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,200\n>> Very exciting.\n\n1099\n00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,140\n>> I know.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1100\n00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,400\n>> There's so much anticipation.\n\n1101\n00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,300\nRight?\nI mean, you got the little blue donuts\n\n1102\n00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,210\ngoing and things are happening.\n\n1103\n00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:05,216\nIt's not incredibly fast because it is\nloading entirely off of the network.\n\n1104\n00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:06,039\nRight?\nRemember,\n\n1105\n00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:10,590\nyour hard-drives they are running usually\nat like six gigabytes per second.\n\n1106\n00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:12,590\nI think gigabytes per second.\n\n1107\n00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:17,226\nVersus our network that might only be one\ngigabit per second so definitely slower.\n\n1108\n00:58:17,226 --> 00:58:18,126\nAll right.\n\n1109\n00:58:18,126 --> 00:58:19,254\n>> So here we go.\n\n1110\n00:58:19,254 --> 00:58:25,090\nSo now, we're greeted with different\nimages that we want to install.\n\n1111\n00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:27,850\nAnd so we can just choose this\nWindows 7 service pack 1.\n\n1112\n00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:28,570\nRight?\n\n1113\n00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:32,400\nWe put on, enter, press enter onto that.\n\n1114\n00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,580\nNow notice that there's\nno other questions.\n\n1115\n00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,220\nRight?\n\n1116\n00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:41,370\nIt's now, it's waiting, and it will,\nas it waits to see if there's any other\n\n1117\n00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:44,344\nmachines that want to jump in on\nthe session, which there isn't.\n\n1118\n00:58:44,344 --> 00:58:45,292\n>> There it is.\n\n1119\n00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:46,700\nSo you're gonna start?\n\n1120\n00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,820\n>> And after it runs through all\nthe stuff it's just gonna reboot and\n\n1121\n00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,310\ndrop us straight up into Windows.\n\n1122\n00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:56,080\nAnd everything will be automatically\nconfigured, good to go.\n\n1123\n00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,160\n>> And this is a great example here\nof a light touch installation.\n\n1124\n00:58:59,160 --> 00:58:59,970\nWhat do we have to do?\n\n1125\n00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:01,680\nYou rebooted the machine.\n\n1126\n00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,890\nWhen it booted up,\nit booted from the network.\n\n1127\n00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:07,860\nAnd we pressed enter but\nit had actually defaulted to Windows 7 and\n\n1128\n00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,970\nhad a 30 second timer.\n\n1129\n00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:13,050\nSo within 30 seconds it would have booted\ninto the Windows 7 setup screen, and\n\n1130\n00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,070\nthen all we really had\nto do was pick an image.\n\n1131\n00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:15,930\nWe had that list.\n\n1132\n00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:18,770\nWe pick which which one and\nhit OK, and off it goes.\n\n1133\n00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:21,280\nIf you have system center\nconfiguration manager,\n\n1134\n00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,630\nyou can actually eliminate that too.\n\n1135\n00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:23,480\nYou can pre-stage it.\n\n1136\n00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,000\nYou can say, give this machine this image.\n\n1137\n00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,780\nAnd the next time that machine reboots,\nit automatically gets that image.\n\n1138\n00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,800\nSo really cool stuff, really automated.\n\n1139\n00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,200\n>> Yep, not the speediest process.\n\n1140\n00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,230\nI mean it is pulling\neverything over the network.\n\n1141\n00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,310\n>> And the VMs, hyper V.\n\n1142\n00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:43,310\nIf you guys ever work with hyper V\nthe network adapter in there that\n\n1143\n00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:46,110\ndoes pixie boot is not optimized for\nspeed.\n\n1144\n00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,540\nSo it's gonna be a little slower\nthere than a physical machine.\n\n1145\n00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,500\nA physical machine\nthough here in building,\n\n1146\n00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,390\nwe can deploy that same image\nto it in about 20 minutes.\n\n1147\n00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,590\nSo it's kinda nice.\n\n1148\n00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:57,620\nYou can have a complete, fresh,\nclean machine in about 20 minutes.\n\n1149\n00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,540\nSo that's nice.\n\n1150\n00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,330\nAll right,\nwell why don't we do this, Nate?\n\n1151\n01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,690\nWhy don't we stop here and take a break?\n\n1152\n01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:03,070\n>> Yep.\n>> And when we get back,\n\n1153\n01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:05,300\nwe're going to show manually\napplying that image.\n\n1154\n01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,540\nThat was kind of automatic there.\n\n1155\n01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,350\nWe'll show manually applying the image.\n\n1156\n01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:11,840\nAnd we're gonna take a look at that cool\nfeature we mentioned at the beginning of\n\n1157\n01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,300\nthe show, VHD, is the Virtual Hard Drives.\n\n1158\n01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,640\nRight?\nReally cool stuff there.\n\n1159\n01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,030\nSo stayed tuned.\n\n1160\n01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:20,974\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n1161\n01:00:20,974 --> 01:00:28,323\n[SOUND] All right, so we got a chance\nto see creating this image file and\n\n1162\n01:00:28,323 --> 01:00:33,151\nwe saw one way of way\ndeploying it using a WDS.\n\n1163\n01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:37,160\nAnother way is we could\nmanually apply using Image X.\n\n1164\n01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,560\nI mentioned that, too.\n\n1165\n01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,590\nBut we're gonna tie that\nin with our final topic for\n\n1166\n01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:44,140\nthe episode which is virtual hard drives.\n\n1167\n01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,280\nIn Windows 7 we got a new feature,\none that I really like,\n\n1168\n01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,990\ncalled Native Boot, or VHD Native Boot.\n\n1169\n01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:53,050\nSo, let's start with what VHDs are.\n\n1170\n01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,530\nSo, VHD stands for Virtual Hard Drive.\n\n1171\n01:00:55,530 --> 01:01:00,390\nAnd it's a technology that actually\ncame from Microsoft Virtual PC and\n\n1172\n01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:03,510\nMicrosoft Virtual Server,\nthey're old virtualization products.\n\n1173\n01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:06,880\nWhere they would take the entire\nhard drive for a machine, for a VM.\n\n1174\n01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,865\nAnd they would basically stuff\nits contents into a single file.\n\n1175\n01:01:10,865 --> 01:01:13,725\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Until you have a file called, whatever,\n\n1176\n01:01:13,725 --> 01:01:14,880\nharddrive.vhd.\n\n1177\n01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,160\nAnd inside of it were the contents of\nan entire virtual machine's hard drive.\n\n1178\n01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,840\nWell, Microsoft said,\nhey if we can do that for\n\n1179\n01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:25,320\na virtual machine,\nwhy not do it for a real machine?\n\n1180\n01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,510\nA physical machine.\n\n1181\n01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:30,200\nAnd so they made it where you can\nactually boot a physical laptop or\n\n1182\n01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,740\ndesktop up from the VHD.\n\n1183\n01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:36,870\nAnd when that system comes up it'll\nview the VHD as a real hard drive.\n\n1184\n01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:39,480\nThey just had to make a little\nchange to their storage drivers and\n\n1185\n01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,630\nthen knocked it right out.\n\n1186\n01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,430\nSo it's a cool feature.\n\n1187\n01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:44,210\nLet me tell you how you can use this.\n\n1188\n01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:47,990\nA lot of times when we do things\nlike dual booting operating systems,\n\n1189\n01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:50,740\nit requires either two\nphysical hard drives, or\n\n1190\n01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,950\nif you do it on one physical hard drive,\nyou have problems with bleed over.\n\n1191\n01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:56,700\nThings from one operating system\ntrickling into the other one.\n\n1192\n01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,340\nAnd you can cause problems there.\n\n1193\n01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:03,280\nWell with VHDs,\nyou can create two separate VHDs.\n\n1194\n01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,800\nOne that is completely\nisolated from the other.\n\n1195\n01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:10,370\nAnd when they boot up, they just see their\nhard drive, their virtual hard drive, and\n\n1196\n01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:13,260\nyou don't have any bleed over\nbetween the two systems.\n\n1197\n01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,760\nI used this for a long time.\n\n1198\n01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,340\nI use something different now,\nbut I used it for\n\n1199\n01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:21,840\na long time here in the studio because I\nhad my laptop that I used during the show,\n\n1200\n01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,600\nand my laptop I used after the show.\n\n1201\n01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:28,630\nThe one I used after the show had things\nlike Google Voice was installed on it.\n\n1202\n01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:32,470\nSo, I would get notifications about\nvoicemails and Google hangout messages,\n\n1203\n01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:34,300\nnew email notifications.\n\n1204\n01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,240\nI didn't want that stuff\nhappening during the show.\n\n1205\n01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,290\nRight?\nI didn't want to be in the show and\n\n1206\n01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,450\nall of a sudden I get these\npop ups on the screen.\n\n1207\n01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:44,030\nI also had things like my passwords and\nstuff that I didn't want on the show.\n\n1208\n01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:47,940\nAt the same time, I needed a nice,\nclean installation of Windows 7 or\n\n1209\n01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:50,200\nWindows 8 to be able to\nuse during the show, so\n\n1210\n01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:55,030\nthat people saw a typical install, not the\none that I had customized for my own use.\n\n1211\n01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:59,610\nSo I had two VHDs, and\nwhen I boot my computer up, it would\n\n1212\n01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:03,600\njust ask which one I wanted to boot from\nusing the standard Windows boot menu.\n\n1213\n01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,780\nSo I would pick the show virtual hard\ndrive, or I would pick the normal,\n\n1214\n01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,215\nthat's what I call them, show and normal.\n\n1215\n01:03:09,215 --> 01:03:09,850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1216\n01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:12,500\nI would pick those based on\nwhat it was that I was doing.\n\n1217\n01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:17,310\nVery handy, very useful and\nactually not very hard to do at all.\n\n1218\n01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:22,440\nReally, we just need to create a VHD file\nand we need to install Windows into it.\n\n1219\n01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,380\nAnd you can do that with\nthe default install image or\n\n1220\n01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,280\nwe'll use the image that we\njust made earlier in the show.\n\n1221\n01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,390\nSo instead of deploying that\nimage to a physical machine,\n\n1222\n01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,500\nwe're gonna deploy it to a VHD.\n\n1223\n01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,220\nThen we can add that as a boot\noption on our system and\n\n1224\n01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,210\nboot up off of it if we want to, or not.\n\n1225\n01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:39,420\nYou've got that flexibility and\nthat option.\n\n1226\n01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:40,050\nRight?\n\n1227\n01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:45,960\nSo, Nate, let's take a look at getting\na VHD built up and associated for boot.\n\n1228\n01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:46,520\n>> All right.\n\n1229\n01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,086\nSure thing, Don.\n\n1230\n01:03:47,086 --> 01:03:51,755\nSo, I [LAUGH] Sorry,\nI'm not sure ,I saw that funny.\n\n1231\n01:03:51,755 --> 01:03:54,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I'm on machine right here.\n\n1232\n01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,958\nSo, we've got a good old command prompt.\n\n1233\n01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:59,585\nSo, we're just gonna do all\nthe stuff from the command line.\n\n1234\n01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:05,180\nAll right, so\nthe tool that we need to use is diskpart.\n\n1235\n01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:08,060\nSo I'll just go ahead and\ntype in diskpart and enter.\n\n1236\n01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:11,970\nAnd it'll drop down to a little\ndiskpart little window little deal.\n\n1237\n01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:16,440\nAnd so what we'll do is we will say\ncreate a vdisk, a virtual disk.\n\n1238\n01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,810\nAnd the file, so\nwherever it is that we want to put it.\n\n1239\n01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:29,290\nAnd so we're going to put this\nin d:\\ima image or images, Don?\n\n1240\n01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:31,300\n>> It was image.\n\n1241\n01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,260\n>> Are you sure?\n\n1242\n01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,260\n>> I am.\n>> Oh, yes.\n\n1243\n01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:37,300\nOkay.\nd:\\image\\ and then,\n\n1244\n01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,360\nwhat should we call this?\n\n1245\n01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,240\nHow about just Windows 7?\n\n1246\n01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,650\n>> Sure.\n\n1247\n01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:44,550\n>> Dot VHD.\nAll right.\n\n1248\n01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,060\nAnd so that's what our VHD's gonna be\ncalled and we need to give it an assias.\n\n1249\n01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,050\nAll right?\n\n1250\n01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:58,476\nSo, we'll say maximum equals, and\nso we'll make it 30 gigabytes.\n\n1251\n01:04:58,476 --> 01:05:03,270\nSo we'll do 30720.\n\n1252\n01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:05,970\nAnd then what type of VHD?\n\n1253\n01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:09,790\nSo we can do a fixed size or\nan expandable size.\n\n1254\n01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:14,555\nA fixed size we'll go ahead and\nrake all 30 gigabytes at once and\n\n1255\n01:05:14,555 --> 01:05:17,255\nallocate that to our VHD.\n\n1256\n01:05:17,255 --> 01:05:20,225\nWe're gonna do an expandable\nwhich will grow\n\n1257\n01:05:20,225 --> 01:05:25,040\nwith the amount of data that we\nput in there up to 30 gigabytes.\n\n1258\n01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,270\nSo at first it could be pretty small.\n\n1259\n01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:29,210\nIt's like ten megs, something like that.\n\n1260\n01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:30,810\n>> It's not very big when it's empty.\n\n1261\n01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:37,520\n>> Yeah and then as we apply our image to\nit and install stuff to it, it will grow.\n\n1262\n01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:42,290\n>> The problem with dynamic growth is as\nit grows, the odds of the file becoming\n\n1263\n01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:45,540\nfragmented on the hard drive increases and\nthat can hurt performance.\n\n1264\n01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,030\nNow Nate you're running on an SSD.\n\n1265\n01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:50,050\nIs that D drive, is that SSD also?\n\n1266\n01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:53,300\nOkay, so on an SSD we don't worry so\nmuch about fragmentation,\n\n1267\n01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,370\nit doesn't have that\nsame performance profile.\n\n1268\n01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:58,810\nBut if this were a ceta disk,\nby doing, instead of expandable,\n\n1269\n01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:02,190\nby doing a fixed disc it would\nlay out all 30 gigs right now\n\n1270\n01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:06,600\nhopefully all into contiguous space,\nwhich will give us better performance.\n\n1271\n01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,980\nSo if this is a machine that you're\nconcerned about performance on,\n\n1272\n01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:13,650\nyou'll normally want to do that fixed\ndisk But if this is research or testing,\n\n1273\n01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:17,420\njust practice, or if you're on an SSD,\nyou can do expandable,\n\n1274\n01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:21,060\nyou'll save a lot of space and\nit makes the creation much, much faster.\n\n1275\n01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:23,830\n>> So there we go.\n\n1276\n01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:25,330\nSo it made that file.\n\n1277\n01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:31,460\nLet's jump over here and we'll go over to\nD and we stuck it in the image folder.\n\n1278\n01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:35,300\nAnd sure enough, and\nthere is our new VHD and wow.\n\n1279\n01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,420\n>> 62k, very small.\n\n1280\n01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:39,240\n>> 10mb I said, yeah, 62k, much smaller.\n\n1281\n01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,050\nSo now that I have it created,\nso now what we need to do\n\n1282\n01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:49,090\nis we want to select our vdisk, and\n\n1283\n01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:57,790\nfile equals d:\\Image\\windows7 7.vhd.\n\n1284\n01:06:57,790 --> 01:07:03,540\nRight, so we want to select this\nVHD file we want to work with.\n\n1285\n01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:07,580\nAll right, successfully selected,\ngood sign.\n\n1286\n01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:11,160\nSo now what we wanna do\nis attach The vdisk.\n\n1287\n01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,590\nAll right, so, attaching this vdisk,\nit's basically mounting, like mounting\n\n1288\n01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:22,800\na WIM image or attaching a VHD,\nsame thing, two different words.\n\n1289\n01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,460\n>> It would be the equivalent of\nplugging in a USB thumb drive.\n\n1290\n01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:28,020\nRight, so we just plugged in that VHD.\n\n1291\n01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:32,480\n>> All right, so now that this guy is\nattached, so now what we want to do is,\n\n1292\n01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,870\nwell, I mean, it's basically\njust a blank hard drive, right?\n\n1293\n01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:41,580\nSo we need to create a partition, and\nwe'll create a primary partition onto it.\n\n1294\n01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:43,480\nAll right.\n\n1295\n01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,370\nSuccessfully created.\n\n1296\n01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:45,020\nCool.\n\n1297\n01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,880\nSo now we need to give it a file system.\n\n1298\n01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,030\nAll right.\n\n1299\n01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,540\n>> This is where I normally cheat and\ngo to the disk manager and\n\n1300\n01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,220\ndo it from there, but it's nice to see\nthese command line entries because\n\n1301\n01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,259\nthey can show up on the exam.\n\n1302\n01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:58,490\nLet's give it a label.\n\n1303\n01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:01,510\nWe'll just, how about windows7vhd?\n\n1304\n01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:05,560\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n1305\n01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:08,979\nSo now we've formatted this guy, and\nthe last thing that we need to do,\n\n1306\n01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:15,330\nis give it a drive letter and so\nwe're gonna use v for virtual.\n\n1307\n01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:16,270\n>> Sure, easy to remember.\n\n1308\n01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,510\n>> There we go.\n\n1309\n01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:23,770\nNow what we should find\nis that hard drive.\n\n1310\n01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,980\nSo we could go back over here,\ngo into computer.\n\n1311\n01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:30,210\nSure enough, there we go,\nthere's our fresh and brand new VHD file.\n\n1312\n01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:32,010\nWe can see it's 30 gigabytes.\n\n1313\n01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:35,380\nI mean, not actually 30 gigabytes,\nbut Windows sees it as 30.\n\n1314\n01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:39,000\nAnd there's our little name and\nthe letter right there.\n\n1315\n01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,400\n>> So now we've got a blank hard drive.\n\n1316\n01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,230\nIf we were to try and boot off of that,\nwe're not gonna get very far, right?\n\n1317\n01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:48,310\nSo now we need to put an installation\nof Windows inside of it, and so\n\n1318\n01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:52,300\nwe're gonna deploy that Win file\nwe made last time into that VHD.\n\n1319\n01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:55,320\n>> All right, so the command to do that.\n\n1320\n01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:59,702\nIt's not in a disk part, so\nwe click on exit to fall back here.\n\n1321\n01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:02,620\nAll right and\nit's good old DISM, DISM tool.\n\n1322\n01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:08,310\nAnd with DISM, it is the apply dash image,\nthat's what we're wanting to do.\n\n1323\n01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:15,680\nImage file and\nthat is indeed colon slash image no s?\n\n1324\n01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:21,013\nimage\\win7\n\n1325\n01:09:21,013 --> 01:09:23,930\n>> pe.wim.\n\n1326\n01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:24,490\n>> Yeah?\n\n1327\n01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:25,190\nWas it?\n\n1328\n01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:26,700\nSorry Don.\n>> I was pretty certain.\n\n1329\n01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,030\nSo much doubt today.\n\n1330\n01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:30,180\n>> Yeah, win7pe.wim.\n\n1331\n01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:32,930\n>> You'd almost think I was\npaying attention this episode.\n\n1332\n01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:33,630\n>> Yeah, no doubt.\n\n1333\n01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:35,860\n>> As opposed to the other episodes where,\nwhen Nate's on camera,\n\n1334\n01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:38,325\nI'm over here with a Playstation or\nsomething.\n\n1335\n01:09:38,325 --> 01:09:44,690\n[LAUGH] All right, win7pe.wim.\n\n1336\n01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:49,870\nAnd then we need to give\nit an apply directory.\n\n1337\n01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:55,020\nAnd so\nwe're going to apply it to that VHD.\n\n1338\n01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:55,670\nSo v:\\.\n\n1339\n01:09:55,670 --> 01:10:00,085\nAnd I kinda looped over there right there.\n\n1340\n01:10:00,085 --> 01:10:05,980\nV:/, and\nthen we need to do index:1, right?\n\n1341\n01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:10,980\nSince there could be more\n[LAUGH] images within\n\n1342\n01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:15,278\nthat WIM file, but\nwe just had that one, so an image.\n\n1343\n01:10:15,278 --> 01:10:18,965\nIndex.1.\n\n1344\n01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:23,070\nApply image.\n\n1345\n01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:24,180\nApply image option unknown.\n\n1346\n01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:30,030\n>> So, what I think you are bumping\nup into Nate, is in Windows\n\n1347\n01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:34,850\n8 we use DISM to capture and\nto apply the images.\n\n1348\n01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:40,010\nBut in Windows 7 it was still mostly\nImageX driven and so depending on which\n\n1349\n01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:45,590\nversion of DISM you got from the automated\ninstallation toolkit, it may or may not\n\n1350\n01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:51,110\nhave that tag, so do a DISM slash question\nmark, and see if that one even shows up.\n\n1351\n01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:56,040\nAnd if it doesn't,\nwe may have to use ImageX to do it.\n\n1352\n01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:00,720\nSo, as you kind of skim through there and\nsee, like mount, unmount,\n\n1353\n01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:04,000\nremount, do you see the apply image?\n\n1354\n01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,300\nIt's confusing, cuz there's two\ndifferent versions of DISM out there.\n\n1355\n01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:13,930\nSo I don't see those syntaxes.\n\n1356\n01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:15,840\nSo we can just use ImageX to do it.\n\n1357\n01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,400\nIs ImageX in your path right now?\n\n1358\n01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:23,971\nOr you're in the [CROSSTALK],\nget into the IK directory.\n\n1359\n01:11:23,971 --> 01:11:29,340\nAnd we'll try it with\nthe good old ImageX command.\n\n1360\n01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,184\nYeah.\nJust do an ImageX slash question mark.\n\n1361\n01:11:34,184 --> 01:11:35,150\nMake sure it's there.\n\n1362\n01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:36,670\n>> Oh.\nYou know what?\n\n1363\n01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:37,360\nAll right.\nOkay.\n\n1364\n01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:39,280\n>> What's wrong?\n\n1365\n01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:39,810\n>> Oh, nothing.\n\n1366\n01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:44,740\nI think I'd use this one here\nto use that DISM command.\n\n1367\n01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:46,070\nInstead of my regular command prompt?\n\n1368\n01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:47,880\nMaybe, let's see.\n\n1369\n01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,190\n>> Well, copy and\npaste it, give it a shot.\n\n1370\n01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:52,290\n>> Let's see.\n\n1371\n01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:53,833\n>> Yeah, this is one thing,\nit's kinda frustrating.\n\n1372\n01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,662\nMicrosoft made some changes and,\n\n1373\n01:11:55,662 --> 01:11:58,510\nyou've watched the rest of\nthe show up to this point.\n\n1374\n01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:00,419\nSo you saw where we used\nImageX in the beginning and\n\n1375\n01:12:00,419 --> 01:12:02,750\nthen we used DISM just over and\nover and over again for stuff.\n\n1376\n01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:05,967\nSo, in Windows 8, they said,\nlet's just phase out Image X, and\n\n1377\n01:12:05,967 --> 01:12:07,640\njust do everything through DISM.\n\n1378\n01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:11,001\nAnd so they added a lot more functionality\nto the command than what we had\n\n1379\n01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:12,050\npreviously.\n\n1380\n01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:15,290\nSo, for those of you that are studying for\nboth Windows 7 and Windows 8,\n\n1381\n01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:16,348\nit does get confusing.\n\n1382\n01:12:21,328 --> 01:12:23,011\n>> V colon.\n\n1383\n01:12:29,931 --> 01:12:31,173\nLet's see, all right, nope.\n\n1384\n01:12:31,173 --> 01:12:33,250\n>> Okay, so let's do the old ImageX.\n\n1385\n01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:36,620\nDo an imagex/?,\njust to make sure it's in that path.\n\n1386\n01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:37,399\nI believe it is.\n\n1387\n01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:41,080\nPerfect, okay.\n\n1388\n01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:46,560\nSo you're going to run imagex/apply\n\n1389\n01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:51,356\nd:\\ima win7pe.wim space and\n\n1390\n01:12:51,356 --> 01:13:00,100\nwith ImageX you just specify\nthe index number all by itself.\n\n1391\n01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:00,830\nSo you just put one.\n\n1392\n01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:04,460\nAnd then you're gonna\nspecify where to install it,\n\n1393\n01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:08,550\nwhich is going to be V:/, all right.\n\n1394\n01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,840\nSo it kind of wrapped around there.\n\n1395\n01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,950\nSo, this is the ImageX command and\non the Windows 7 exam,\n\n1396\n01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:17,600\nthis is most likely what you're going to\nsee, because using DISM to capture and\n\n1397\n01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,660\napply images really didn't\nhappen until Windows 8.\n\n1398\n01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:22,132\nSo, just two different\nversions that are out there.\n\n1399\n01:13:22,132 --> 01:13:27,410\nAnd you can download the newer\nWindows 8 IAK and use it on Windows 7.\n\n1400\n01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:30,220\nThat's what makes it even more confusing,\nbut\n\n1401\n01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:33,280\nin this case we just didn't\nhave the one for that.\n\n1402\n01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,900\nSo this is going to apply that image\nright into that virtual machine.\n\n1403\n01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,690\nSo you can see it right there,\nthat command line, fairly straightforward.\n\n1404\n01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:44,790\nNow fortunately,\nNate is on a superfast SSD so\n\n1405\n01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:46,730\nthis is cruising along pretty quickly.\n\n1406\n01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:50,840\nIt's got about 10 gigs of data to write so\nit's moving along nice.\n\n1407\n01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,400\nOn your system it may take longer,\nespecially if the source data is\n\n1408\n01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,870\non a network drive or something like that,\nIt could take longer to apply.\n\n1409\n01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:02,140\nBut what it's basically doing here is\napplying that Windows 7 image that we\n\n1410\n01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:06,470\nbuilt earlier in the show, so it's\neffectively installing Windows along with\n\n1411\n01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:10,340\nthose updates and drivers and all the\nother things that we fed into the image.\n\n1412\n01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:14,380\nThey're going to be in there and\nthey're going to be a part of that VHD.\n\n1413\n01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:19,240\nNow, once the VHD is done we\ncan add it to our boot menu.\n\n1414\n01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,560\nSo, every time we boot,\nwe can choose to boot from that VHD.\n\n1415\n01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,390\nNow, one of the things that I really\nlike about using the VHD file like this.\n\n1416\n01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:28,580\nWell, let's say it's\ntime to buy a new laptop.\n\n1417\n01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:31,560\nYour old laptop is just getting too old,\nso you buy a new one.\n\n1418\n01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:36,420\nAll you have to do is copy this VHD over\nto the new machine, And now you can boot\n\n1419\n01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:38,830\nyour old OS with all your apps and\nstuff right off of the new machine.\n\n1420\n01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:42,220\nSuper easy to move your stuff\nfrom one system to another.\n\n1421\n01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:45,990\nSo pretty cool and\njust a neat feature to use.\n\n1422\n01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:48,710\n>> All right, sweet, so\nthank you for that, Don.\n\n1423\n01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:50,190\n>> Yep.\n>> For that ImageX command.\n\n1424\n01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:50,741\nSo there it goes.\n\n1425\n01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:54,253\nSo it has now applied and so\n\n1426\n01:14:54,253 --> 01:14:59,692\nwe'll get back into good old DiskPart.\n\n1427\n01:14:59,692 --> 01:15:03,203\nActually, we don't need to at this point\ncuz it should still be mounted and\n\n1428\n01:15:03,203 --> 01:15:03,800\nselected.\n\n1429\n01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,330\n>> Should be good.\n\n1430\n01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:06,500\nAnd let's take a look at something\nbefore we move too far, Nate.\n\n1431\n01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,830\nCan you browse through the image\nfolder and let's look at that VHD and\n\n1432\n01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:11,530\nsee what size it is, right?\n\n1433\n01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:14,500\nThe VHD was like 16k earlier.\n\n1434\n01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:19,068\nNow, if we look at it, the Windows7.VHD,\nit's grown to over 7 gigabytes, rIght,\n\n1435\n01:15:19,068 --> 01:15:22,380\ncuz it's now got a full\ncopy of Windows installed.\n\n1436\n01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:25,300\nIt's not 30 gigabytes,\nwhich is what we set the maximum to.\n\n1437\n01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,440\nBut, because it's dynamically expanding,\n\n1438\n01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:31,140\nit grew to encompass the files\nthat we just copied into it.\n\n1439\n01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:35,100\nAnd it's already mounted on our V drive,\nand that's where we need it if we're gonna\n\n1440\n01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,680\nbe adding it to our boot menu,\nso that's our next step.\n\n1441\n01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,200\n>> All right, so yep.\n\n1442\n01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,750\nSo, we don't need to get on DiskPart,\ncuz it is still attached.\n\n1443\n01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:48,711\nSo now, to add it to our boot menu,\n\n1444\n01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:54,910\nbcdboot, and then v:\\windows.\n\n1445\n01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:55,750\nThere we go.\n\n1446\n01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,635\nBoot files successfully created.\n\n1447\n01:15:57,635 --> 01:16:02,570\nAnd so now when we reboot this machine it\nwill then be prompted with the different\n\n1448\n01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:05,470\neditions of Windows basically\nthat it sees that we have, and\n\n1449\n01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:09,480\nwe can choose to boot into this one or\nour existing one.\n\n1450\n01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,120\n>> You know, Nate, the first time\nI ran this screen it blew my mind.\n\n1451\n01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,060\nI was like, wait a minute, BCDboot and\n\n1452\n01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:17,640\nI'm pointing it to v:/windows, that's the\nvirtual directory that it's mounted to.\n\n1453\n01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,350\nHow does it know, right?\n\n1454\n01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:21,900\nCuz doesn't it need to\nknow where the VHD is?\n\n1455\n01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:26,810\nWell, what it's actually doing is\ntaking that v:/ and it's looking\n\n1456\n01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:32,090\nat that disk mount and it recognizes\nthat it's a VHD file and it picks it up.\n\n1457\n01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:37,640\nNate just ran the BCDboot command\nwhich lists all of your boot OSs,\n\n1458\n01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,340\nand you'll see it in there, and\nit's listed as Partition=v: but\n\n1459\n01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:46,185\nit knows that it's a VHD, and it knows\nthat VHD is stored on the D drive.\n\n1460\n01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:47,290\nAnd when we boot the system,\n\n1461\n01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:51,319\nif we choose that menu option,\nit's going to boot off of that one.\n\n1462\n01:16:53,102 --> 01:16:57,960\nAll right, and so now the last thing that\nwe need to do is to detach this, I guess.\n\n1463\n01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:06,626\nAll right, and so for that one, right, so\nwe will get back into good old DiskPart.\n\n1464\n01:17:06,626 --> 01:17:12,184\nAll right, and the select v disk and\n\n1465\n01:17:12,184 --> 01:17:19,223\nfile, that guy is over in d:\\image\\win,\n\n1466\n01:17:19,223 --> 01:17:23,309\nwhat did we call it, Don?\n\n1467\n01:17:23,309 --> 01:17:26,131\n>> Win7pe., oh, no, no, no.\n\n1468\n01:17:26,131 --> 01:17:26,967\nI'm sorry.\n\n1469\n01:17:26,967 --> 01:17:32,133\nYeah, it was Windows 7 vhd, .vhd.\n\n1470\n01:17:32,133 --> 01:17:35,314\nDidn't we call it Windows 7 VHD?\n\n1471\n01:17:35,314 --> 01:17:36,690\nVHD is actually in the name.\n\n1472\n01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:38,020\nNo, I'm wrong this time.\n\n1473\n01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:42,030\nIt'll happen sooner or later.\n\n1474\n01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:46,357\n>> Select VHD file, select help disk.\n\n1475\n01:17:46,357 --> 01:17:55,830\nSo there, all right All right,\n\n1476\n01:17:55,830 --> 01:18:01,635\nmaybe we already did quotes on that.\n\n1477\n01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:03,295\n>> It doesn't want to help you, Nate.\n\n1478\n01:18:03,295 --> 01:18:04,015\n>> Nope.\n\n1479\n01:18:04,015 --> 01:18:08,780\n>> [LAUGH] Again, see,\nthis is where I kind of cheat.\n\n1480\n01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:09,830\nYou go into Disk Management.\n\n1481\n01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:11,180\nYou can right-click on it and\nchoose Detach.\n\n1482\n01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:15,180\nIt's a little bit easier [LAUGH] but\nseeing it from the command line is handy.\n\n1483\n01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:21,430\nWhat we're trying to do right now is\nwe're done modifying that disk, so we can\n\n1484\n01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:25,690\ndetach it, and when you boot up, you can\nstill boot from it while it's detached.\n\n1485\n01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:29,730\nThe reason we wanna detach it here is we\ndon't want this operating system that\n\n1486\n01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:33,185\nwe're booted into having access to\nthat other one unnecessarily, right?\n\n1487\n01:18:33,185 --> 01:18:36,590\nCuz you could accidentally delete some\nfiles, your antivirus could run and\n\n1488\n01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:38,000\nscan that v drive.\n\n1489\n01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,798\nYou could have various quirks like that so\nthat could be a problem.\n\n1490\n01:18:40,798 --> 01:18:46,330\n>> Yeah, so there's our disk,\nright, 30 gigabytes.\n\n1491\n01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:52,130\nIt sees it, not as a virtual disk, but\njust as that straight up disk right there.\n\n1492\n01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:58,250\nSo now we could use good old disk\nmanagement and detach it that way.\n\n1493\n01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:05,071\n>> Well, you should,\nIf you just run Detach, doesn't that\n\n1494\n01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:14,626\nSo it's not letting you select [LAUGH]\n\n1495\n01:19:34,257 --> 01:19:36,650\n>> Hm, selected it that time.\n\n1496\n01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:37,935\n>> And what did you do differently?\n\n1497\n01:19:37,935 --> 01:19:38,795\nI don't see anything-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1498\n01:19:38,795 --> 01:19:39,595\n>> Different there,\n\n1499\n01:19:39,595 --> 01:19:41,305\nfrom what you typed a minute ago.\n\n1500\n01:19:41,305 --> 01:19:45,140\n[LAUGH] Detach vdisk.\n\n1501\n01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:48,050\n>> There must have been a typo\nthat neither of us saw.\n\n1502\n01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:50,118\nThat's the exact command\nyou typed earlier.\n\n1503\n01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:53,292\nWell, anyhow, so you were able\nto select it and then detach it.\n\n1504\n01:19:53,292 --> 01:19:54,875\nThat doesn't mean that it's gone.\n\n1505\n01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:58,720\nIt just means that this OS that we're\nbooted into right now no longer has\n\n1506\n01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:02,583\na V drive, and so it no longer has\nvisibility inside of that, so, yep.\n\n1507\n01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:05,970\nThe V drive is gone, and\nmaybe you just have to run it three times.\n\n1508\n01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:08,020\nThat's it, the third time is the charm.\n\n1509\n01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,570\nWe'll have to play back\nthe footage on that and\n\n1510\n01:20:10,570 --> 01:20:12,071\nsee that there must have been a typo.\n\n1511\n01:20:12,071 --> 01:20:15,500\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it must have been a typo.\n\n1512\n01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:21,500\nSo now, back in the image file and\nsure enough there's our VHD.\n\n1513\n01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:26,440\nOn this PC area here now that we added\nit to the boot menu, we can reboot and\n\n1514\n01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:31,230\nboot from this VHD if we wanted or\nnow that it has been prepped,\n\n1515\n01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:34,750\nit's been loaded,\nwe can copy that to other machines,\n\n1516\n01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:38,290\nadd it to their boot menus, and\njust boot directly off this VHD.\n\n1517\n01:20:38,290 --> 01:20:42,570\n>> Yeah, and we did it to a VHD here, but\nin real life land we could have booted off\n\n1518\n01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:46,030\na Windows PE disk and applied that to\na physical hard drive just the same.\n\n1519\n01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:48,010\nSo you can apply that image over,\nand over, and\n\n1520\n01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,960\nover again to the systems in your network.\n\n1521\n01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,510\nEverybody will have a nice,\nconsistent deployment.\n\n1522\n01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:54,680\nSame OS, same app, same drivers.\n\n1523\n01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,850\nKeeps things nice and easy when it comes\nto troubleshooting and supporting.\n\n1524\n01:20:57,850 --> 01:21:01,770\nSo, all right, so some pretty\nadvanced ways to deploy Windows 7.\n\n1525\n01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:06,370\nYou guys can see, really nothing we\ncovered in this episode is great for\n\n1526\n01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:10,810\nhome users, but for corporate and\nenterprise users that are supporting large\n\n1527\n01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:14,660\nquantities of Windows 7 machines,\nthis stuff can really save some time and\n\n1528\n01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:19,226\nreally streamline your organization,\nso very cool stuff to work with.\n\n1529\n01:21:19,226 --> 01:21:24,180\n>> So Don, now that we have this VHD file,\nas far as servicing it,\n\n1530\n01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:28,790\nloading updates into it and\ndrivers, turning on and\n\n1531\n01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:33,610\noff features, the the process is\nthe same as if it was a WIM file.\n\n1532\n01:21:33,610 --> 01:21:38,610\nMount it or attach it and\nwhen you push up those DISM commands and\n\n1533\n01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:42,515\nstill we still service\nit just like the image.\n\n1534\n01:21:42,515 --> 01:21:46,360\n>> Yeah, if you wanna inject some drivers\ninto it, inject updates, or whatever.\n\n1535\n01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:50,340\n>> We don't normally have to do it\nbecause it's an OS that's ready to boot.\n\n1536\n01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,040\nIt's not like it's been generalized,\nright?\n\n1537\n01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:56,040\nIt's unique already and so\nit's easy enough to apply.\n\n1538\n01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,610\nBut if you want to service\nit is the same commands.\n\n1539\n01:21:58,610 --> 01:21:59,770\nVery convenient there, too.\n\n1540\n01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:01,710\n>> Yep.\n\n1541\n01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:02,580\n>> All right well Nate,\n\n1542\n01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:06,960\nI think that pretty much wraps up our\nobjectives here for deploying Windows 7.\n\n1543\n01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,870\nIt's pretty cool stuff.\n\n1544\n01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:11,890\nIt's the kind of stuff that most people\ndon't get a chance to work with so\n\n1545\n01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:13,240\nit's fun.\n\n1546\n01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:16,020\nKeep in mind\nthe Automated Installation Toolkit\n\n1547\n01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,470\nis a free download from\nMicrosoft's website.\n\n1548\n01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:23,340\nIt also includes a ton of documentation\nexplaining these exact processes and more.\n\n1549\n01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:26,900\nSo, if you want to write things like\nunattended answered files and try and\n\n1550\n01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:30,710\nachieve zero touch installation, which is\nkind of that Holy Grail of deployment,\n\n1551\n01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:33,460\nthey've got documentations that\nexplain how to do all of that.\n\n1552\n01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:36,490\nIt's not necessarily the most\nfascinating of reads, but\n\n1553\n01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:41,410\nit is good stuff and if you're\nwired like we are it's kinda fun.\n\n1554\n01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:43,375\n>> All right, Don.\n\n1555\n01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:46,580\nWell that's all I've got for\nrolling this stuff out.\n\n1556\n01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:47,550\n>> Excellent.\n\n1557\n01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:49,820\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\nlet me just remind everybody.\n\n1558\n01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:54,390\nIf you have any questions, live during the\nshow you can go to

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening, and\n\n5\n00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,796\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:39,796 --> 00:00:42,690\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\ntoday with Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,710\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,105\n>> I am shocked and\nsurprised this morning.\n\n9\n00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:46,610\n>> Uh-oh.\n\n10\n00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,450\n>> You and\nI were just looking at a news article and\n\n11\n00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,070\nwe saw the collaboration on an album.\n\n12\n00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,285\nThe Wu-Tang Clan and\nCher on a secret album.\n\n13\n00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:56,790\n[LAUGH]\n>> And sadly the most shocking part of\n\n14\n00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,181\nthat article is just the fact\nthat Cher is still alive.\n\n15\n00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:03,378\n[LAUGH] Or is this like a posthumous.\n\n16\n00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:04,961\n>> Yeah, who knows.\n\n17\n00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:06,128\nTo me the Wu-Tang Clan.\n\n18\n00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:07,503\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:08,670\n>> Is the shocking part on that one.\n\n20\n00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,517\n>> And the fact that they're still alive,\nyeah, good point.\n\n21\n00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:13,170\n[LAUGH] All right, well ladies and\n\n22\n00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,170\ngentlemen, we've got another episode\nof Windows 7 up ahead for us.\n\n23\n00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,550\nAnd boy we're moving into some\nreally interesting stuff.\n\n24\n00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,320\nThe first two episodes we focused on\njust getting Windows 7 installed.\n\n25\n00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,930\nAnd we got a chance to see that there's\na lot more than just popping a DVD in\n\n26\n00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,880\na drive, so\nwe got a chance to look at that.\n\n27\n00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,140\nToday we're gonna take a look at what we\ndo with our system after it's installed.\n\n28\n00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,830\nSo we've got Windows 7 up and running.\n\n29\n00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,340\nNow we need to get it either customized\nfor our current hardware or customized for\n\n30\n00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,480\nhow we're gonna be using\napplications on our network.\n\n31\n00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,560\nSo kind of some neat\nthings to jump through and\n\n32\n00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,090\nthis will be a good chance to see it.\n\n33\n00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,139\n>> Today, we're focusing in on the idea\nof configuring some basic hardware,\n\n34\n00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:57,061\nas well as the idea of application\ncompatibility as well to ensure that our\n\n35\n00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:00,878\napplications and our hardware can\nwork in the Windows 7 environment.\n\n36\n00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:03,290\nSo we'll be taking a look at\nthe idea of device drivers and\n\n37\n00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,220\nalso dealing with those issues and how do\nwe actually handle compatibility issues.\n\n38\n00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,810\n>> All right, well,\nlet's start off with device drivers,\n\n39\n00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,890\nbecause whenever I install Windows this\nis the first thing that I deal with..\n\n40\n00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,010\nMany, many computer out there have a, just\na wide variety of hardware configurations.\n\n41\n00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,460\nIf everybody has the same laptop,\nfor example, So here in our studio,\n\n42\n00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,200\nwe got several of these\nDell XPS 12 laptops, right?\n\n43\n00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,980\nWell if everybody has the same laptop,\nyou can create one Windows image that\n\n44\n00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,720\nhas the drivers necessary load\nit on there and be done with it.\n\n45\n00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,080\nBut what if everybody has different\nlaptops or desktops and whatever?\n\n46\n00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,610\nSo then you really start to have variety\nand it gets to be challenging to support.\n\n47\n00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,240\nSo when you format a machine and you\ninstall Windows, one of the things you've\n\n48\n00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,610\ngot to do is identify the hardware\nthat you're system has and\n\n49\n00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,270\nget the appropriate drivers for\nit, areight?\n\n50\n00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,110\nAnd so\nthat's a process that we go through.\n\n51\n00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,440\nNow when you get drivers, there's really\ntwo places you can get them from, or\n\n52\n00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,770\nI guess, let me clarify.\n\n53\n00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,170\nThere's two places you should get them\nfrom, everywhere else it's craziness.\n\n54\n00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,920\nBut one of the best places to\nget drivers from is straight\n\n55\n00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,050\nfrom Microsoft themselves.\n\n56\n00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,610\nMicrosoft has what's called the WDDM, and\n\n57\n00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,950\nlet me see if I can pull up the WHQL,\nhere we go.\n\n58\n00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,550\nSo Microsoft has what's called\nthe Windows Hardware Quality Labs, WHQL.\n\n59\n00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,470\nYou know, you would think you'd\ndo a Google search for WHQL and\n\n60\n00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,182\nit would turn up, but no, it really isn't.\n\n61\n00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,140\nWell anyhow,\n\n62\n00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,620\nWHQL, where Microsoft will take hardware,\nthey'll test it with Windows.\n\n63\n00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,020\nThey'll certify it as being valid and\nfunctioning within Windows.\n\n64\n00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,870\nAnd then they'll take the driver for\nit and build it into the operating system.\n\n65\n00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,350\nSo if you have hardware\nthat's been WHQL certified,\n\n66\n00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,970\nif it's been certified by Microsoft as\nbeing officially compatible with Windows,\n\n67\n00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,790\nyou may not need a driver at all.\n\n68\n00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,250\nWindows may just automatically pick it up,\nhave the drivers you need and\n\n69\n00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:04,960\nyou're in business.\n\n70\n00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,150\nThere's one problem with this.\n\n71\n00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,930\nThe WHQL process, the process for getting\na driver certified, is expensive and\n\n72\n00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,730\nit takes time.\n\n73\n00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,055\nIt takes a couple of months and\nit usually costs between $20 and\n\n74\n00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:20,504\n$40,000 per driver update.\n\n75\n00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:23,850\nSo every time they update the driver\nthey gotta go and get it recertified.\n\n76\n00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,300\nIt's a lot of money, all right, so\nthe HPs of the world, the Dells,\n\n77\n00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,450\nthose guys, yeah,\nthey're gonna get their stuff certified.\n\n78\n00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,750\nBut if you're dealing with hardware\nfrom smaller vendors, people who may be\n\n79\n00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,170\na little less known, then they're not\ngonna go through that crazy expense.\n\n80\n00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,220\nOr if you take somebody big,\nlike Nvidia, right?\n\n81\n00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,985\nThey release new video card drivers like,\nI get really frustrated,\n\n82\n00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,378\nthey release new video card\ndrivers like every three days.\n\n83\n00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:48,070\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n84\n00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,045\nthey're not gonna pay to have\nevery one of those certified, so\n\n85\n00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:56,620\nthey'll normally pick one every\nfew months and get it certified.\n\n86\n00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,060\nBut then there's little updates in-between\nthat aren't getting certified, so\n\n87\n00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,580\nif you want those, those you should\ngo directly to the hardware vendor.\n\n88\n00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,550\nYou've got an Nvidia video card,\ngo to Nvidia's website.\n\n89\n00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,560\nYou have a Dell laptop,\ngo to Dell's website.\n\n90\n00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,390\nYou have a Lenovo, go to Lenovo's website.\n\n91\n00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,950\nAnd they'll have where you can\ntype in your serial number and\n\n92\n00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,070\npull the drivers right from the vendor.\n\n93\n00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,970\nAll right, now, just because the driver is\nnot certified doesn't mean that it's bad.\n\n94\n00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,520\nIt just means that Microsoft\nhasn't signed off on it.\n\n95\n00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,690\nBut nobody knows that hardware better\nthan the vendor themselves and so\n\n96\n00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,109\nwe can typically trust the vendors.\n\n97\n00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,890\nOne problem that we had in\nthe last few years really is,\n\n98\n00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,930\npeople were writing malicious drivers.\n\n99\n00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,400\nThey'd take a driver and\nthey would put a malicious code in there..\n\n100\n00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,020\nKey stroke monitors, you know,\ncall backs, remote back doors,\n\n101\n00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,744\nthings like that into a driver.\n\n102\n00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:51,291\nThen they would release\nthat on the internet,\n\n103\n00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,503\nand say, oh, this is an optimized\nATI video card driver.\n\n104\n00:05:54,503 --> 00:05:55,680\n>> People would download it.\n\n105\n00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,760\n>> Absolutely, people do whatever they\ncan to eke out that performance, right?\n\n106\n00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,100\nWell the problem is when you\nload a driver in Windows,\n\n107\n00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,040\nit's running in what's\ncalled kernel space.\n\n108\n00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,590\nIt's running with direct access to\nthe operating system and the hardware,\n\n109\n00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,080\nbecause that's what it's got to do.\n\n110\n00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,350\nSo when you have software running at\nthat level it has access to everything.\n\n111\n00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:22,270\nSo it is the perfect place for malware,\nspyware, virus activity and whatever.\n\n112\n00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,040\nSo you should never trust drivers\nobtained from a third party.\n\n113\n00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,040\nMicrosoft and the hardware vendor,\nthose are the two people you should trust.\n\n114\n00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,380\nAnybody else you really\nshouldn't run the drivers.\n\n115\n00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,020\n>> Yeah.\n\n116\n00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,240\nA lot of times with this,\nespecially if you're new to this, right,\n\n117\n00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,900\nis that from Microsoft they tend to\nalso put a digital signature on it.\n\n118\n00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,455\nSo if anybody does modify it,\nonce again, they can prove that, hey,\n\n119\n00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:47,855\nthis didn't come from them.\n\n120\n00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:51,255\nSomebody else has played around with this,\nand so don't trust that particular vendor,\n\n121\n00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:54,005\nso just kind of realize that too,\nor that particular site.\n\n122\n00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:56,325\n>> And that digital signature\nthat Ronnie mentioned,\n\n123\n00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:59,815\nthat's a requirement\nnow on the 64-bit OSs.\n\n124\n00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:02,845\nSo if you're running a 64\nbit version of Windows 7,\n\n125\n00:07:02,845 --> 00:07:06,505\nall of your drivers have\nto be digitally signed.\n\n126\n00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:09,125\nIf they're not digitally signed,\nWindows won't let you install it.\n\n127\n00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:13,130\nNow, you can override that, right,\nthere's always a way to override things.\n\n128\n00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,760\nAnd so you can force in an unsigned\ndriver, but it's not recommended.\n\n129\n00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,270\nAnd you should only do that if\nyou absolutely have no choice.\n\n130\n00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,040\nTypically, the only people doing that\nare the people developing the drivers.\n\n131\n00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,620\nBecause they'll run them unsigned\nuntil they finish the driver and\n\n132\n00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,280\nthen they'll digitally sign it.\n\n133\n00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,400\nSo when you go out and you get third party\nsoftware that ties into a driver somehow,\n\n134\n00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,350\nyou may see it, they digitally signed it.\n\n135\n00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,890\nNow that digital signature just ensures\nthat the driver wasn't tampered with.\n\n136\n00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,220\nThey could have signed it after putting\nvirus activity in there themselves.\n\n137\n00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,570\nYou know, they could have done that, so\n\n138\n00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,220\nyou still have to trust the vendor,\ntrust who made that driver.\n\n139\n00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,840\nAt the end of the day that's\nkind of what it comes down to.\n\n140\n00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,877\nSo that digital check that happens,\n\n141\n00:07:51,877 --> 00:07:55,960\nwhere it examines to make sure those\ndrives are digitally signed and all.\n\n142\n00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,050\nThat happens all the time and\nit is the default inside of Windows.\n\n143\n00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,973\nAnd, it's not on the exam Ronnie, but\nshould we show how they bypass, well,\n\n144\n00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:07,816\nbypassing it's not something we should do.\n\n145\n00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:11,485\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe, here, you know what, let me,\n\n146\n00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:14,073\nthere's a couple of neat things.\n\n147\n00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:14,677\n>> Yeah.\n\n148\n00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:17,960\n>> I'm trying to think of what would\nshow up on the exam and what wouldn't.\n\n149\n00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,040\nThere is one command we can run\n\n150\n00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,010\nto check the digital signatures\nof our drivers in Windows 7.\n\n151\n00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,682\nAnd let me just see if I\ncan find it real quick.\n\n152\n00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:30,132\nDo you know it offhand, Ronnie?\n\n153\n00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:34,506\nThere's a command you run, and it scans\nall the drivers already on your system,\n\n154\n00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:36,770\nto make sure they're digitally signed.\n\n155\n00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,660\nWhich you know really\nthey should already be.\n\n156\n00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,390\n>> Driver query?\n\n157\n00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,210\n>> Yeah, I'm going to have to\nlook it up during the break, but\n\n158\n00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:49,240\nif you want to disable the driver,\nthe digital signature checking.\n\n159\n00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,630\nIf you want to disable that.\n\n160\n00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,410\nIt's actually a modification you have\nto make to Windows at boot time, and\n\n161\n00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,750\nboy does it get angry at you.\n\n162\n00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,990\nIt puts little watermarks on your screen,\nand it lets you know, hey,\n\n163\n00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,380\nthis is not something you should do.\n\n164\n00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,670\nSo, if we do Windows 7 disable driver,\nsignature enforcement, there we go.\n\n165\n00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,230\nAll right.\n\n166\n00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,800\nSo you'll find articles out there on the\nInternet, and notice when I did a search,\n\n167\n00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,310\nnormally when I search for a technical\nterm like this I get Microsoft Technet\n\n168\n00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:21,060\narticles, I get Paul Thurrott's Windows\nsuper site, reputable sites.\n\n169\n00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,250\nBut when I search for something like this,\ndisabled driver signature enforcement.\n\n170\n00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,130\nI'm not getting nice official sites.\n\n171\n00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,160\nI'm getting social.technet.\n\n172\n00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,710\nThis is a forum post, you know this is not\nsomething that Microsoft recommends and\n\n173\n00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,330\nthat's why I say it's\nnot really on the exam.\n\n174\n00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,010\nBut basically you have a couple of\ncommands that you can run to disable that.\n\n175\n00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,860\nThat's assuming the site even loads,\nthere we go.\n\n176\n00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,138\nThat you can do to disable that and\nkind of get around it or whatever.\n\n177\n00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:50,570\nBut you'll see where a lot of\npeople tell you not to do it and\n\n178\n00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,756\nthat's really a good idea.\n\n179\n00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:54,970\nHere they're using a third party\nsoftware to do it, EasyBCD.\n\n180\n00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,940\nThat's a third party program.\n\n181\n00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,740\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n182\n00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,340\nIn Windows 7 64 bit,\ndigital drivers are required.\n\n183\n00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,520\nIn 32 bit, they aren't and that's just for\n\n184\n00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,300\nbackwards compatibility cuz Microsoft\ndidn't require that in previous OSs.\n\n185\n00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,480\nSo it's an extra security\nfeature that we have.\n\n186\n00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,030\nRight.\n\n187\n00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,728\nSo, when we load a driver first thing we\nneed to is we need to get the driver.\n\n188\n00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:19,530\nIf Microsoft has already\ncertified it then great,\n\n189\n00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,920\nit's already in Windows we\ndon't have to get a driver.\n\n190\n00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,750\nBut, if we want the latest edition of that\ndriver we'll probably have to go to our\n\n191\n00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,440\nhardware vendor.\n\n192\n00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,700\nI mentioned Dell for example.\n\n193\n00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,750\nIf I have a Dell XPS 12, then what I\nwould do is I would go to Dell's website.\n\n194\n00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,310\nI'm just going straight\nto support.dell.com.\n\n195\n00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,740\nAnd you come in here.\n\n196\n00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,780\nAnd if you have your serial number,\nyou can punch it right in there.\n\n197\n00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,870\nIf you're actually on that device,\nyou can detect your hardware or\n\n198\n00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,030\nyou can just go down here and\nbrowse and find it.\n\n199\n00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:54,500\nI'll do a laptop and XPS and XPS 12.\n\n200\n00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,730\nAnd, there we go.\n\n201\n00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,210\nAnd when it comes up, it's gonna offer\nyou some stuff, I wanna get drivers and\n\n202\n00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,920\ndownloads.\n\n203\n00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,850\nAnd it's in here that we can tell\nit whether we're running, oh,\n\n204\n00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,840\nyou know that laptop didn't ship with\nWindows 7, so it's not an option.\n\n205\n00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,050\nI have to pick like an older laptop.\n\n206\n00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,020\nYou'd pick your OS that you wanted.\n\n207\n00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,110\nI'll say Windows 8 even\nthough it's Windows 7.\n\n208\n00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,870\nThen, here's all your drivers down here.\n\n209\n00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,420\nWe'll see chip set, video card, and so on.\n\n210\n00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,840\nYou download the drivers and\nyou install that, right?\n\n211\n00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,470\nSo, fairly straight forward process.\n\n212\n00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,060\nThe more hardware you have,\nthe more drivers you may have to\n\n213\n00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,290\nload though depending on what Windows\nautomatically detects and what they don't.\n\n214\n00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,650\n>> Now the nice thing about going\nto a site like this especially from\n\n215\n00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,540\nthe manufacturer is since they\nalready have your serial number,\n\n216\n00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,780\nthey literally can pinpoint the exactly\nthe hardware that is on your computer.\n\n217\n00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,230\nThat really does help because\nsometimes you will get\n\n218\n00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,620\njust a little bit of a difference\nin terms of hardware.\n\n219\n00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,330\nYou pick the generic one that's wrong.\n\n220\n00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,890\nYou again have to be able to\ntake care of that as well.\n\n221\n00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,220\nSo by being able to go directly to the\nmanufacturer and seeing what they actually\n\n222\n00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,330\noffer Is probably the best way for\nus to keep our machines up to date.\n\n223\n00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,680\n>> Yeah.\n>> With the stuff.\n\n224\n00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,480\n>> So when we get a driver like this and\nthis is what happens to me.\n\n225\n00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,190\nWell let's use that XPX 12 as an example.\n\n226\n00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,820\nIt's got integrated Intel graphics so\n\n227\n00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,400\nthe video card inside of it is\njust an Intel 4000 or something.\n\n228\n00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,310\nActually I can probably find it\nhere since I'm on the driver page.\n\n229\n00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,830\nLet's go down to video.\n\n230\n00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,600\nAnd it's an Intel 4000, there we go,\nHD Graphics 4000 Driver.\n\n231\n00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,440\nWell, Intel makes that graphics adapter,\nit's actually part of the chip set, and\n\n232\n00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,190\nthey release updates for\nit pretty regularly, although this one\n\n233\n00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,400\nsays last updated December 10,\n2013, so it's not that regular.\n\n234\n00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,090\nThat's over six months ago.\n\n235\n00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,480\nSo it's been a little\nwhile since it's updated.\n\n236\n00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,880\nBut, that doesn't mean that\nthe official Microsoft one,\n\n237\n00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,310\nthe one that they got certified\nwith Microsoft has been updated.\n\n238\n00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,270\nSo, when you fire up Windows,\n\n239\n00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,630\nWindows has the Intel HD Graphics\n4000 driver built into it.\n\n240\n00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,420\nSo, it's just gonna load that.\n\n241\n00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,320\nAnd, you can run that, that's fine.\n\n242\n00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,800\nBut, there's some 3D features,\nand things like that,\n\n243\n00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,190\nthat weren't in the driver that\nwas certified by Microsoft.\n\n244\n00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,520\nAnd so, if I download it from here,\nI'll get an even newer one.\n\n245\n00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,030\nAnd then notice how this one is\nlike version 9.17 blah, blah, blah.\n\n246\n00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,930\nIf I go to Intel's website, I might\nbe able to find something even newer.\n\n247\n00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,660\nSo, Dell made the laptop, and\nthey're hosting drivers for\n\n248\n00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,520\nit, but Intel made the chip\nthat has that graphics driver.\n\n249\n00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,290\nAnd so if I go in here and let's see\nif I can't find a driver for that one.\n\n250\n00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,816\nWe'll browse.\n\n251\n00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:35,953\nAnd that was an HD4000?\n\n252\n00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:37,230\n>> Yes.\n\n253\n00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:43,380\n>> So, trying to think is it written all\ntogether, so let's do a quick search.\n\n254\n00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,500\nAnd we'll say,\nI think I was looking at Windows 8 so\n\n255\n00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,380\nI'll just stick with that\nto go apples to apples.\n\n256\n00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,070\nHere we go.\n\n257\n00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,760\nSo Intel Iris and Intel graphics adapter.\n\n258\n00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,260\nNotice that version number 15.33 or\n\n259\n00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,970\nthey've got a different\nrevision number here of 10.18.\n\n260\n00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,400\nThat's probably in line with the Dell one.\n\n261\n00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,800\nSince the Dell one was 9.17.\n\n262\n00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,607\nAnd then notice release date January 29,\n2014.\n\n263\n00:14:08,607 --> 00:14:12,600\nSo, that's two months after\nthe one that Dell has.\n\n264\n00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,390\nSo, Dell has one that's two months older.\n\n265\n00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,390\nSo, Microsoft Windows has one built in.\n\n266\n00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,950\nDell has a newer one.\n\n267\n00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,720\nAnd then Intel has the newest one.\n\n268\n00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,660\nSo three different places that I can pick.\n\n269\n00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,910\nAnd if I want the latest, greatest,\ncutting edge features or whatever,\n\n270\n00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,740\nI'll probably get it straight from Intel,\nright?\n\n271\n00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,270\nBut if I want the one I know my\nhardware manufacturer will support\n\n272\n00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,320\nI'll go with Dell, and get it from there.\n\n273\n00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,400\nIf I just don't want to load drivers and\nI don't care about 3D performance and\n\n274\n00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,520\nstuff like that, then I may stick with\nthe one that came from Microsoft.\n\n275\n00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,380\nKnowing that the one from Microsoft\nis going to have the least amount of\n\n276\n00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,140\nfeatures, but\n\n277\n00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,808\nit's also going to be the most stable\nof the drivers that are available.\n\n278\n00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:59,450\nAll right, so Ronnie, let's say that we\nwant to install a driver in a system.\n\n279\n00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,060\nYou got a demo for us, right?\n\n280\n00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,940\n>> Yep.\n>> And there's\n\n281\n00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,380\nproblems that can happen too, right?\n\n282\n00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,160\nSo, Windows has certain protections\nbuilt in to help us recover from\n\n283\n00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,300\ndriver problems and\nRonnie's gonna show us some of that.\n\n284\n00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,760\nAnd let's jump over to your machine.\n\n285\n00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,520\n>> Yeah.\n\n286\n00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,060\nSo, over on my machine here.\n\n287\n00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,950\nI've just got Windows 7 running.\n\n288\n00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,710\nSo let's say that we\njust wanted to install,\n\n289\n00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,830\nthis is where we might run\ninto some issues, right?\n\n290\n00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,760\nThe idea of older device drivers\nthat might actually be out there.\n\n291\n00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,100\nNow I didn't, to tell you the truth\nit was unusual in Windows 7,\n\n292\n00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,310\nI tried to go on and find an older driver\nthat just wouldn't work in Windows 7 and\n\n293\n00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,310\nit was amazing that all of\nthe drivers actually came up to this\n\n294\n00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:41,310\nunusual phrase that said, your machine\nhas a newer driver than this one.\n\n295\n00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,440\nAnd so, in other words, the Windows\n7 drivers had already updated it.\n\n296\n00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,000\nBut in terms of installing a driver here,\nokay?\n\n297\n00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,655\nIf I wanna go ahead and do that,\n\n298\n00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:56,590\nI'm gonna click on Start > Computer,\nright-click, and Manage.\n\n299\n00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:02,250\nAnd what we're looking for, of course,\nis the Device Manager here.\n\n300\n00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,489\nSo inside of Device Manager for us,\n\n301\n00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:07,790\nwe have the ability to\ninstall hardware directly.\n\n302\n00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,270\nOr a lot of times if you're\ngoing to the website of course,\n\n303\n00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,420\nyou can actually download that and\nrun the actual executable from there or\n\n304\n00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,850\nthe installer from there.\n\n305\n00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,890\nBut another way to do this is to\nright click on CL6 up here and\n\n306\n00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,570\nthen go to Add Legacy Hardware.\n\n307\n00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,140\nFrom there, if you do have a driver that\nhas not been recognized by Plug 'n Play\n\n308\n00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,470\nautomatically, you can now\nuse this Add Hardware feature\n\n309\n00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,710\nthat allows you to actually do this and\nit says.\n\n310\n00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,910\nHere, it gives you a nice little warning.\n\n311\n00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,695\nif your hardware came with an installation\nCD it's recommended that you cancel this\n\n312\n00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:42,373\nand use that one, so you actually do have\ndrivers that come along with your devices\n\n313\n00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:43,676\nthat you're attaching in.\n\n314\n00:16:43,676 --> 00:16:47,298\nThat is recommended, and I'm just\ngonna go ahead and click next here.\n\n315\n00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:50,905\nAnd then I could try to search for\nthe hardware that's on this machine since\n\n316\n00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:54,240\nI'm in a virtual machine,\nit's not going to really find a lot here.\n\n317\n00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,881\nI'm going to install hardware,\nthat I select manually from a list, and\n\n318\n00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:03,156\nthen I have a list of these older drivers,\nthat are actually here.\n\n319\n00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,130\nNow we can go down here, lets say.\n\n320\n00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:11,237\nSome sound cards and\nvideo controllers there.\n\n321\n00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:15,550\nAnd in a moment it's going to actually\ngive me a list of these different drivers.\n\n322\n00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,850\nNow this is actually quite nice\nbecause it actually does tell you\n\n323\n00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,440\nthat this driver has actually\nbeen signed digitally for us.\n\n324\n00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,849\nSo we know that Windows has\ntested this stuff out here.\n\n325\n00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,750\nBut I may not have some of these\nparticular components on my machine.\n\n326\n00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,281\nLet's see if it will actually\nlet me install one of these.\n\n327\n00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:35,460\nSo I'm gonna select those,\nhow do you pronounce, Hauppauge.\n\n328\n00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,174\n>> We had this big debate in an episode.\n\n329\n00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:39,393\n>> [LAUGH] It was like Hauppauge-\n>> Hauppauge, Hauppauge.\n\n330\n00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:39,997\n>> Is how you actually pronounce it.\n\n331\n00:17:39,997 --> 00:17:40,787\n>> It was something weird, yeah.\n\n332\n00:17:40,787 --> 00:17:42,110\n>> So yeah, whatever it might be here.\n\n333\n00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,262\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm going to just take one of these\n\n334\n00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:47,799\nmodels here and then click next.\n\n335\n00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:53,750\nAnd then go ahead and\nlet it try to install the driver here.\n\n336\n00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,700\nIt's, again, copying it into\nthe driver store at this point, and\n\n337\n00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,580\nthen it will actually try to\ninstall it into the machine.\n\n338\n00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,465\nAnd oh, look at that, it looks\nlike it's having an issue already.\n\n339\n00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:07,225\n>> [LAUGH] Your machine's locked up.\n\n340\n00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:10,170\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n341\n00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,010\nThere we go.\n\n342\n00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,060\nBy doing this, right, it actually\ndid lock me out of the machine here,\n\n343\n00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,810\nbecause I tried to install this video\ndriver here that it didn't like.\n\n344\n00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,060\n>> So, was that an additional video\ncard driver, or was that the main one?\n\n345\n00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,350\n>> No, that was an additional one,\nit's supposed to be.\n\n346\n00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,000\n>> So we're running this\nin a virtual machine, and\n\n347\n00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,540\nthat means we're remotely displaying.\n\n348\n00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,960\nAnd when you add a video driver, well\nit's modifying the video subsystem, so\n\n349\n00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,260\nit's kind of kicked him out.\n\n350\n00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,720\nAnd what you'll probably\nhave to do at this point,\n\n351\n00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,400\nthe machine's locked,\ngive it the old reboot, right?\n\n352\n00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,350\nSo now,\nwe are kinda faced with a neat situation,\n\n353\n00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,310\nbecause the machine, well,\nit's neat if it's a test machine.\n\n354\n00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,565\nIf not's neat if it's\nyour personal machine.\n\n355\n00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:52,780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the video card's messed up.\n\n356\n00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,860\nIf you can't see the machine,\nhow are you supposed to fix it, right?\n\n357\n00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,340\nWell, in Window's we've got a number\nof different methods for doing that.\n\n358\n00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,780\nIt may be as simple as\nrebooting the machine.\n\n359\n00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,050\nReboot the machine, everything's fine.\n\n360\n00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,910\nIf it isn't, though,\nwhen you reboot Windows 7,\n\n361\n00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:14,080\nbefore the Windows logo shows up on the\nscreen we can tap F8 on the keyboard and\n\n362\n00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,490\nthat will get us our system startup menu.\n\n363\n00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,650\nAnd you can choose in there to boot, well,\n\n364\n00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,440\nI guess you really have two options,\nright?\n\n365\n00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,530\nYou could go safe mode,\nthat's the one I always think of, like oh,\n\n366\n00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,960\njust put it into safe mode.\n\n367\n00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,310\nSafe mode will load very\nlimited drivers and\n\n368\n00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,760\nno applications to allow you to get into\nWindows and try and fix the problem.\n\n369\n00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,280\nBut there's also a second option\ncalled VGA mode specifically for\n\n370\n00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,630\nvideo card issues.\n\n371\n00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,770\nAnd, if we choose to boot into VGA mode,\nit will boot up Windows with the old,\n\n372\n00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,440\nwhat is it,\nit's like a 640 by 480 resolution.\n\n373\n00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,530\nI think it's 800 by 600 now,\nand real low-color depth.\n\n374\n00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,050\nJust a very, very basic video card\ndriver to get you in the system so\n\n375\n00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,120\nyou can repair the problem, all right.\n\n376\n00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,030\nVideo card drivers,\nare always really sensitive about this.\n\n377\n00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,880\nIf you can't see the machine,\nit's really hard to fix it,\n\n378\n00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,344\nso that's why Windows has\nthat extra little step.\n\n379\n00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:06,199\nIf this were something like a mouse\ndriver, it would be a different story.\n\n380\n00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:08,752\nMouse driver,\nyou could at least see the computer and\n\n381\n00:20:08,752 --> 00:20:12,167\nstill use your keyboard to fix it,\nand so we've got other tools there.\n\n382\n00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:16,830\nSo there's a lot of different options for\nhow we can fix a bad driver install.\n\n383\n00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,540\nAll right, so\ndid you give the machine the old reboot?\n\n384\n00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,180\n>> I did and there we go.\n\n385\n00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,120\nHoping that we actually got to this\nscreen right here, is what I was hoping.\n\n386\n00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,470\nSo at this point,\n\n387\n00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,320\nremember that we actually did\nhave some different options here.\n\n388\n00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,260\nI loaded in a driver that was wrong.\n\n389\n00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,490\nThe nice thing is Windows 7 caught it and\n\n390\n00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,725\nsaid look,\nI don't like what you're doing, Ronnie.\n\n391\n00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:42,996\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm going to reboot,\n\n392\n00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:43,948\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n393\n00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:45,341\n>> And essentially kick you out.\n\n394\n00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:47,640\nWell, Don mentioned several options.\n\n395\n00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,959\nThe ones that we can actually do here,\nis go to safe mode.\n\n396\n00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,983\nIf it lets me get in, well,\nthen I know I can do it,\n\n397\n00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:57,160\nI can uninstall the actual driver.\n\n398\n00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:02,872\nSo it's gotta actually load up\nthe basic drivers for Windows 7 here.\n\n399\n00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:06,527\nAnd this is where it's loading in that\nmost basic driver that should give me\n\n400\n00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:08,165\nthe ability to get right in here.\n\n401\n00:21:11,346 --> 00:21:11,950\n>> Eventually.\n\n402\n00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,181\n>> Eventually.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n403\n00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:13,901\n>> It does take a moment.\n\n404\n00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:18,302\n>> It is a very verbose startup process,\nso t's showing every single file that\n\n405\n00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:21,940\nit's loading and\neventually getting us into that safe mode.\n\n406\n00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,223\nThis is a common thing with drivers, well,\n\n407\n00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:28,330\nno, the common thing is that they work\ngreat and we don't have an issue.\n\n408\n00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,187\nBut we need to be aware of what to\ndo when you do you have an issue.\n\n409\n00:21:32,187 --> 00:21:36,056\n>> Sometimes uninstalling the driver,\nwhen you actually load in the wrong one,\n\n410\n00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:38,061\nis actually something that can happen.\n\n411\n00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:43,053\nThe good thing is it didn't lock me out\nto the point where I can't at least see\n\n412\n00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,934\nthe operating system here.\n\n413\n00:21:44,934 --> 00:21:48,027\nSo by loading in the most basic driver,\n\n414\n00:21:48,027 --> 00:21:52,828\nthen what I have to do is really\ngo back in and uninstall this.\n\n415\n00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:56,961\n>> Yeah, and notice the screen\nresolution is much, much smaller now.\n\n416\n00:21:56,961 --> 00:21:58,517\nThere's watermarks on the screen.\n\n417\n00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:01,001\nSee how it says safe\nmode in all four corners?\n\n418\n00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:04,833\nIt's letting us know that\nthis is not a full Windows.\n\n419\n00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:08,641\nAnd it is Windows running, but it not\nreally loading all of your software.\n\n420\n00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:13,260\nIt's very limited so that you can test and\nfix your problem, right?\n\n421\n00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,820\nSo we had that bad driver and so we should\nbe able to go into our device manager and\n\n422\n00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,670\nsort it out.\n\n423\n00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,440\nNow, if you were adding hardware\n\n424\n00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,610\nthen it could be as simple as\njust removing that hardware.\n\n425\n00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,470\nBut if you were updating the driver, so\n\n426\n00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,070\nyou had an old version of\nthe driver that worked fine and\n\n427\n00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,809\nyou updated to a new version of\nthe driver and now it's all broken.\n\n428\n00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,640\nWell Windows has the ability\nto roll back that driver.\n\n429\n00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,990\nIt doesn't actually delete the old\ndriver when it updates, it saves it.\n\n430\n00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,398\nIt saves it just for situations like\nthis where we might need to roll back.\n\n431\n00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:50,050\n>> Now all right, so\ndo we want to try and install or\n\n432\n00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,770\ndo we want to take a look\nat our Properties and see.\n\n433\n00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,580\n>> So let's go into the Properties\nas if we had done an update, right?\n\n434\n00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,720\nSo here, on that Unknown device driver\nProperties here, right-click on driver.\n\n435\n00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,636\nNotice that I may have\nthat featured roll back.\n\n436\n00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:08,987\nThe problem that I had is that this\nparticular driver did not actually\n\n437\n00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,906\nhave a previous version of the driver.\n\n438\n00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:14,714\nSo this one is actually grayed out for\nme right here.\n\n439\n00:23:14,714 --> 00:23:17,500\nSo at this particular instance here,\n\n440\n00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,469\nI really don't have any ability to\nroll this one back at this point.\n\n441\n00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:27,410\nSo my option here is to uninstall it or\nI can try and update it.\n\n442\n00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,790\nMore than likely you\nactually wanna uninstall.\n\n443\n00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,465\nWe do have the ability to disable this.\n\n444\n00:23:32,465 --> 00:23:35,580\nIf we wanna just want to test if this\nis the driver that's really causing us\n\n445\n00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,770\nproblems, we may just wanna disable it.\n\n446\n00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,250\nIt doesn't actually uninstall\nat that point, it just says,\n\n447\n00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,720\nlook don't recognize this\nparticular device at this point.\n\n448\n00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,830\nSo we wanna pick the Uninstall here.\n\n449\n00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,830\nAnd it says, Warning,\nyou're about to uninstall this.\n\n450\n00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,170\nClick OK and let it uninstall.\n\n451\n00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:58,210\nAnd so, now notice that we get no yellow,\nor any other color buttons here.\n\n452\n00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,340\nWe're very proud.\n\n453\n00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:06,500\n[LAUGH] And,\nwe're simply gonna restart this machine.\n\n454\n00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,683\nYeah now, since Ronnie's machine\nwas a hard crash, when he rebooted,\n\n455\n00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:15,430\nit automatically brought up that limited\nstart menu and let him go into safe mode.\n\n456\n00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:20,490\nIf it was more of a soft crash, Windows\ndoesn't actually realize it crashed,\n\n457\n00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,430\nthen that may not happen, and that's where\nyou'll have to tap F8 on the keyboard.\n\n458\n00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,200\nReally hard to do on a virtual machine,\nbut\n\n459\n00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,970\non a physical machine it's really easy.\n\n460\n00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,102\nAs soon as the BIOS screen goes away, but\n\n461\n00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:33,501\nbefore you see the Windows logo\nyou just tap F8 on the keyboard.\n\n462\n00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:35,440\nI usually just sit there and\nhit it over and over again.\n\n463\n00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,365\nAnd you'll get that boot-up menu.\n\n464\n00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:39,527\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n465\n00:24:39,527 --> 00:24:40,827\nSo, it's just restarting, yep.\n\n466\n00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:44,020\n>> While your machine is restarting,\nRonnie, let me show you.\n\n467\n00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,607\nNate helped me out during that.\n\n468\n00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:51,076\nI mentioned there was command we could\nrun that would let us scan Windows to see\n\n469\n00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:54,020\nif all of our drivers\nwere digitally signed.\n\n470\n00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,390\nAnd the command is sigverif for\nsignature verification.\n\n471\n00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:03,800\nAnd if we want to see that in action,\nlet me just, actually hang on,\n\n472\n00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,020\nlet me get an administrative\ncommand prompt open.\n\n473\n00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:12,560\nI'm on a Windows 8 machine, but\nit's the same on Windows 7.\n\n474\n00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,510\nIt's just sigverif, like that.\n\n475\n00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,700\nAnd if you run that command,\n\n476\n00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,120\nit will scan the drivers that\nare in your system right now.\n\n477\n00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,330\nThese are the loaded drivers\nthat you're running.\n\n478\n00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,620\nAnd let you know if any of them\ndon't have valid signatures.\n\n479\n00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,320\nNow, there's two things that might\nlead to the signature not being valid.\n\n480\n00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,251\nOne is it didn't have it in the first\nplace and you force loaded it.\n\n481\n00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:37,279\nOr two, the signature may\nhave been revoked or expired.\n\n482\n00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,091\nRight?\nThe signature may no longer be valid.\n\n483\n00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:40,819\nAnd so this will scan and find that.\n\n484\n00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:43,340\nSo, sigverif,\nthat's that command that'll do it.\n\n485\n00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,116\nMy machine's pretty clean here.\n\n486\n00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:47,113\nI think I've loaded some VMware\ndrivers and that's about it.\n\n487\n00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:50,712\nSo it's just telling me that\neverything's been verified,\n\n488\n00:25:50,712 --> 00:25:52,837\neverything's digitally signed.\n\n489\n00:25:52,837 --> 00:25:53,951\nAnd there we are.\n\n490\n00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:58,940\nAnd I also mentioned earlier that you can\ndisable that driver signature requirement.\n\n491\n00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,300\nIt's not a good idea.\n\n492\n00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,790\nBut if you're a driver developer and\nyou need to deal with this, or\n\n493\n00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:09,240\nif you just have some business need, that\nyou've got some driver you have to load,\n\n494\n00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,780\nyou use the BCD edit command, which is\nwhat allows us to modify our boot record.\n\n495\n00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,500\nAnd basically you're setting some options.\n\n496\n00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,260\nFirst off,\nyou're saying disable integrity checks.\n\n497\n00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,310\nThat means do not do\ndriver signature checks.\n\n498\n00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,680\nAnd then the second command is a little\nconfusing cuz you're basically setting\n\n499\n00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,690\na value saying, test signing on.\n\n500\n00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,190\nAnd what that means is, you're gonna\ngenerate your own test signatures for\n\n501\n00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:38,140\nany driver that's loaded, as opposed to\nexpecting a signature to already be there.\n\n502\n00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,680\nSo, that basically says,\nwe're going to use fake signatures.\n\n503\n00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,410\nSo, you turn these two options on,\nyou go to a command prompt,\n\n504\n00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,790\nyou run these two commands.\n\n505\n00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:51,190\nAnd when you reboot, you will now no\nlonger be doing driver signature testing,\n\n506\n00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,450\nbut you'll have watermarks on your screen\nletting you know that's turned on.\n\n507\n00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,140\nAnd if you call Microsoft for support,\nthey will not help you anymore.\n\n508\n00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,150\nThat's the limit of your warranty.\n\n509\n00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,800\nNot that you get much of\na warranty with Windows anyway.\n\n510\n00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,090\nBut, yeah.\n\n511\n00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,280\nSo that's how we do those.\n\n512\n00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,510\nSo couple of little odds and ends there\nyou might bump into in the real world.\n\n513\n00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,036\nHow's our machine looking?\n\n514\n00:27:11,036 --> 00:27:14,502\n>> My machine is just starting up again.\n\n515\n00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:15,558\nThere it goes.\n\n516\n00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:16,521\nIt's actually getting into it.\n\n517\n00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:17,462\nThere.\n\n518\n00:27:17,462 --> 00:27:23,030\n>> So this time he's booting in the full\nmode, as opposed to the safe mode.\n\n519\n00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:28,450\nIn safe mode you just get that real low\nresolution, that real low color depth.\n\n520\n00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,469\nBut now it should be loading his\nactual video card drivers, so\n\n521\n00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:32,810\nhe should get full resolution.\n\n522\n00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,260\nYeah, it already looks bigger.\n\n523\n00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,600\nFull color depth, and off we go.\n\n524\n00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,860\nAnd so, problem solved.\n\n525\n00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,410\n>> Yep.\n\n526\n00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,420\nAnd so again, we just want to verify that.\n\n527\n00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,960\nRemember that Device Manager is pretty\nmuch our home in terms of this.\n\n528\n00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,200\nIt actually does tell us when we do\nhave problems with drivers here.\n\n529\n00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,268\nSo make sure you do spend some time\nwith it if you're not familiar with.\n\n530\n00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:52,869\nOf course, everything's booting up so\n\n531\n00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:55,324\neverything's taking a little\nbit longer than I expect it to.\n\n532\n00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:59,879\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well, Ronnie,\nI think that pretty much covers drivers,\n\n533\n00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:00,386\nright?\n\n534\n00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:01,731\n>> Yeah.\n>> I'm just kind of scanning over\n\n535\n00:28:01,731 --> 00:28:02,440\nthe objectives here.\n\n536\n00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,344\nUpdating, disabling.\n\n537\n00:28:04,344 --> 00:28:06,009\nWe didn't disable, we uninstalled.\n\n538\n00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:06,590\n>> Yeah.\n\n539\n00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,018\n[LAUGH]\n>> But disabling is the same thing.\n\n540\n00:28:09,018 --> 00:28:11,220\nYou just right-click in the device\nmanager on any device and\n\n541\n00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,780\nyou choose disable, and\nthat temporarily turns it off.\n\n542\n00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,550\nNow, I do this with network\ncards I'm not using.\n\n543\n00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:19,181\nCuz I get annoyed at seeing the little\nnetwork card is unplugged message.\n\n544\n00:28:19,181 --> 00:28:21,583\nSo, you may or\nmay not actually need to deal with that.\n\n545\n00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:25,380\nBut disabling is a great way for\ntemporarily troubleshooting.\n\n546\n00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,997\nWe talked about driver signatures and\nconflicts, configuring driver settings.\n\n547\n00:28:29,997 --> 00:28:33,455\nWe've seen that and resolving a problem\ndevice driver, we resolved it.\n\n548\n00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:34,188\n>> Sure.\n\n549\n00:28:34,188 --> 00:28:37,070\n>> So that's pretty much all we\nneed to know for device drivers.\n\n550\n00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,420\nJust keep in mind, in real life land, you\ndo need to keep your drivers up-to-date.\n\n551\n00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,470\nOne last thing I want to\nmention about conflict,\n\n552\n00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:49,490\nis when there is a driver that is\nofficially certified with Microsoft,\n\n553\n00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,360\npart of that\nWindows Hardware Quality Labs,\n\n554\n00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,690\nthe WHQL, they will push that\nout using Windows Update.\n\n555\n00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:01,470\nIt has happened more than once to me,\nwhere instead of using Microsoft's driver,\n\n556\n00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,550\nI use the hardware manufacturer's driver.\n\n557\n00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,370\nSo I get something newer.\n\n558\n00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:09,760\nAnd then Windows Update overwrites what\nI loaded with an older driver that just\n\n559\n00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,160\nhappens to be the newest\none in Windows Update.\n\n560\n00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,500\nSo, if that happens to you,\n\n561\n00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,950\nyou may need to go and\ndisable that update in Windows Update.\n\n562\n00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:23,452\nAnd you can do that through programs and\nsoftware.\n\n563\n00:29:23,452 --> 00:29:25,810\nYou go into that setting in there and\nyou can hide the update.\n\n564\n00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,240\nAnd that'll stop that driver\nupdate from coming there.\n\n565\n00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,920\nOr you can just turn off optional updates.\n\n566\n00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,020\nThe driver updates are almost\nalways optional updates anyway, so\n\n567\n00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,160\nyou can turn those off.\n\n568\n00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,100\nBut I have had that happen more than once.\n\n569\n00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,400\nSo just be aware that sometimes you can\nget conflicts between drivers like that.\n\n570\n00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,370\n>> Right.\n\n571\n00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,030\n>> All right, well, Ronnie,\nthis is probably a pretty good spot for\n\n572\n00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,290\nus to stop and take a break.\n\n573\n00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,807\nWhen we get back,\nwe're gonna take a look at\n\n574\n00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:49,564\nmaking our older applications\ncompatible inside of Windows 7.\n\n575\n00:29:49,564 --> 00:29:52,966\nIt's a business case that we deal with\nquite a bit, so that's what we've got.\n\n576\n00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:54,428\nComing up in a few.\n\n577\n00:29:54,428 --> 00:30:03,624\n[SOUND]\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n578\n00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:07,380\nSo, what we're going to talk about\nnow is application compatibility.\n\n579\n00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,240\nAnd this is something that as a home\nuser you probably don't experience, but\n\n580\n00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,430\nin the business world we\nexperience all the time.\n\n581\n00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:20,540\nA new version of Windows comes out and\nyou want to upgrade to it right away, but\n\n582\n00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:24,290\nyou require certain applications\nas part of your work, and\n\n583\n00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,160\nthose applications haven't been updated\nyet to support the new operating system.\n\n584\n00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,850\nWe see this all the time.\n\n585\n00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:33,876\nThey're making a big deal in the news\nright now about how Microsoft has done end\n\n586\n00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:35,282\nof support for Windows XP.\n\n587\n00:30:35,282 --> 00:30:36,744\nThey're not gonna support XP anymore.\n\n588\n00:30:36,744 --> 00:30:40,830\nRight?\nWell, Windows XP came out 13 years ago.\n\n589\n00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,450\nIt's a very old operating system.\n\n590\n00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,890\nSo it is no surprise that\nMicrosoft has end-of-supported it.\n\n591\n00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:49,660\nBut what is surprising is how many\ncompanies out there are still running it.\n\n592\n00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,370\nAnd the reason the are running it is\nbecause Windows Vista, Windows 7,\n\n593\n00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:57,280\nWindows 8,\nthey all introduced new security features\n\n594\n00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,875\nthat broke some of the software that\nwas designed to run under Windows XP.\n\n595\n00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:06,305\nThere's new features like, well\nespecially, User Account Control, or UAC.\n\n596\n00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:08,431\nUser Access Control?\n\n597\n00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:09,487\nShoot.\n>> User Account Control.\n\n598\n00:31:09,487 --> 00:31:10,972\n>> Account, oh all right,\nI was right the first time.\n\n599\n00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:16,987\nSo with UAC, applications are not\nallowed to write to C:\\Program Files.\n\n600\n00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:21,340\nThey're not allowed to write directly to\nthe registry like they used to do without\n\n601\n00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,371\nhaving administrative privileges.\n\n602\n00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:26,825\nSoftware written for Windows XP and\nearlier had those permissions,\n\n603\n00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:29,454\ncould write to C:\\Program Files\nall they wanted.\n\n604\n00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,151\nRight?\n\n605\n00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:32,207\nBut starting with Windows Vista,\nthat changed.\n\n606\n00:31:32,207 --> 00:31:36,872\nAnd so, those applications were broken,\nand they had to be updated.\n\n607\n00:31:36,872 --> 00:31:37,791\nUpdated and fixed.\n\n608\n00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:41,820\nWell, for us as a home user, we're like,\noh hey, 7-Zip won't run anymore,\n\n609\n00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,405\nlet me just go download\nthe newest version, done.\n\n610\n00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:45,131\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n611\n00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:49,629\n>> But if you're a business, maybe you're\na bank, and you have custom mortgage\n\n612\n00:31:49,629 --> 00:31:54,131\nunderwriting software that you had\ndeveloped that cost hundreds of thousands\n\n613\n00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:58,580\nof dollars, getting that updated can\nbe very expensive and very sensitive.\n\n614\n00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,050\nIf that mortgage software fails,\nyou can't issue mortgages.\n\n615\n00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,840\nNow your company's not making money.\n\n616\n00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,780\nThat's a big deal.\n\n617\n00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,800\nEnterprises and\nbusinesses are very sensitive,\n\n618\n00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,380\nvery slow to move when it comes to\nupdating their internal software because\n\n619\n00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,490\nthey don't want to train employees,\nvarious support costs and so on.\n\n620\n00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:20,310\nSo when a new version of Windows\ncomes out it may not be an option for\n\n621\n00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,435\nthem to go to it right away.\n\n622\n00:32:21,435 --> 00:32:25,340\nNow that being said,\nit's extremely irresponsible that a lot of\n\n623\n00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,470\ncompanies are still on Windows XP because\nit is such an old operating system and\n\n624\n00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,500\nthere's been two versions,\nthree versions of Windows since then.\n\n625\n00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,300\nVista, Windows 7, Windows 8.\n\n626\n00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,620\nYou might have hated Vista,\n\n627\n00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,970\nyou might hate Windows 8 but\nWindows 7's a really good OS.\n\n628\n00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,260\nThere's really no reason\nnot to move to it.\n\n629\n00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:45,880\nSo if I have older software that's\nnot compatible with Windows 7 and\n\n630\n00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,750\nI can't get that software\nupdated am I out of luck?\n\n631\n00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,610\nNo.\n\n632\n00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,010\nMicrosoft wants to help you.\n\n633\n00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,220\nSounds funny, right?\n\n634\n00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:53,990\n>> That's true.\n>> And we laugh.\n\n635\n00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,645\nThey want to help you\ngive them more money.\n\n636\n00:32:55,645 --> 00:33:00,960\n[LAUGH] They want to help you get your\nolder software operating under Windows 7.\n\n637\n00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,340\nMicrosoft has always had a really good\nfocus on backwards compatibility,\n\n638\n00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,680\nmaking your older software work.\n\n639\n00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,270\nThat's why they're so successful in\nthe business market, versus Apple,\n\n640\n00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,950\nthat's a little more successful\nin the consumer market.\n\n641\n00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,650\nSo, they do this through\na couple of different means.\n\n642\n00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,310\nFirst off, there's more than one\noperating sublayer in Windows.\n\n643\n00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,800\nYou have the 32 bit subsystem and\nthe 64 bit subsystem, so\n\n644\n00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,740\nyou can run both sets of apps.\n\n645\n00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,530\nBut when it comes to things like\npermissions, that's a little trickier.\n\n646\n00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:34,040\n>> Microsoft released a toolkit,\nthe Application Compatibility Toolkit, or\n\n647\n00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,360\nthe ACT.\n\n648\n00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,280\nIt's free.\n\n649\n00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,930\nYou just go to the Microsoft's website and\ndownload it.\n\n650\n00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:44,730\nIn fact, let me see if I can\nwhip up that website real quick,\n\n651\n00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:49,951\nand so it is the application\ncompatibility toolkit.\n\n652\n00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:51,370\nThere it is.\n\n653\n00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,990\nYou can go and get the application\ncompatibility toolkit right from\n\n654\n00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:59,080\nMicrosoft's website, free of charge and\nit is packed full of utilities\n\n655\n00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,590\nto help you get your old software to\nrun under newer operating systems.\n\n656\n00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,310\nSo this removes that\nobstacle from updating.\n\n657\n00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,320\nSure you need Windows XP cuz your old\nsoftware doesn't work under Windows Vista\n\n658\n00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,930\nor Windows 7.\n\n659\n00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:14,140\nWell spend some time with the ACT, and\nyou can probably get that old software\n\n660\n00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:18,680\nworking under Windows 7, so\nthat helps you to do that upgrade.\n\n661\n00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,940\nSo Rodney,\nyou're going to do a demo of this right?\n\n662\n00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,400\nWe've got some software,\nthat is just not happy with Windows 7.\n\n663\n00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,370\n>> Right, yup.\n\n664\n00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:29,198\nSo on my machine here, there's a, and this\nis something neat that you can do again\n\n665\n00:34:29,198 --> 00:34:31,040\nfor practicing for the exam and stuff.\n\n666\n00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,150\nYou can go to the MSDN website and\n\n667\n00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:36,250\nthey actually have a different application\nthat was written before the UAC.\n\n668\n00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:41,110\nIn other words, this is actually designed\nto break in terms of Windows 7 here.\n\n669\n00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,254\nSo-\n>> Your IVGA is down.\n\n670\n00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:44,378\n>> Oh, yep.\n\n671\n00:34:44,378 --> 00:34:47,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So much for technology here.\n\n672\n00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,332\n>> Our compatibility there, yeah.\n\n673\n00:34:49,332 --> 00:34:49,880\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n674\n00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,860\n>> While Ronnie's bringing up his machine,\n\n675\n00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,920\nwe're gonna use a demo app,\none that's specifically broken,\n\n676\n00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,030\nbecause it's really hard to find an app\nthese days that's not compatible.\n\n677\n00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,760\nVendors have had years\nnow to become updated.\n\n678\n00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,390\nBack when I originally,\nI'm a Microsoft certified trainer,\n\n679\n00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,940\nan MCT, so\nI taught Windows 7 when it first came out.\n\n680\n00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,210\nAnd you could find apps all over the\ninternet that were broken but if you'll\n\n681\n00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,640\nlook today, it's very hard to find one,\nso Zeroni got a demo app to use and.\n\n682\n00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,320\nOh is that it right there?\n\n683\n00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,740\n>> It's just called stock viewer and\nagain if you do e-trading or\n\n684\n00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,300\nanything like that, it's probably\nvery similar but this probably one of\n\n685\n00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,010\nthe earlier ones that somebody had\ntaken and modified and done this.\n\n686\n00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,000\nAnd so, again a lot of developers like\nthis because it helps them to test out\n\n687\n00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,620\nthese systems here Especially\nwith issues of compatibility.\n\n688\n00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:38,660\nSo right away when I installed this\nparticular application and it created\n\n689\n00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,040\na shortcut on my desktop, you see right\nhere that it gives me this error.\n\n690\n00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,110\nIt says you must be an administrator\nto run this application.\n\n691\n00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:50,740\nWell, I go ahead and click OK well, and\noh, look at that, it is still running Don.\n\n692\n00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,850\nEven though it says I have to\nan administrator to run it.\n\n693\n00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:54,620\nI click OK.\n\n694\n00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,190\nIt didn't ask me for\nUAC prompt or anything.\n\n695\n00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,650\nIt just went ahead and ran it anyways.\n\n696\n00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:03,700\nSo I'm going, okay it's fixed,\nit's done, everything should be good.\n\n697\n00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,000\nNow somebody begins to work\nwith it a little bit more.\n\n698\n00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,870\nSo they go and say, all right I need to\ntake a look at some of the options here.\n\n699\n00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:14,690\nAn unhandled exception has\noccurred in your application.\n\n700\n00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,580\nYou click continue.\n\n701\n00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,540\nThe application will ignore this error.\n\n702\n00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,230\nIf you attempt to continue,\nit's gonna ignore it.\n\n703\n00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,590\nSo yes, you see where it tells\nyou what the issue is right here,\n\n704\n00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,220\nthere's a registry key here that's\nactually been denied at this point, so\n\n705\n00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:31,335\nI'm gonna go ahead and click continue,\nthen look it's not really doing anything.\n\n706\n00:36:31,335 --> 00:36:33,340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I click trends,\n\n707\n00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,170\nthis is my favorite one.\n\n708\n00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,400\n>> Can't create objects.\n\n709\n00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,720\n>> Yeah, the error.\n\n710\n00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,945\nIf that wasn't helpful enough, here's\nsome additional information for you.\n\n711\n00:36:41,945 --> 00:36:45,100\n>> [LAUGH] Here is some\nadditional random text.\n\n712\n00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,145\nSo it's random.\n\n713\n00:36:46,145 --> 00:36:47,730\n>> So\n\n714\n00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:52,100\nthey're trying to show you that sometimes\nthe error messages that we got were what?\n\n715\n00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,250\nThey were just so\n\n716\n00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,910\nhard you'd just go, how the heck do\nwe figure this stuff out, right?\n\n717\n00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,810\nSo you can see things like\nthat that kind of go along,\n\n718\n00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,225\nand then I want to click\non this browse button.\n\n719\n00:37:02,225 --> 00:37:06,525\nOh look at that, it says that\nthe browse functionality requires IE6.\n\n720\n00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:10,125\nWell by default Windows 7 actually\ncomes with a higher version, IE8,\n\n721\n00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:14,865\nit is the one we actually have by\ndefault here, when Windows 7 installs.\n\n722\n00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:19,115\nSo there's actually some issues,\nthat go along with this, and\n\n723\n00:37:19,115 --> 00:37:20,445\nthere maybe even more issues here, but\n\n724\n00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:25,005\nthat's enough to actually let us try\nto talk about some of those issues.\n\n725\n00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:30,890\nThe very fact is that this application was\nolder, ran perfectly fine in Windows XP\n\n726\n00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:35,140\nbut now that we actually take a look\nat moving to Windows 7, I'd say we got\n\n727\n00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,440\na hundred users actually trying to do\nthis, or a thousand user trying to do it.\n\n728\n00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,160\nWell, how do you fix this, right?\n\n729\n00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,460\nYou may actually have to try and\nfigure this out.\n\n730\n00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,300\nSo there's a couple of different ways.\n\n731\n00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,160\nIf I was testing this bigger application\nout that I would want to use.\n\n732\n00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,070\nAnd the first one of course\nis downloading that ACT and\n\n733\n00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:58,080\nbeing able to run that on my\nmachine here to really help us out.\n\n734\n00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,580\nNow the ACT kind of helps us\nout in two bigger modes here.\n\n735\n00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,840\nThere is actually kind of\na little cheat mode and\n\n736\n00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,890\nthis is probably on that\nmost of us will use here.\n\n737\n00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,040\nIt's called the standard user analyzer.\n\n738\n00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,950\nIt's right up here at the top of my list.\n\n739\n00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,762\n>> Do you have to hit like up up,\ndown down, left right, left right?\n\n740\n00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:15,500\n>> Just about.\n\n741\n00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,610\nThe nice things about this though\nis that I can run through this and\n\n742\n00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,620\nit actually gives me\nthe ability to run through it.\n\n743\n00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,390\nAnd the reason why we want to use\nthis is it really can help me\n\n744\n00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,600\nto pinpoint what the issues actually are.\n\n745\n00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,270\nSo at this point here, in the standard\nuser analyzer that you see all these tabs\n\n746\n00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,730\nacross the top, there's nothing in them.\n\n747\n00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,610\nBut if I go ahead I select\nthe target application,\n\n748\n00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:42,937\nwhich is the stop viewer here and\nI go ahead and\n\n749\n00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:46,680\nclick open, what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna launch the application again.\n\n750\n00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,640\nAnd it actually had me go through the UA,\noh I know I have to kind of stop that.\n\n751\n00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,620\nThe reason why is I forgot\nto uncheck something.\n\n752\n00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,810\nI launched it in the mode\nit was supposed to be in.\n\n753\n00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,190\nSo I need to uncheck this here.\n\n754\n00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,780\nSo let me do this again.\n\n755\n00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,628\nI need to uncheck where it says elevate\ncuz that was actually the problem that we\n\n756\n00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:10,020\nsaw at the beginning here.\n\n757\n00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,950\nI want to launch it as if it actually\nhad the initial problem that we had.\n\n758\n00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,230\nAt this point here I'm going to launch.\n\n759\n00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,460\nAnd now we're going to see the exact\nproblem that we saw before.\n\n760\n00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,770\nYou must run as an administrator\nto this application.\n\n761\n00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,470\nI'm leaving that thing\nup in the background.\n\n762\n00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:28,560\nThe reason why is it's now gathering\nthe information from the application.\n\n763\n00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,180\nSo here I go back and I do the same thing.\n\n764\n00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,200\nI go to tools, and\noptions and there it is.\n\n765\n00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,580\nIt's giving me that same error so I know\neverything is working in the same way.\n\n766\n00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,790\nIf I go to trends where\nI can see stock trends,\n\n767\n00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:44,019\nthere it is that same particular random\ngenerated error that we have here.\n\n768\n00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,370\nAnd also at this point I\ncan click on browse here.\n\n769\n00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:54,460\nSays the browser functionality requires IE\n6, and there's probably other ones here.\n\n770\n00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,550\nIf I go to help, and check for\nupdates, look at that.\n\n771\n00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,550\nI can't actually get an update.\n\n772\n00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,550\nSo you name it, there's actually issues.\n\n773\n00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,280\nNow again, if I took the time to\nwrite down each of those errors and\n\n774\n00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,559\nwhat they gave me, the only one that's\nreally unhelpful is the one that says,\n\n775\n00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:11,480\nhere's some random string of hex for\nyou to try and figure out.\n\n776\n00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,990\nBut all those other ones,\nI could take the time to research and\n\n777\n00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,660\ndo all the stuff that I need to.\n\n778\n00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,150\nLet's just take that amount\nof information for right now.\n\n779\n00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,220\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nclose out of that and\n\n780\n00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,530\nnow across the top of\nthe Standard User Analyzer for\n\n781\n00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,930\nus, it gives me some information.\n\n782\n00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:35,740\nSo underneath File, I can see the file\nthat was actually, again, affected here.\n\n783\n00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,770\nI notice that there's\na registry setting right here.\n\n784\n00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,910\nThat I'm going to need to take a look at.\n\n785\n00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:45,570\nThat tells me that there's\nan API RegCreateKeyExW.\n\n786\n00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,400\nAnd, again,\nis actually working with the stock viewer.\n\n787\n00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,000\nIf I click on Token, well, this is the one\nthat really affects the program, right?\n\n788\n00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,190\nThe idea of running as administrator.\n\n789\n00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,260\nAnd notice that the parameter\nis the SID here.\n\n790\n00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,920\nCheck the token membership and\n\n791\n00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,420\nit actually is requiring the idea\nof administrative mode here.\n\n792\n00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:07,030\nAnd there's other ones\nthat are also here too.\n\n793\n00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:11,610\nThis idea of this file mapping\nof where things actually belong.\n\n794\n00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:16,740\nAnd then there are other objects here,\nthat same file mapping and this process.\n\n795\n00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,870\nSo it tells me that there's several\nthings that are actually wrong with this\n\n796\n00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,940\nwhen we do this, okay.\n\n797\n00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:27,170\nAll right, now at this particular point,\nyou might still go well,\n\n798\n00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,830\nI still don't know what's wrong.\n\n799\n00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,990\nThe nice thing about\nbeing able to find this.\n\n800\n00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:35,890\nIs that there is this little link up\nhere at the top that says, Mitigation.\n\n801\n00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:40,750\nIf I select Mitigation,\nI can click Apply Mitigation here.\n\n802\n00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:44,922\nAnd, that will give me a list of\nall of the corrections that this\n\n803\n00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:49,280\nStandard Analyzer wants to be able\nto actually run and do, okay.\n\n804\n00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,940\nSo, notice it gives me the force\nadministrative access, and\n\n805\n00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,140\nit's a little bit hard to read here.\n\n806\n00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,160\nIt says apply force admin shim, and\n\n807\n00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,610\nthat's what we're actually talking\nabout creating, is what we call a shim.\n\n808\n00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:05,490\nIt is that gap between the way that\nthe application wants to run and\n\n809\n00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,280\nthe way that Windows 7 runs.\n\n810\n00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,950\nAnd this is saying hey I can fill that in.\n\n811\n00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,420\nIt says it's going to simulate\nadministrative powers to queries made by\n\n812\n00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,680\nthe application.\n\n813\n00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,020\nThat's pretty neat.\n\n814\n00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:19,430\nIf I go down the local mapped object,\nit says apply the shim,\n\n815\n00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:24,700\ncausing the global objects to\nbe mapped into the local space.\n\n816\n00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,070\nSo this is actually realizing that hey,\nnot everything runs in that global mode,\n\n817\n00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,630\nmost things run now in\nthat users interface mode.\n\n818\n00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,160\nAnd there's even some file correction\nhere in terms of the path.\n\n819\n00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,130\nSo remember, that even though actually\neverything used to run in one location,\n\n820\n00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:43,130\nnow everything runs per user and\nit's saying we can correct that here.\n\n821\n00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,660\nAnd then there's some other ones.\n\n822\n00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:49,493\nNow one of the things even though I've\nfound a way that we could to fix this is\n\n823\n00:42:49,493 --> 00:42:52,740\nto loosen the idea of that UAC control.\n\n824\n00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,240\nIt still says look,\nI really don't want to do that.\n\n825\n00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,600\nSo even though it gives\nme the option to do it,\n\n826\n00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,000\nit actually doesn't have it checked.\n\n827\n00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,225\nBecause that's a bad idea.\n\n828\n00:43:00,225 --> 00:43:01,582\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n829\n00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:05,900\nAnd then there's applying this\nparticular age key, right?\n\n830\n00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,680\nThe current running is what we have here,\nright?\n\n831\n00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,540\nThe class root is what we have.\n\n832\n00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,030\nSo it's going to\nvirtualize the class root.\n\n833\n00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,160\nAnd then this last one here,\nwhich is a big one for\n\n834\n00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,265\nus, is elevating the process\nas it creates this.\n\n835\n00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:19,250\nNow I can run this and\n\n836\n00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:23,480\nable it, okay, and more than likely\neverything's gonna work just fine.\n\n837\n00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,320\nThat doesn't help you and\n\n838\n00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:30,020\nme to understand the use of the actual\napplication compatibility mode then.\n\n839\n00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,320\nSo I'm gonna click Cancel, I know.\n\n840\n00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,510\nNow what I've done is I've copied down\nsome of those particular links that we\n\n841\n00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:39,000\njust saw and once I have that information,\n\n842\n00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,850\nI'm just gonna close out of this and I'm\ngonna run the Compatibility Administrator.\n\n843\n00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:50,060\nThe Compatibility Administrator\ncomes in two different modes for us.\n\n844\n00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:55,557\nIf we actually install it inside\nthe application compatibility toolkit,\n\n845\n00:43:55,557 --> 00:43:58,708\nyou'll get a 32 bit as well as a 64 bit.\n\n846\n00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:01,210\nThis depends on the application\nthat you're running.\n\n847\n00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,840\nIf you're having a problem\nwith a 32 bit application,\n\n848\n00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,370\nyou need to select the 32 bit mode.\n\n849\n00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:08,350\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\n\n850\n00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:12,709\nselect the Compatibility Administrator,\nand click Yes.\n\n851\n00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,800\nAnd when I do so,\nyou're gonna end up seeing here\n\n852\n00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,660\nthat it's actually got quite\na few different options for us.\n\n853\n00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,450\nSo at this point I'm gonna create\na custom database is what I'm gonna do.\n\n854\n00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,030\nIt says New Database.\n\n855\n00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,690\nWell what am I trying to do?\n\n856\n00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,549\nI am really trying to fix\nthat stock viewer app.\n\n857\n00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,850\nSo, if I click on Fix.\n\n858\n00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:40,710\nAnd I'm just going to\nname this Stock Viewer,\n\n859\n00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,010\njust to make an easy name reference for\nme.\n\n860\n00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,332\nAnd then I have to pick that\nparticular application.\n\n861\n00:44:45,332 --> 00:44:48,630\nI'm gonna click on Browse and\nI already went ahead and\n\n862\n00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:51,450\nnavigated to it earlier so\nit can be easier.\n\n863\n00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,402\nSo it's underneath the Programs x86\nwhich means a 32 bit application and\n\n864\n00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:57,060\nthen select Stock Viewer here.\n\n865\n00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:58,770\nClick Open.\n\n866\n00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,980\nAnd it's gonna load it right in here, and\n\n867\n00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,825\nnow it's giving me these\ncompatibility modes.\n\n868\n00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:10,675\nIf I wanted to try and choose to run\nthis as different versions here, okay.\n\n869\n00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:11,785\nNotice I had this option.\n\n870\n00:45:11,785 --> 00:45:13,755\nNow this is not the only\nplace we see this, right Don?\n\n871\n00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:17,725\nA lot of times we can see it on\nthe shortcuts, we right-click and\n\n872\n00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:19,240\nwe can actually choose that as well.\n\n873\n00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:19,830\n>> Yeah and for\n\n874\n00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:24,010\na one-time application using that right on\nthe shortcut, that's the easiest right?\n\n875\n00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:26,540\nThat's what I'd do if I'm just doing\na single application on my machine,\n\n876\n00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,370\nbut going back to what you said earlier,\n\n877\n00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:31,165\nwhat if we're going to deploy this\nsoftware on a thousand machines.\n\n878\n00:45:31,165 --> 00:45:34,380\nWe need something a little more\nself-contained we can repeat easily.\n\n879\n00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,880\nYou can't repeat mouse clicks either.\n\n880\n00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,020\n>> [LAUGH] And so\nthey have a ton of different modes.\n\n881\n00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,800\nIt was all about the compatibility\nin terms of different modes\n\n882\n00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,720\nthat are actually out.\n\n883\n00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,830\nWe're not gonna worry about this because\nwe're gonna go into some very detailed\n\n884\n00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,250\nfixes here instead.\n\n885\n00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:54,100\nWhen we click Next, and it is here that we\nsee a whole list of compatibility fixes.\n\n886\n00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,240\nIt shows me that there are 366 of them.\n\n887\n00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,520\nNow we're not going to go\nthrough all 366 of them.\n\n888\n00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,380\n>> Aw.\n\n889\n00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,440\n>> Unless Don really wants\nto explain all 366 of them.\n\n890\n00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,650\n[LAUGH] But for\nus we're just gonna pick a few, okay.\n\n891\n00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:08,830\nSo right here,\n\n892\n00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:12,440\nit says select the actual compatibility\nfixes that are applied for this.\n\n893\n00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,280\nNow, the way that it showed us in\nthat standard user analyzer, okay,\n\n894\n00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,320\nthat works but it wasn't actually\nin alphabetical order, okay.\n\n895\n00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,570\nAnd the good thing is this list is\nat least in alphabetical order,\n\n896\n00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,150\nwhich makes it a little bit easier for us.\n\n897\n00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,870\nBut I don't have the list\nactually in alphabetical order.\n\n898\n00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:31,529\nSo, one of the fixes that I wanted\nto actually apply was the idea of\n\n899\n00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:35,530\nforcing the application to\ndo administrative access.\n\n900\n00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,900\nWe're really lying to the application.\n\n901\n00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,020\nEven though the user's running\nin the standard user mode here,\n\n902\n00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,020\nwe're essentially going to\nlie to the application.\n\n903\n00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:47,130\nSo, I'm gonna scroll down here\nto the letter F If I can.\n\n904\n00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:54,240\nAnd then we're gonna actually\nForceAdminAccess, okay?\n\n905\n00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,120\nSimple, just by checking on it.\n\n906\n00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,420\nNow, notice that there's\nother parameters up here.\n\n907\n00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,210\nWe're not gonna use any of them for right\nnow, but you can actually make it a little\n\n908\n00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,750\nbit more fine grained in\nterms of what you're doing.\n\n909\n00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,730\nSo ForceAdminAccess.\n\n910\n00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:10,620\nThe second one that we're\nalso gonna choose here.\n\n911\n00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,510\nAgain, this was from the list that\nI actually had in the standard user\n\n912\n00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,510\nanalyzer.\n\n913\n00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:16,775\nAnd this goes down to LocalMappedObject.\n\n914\n00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:22,270\nSo I'm gonna select that one\nto essentially enforce that.\n\n915\n00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:25,830\nAnd then I'm going to skip\nover that correct file paths.\n\n916\n00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:27,801\nCuz I don't want to type\nin all [LAUGH] right now.\n\n917\n00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:29,949\nI'm gonna go down to\nthe virtualization and\n\n918\n00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:32,630\nthen we are going to scroll back up here.\n\n919\n00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:33,611\nSo I need the V's.\n\n920\n00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,060\nAnd there it is in the classes root here.\n\n921\n00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,800\nSo we again are going to do that one.\n\n922\n00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,549\nAnd then lastly, the big one,\n\n923\n00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:47,762\nwhich is to elevate the actual\ncreated process here, okay.\n\n924\n00:47:47,762 --> 00:47:50,554\nSo, at the beginning of that\nstandard user analyzer,\n\n925\n00:47:50,554 --> 00:47:52,630\nthere was a check box that said Elevate.\n\n926\n00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:57,268\nAnd that's because we believed\nthat we were having a problem with\n\n927\n00:47:57,268 --> 00:47:59,050\nthe standard user mode.\n\n928\n00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,250\nI missed Elevate somewhere.\n\n929\n00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,080\n>> There it is.\n>> There it is.\n\n930\n00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,880\nOkay?\n\n931\n00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,460\nSo I'm just selecting\nthose processes here.\n\n932\n00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,900\nI'm gonna weed this down and\njust show the selected ones, okay?\n\n933\n00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,460\nSo there it is.\n\n934\n00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,140\nThose are the four that I want\nto correct at this point.\n\n935\n00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,260\nAnd I know that I can test out.\n\n936\n00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,220\nAll right.\n\n937\n00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,840\nSo I'm gonna click Next.\n\n938\n00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,730\nAnd then, of course at this point,\nyou can actually go ahead and\n\n939\n00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:28,580\nbecome incredibly detailed on information\nthat you wanna make sure that matches.\n\n940\n00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,082\nI'm not gonna do that.\n\n941\n00:48:30,082 --> 00:48:31,500\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n942\n00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,170\n>> Yeah, you can, again, just kind of,\n\n943\n00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:38,480\nif you want to, go insane about\nwhat actually has to be done here\n\n944\n00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,990\nto make sure that that\napplication matches.\n\n945\n00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:45,830\nAnd that shim applies as well, even to\nparticular versions, if you need to.\n\n946\n00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,640\nNow, if you remove some of these options,\nlike the version number.\n\n947\n00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,980\nSo you got product version 1001.\n\n948\n00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,030\n>> Yeah, file version.\n\n949\n00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,440\n>> Well, if a new version of\nthe software comes out, 1002,\n\n950\n00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,870\nthis shim will no longer apply, right?\n\n951\n00:48:56,870 --> 00:49:01,180\nSo if we remove that option, you can\nreuse this Shamwidth with newer versions.\n\n952\n00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,940\nBut normally, you need to repeat\nyour testing and all of that.\n\n953\n00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,760\nSo we typically keep it\nhere at the defaults.\n\n954\n00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,350\n>> Yeah.\nSo all right,\n\n955\n00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,810\nI'm just gonna click finish here.\n\n956\n00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:14,500\nAnd notice that that will apply now,\nan application and the stock viewer.\n\n957\n00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,790\nAnd we're not done yet.\n\n958\n00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:18,940\nThe key process in this is that\nof course it has to be applied.\n\n959\n00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,140\nWe've created this shim,\nbut it has to be applied.\n\n960\n00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,050\nYou have to save this,\nbefore you can apply it.\n\n961\n00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:27,260\nSo it's gonna ask me for a name.\n\n962\n00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,160\nAnd I'm just gonna call\nit stopviewer again.\n\n963\n00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:31,800\nSo the database name.\n\n964\n00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,720\nAnd this is where it creates\na file that's a .sdb.\n\n965\n00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,944\nWhy can't I remember\nwhat I was gonna type.\n\n966\n00:49:37,944 --> 00:49:39,239\nIt's stopviewer.\n\n967\n00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:43,720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Click OK.\n\n968\n00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,660\nAnd note, there's where it actually\ncreates the name of the file here.\n\n969\n00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,880\nSo I did one a little bit earlier.\n\n970\n00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,340\nSo again, we'll just call it stock viewer.\n\n971\n00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,860\nOops, that's not what I wanted.\n\n972\n00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:01,460\nRemember that extension right that,\nthat SHIM database that we have, SDB.\n\n973\n00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,710\nIs pretty much the key,\nif you're going to apply this.\n\n974\n00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,180\nThat's what you're gonna need.\n\n975\n00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,540\nI'm going to save it to the desktop for\nright now.\n\n976\n00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:11,910\nOkay?\n\n977\n00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:15,635\nNow, once I've got it saved,\nthe application, If I want to,\n\n978\n00:50:15,635 --> 00:50:17,845\nI right click and I select install.\n\n979\n00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:22,555\nAnd now it tells me that this\ndatabase was installed successfully.\n\n980\n00:50:24,845 --> 00:50:29,555\nAnd now, if I run that stock viewer again,\nyou can see where it's no\n\n981\n00:50:29,555 --> 00:50:34,125\nlonger telling me that I need to run\nin that administrative mode, okay?\n\n982\n00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:36,325\nSo that looks good at this point.\n\n983\n00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:39,860\nIf I go back up to tools and options.\n\n984\n00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,400\nOh, there it is.\n\n985\n00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,860\nThere have been no options available.\n\n986\n00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,070\nIt gives me the right one.\n\n987\n00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:48,400\nThe free version, apparently,\nI'm cheap, does not have this option.\n\n988\n00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,820\nIf I click on trends, notice now, it is\nactually showing the trending information.\n\n989\n00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,410\nSo we are actually able to see this and\n\n990\n00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:02,210\ncontinue on and now go through and\ntest the rest of the product.\n\n991\n00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:05,300\nWell, remember,\nthe one that I had here was that one.\n\n992\n00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,510\nOh, I forgot it.\n\n993\n00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,898\nWell sometimes, going through and\ncreating this process, right?\n\n994\n00:51:08,898 --> 00:51:11,320\nYou go, okay,\nI think I've hit all of them.\n\n995\n00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,970\nBut you might again,\ngo back and test it and\n\n996\n00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,960\nfind out that you didn't fix everything.\n\n997\n00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,780\nWell, this actually gives\nyou the ability and\n\n998\n00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:21,140\nthe time, to be able to go back in and\nalso test this one out too.\n\n999\n00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:25,510\nSo if I close that out and now,\nI can go back Stop viewer app.\n\n1000\n00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:29,170\nI have to go over here\nto the righthand side.\n\n1001\n00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,868\nSo, under applications here, stop viewer.\n\n1002\n00:51:33,868 --> 00:51:39,750\nI can right-click and I can edit that to\nnow include in that thing that I missed.\n\n1003\n00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:43,010\nSo, now I go back to next.\n\n1004\n00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:45,760\nAnd again,\nI'm not going to mess with this.\n\n1005\n00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,525\nThis right here and the one that I want\nis what we call the virtual registry fix.\n\n1006\n00:51:52,963 --> 00:51:55,470\nNow, what is the application asking?\n\n1007\n00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:58,440\nIt's saying, look, this application\nonly really runs with IE6.\n\n1008\n00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,880\nBut what if your running IE8?\n\n1009\n00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,765\nWell, we have to lie to it.\n\n1010\n00:52:01,765 --> 00:52:03,620\n[LAUGH] It is what we have to do.\n\n1011\n00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,370\nSo again, that's what essentially,\nthe shim is doing for us here.\n\n1012\n00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,710\nSo much dishonesty right here.\n\n1013\n00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:08,670\n>> I know, too much.\n\n1014\n00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:12,390\n>> Virtual registry, and\nthis is where we can use that parameter.\n\n1015\n00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:18,380\nAnd now, notice it actually is creating\na registry entry, is what it's doing.\n\n1016\n00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,520\nSo what I'm gonna tell it is that hey,\n\n1017\n00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:26,370\nstopviewer when you call on that,\nyou're gonna actually think it's what?\n\n1018\n00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,540\nIE6, oh, is what you're going to do, okay?\n\n1019\n00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:34,130\nAnd then, go ahead and\nclick next, and finish.\n\n1020\n00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:37,680\nAnd then, once again,\nI have to save everything.\n\n1021\n00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:42,155\nThen, install.\n\n1022\n00:52:44,045 --> 00:52:45,985\nAnd now, once again,\nyou run through the test.\n\n1023\n00:52:47,025 --> 00:52:49,220\nAnd you do want to make sure you\ndo this in the pattern, right?\n\n1024\n00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:52,095\nCuz, what if you introduce a fix and\nthen, actually broke something else?\n\n1025\n00:52:53,895 --> 00:52:55,885\nSo there's my options,\neverything looks good.\n\n1026\n00:52:57,255 --> 00:52:58,645\nThere's the trending.\n\n1027\n00:52:58,645 --> 00:53:00,300\nEverything looks good here.\n\n1028\n00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:04,640\nNow if I click on browse,\nnotice it actually opens up.\n\n1029\n00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,246\nWell for me IE 8 or\n\n1030\n00:53:06,246 --> 00:53:11,050\n9, whatever that she is in this\nparticular updated version right here.\n\n1031\n00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:15,820\nSo it gives you that chance again to\ncontinue to add and to change this.\n\n1032\n00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,800\nAs you actually realize as\nyou come across more and\n\n1033\n00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:22,550\nmore details that may not actually be\ncompletely fixed when you first start.\n\n1034\n00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,070\nAll right.\n\n1035\n00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,190\n>> So you'll see there's\nquite a bit involved there.\n\n1036\n00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,770\nAnd it's all about testing.\n\n1037\n00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,320\nYou've got to run through\nthis process over and\n\n1038\n00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,880\nover again until you identify all\nthe little quirks that software needs.\n\n1039\n00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,700\nAnd remember, this is like a band aid.\n\n1040\n00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,810\nThis is just something that's\ndesigned really to be temporary\n\n1041\n00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,660\nwhile you reach out to\nthat software vendor and\n\n1042\n00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,320\nget them to update the software or\nyou line up replacement software.\n\n1043\n00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,080\nSomething to replace the functionality\nof that older software that you had.\n\n1044\n00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,460\nJust remember that it's all part of\nthe application compatibility toolkit.\n\n1045\n00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,150\nIt's free.\nYou can download it right from Microsoft.\n\n1046\n00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,740\nYou can mess around with it.\n\n1047\n00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,360\nIt's good stuff to play around with.\n\n1048\n00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,980\nIt is very useful in\nbusiness environments.\n\n1049\n00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:03,640\nHome users again really not going\nto deal with this stuff very much.\n\n1050\n00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,740\nBut it is there,might as well use it.\n\n1051\n00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,750\n>> There's only one other thing that\nI wanna make sure I mention here too.\n\n1052\n00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,410\nWhen you start running that\napplication compatibility tool kit,\n\n1053\n00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:14,510\nwhen you find the application\nyou need to run and test it out,\n\n1054\n00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:19,540\nit may also ask you to do a verification,\napplication verification.\n\n1055\n00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:22,650\nAnd essentially,\nit will lead you to a download page.\n\n1056\n00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:25,430\nYou need to download the 32-bit or\nthe 64-bit depending on your machine.\n\n1057\n00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,560\nIt's a little bit confusing there.\n\n1058\n00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,890\nBut again, it will tell you\nexactly what you need to do.\n\n1059\n00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:32,480\nSo it's kind of a two\nstep process in that.\n\n1060\n00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,590\nSo the ACT will run.\n\n1061\n00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:36,580\nAnd it will tell you, hey, for\nthis to really work the way it needs to,\n\n1062\n00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,000\nyou need to download this.\n\n1063\n00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,740\nSo just follow those instructions\nto make sure you get that as well.\n\n1064\n00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,320\n>> Yeah.\n\n1065\n00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,580\nAnd then,\nonce you've got your shim perfect,\n\n1066\n00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,080\nthe next thing you need to do\nis roll it out to your company.\n\n1067\n00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,320\nYou need to deploy it out to all\nthe machines in your network.\n\n1068\n00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,620\nThat's kinda the whole point.\n\n1069\n00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:54,150\nIf you waste all this time writing a shim\njust for a single application on your\n\n1070\n00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:57,660\nown computer, you would have been\nbetter off using the compatibility tab.\n\n1071\n00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,710\nPull up the property of that file and\ngo to the compatibility tab.\n\n1072\n00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,600\nYou can set a lot of the same options.\n\n1073\n00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,890\nSo I've got a TechNet\narticle pulled up here.\n\n1074\n00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:05,980\nLet me just show you guys this.\n\n1075\n00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,910\nAnd I'll put the link with the episode.\n\n1076\n00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,980\nBut when it comes time to deploy the shim,\n\n1077\n00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:15,540\nMicrosoft has on their website a visual\nbasic script that we can use for that.\n\n1078\n00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:19,870\nAnd what you basically do is,\nyou create a Group Policy Object, a GPO.\n\n1079\n00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:23,490\nThat then runs this script\non your company's machines.\n\n1080\n00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,090\nAnd so they've got in here where\nthey're basically pointing.\n\n1081\n00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,350\nYou'll see it right here.\n\n1082\n00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:34,940\nWhere they're using a couple of different\ncommands here to install shim database and\n\n1083\n00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,640\nthen, to run a few extra things to\nget it squared away and in place.\n\n1084\n00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,310\nThat's where its kind of\nassigned that in doing it So\n\n1085\n00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:43,600\nwe can do it with a script,\npush it out that way.\n\n1086\n00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,840\nAll of your machines now have the update.\n\n1087\n00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,950\nWhether or not they actually run\nthat software doesn't matter.\n\n1088\n00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:50,700\nIf you just push it out to all your\nmachines you know that your covered.\n\n1089\n00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,840\nSo that's kind of how we go about that.\n\n1090\n00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,670\nNow, actually deploying the shim,\nthat's not really on the exam.\n\n1091\n00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:59,208\nBut this is that logical next\npiece they kind of leave off.\n\n1092\n00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:03,340\nSo, I wanna post that and I'll put\nthe link to this with the episode.\n\n1093\n00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:07,370\n>> It's actually right there at the top,\nthose two little bullet points that we\n\n1094\n00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:10,170\nwant to make sure that we\npoint out there for the exam.\n\n1095\n00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:14,711\nPlacing the shim in a place that everybody\nhas access to if you're doing that.\n\n1096\n00:56:14,711 --> 00:56:15,295\nThat's pretty [CROSSTALK]\n>> A shared folder\n\n1097\n00:56:15,295 --> 00:56:16,503\n>> A shared folder or something like that.\n\n1098\n00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:20,242\nYeah, and\nthen knowing that command right there,\n\n1099\n00:56:20,242 --> 00:56:23,020\nif you were doing this again,\none at a time.\n\n1100\n00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,390\n>> Yep, so this is the two pieces and\nit's easy enough to roll out so\n\n1101\n00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:27,930\nvery, very cool.\n\n1102\n00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,370\nAll right.\nWell, Ronnie,\n\n1103\n00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:32,350\nthat puts us at a pretty good\nspot to stop and take a break.\n\n1104\n00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:35,890\nWhen we get back we've more\nexciting Windows 7 ahead of us.\n\n1105\n00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,580\nThe next thing we've got,\nwe application restrictions and\n\n1106\n00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,400\nsome Internet Explorer action\ncoming down the pipe, too.\n\n1107\n00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,045\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n1108\n00:56:43,045 --> 00:56:45,933\n[NOISE]\n\n1109\n00:56:45,933 --> 00:56:51,711\nAll right.\n\n1110\n00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,875\nFor our next section we're going to be\ntaking a look at how we can control\n\n1111\n00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:56,211\napplications on our system.\n\n1112\n00:56:56,211 --> 00:56:58,970\nWe saw compatibility\njust getting them to run.\n\n1113\n00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:01,850\nBut once we've got them running there\nmay be additional controls that we want\n\n1114\n00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:02,920\nto implement.\n\n1115\n00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,790\nIn Windows 7 we've gotta couple\nof neat tools available to us.\n\n1116\n00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:11,350\nWe've got what are called application or\nsoftware restriction policies\n\n1117\n00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:16,490\nwhere you might want to block certain\nsoftware on a workstation and\n\n1118\n00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:19,734\nyou've also got ApBlocker which\nis kind of really the same thing,\n\n1119\n00:57:19,734 --> 00:57:21,430\njust a different way of looking at it.\n\n1120\n00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:24,470\nBut what they do is allow us to take two\n\n1121\n00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:27,718\ndifferent standpoints on how software\nruns in our environment, all right?\n\n1122\n00:57:27,718 --> 00:57:34,500\nOption number one, you can allow all\nsoftware and just block specific things.\n\n1123\n00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,420\nMaybe you don't want people in your\ncompany running AOL Instant Messenger.\n\n1124\n00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:38,920\n>> What?\n\n1125\n00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,840\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know.\n\n1126\n00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:44,990\nSo you can create a software\nrestriction policy that says\n\n1127\n00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:49,490\ndon't allow the executable to run,\nblock that instance from running.\n\n1128\n00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:53,980\nSo that's an effective way, if you know\nspecifically what you want to target.\n\n1129\n00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:58,070\nBut so you block it, AOL Instant\nMessenger, AIM, whatever it's called.\n\n1130\n00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:00,150\nYou block that thing,\nwhat do your end users do?\n\n1131\n00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:04,412\nThey say, well you know what, I'll just\ngo ahead and get Trillion or Pidgin or\n\n1132\n00:58:04,412 --> 00:58:07,480\nsome third party instant messenger\nclient and I'll use that.\n\n1133\n00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,280\nHey, it's not blocked!\n\n1134\n00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,320\nDone!\nProblem solved.\n\n1135\n00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:09,880\nRight?\n\n1136\n00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,490\nUsers are constantly finding ways\nto get around our restrictions.\n\n1137\n00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:18,390\nSo, you may choose to go the alternate\nroute which is to block all software.\n\n1138\n00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:21,820\nBlock everything and\nthen create exceptions for\n\n1139\n00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,080\nthe software that your business requires.\n\n1140\n00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:27,310\nThis is a really neat option\nbecause it does two things.\n\n1141\n00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:30,990\nFirst, it keeps your computers nice and\nclean, and\n\n1142\n00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:32,900\nusers aren't installing junk on there.\n\n1143\n00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,930\nThey've got their business apps and\nthat's it.\n\n1144\n00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,490\nThe computer at the end of\nthe day is a business tool.\n\n1145\n00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:42,890\nIt's designed to help you work and you\ndon't want Free Cell and Solitaire, and\n\n1146\n00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:46,110\nall of these other different things\nrunning on there when people should be at\n\n1147\n00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:47,850\nwork, so that's one benefit.\n\n1148\n00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:53,160\nThe second benefit is, it can block a lot\nof malware, and spyware, those annoying\n\n1149\n00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:57,190\ntoolbars that get installed, and the drive\nby installations that happen on the web.\n\n1150\n00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:02,310\nIf you're blocking that software actively\nthen it's not going to be able to install,\n\n1151\n00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:03,200\nbetter yet run.\n\n1152\n00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:03,780\nRight?\n\n1153\n00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,380\nSo, really cool stuff to do.\n\n1154\n00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,500\nAnd it's not very hard.\n\n1155\n00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,430\nAll right?\n\n1156\n00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:10,710\nNow, before we do it, before we do\nthe software restriction policy,\n\n1157\n00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:13,040\nlet me talk a little bit\nabout how they work.\n\n1158\n00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,450\nFirst off, they need to be\nable to identify applications.\n\n1159\n00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:19,970\nAnd there is a few different ways\nthat we can identify the application.\n\n1160\n00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:23,490\nThe easiest way is what's\ncalled the path method.\n\n1161\n00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:28,240\nWith the path, we specify the folder\nthe executable resides in and\n\n1162\n00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,020\nthe executable name, all right?\n\n1163\n00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:36,550\nThis is the easiest way to block or allow\nsoftware, but, it's not the best way.\n\n1164\n00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:41,310\nSo, maybe I'm trying to run Freecell,\nit's freecell.exe.\n\n1165\n00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:45,420\nAnd there's a policy\nthat blocks freecell.exe.\n\n1166\n00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:51,850\nWell as an end user, if I'm smart,\nI could go in and rename it frecell2.exe.\n\n1167\n00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:53,360\nNot it's not blocked.\n\n1168\n00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,820\nOr I can move it to a different directory.\n\n1169\n00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,110\nNow it runs just fine.\n\n1170\n00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:58,310\nIt's not blocked.\n\n1171\n00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:02,910\nNow while the path method is the easiest\nit's also the easiest to circumvent.\n\n1172\n01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:08,570\nAnother method is called the hash method.\n\n1173\n01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:13,470\nWe take a hash of the executable and\nwe say any program that runs,\n\n1174\n01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:19,360\nif it has this hash, then block it,\nor allow it, we can do either one.\n\n1175\n01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,610\nThe hash method is awesome\nbecause if they rename the file,\n\n1176\n01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:24,830\nit still has the same hash.\n\n1177\n01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,640\nIt they move it to a different directory,\nstill got the same hash.\n\n1178\n01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,460\nIt prevents those exploits.\n\n1179\n01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,370\nBut the problem with the hash method is,\n\n1180\n01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,850\nwhat happens if an update\nthat's offered comes out?\n\n1181\n01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:36,970\nIf an update comes out,\nnow it no longer matches.\n\n1182\n01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:39,160\nRight?\nSo, hash values,\n\n1183\n01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,580\nit takes a lot of work on our\npart to keep them up to date.\n\n1184\n01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:47,070\nSo, there's a third method that's\nthe Microsoft recommended method.\n\n1185\n01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:50,250\nAnd, that's to match based\noff of a certificate.\n\n1186\n01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:53,270\nWe talked about digitally signed drivers\nat the beginning of the episode.\n\n1187\n01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:56,600\nYou can have digitally signed software,\nalso.\n\n1188\n01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,820\nAnd so, you can identify\nthe software not based on its hash,\n\n1189\n01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:02,460\nnot based on its path,\nor name, or anything.\n\n1190\n01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:05,930\nBut based on the certificate\nthat's embedded inside of it.\n\n1191\n01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:10,240\nAnd you can say software flagged with\nthis certificate is allowed to run.\n\n1192\n01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,540\nAny other software is not.\n\n1193\n01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,300\nThis is the best way to do it.\n\n1194\n01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:18,030\nThe problem is not a lot of software\nout there is digitally signed, so\n\n1195\n01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:19,670\nyou might have to sign it yourself.\n\n1196\n01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:21,800\nIf you don't have access to the source\ncode that can be a difficult\n\n1197\n01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,040\nproposition, right.\n\n1198\n01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,820\nSo it's not always available.\n\n1199\n01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,320\nSo what we typically have\nto do is kind of mix and\n\n1200\n01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:32,400\nmatch between the three methods to figure\nout what's the best one for us to use.\n\n1201\n01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,580\nSo keep that in mind as we go into\nsetting up a software restriction policy,\n\n1202\n01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,990\nyou've got some choices\nhow you want to do it.\n\n1203\n01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:42,410\nThe other thing is, software restriction\npolicies can be applied to one computer\n\n1204\n01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:47,390\nlike just this laptop or we can put them\nin what's called a group policy object.\n\n1205\n01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:51,370\nAnd pushed out across our active\nwindow directory effecting, thousands,\n\n1206\n01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:54,516\ntens of thousands of machines\nall with one policy.\n\n1207\n01:01:54,516 --> 01:01:57,720\nYou make the decision based on how\nit is you want to implement it.\n\n1208\n01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:01,300\nNow we're going to show it just\nhere locally on the single system.\n\n1209\n01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,070\nBecause it makes the most sense.\n\n1210\n01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:04,430\nIf you wanna do it as a GPO,\n\n1211\n01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,900\nit's actually done the same way except\nyou do it in the active directory.\n\n1212\n01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,940\nIf you wanna learn more\nabout group policy objects,\n\n1213\n01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:15,330\nyou should jump over to our 74-10 and\n74-11 shows, the Windows server shows.\n\n1214\n01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:18,870\nWe do a ton of group policy in there and\nwe show how to set it up.\n\n1215\n01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:21,880\nSo what we do here in\nthe local policy today,\n\n1216\n01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,910\nyou just do in the group\npolicy in the domain later.\n\n1217\n01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:26,620\nIt's actually the same basic setup.\n\n1218\n01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,160\nIt's just where you put\nit that's different.\n\n1219\n01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,120\nSo we're gonna take a look at that.\n\n1220\n01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,230\nAnd Ronnie,\nwhat are we gonna restrict today?\n\n1221\n01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:36,100\n>> Well, I have downloaded\nyour favorite downloadable\n\n1222\n01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,660\napplication called Real Player.\n\n1223\n01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,550\n>> Real Player.\n\n1224\n01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,890\nFor those of you that have been on\nthe internet for more than ten years,\n\n1225\n01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:43,030\nyou may remember Real Player.\n\n1226\n01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:46,045\nIt is the most awful video player ever.\n\n1227\n01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:46,948\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1228\n01:02:46,948 --> 01:02:49,170\nI'm surprised you were able to find it.\n\n1229\n01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,520\n>> I know, yeah.\n\n1230\n01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,170\nSo, I went and\ndownloaded the ID of Real Player\n\n1231\n01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:56,710\nhere to again restrict this from\nrunning on this bigger machine.\n\n1232\n01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:58,950\n>> So\nwe're gonna do a couple of methods here.\n\n1233\n01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:02,200\nWe're going to take a look at\nthis idea of the path restriction\n\n1234\n01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,700\nas well as the hash restriction for us,\nand see how that actually works out.\n\n1235\n01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,680\n>> Yeah.\nI seriously doubt it's signed.\n\n1236\n01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,670\nIs it?\n\n1237\n01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:10,753\n>> I don't know.\nI didn't even check.\n\n1238\n01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:15,950\nSo first thing we need to do is we need to\nbring up our local group policy editor.\n\n1239\n01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:19,130\nI went ahead and\nlaunched that up for us, right?\n\n1240\n01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:23,110\nRemember that you go to start,\nand you type in gpedit.msc,\n\n1241\n01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:27,060\nand that brings up our\nlocal policy editor for us.\n\n1242\n01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:27,740\nOkay?\n\n1243\n01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,590\nAnd we're gonna use the computer\nconfigurations that run it.\n\n1244\n01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:34,215\nThat there's two settings that we have\nunderneath computer configurations,\n\n1245\n01:03:34,215 --> 01:03:35,739\nis gonna be in Windows settings.\n\n1246\n01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:38,785\nAnd okay, I was gonna say maybe.\n\n1247\n01:03:38,785 --> 01:03:43,790\n[LAUGH] And then under security\nsettings here as well, okay?\n\n1248\n01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:48,540\nUnderneath security settings in terms\nof us being able to do this, right?\n\n1249\n01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,840\nWe have two different policies\nthat we're really looking at.\n\n1250\n01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,593\nWe're gonna take a look at\nthe software restriction policies and\n\n1251\n01:03:53,593 --> 01:03:54,752\nthe app blocker policies.\n\n1252\n01:03:54,752 --> 01:03:58,130\nWe're just gonna do the software\nrestriction policies right now, okay?\n\n1253\n01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:01,191\nIf I select this you can see that\nthere's no particular software\n\n1254\n01:04:01,191 --> 01:04:04,040\nrestriction policies currently defined for\nme.\n\n1255\n01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,380\nSo at this point notice it says that\nto define the restrictions policies\n\n1256\n01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:09,540\nwhat I need to do,\nI need to go to the Action menu and\n\n1257\n01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:14,220\nclick New Software Restrictions Policies\nand then I can do that.\n\n1258\n01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:19,770\nAnd it automatically creates this kind of\nsubstructure for us that we have here.\n\n1259\n01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:24,050\nNow, notice that there's an object\ntype of enforcement for us.\n\n1260\n01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:27,890\nAnd, it actually gives\nquite a bit of information.\n\n1261\n01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:30,340\nSoftware restriction policies\napply to the following.\n\n1262\n01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,070\nAll softwares except for DLLs, okay.\n\n1263\n01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,520\nAll software files.\n\n1264\n01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:38,650\nAnd again you can adjust\nthese things to limit you or\n\n1265\n01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:42,430\nto expand what you actually need to do\nin terms of how you want this enforced.\n\n1266\n01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:44,570\n>> One option that I really\nlike is that middle one,\n\n1267\n01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:48,030\nwhere it says, apply software restriction\npolicies to the following users.\n\n1268\n01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:50,570\nIt defaults to all users, but see,\n\n1269\n01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:54,700\nyou've got that option where you can say\nall users except local administrators.\n\n1270\n01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:58,230\nThat's a nice option because as an admin,\nyou might need to be able to get in and\n\n1271\n01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:00,530\ndo something that you don't\nwant a normal user to do.\n\n1272\n01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:04,235\nThe problem is, your company might be\none that allows people to be a local\n\n1273\n01:05:04,235 --> 01:05:06,196\nadministrator on their own machine.\n\n1274\n01:05:06,196 --> 01:05:08,977\nAnd that's why it defaults\nto all users here,\n\n1275\n01:05:08,977 --> 01:05:12,769\ncuz otherwise it would exclude\nthe people you want to control.\n\n1276\n01:05:12,769 --> 01:05:13,837\n>> Oops.\n\n1277\n01:05:13,837 --> 01:05:18,318\nMy touchpad is so incredibly nice.\n\n1278\n01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:21,601\nAnd then, of course,\nyou can actually set it up to do all of\n\n1279\n01:05:21,601 --> 01:05:24,290\nthese different file\nextension types as well.\n\n1280\n01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:29,520\nSo the one that we're doing here, I think,\nand RealPlayer is actually an EXE, so\n\n1281\n01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,490\nit's already right here.\n\n1282\n01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:34,181\nSo, if you actually do have other\nfile extensions, you want to add in,\n\n1283\n01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:38,685\nyou can also do that here, and then of\ncourse, if you had trusted publishers.\n\n1284\n01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:41,425\nOnce again you could set that up as well,\nokay.\n\n1285\n01:05:41,425 --> 01:05:43,775\nSo there are many different\nthings we have here, okay.\n\n1286\n01:05:43,775 --> 01:05:46,895\nAlong with that, of course,\nare different security levels.\n\n1287\n01:05:46,895 --> 01:05:50,055\nAnd this is really where it gets\nwhere we need to go, right.\n\n1288\n01:05:50,055 --> 01:05:54,595\nDisallowed for us is actually one of\nthose settings that we have says look,\n\n1289\n01:05:54,595 --> 01:05:58,620\nif you set this here,\nsoftware's not gonna run no matter what.\n\n1290\n01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:02,580\nBasic user again, like it says, allows\nprograms to execute as a user that doesn't\n\n1291\n01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:06,700\nhave any administrative rights,\nokay, or access here.\n\n1292\n01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:10,260\nAnd then of course unrestricted,\nlet it do whatever we want it to do, okay.\n\n1293\n01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:13,500\nSo this is where Don was talking about\nthe difference of what we could do, right?\n\n1294\n01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,780\nWe could restrict everything,\ndisallow everything and\n\n1295\n01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:20,900\nthen, only allow the programs we really\nwant to run here, or we can pick and\n\n1296\n01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,420\nchoose what we really want to do.\n\n1297\n01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:23,190\nSo, they went ahead and\n\n1298\n01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:26,750\nset those up, and then, of course,\nyou have additional rules.\n\n1299\n01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,330\nAnd this is where\nthe default rules come in.\n\n1300\n01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:32,110\nSo, when you first create software\nrestriction policies you have these two\n\n1301\n01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,200\ndifferent rules.\n\n1302\n01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,150\n>> Yep and Ronnie didn't type\nthese in before the show.\n\n1303\n01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:36,610\n>> Nope. Yep. >> These are already there.\n\n1304\n01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:37,940\n>> Yep.\n>> Microsoft puts it in\n\n1305\n01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:40,485\nbecause they need to make sure\nthat Windows will still run.\n\n1306\n01:06:40,485 --> 01:06:43,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you tell it no software can run,\n\n1307\n01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:45,760\nwell how can Windows run?\n\n1308\n01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,000\nIt's gonna break\nthe operating system itself.\n\n1309\n01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,975\nSo you'll see where it puts\nexceptions in there for\n\n1310\n01:06:50,975 --> 01:06:53,960\nthe system root which is\nC:\\Windows by default.\n\n1311\n01:06:53,960 --> 01:07:00,229\nAnd the program files directory which is\nC:\\Program Files and C:\\Program Files x86.\n\n1312\n01:07:00,229 --> 01:07:06,173\nIt's going to allow applications that run\nin there to run unrestricted by default.\n\n1313\n01:07:06,173 --> 01:07:08,830\nSee on the right side that security level,\nunrestricted.\n\n1314\n01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:10,720\nSo that's going to ensure that,\nat a minimum,\n\n1315\n01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,920\nyour operating system can function and\nanything in the program files directory.\n\n1316\n01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,520\nNow we may not want that.\n\n1317\n01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,720\n>> Right.\n>> So we can go in and\n\n1318\n01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:22,150\nchange that program files\ndirectory to say disallowed.\n\n1319\n01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:24,710\nAnd then we create exceptions\n\n1320\n01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:28,500\nwith our additional rules to allow those\nother programs to be able to execute.\n\n1321\n01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:33,170\n>> And, so those are kind of the default\nones that we have set up here.\n\n1322\n01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:36,100\nI'm not gonna mess with\nthem at this point here.\n\n1323\n01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:39,806\nSo, we're just gonna create a new\nrule is what we're gonna do.\n\n1324\n01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,590\nSo, I'm gonna right-click and\n\n1325\n01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,480\nnotice that here are the options\nthat we were talking about earlier.\n\n1326\n01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:48,350\nA New Certificate Rule if I do have\nthe actual digital certificate for it.\n\n1327\n01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:52,420\nThe Hash Rule of course,\nallows me to again take that file hash and\n\n1328\n01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,260\nverify that everything's good.\n\n1329\n01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:55,713\nHere's another one that\nwe didn't talk about.\n\n1330\n01:07:55,713 --> 01:07:56,530\n>> Oh, I forgot about that.\n\n1331\n01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,430\n>> This is a new one.\nYeah.\n\n1332\n01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:58,490\nNetwork zone rule.\n\n1333\n01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:00,065\n>> Yeah, and this one,\n\n1334\n01:08:00,065 --> 01:08:02,970\nit's a rule that's going to apply\nbased on what network zone you're in.\n\n1335\n01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:05,860\nWhen you first connect to a network,\nWindows 7 asks you,\n\n1336\n01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:10,010\nhey is this a home,\nwork or public network?\n\n1337\n01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:12,700\nAnd so\nyou can create a rule that will block or\n\n1338\n01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:16,100\nallow software based on the type\nof network that you're on.\n\n1339\n01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:21,930\nSo if you're on a home network or a public\nnetwork, maybe you allow Freecell to run.\n\n1340\n01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:25,550\nBut if you are on the work network,\nyou don't allow Freecell to run.\n\n1341\n01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:28,840\nSo you can kind of have that\ndetermination based on the network zone.\n\n1342\n01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,085\nThat's one, I know why I forgot it.\n\n1343\n01:08:31,085 --> 01:08:33,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've never had the need to use it in\n\n1344\n01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:37,370\na production environment but it is there,\nit is an option available for us.\n\n1345\n01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:39,995\n>> So let's just do the Path Rule\nsince that's probably the easiest one\n\n1346\n01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:41,010\nfor us to do.\n\n1347\n01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:43,606\nAnd so\nI've got this in my Downloads folder.\n\n1348\n01:08:43,606 --> 01:08:47,000\nI wanna just,\nagain let's go ahead and just say\n\n1349\n01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,300\nanything in the Downloads folder I don't\nwant to be able to go ahead and run.\n\n1350\n01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:56,610\nSo I'm going to click on Browse, and\nI'm gonna go inside my profile there.\n\n1351\n01:08:56,610 --> 01:08:57,700\nAnd select the Downloads.\n\n1352\n01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,810\nAnd click OK.\n\n1353\n01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:03,740\nAnd then this is where I\nset the security level.\n\n1354\n01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:06,010\nI'm going to select\nDisallowed at this point.\n\n1355\n01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,500\nAnd click Apply.\n\n1356\n01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,090\nAnd click OK.\n\n1357\n01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,270\nAll right?\n\n1358\n01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:13,040\nDon, I think I'm done at this point.\n\n1359\n01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,670\nIs there-\n>> Let's see, so you have, so\n\n1360\n01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:19,925\nthe way that Ronnie has written the rule,\nit's basically taking that path,\n\n1361\n01:09:19,925 --> 01:09:24,470\nC:\\Users\\Ronnie\\Downloads, and\nit's setting it to Disallowed.\n\n1362\n01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:28,160\nSo any application there is gonna be\nblocked, not just the Real Player but\n\n1363\n01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,650\nany application.\n\n1364\n01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:33,290\nIf we really wanted we could go even more\nspecific, but yeah this should get it.\n\n1365\n01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:35,250\nWe should be in business there.\n\n1366\n01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,030\n>> All right.\n\n1367\n01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:38,590\n>> And these policies,\nthey apply pretty quickly.\n\n1368\n01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:39,680\nOr are you about to force it?\n\n1369\n01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,630\n>> Yeah.\nI was about to force it.\n\n1370\n01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:41,130\nYep.\n\n1371\n01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:46,670\nWith a local security policy,\nit normally applies instantly, but\n\n1372\n01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:50,210\njust to be certain,\nyou can do the gpupdate /force.\n\n1373\n01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:55,140\nThat'll make sure that it takes effect\nright now, but it probably already has.\n\n1374\n01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:57,380\nWhen you're pushing it\nfrom the active directory,\n\n1375\n01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:59,750\nit's a different story when you do a GPO.\n\n1376\n01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:02,869\nThose could take up to an hour and\na half to apply, so\n\n1377\n01:10:02,869 --> 01:10:06,800\ngpupdate /force is a nice way to\nensure that kicks in right now.\n\n1378\n01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,402\nAnd you can go in and test it.\n\n1379\n01:10:12,164 --> 01:10:14,903\n>> All right, so,\nI'm inside of the Downloads folder here.\n\n1380\n01:10:14,903 --> 01:10:20,234\nAnd so, I want to, let's pick again the\none that we actually wanted to do here,\n\n1381\n01:10:20,234 --> 01:10:22,078\nRealPlayer.exe, okay.\n\n1382\n01:10:22,078 --> 01:10:25,027\nCuz Don hates for\nthis to actually run on his machines.\n\n1383\n01:10:25,027 --> 01:10:28,055\nI don't know if Don would cry or\nif he would just take the machine and\n\n1384\n01:10:28,055 --> 01:10:29,290\njust tear it down.\n\n1385\n01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:30,090\n>> Format it.\n\n1386\n01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:30,980\nReinstall.\n\n1387\n01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:33,030\n>> There we go.\n\n1388\n01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:37,920\nSo, we get it where this program now\ntells us it's blocked by group policy.\n\n1389\n01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,180\nWe can actually see\nwhere it's not running.\n\n1390\n01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:44,500\nNow, if I only wanted to limit\nRealPlayer though, okay.\n\n1391\n01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:48,510\nI've now got a conundrum because look\nat all those other things here, okay?\n\n1392\n01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:52,060\nSo, the application control\ncompatibility here.\n\n1393\n01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:54,250\nNotice again everything else is blocked.\n\n1394\n01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,500\nSo, putting that path there is effective.\n\n1395\n01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,200\nIt does work.\n\n1396\n01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,390\nBut it again can do more than\nwe possibly want it to do.\n\n1397\n01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:01,980\n>> Yeah.\n\n1398\n01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:04,020\nAnd you know he did it from\nthe command line here, but\n\n1399\n01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,410\nit works through he GUI too, right.\n\n1400\n01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:06,890\nSo if you just browse to that folder.\n\n1401\n01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:09,315\nWhy don't you browse to it and\ndouble-click on Real Player that way.\n\n1402\n01:11:09,315 --> 01:11:12,407\nYou'll see it's the same thing,\nexcept that you get a graphical warning.\n\n1403\n01:11:12,407 --> 01:11:15,681\nSo when he runs it.\n\n1404\n01:11:15,681 --> 01:11:16,424\n>> Nope.\n\n1405\n01:11:16,424 --> 01:11:17,887\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Oh, you know what Ronnie?\n\n1406\n01:11:17,887 --> 01:11:19,541\nIt asked if you wanted\nadministrator privileges.\n\n1407\n01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:20,108\n>> Oh and I said yes.\n\n1408\n01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:21,211\n>> And so it bypassed the block.\n\n1409\n01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:22,193\nYeah.\n>> Let me see.\n\n1410\n01:11:22,193 --> 01:11:26,500\n>> So when he ran it from the command\nprompt it was a command prompt without\n\n1411\n01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,960\nelevated privileges.\n\n1412\n01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,377\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so it didn't run.\n\n1413\n01:11:29,377 --> 01:11:32,988\nWhen he ran it here, it prompted real\nquick to run as an administrator, so\n\n1414\n01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:33,820\nit bypassed it.\n\n1415\n01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:35,262\n>> I'm so used to doing that.\n\n1416\n01:11:35,262 --> 01:11:36,050\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n1417\n01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:37,650\n>> Just yes.\n\n1418\n01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:39,840\n>> You're a normal user so,\nanyhow so it stopped.\n\n1419\n01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,050\nBut that kinda shows how\nadministrators can get around that.\n\n1420\n01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,800\n>> Yeah.\n>> But you know the other applications\n\n1421\n01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,920\nin there like if you try and\nrun application verifier or something.\n\n1422\n01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,300\nWell, those are installers, so\nthey're gonna run as administrators too.\n\n1423\n01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,550\nAll right.\nWell, whatever.\n\n1424\n01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:56,460\nSo basically you put the path in.\n\n1425\n01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,310\nThe more specific you are with the path,\nthe more granular it can be, and\n\n1426\n01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:01,340\nyou can continue it on to\ninclude the file name too.\n\n1427\n01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:04,655\nJust be aware it's pretty easy to bypass\nthis cuz you can move the file out of that\n\n1428\n01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:05,210\ndirectory.\n\n1429\n01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:11,000\n>> Yeah, speaking of that If I just go\ndown to, I wanna copy this to the root.\n\n1430\n01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,670\nWhere you always wanna copy programs to.\n\n1431\n01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,540\n[LAUGH]\n>> Of course.\n\n1432\n01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:17,170\n>> And again, it would run just fine here.\n\n1433\n01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:21,066\n>> Oh yeah, if you ran it from the command\n[CROSSTALK] you'd see a command line.\n\n1434\n01:12:21,066 --> 01:12:24,985\n>> And so,\nthat's probably why I left that up for us.\n\n1435\n01:12:24,985 --> 01:12:25,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there we go.\n\n1436\n01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:28,030\nWe didn't have to worry\nabout seeing it there.\n\n1437\n01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:30,100\nOkay, so we wanna be very specific.\n\n1438\n01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,120\nLet's say that like,\nnot every user does this.\n\n1439\n01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,900\nNot every user copies multiple times or\n\n1440\n01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:38,350\nthe same application\nto multiple locations.\n\n1441\n01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:39,970\nBut let's say it happens, right.\n\n1442\n01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:44,000\nSo I really don't want this\nparticular policy here.\n\n1443\n01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,160\nI want one that actually\npinpoints RealPlayer, okay.\n\n1444\n01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:51,740\nSo if I want that, I'm going to right\nclick and what I want is the Hash Rule.\n\n1445\n01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:58,830\nThe hash rule, again, will kind of let\nme pinpoint that particular file itself.\n\n1446\n01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,050\nIf I go down to downloads.\n\n1447\n01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:05,940\nThis should block it regardless\nof where the location is\n\n1448\n01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:06,840\non this particular computer.\n\n1449\n01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,270\nI'm going to select RealPlayer.\n\n1450\n01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:10,800\nI'm going to click open there.\n\n1451\n01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,200\nAnd then notice the file information.\n\n1452\n01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,240\nTakes a look at all that stuff.\n\n1453\n01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,800\nAnd this allowed.\n\n1454\n01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,810\nClick Apply.\n\n1455\n01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,260\n>> And so it's gonna calculate\nthe hash value for us.\n\n1456\n01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:21,210\nIt's not something we have to do.\n\n1457\n01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:23,980\nIt's gonna calculate the hash value and\nstore it as part of this policy.\n\n1458\n01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:25,440\n>> And then click OK.\n\n1459\n01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,590\nAnd there we go.\n\n1460\n01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:31,255\nSo again just in good practice.\n\n1461\n01:13:31,255 --> 01:13:34,820\n[LAUGH] I know I'm a little\nparanoid about that.\n\n1462\n01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,080\n>> Better safe than sorry.\n\n1463\n01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,490\n>> That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1464\n01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:40,014\n>> So now it's not tied to a path so\n\n1465\n01:13:40,014 --> 01:13:43,476\nregardless of where this file resides and\neven if you rename the file,\n\n1466\n01:13:43,476 --> 01:13:46,836\nthe hash will still be the same so\nif he runs it it should get blocked.\n\n1467\n01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:52,041\nIt's right there.\n\n1468\n01:13:56,545 --> 01:14:00,360\nThere, on both the root and that location.\n\n1469\n01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,850\nSo anytime this RealPlayer app and\n\n1470\n01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:05,290\nsomebody says, oh, I'll just move\nit out of that particular location.\n\n1471\n01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:07,260\nThis hash value actually\nlet's us be able to do that.\n\n1472\n01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:11,760\n>> All right, so that is an example\nof a software restriction policy.\n\n1473\n01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,420\nNow when Ronnie ran RealPlayer it prompted\nfor him for administrative credentials,\n\n1474\n01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:18,530\nand you guys saw when he hit\nRonnie it ran anyway, right.\n\n1475\n01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:20,140\nSo what the heck was going on there?\n\n1476\n01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:24,820\nWell, software restriction policies\nwere created prior to Windows Vista.\n\n1477\n01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:28,320\nThey were designed for\nWindows XP and Windows server 2003.\n\n1478\n01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:33,310\nSo they were not designed with user\naccount control or UAC in mind.\n\n1479\n01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:36,840\nUAC didn't exist then, so\nthere's a flaw, right?\n\n1480\n01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,640\nAnd the flaw is that you can\n\n1481\n01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,500\nstill run the application if you've\ngot the administrative credentials.\n\n1482\n01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:44,780\nSo, what Microsoft did is they\ncreated a replacement for\n\n1483\n01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,770\nsoftware restriction policies.\n\n1484\n01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:52,090\nAnd that is what we saw for the brief\nmoment that Ronnie was in the policy.\n\n1485\n01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:53,870\nYou saw software restriction policies and\n\n1486\n01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:57,990\nright beneath it was a folder called\nApplication Control Policies.\n\n1487\n01:14:57,990 --> 01:15:01,460\nThat is what's called app blocker,\nalright?\n\n1488\n01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:04,450\nIt's kind of hard to remember because in\nthe policies these application control\n\n1489\n01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:05,330\npolicies but\n\n1490\n01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:09,000\nif we expand that out you'll see where\nit's got app blocker right there.\n\n1491\n01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,090\nApp blocker effectively does the same\n\n1492\n01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:14,820\nthing that software\nrestriction policies does.\n\n1493\n01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:18,540\nThe only thing is,\nit takes into account stuff like UAC and\n\n1494\n01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:21,780\nthe newer security model found\nin Windows 7 and higher.\n\n1495\n01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:24,900\nSo if you're deploying this brand new and\nyou're just supporting Windows 7 and\n\n1496\n01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:28,450\nhigher, you should do AppLocker instead.\n\n1497\n01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:30,400\nBut if you're supporting Windows XP,\n\n1498\n01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,600\nif you're supporting Windows Server 2003,\napp blocker doesn't work on those guys,\n\n1499\n01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,080\nyou still need the software restriction\npolicies, that's why we have both.\n\n1500\n01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,940\n>> Ronnie,\ndid you have a demo for this one?\n\n1501\n01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:41,440\n>> We do.\n\n1502\n01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,290\n>> Perfect well let's show it off.\n\n1503\n01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:47,380\n>> I have your second favorite\nprogram you like to download, Java.\n\n1504\n01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:51,800\n>> Java, you know we have this long\nrunning thing in the studio that I\n\n1505\n01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:56,910\nabsolutely hate to install Java on\nany machine, just because Oracle and\n\n1506\n01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:59,910\nSun have shown that they don't\nunderstand what security is.\n\n1507\n01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:03,000\nSo it is something that I hate to deploy.\n\n1508\n01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:06,615\n>> Well the good thing is we're using\nthese to actually prevent things\n\n1509\n01:16:06,615 --> 01:16:09,265\nlike that from happening, so\nthat really does help us out.\n\n1510\n01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:09,785\nOkay?\n\n1511\n01:16:09,785 --> 01:16:14,425\nNow inside of the application control\npolicies here, underneath that you see\n\n1512\n01:16:14,425 --> 01:16:17,095\nwhere it actually drops down and\nit actually gives you ad blocker, and\n\n1513\n01:16:17,095 --> 01:16:20,735\nif I again drop down again, you'll\nsee that there are executable rules,\n\n1514\n01:16:20,735 --> 01:16:23,780\nWindows installer rules,\nand script rules as well.\n\n1515\n01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:26,150\nSo we're no longer just blocking\nthe idea of executables and\n\n1516\n01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:27,420\nthose things with the paths.\n\n1517\n01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:30,200\nNotice that I can actually do\nthis on Windows Installer and\n\n1518\n01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:33,090\neven create different scripts\nto run when we want to.\n\n1519\n01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:36,840\nNow actually this first node right here is\nactually very important because it gives\n\n1520\n01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,840\nus so much information over here.\n\n1521\n01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:41,890\nAnd the thing that I always forget\nis under this configure enforcement\n\n1522\n01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:42,660\nrule right here.\n\n1523\n01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:43,690\nThis big yellow warning.\n\n1524\n01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:45,230\n>> Yeah, you need to do this first.\n\n1525\n01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:49,260\n>> Yeah, you need to do this clicker first\nwhen you actually set everything up here.\n\n1526\n01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:52,990\nSo it says, the ad blocker policy,\nto be enforced on the computer,\n\n1527\n01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:56,470\nthe application identity service must\nbe running, and I clicked off it.\n\n1528\n01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,820\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and start that.\n\n1529\n01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:01,410\nAnd what you can do is,\n\n1530\n01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,730\nif you're deploying this in\nyour corporate environment.\n\n1531\n01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:08,470\nYou can create a GPO that turns\nthe service on, on your machines and\n\n1532\n01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:09,550\npush it out across the network.\n\n1533\n01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:11,510\nIf you're just doing it on a single\nmachine though, you just come and\n\n1534\n01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,750\nstart the service and set it to automatic.\n\n1535\n01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,400\nYep.\n\n1536\n01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,290\n>> I'm just going to double click on\nthe application identity service here.\n\n1537\n01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:23,350\nAnd set it to automatic and\nclick Start, and click OK.\n\n1538\n01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:28,900\nMake sure that that service is started for\nus.\n\n1539\n01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:31,350\nNow you can create the rules and\nthen start the service.\n\n1540\n01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,730\nIt's probably better if you start the\nservice and then create the rules here,\n\n1541\n01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:37,980\nthat way it's consistent in\nterms of what you do, okay?\n\n1542\n01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:40,235\nSo for us here, I've got two.\n\n1543\n01:17:43,369 --> 01:17:46,633\nHere, I went ahead and what I want\nto do is a, we can actually do so\n\n1544\n01:17:46,633 --> 01:17:48,410\nmany things with AppLocker here.\n\n1545\n01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:49,890\nI've got this Java update and\n\n1546\n01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:54,630\nthis other one that's a little bit earlier\nhere so everything actually works for us.\n\n1547\n01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:55,870\nSo that's where we're going.\n\n1548\n01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:57,960\nSo, I'm gonna go down to\nexecutable rules here.\n\n1549\n01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,360\nAnd then in this right action we have\nto do a couple of different things.\n\n1550\n01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:07,810\nThere are some default rules\nthat have to be created first.\n\n1551\n01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:12,798\nIf not, you'll lock yourself out just\nlike we talked about in software fit.\n\n1552\n01:18:12,798 --> 01:18:15,257\nI can go ahead and create default rules.\n\n1553\n01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:17,310\nEven if you create a rule,\nit'll come back and tell you, hey,\n\n1554\n01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:19,750\nyou need to create default rules\nbefore you really do this.\n\n1555\n01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:20,860\nAnd will put them in.\n\n1556\n01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:23,880\nSo here is the actual\nfollowing options again.\n\n1557\n01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:28,300\nGiving the ability for the system\nto run and of course program files.\n\n1558\n01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:32,945\nAnd then of course the administrators\nanything that they wanna do.\n\n1559\n01:18:32,945 --> 01:18:34,310\nOkay.\nSo very important for\n\n1560\n01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,960\nus to actually have that.\n\n1561\n01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,730\nAnd then we can create a new rule.\n\n1562\n01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,040\nSo it walks us through this wizard.\n\n1563\n01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:48,140\nIf I click next here this is where\nI can allow or deny the options and\n\n1564\n01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,500\neven more specifically than our\nsoftware restriction policies,\n\n1565\n01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:53,270\nwe can even go in and\ndo this for individual groups.\n\n1566\n01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,900\nOn our computer or\ninside of our Active Directory.\n\n1567\n01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,170\nNow I'm gonna click Next.\n\n1568\n01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:03,242\nand now notice even more specifically,\na publisher, so I can actually say\n\n1569\n01:19:03,242 --> 01:19:07,604\nthe condition, select the option if you\nwant the application to create a rule for\n\n1570\n01:19:07,604 --> 01:19:10,908\nsign, a publisher's software,\nthe path or the file hash.\n\n1571\n01:19:10,908 --> 01:19:13,910\nWell, we want to prevent all of Java.\n\n1572\n01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:17,600\nI don't care what version it is, or\nDon doesn't care what version it is,\n\n1573\n01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,142\nI should say.\n\n1574\n01:19:18,142 --> 01:19:18,760\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, the thing to\n\n1575\n01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:19,700\nalso remember here is,\n\n1576\n01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:23,220\nthese are the same three options we had in\nthe software restriction policy, right?\n\n1577\n01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:23,860\nPublisher.\n\n1578\n01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:26,150\nThat's the certificate,\nthe digital signature.\n\n1579\n01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:26,770\nPath.\n\n1580\n01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:27,780\nAgain, just the location.\n\n1581\n01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:28,870\nAnd then, final hash.\n\n1582\n01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:31,760\nWe also had network zone,\nwhich I said nobody ever used.\n\n1583\n01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,920\nSo, we've got these three right here.\n\n1584\n01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,320\nThese are basically a mirror of what you\nhad with software restriction policies\n\n1585\n01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,360\njust with a little bit more power.\n\n1586\n01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:43,950\n>> So I'm gonna click Next and then I'm\njust going to pull up one of those files.\n\n1587\n01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:46,170\nSo I'm going to select one of the Java.\n\n1588\n01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:49,340\nI'm going to select the earlier\none here and click Open.\n\n1589\n01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:56,060\nAnd in a moment notice it gives us that\npublisher certificate right there.\n\n1590\n01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:58,250\n>> Oracle did digitally sign this one.\n\n1591\n01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:02,480\n>> So look at the other things we can do,\nwe can actually go down to the file\n\n1592\n01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,590\nversion, or just the name itself,\nproduct name.\n\n1593\n01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:09,380\nBut if I want to actually do this for\nthe publisher, I just move that toggle up.\n\n1594\n01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:13,020\n>> [LAUGH] Don't allow anything\nsigned by Oracle to run.\n\n1595\n01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:14,320\nThat's it.\nWe're just gonna cut em out.\n\n1596\n01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,550\n>> Yeah.\nNow, of course, if we're a little bit,\n\n1597\n01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:19,100\nwe might actually go\ndown to the idea of this.\n\n1598\n01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,260\nBut let's just go ahead and\n\n1599\n01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:23,270\nsay, all the java stuff that's\nrunning on my computer at this point.\n\n1600\n01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:24,220\n>> Just say no to Oracle.\n\n1601\n01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:26,190\n>> Just say no to Oracle.\n\n1602\n01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:27,590\nAnd then go ahead and click Next.\n\n1603\n01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:31,690\nAnd if we wanted to make an exception at\nthis point, notice it gives you that.\n\n1604\n01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:34,370\nSo if there is a specific version or\n\n1605\n01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:37,560\nsomething you wanted to do,\nyou could add that in here now.\n\n1606\n01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:38,810\nNext.\n\n1607\n01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:41,730\n>> Yeah, and you know, you could use\nthis in a little more realistic way.\n\n1608\n01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:45,310\nMaybe you want to enforce Java\nupdates in your environment.\n\n1609\n01:20:45,310 --> 01:20:49,310\nSo a security announcement comes\nout that says Version 7.10 update\n\n1610\n01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:51,640\nfive has a known vulnerability.\n\n1611\n01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:56,110\nSo you might create a block rule for\n7.10 update five, but\n\n1612\n01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:58,665\nallow 7.10 update six, right?\n\n1613\n01:20:58,665 --> 01:21:00,570\nSo you can ensure that\nacross your network,\n\n1614\n01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:02,485\nnobody is running the vulnerable version.\n\n1615\n01:21:06,021 --> 01:21:07,707\n>> And then we just create this.\n\n1616\n01:21:07,707 --> 01:21:09,740\n>> Yep, you didn't allow rule.\n\n1617\n01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:13,375\n>> I've,\n[LAUGH] let me change that to deny.\n\n1618\n01:21:18,536 --> 01:21:21,540\nSo hopefully,\nthat should set it up for us.\n\n1619\n01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:25,230\nWe've got the application identity\nservice running, which is absolutely key.\n\n1620\n01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:28,130\nWe have now created the default\nrules as well as the actual rule,\n\n1621\n01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:29,220\nwe wanted to block here.\n\n1622\n01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:36,519\nAnd once again, I'm going to\nbe paranoid and do the [LAUGH]\n\n1623\n01:21:36,519 --> 01:21:39,250\ngp update.\n\n1624\n01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:41,560\nAnd make sure that actually\napplies here for us.\n\n1625\n01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:47,698\nComputer policies are scared\nof us apparently.\n\n1626\n01:21:47,698 --> 01:21:49,500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n1627\n01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:58,785\nSo now, if I go into my directory here,\nlet's just do the java set up here.\n\n1628\n01:21:58,785 --> 01:22:01,440\nOkay.\n\n1629\n01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,200\nSo that actually worked.\n\n1630\n01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,140\nLet's try the other one.\n\n1631\n01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:10,750\nAnd so both of them were blocked.\n\n1632\n01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:13,000\nNow, this one,\nI had a little bit of a problem with.\n\n1633\n01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,360\nThere are earlier versions of Java, right?\n\n1634\n01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,045\nBut they were written by Sun Microsystems.\n\n1635\n01:22:17,045 --> 01:22:17,820\n>> Yep.\n>> And so\n\n1636\n01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:21,230\nyou've gotta be careful thinking,\noh no, I'll just block this one.\n\n1637\n01:22:21,230 --> 01:22:23,670\nYou got to pay attention, if you're\ngoing to use that publisher rule.\n\n1638\n01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:25,830\n>> Vendors change certificates\nfrom time to time too.\n\n1639\n01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:26,860\nAnd they renew them.\n\n1640\n01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:28,570\nSome certificates change their datea.\n\n1641\n01:22:28,570 --> 01:22:30,210\nSo various things can happen there.\n\n1642\n01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:32,280\nYou just have to stay on top of it.\n\n1643\n01:22:33,628 --> 01:22:36,260\nAll right, so we just saw the,\n\n1644\n01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:39,930\nbasically, the way to recreate what we\ndid with software restriction policies.\n\n1645\n01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,480\nYou do have a few other bells and\n\n1646\n01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,400\nwhistles back in there, in addition\nto the software restriction policies.\n\n1647\n01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,940\nIf we go back to the policy there, you'll\nsee where you've got the Windows install\n\n1648\n01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:52,260\nrules where you can target particular MSIs\nand installers that you want to allow or\n\n1649\n01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:54,680\nnot, and then just general scripts.\n\n1650\n01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:59,070\nWhether you want people to be able to\nexecute visual basic scripts, and so on.\n\n1651\n01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:00,520\nSo we have a lot more power.\n\n1652\n01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:05,170\nJust remember for the exam that you still\nhave software restriction policies for\n\n1653\n01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:08,540\nwhen you're supporting Windows XP and\nserver 2003.\n\n1654\n01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:12,010\nBut you've got AppLocker for\nWindows Vista and higher.\n\n1655\n01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:13,420\n>> Right.\n>> So everybody should be using\n\n1656\n01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:14,440\nAppLocker now.\n\n1657\n01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,080\nYou can easily recreate\nthe same rules that you had\n\n1658\n01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,520\nwith software restriction policies.\n\n1659\n01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,760\n>> There you go.\n\n1660\n01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,180\n>> And, the only other thing was that\nwe did this here in a local policy.\n\n1661\n01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:27,740\nIt's the same exact way,\nif you do it in a GPO applied to a domain,\n\n1662\n01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:29,070\njust a different place for it.\n\n1663\n01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,980\nSo if you wanna check that out,\nbe sure to check out our server shows.\n\n1664\n01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,360\nWe dive into the domain side there.\n\n1665\n01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:37,710\nAll right so that pretty much wraps\nup software restriction policies and\n\n1666\n01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:38,500\napp locker.\n\n1667\n01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:41,040\nWe still have a little bit more\nto talk about in this objective.\n\n1668\n01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,620\nWe need to talk about some\nInternet Explorer compatibility and\n\n1669\n01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,940\nsettings and stuff.\n\n1670\n01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:47,690\nSo we will tackle that next.\n\n1671\n01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:51,100\nBut, I think, we are at a pretty\ngood spot to stop and take a break.\n\n1672\n01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:52,570\nWhat do you think, Ronnie?\n\n1673\n01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:53,380\n>> Sounds Good.\n\n1674\n01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:55,310\n>> All right.\nSo ladies and gentlemen stay tuned.\n\n1675\n01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:59,028\nWhen we get back,\nInternet Explorer compatibility in a few.\n\n1676\n01:23:59,028 --> 01:24:03,876\n[SOUND] All right, so\nfor our final segment,\n\n1677\n01:24:03,876 --> 01:24:09,654\nwe're gonna be taking a look\nat Internet Explorer.\n\n1678\n01:24:09,654 --> 01:24:12,360\nI know,\nit's not the most terribly exciting thing.\n\n1679\n01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,580\nBut it kind of goes hand in hand\nwith application compatibility.\n\n1680\n01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:19,830\nWith each new version of Windows, you\nget a new version of Internet Explorer.\n\n1681\n01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:23,260\nAnd with each new version of Internet\nExplorer, there can be issues with\n\n1682\n01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:27,670\naccessing the sites and web applications\nthat we use as part of our business.\n\n1683\n01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:29,210\nSo we need to take a look\nat some of the bells and\n\n1684\n01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:33,490\nwhistles that are found in IE that we\ncan use to kinda smooth that over and\n\n1685\n01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:35,930\nmake the transition go\nthe way that we want.\n\n1686\n01:24:35,930 --> 01:24:36,850\n>> Yep.\n\n1687\n01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:39,970\n>> So the first feature we're gonna\ntalk about is the Internet Explorer\n\n1688\n01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:42,260\ncompatibility view.\n\n1689\n01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:46,580\nWhen you go to a website,\nthe website has various scripts, code,\n\n1690\n01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:48,270\nwhatever that's running in the background.\n\n1691\n01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:51,870\nAnd it's up to your web browser to\nrender that in a meaningful way to you.\n\n1692\n01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:57,890\nWell, as web browsers advance, the way\nthey render those pages starts to change.\n\n1693\n01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:03,710\nAnd so Internet Explorer 7 renders things\ndifferently, than Internet Explorer 8,\n\n1694\n01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:06,880\nwhich renders things differently\nthan Internet Explorer 9, and so on.\n\n1695\n01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,650\nSo each one's a little bit different.\n\n1696\n01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:13,590\nSo in Internet Explorer, we actually\nhave what's called a compatibility view.\n\n1697\n01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:17,090\nIf you go to a webpage and\nit's not rendering properly.\n\n1698\n01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:18,300\nIt's just most likely that,\n\n1699\n01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:21,170\nthat web page hasn't been updated\nto reflect the newest standards.\n\n1700\n01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:24,330\nSo you can choose to move\ninto compatibility view.\n\n1701\n01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:25,580\nIn compatibility view,\n\n1702\n01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:30,660\nyour version of Internet Explorer\nbegins to act like Internet Explorer 6.\n\n1703\n01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:32,990\nIt acts like an older version of IE.\n\n1704\n01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:37,320\nThat's the default browser on Windows XP,\nand it acts that way.\n\n1705\n01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:40,280\nSo that the webpage can render\nin hopefully, in intact form.\n\n1706\n01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:44,970\nNow as time goes on,\nthis becomes less and less of a deal.\n\n1707\n01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:46,990\nI remember,\nwhen Window's 7 first came out,\n\n1708\n01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:48,894\nI was using compatibility view left and\nright.\n\n1709\n01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:52,920\nBut today,\nI don't use it anywhere, anymore.\n\n1710\n01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,760\nAnd that's because, it's been years.\n\n1711\n01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,050\nWebsites have been updated.\n\n1712\n01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:58,750\nThings are all kind of running nice and\nsmooth.\n\n1713\n01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:01,190\nIt's not an issue that we worry about so\nmuch anymore.\n\n1714\n01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:03,350\nBut when a new version\nof Windows comes out,\n\n1715\n01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:05,150\nit is something you'll have to experience.\n\n1716\n01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:07,730\nAnd you may still be dealing\nwith that in Windows 7.\n\n1717\n01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:09,420\nSo, let's see how that works.\n\n1718\n01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:10,660\n>> Yeah.\n>> Ronnie, do you have\n\n1719\n01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:11,880\na demonstration for us?\n\n1720\n01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,168\n>> Yep, for us here, I went ahead and\n\n1721\n01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:15,133\njust pulled up the web\nbrowser inside of Windows 7.\n\n1722\n01:26:15,133 --> 01:26:17,140\nThe default one that\nwe actually have here.\n\n1723\n01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:19,390\nAnd so, you can see that those\nweb pages haven't been updated.\n\n1724\n01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:21,930\nAnd so this one on www.msn.com.\n\n1725\n01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:24,690\nThis icon shows up right here.\n\n1726\n01:26:24,690 --> 01:26:25,220\n>> Well, broken page.\n\n1727\n01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,620\n>> Yeah, the broken page.\n\n1728\n01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:30,430\nCompatibility view, websites designed for\nolder browsers would often look better.\n\n1729\n01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:32,860\nAnd problems such as out of place menus,\nimages or\n\n1730\n01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:34,670\ntexts will end up being corrected.\n\n1731\n01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:36,840\nSo you do go to a website and\nthis is happening.\n\n1732\n01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,830\nAnd you may go,\nwell MSN looks perfectly fine.\n\n1733\n01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:40,850\nIt's working.\n\n1734\n01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:44,420\nBut remember that, you may actually be\nconnecting to your business websites and\n\n1735\n01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,990\nthings are not working well.\n\n1736\n01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:48,670\nAll you have to do is click\non that compatibility mode.\n\n1737\n01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,640\nAnd then, from this point you\nactually see where it tells you,\n\n1738\n01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,430\nthat it's now running compatibility view.\n\n1739\n01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:53,630\nDid it fix anything?\n\n1740\n01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:54,270\nIt probably did.\n\n1741\n01:26:54,270 --> 01:26:56,970\nI didn't realize exactly\nwhat it fixed here, okay?\n\n1742\n01:26:56,970 --> 01:26:59,900\nSo you will get sites like that,\nthat may not have been\n\n1743\n01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:03,060\nupdated to the latest standard\nin terms of what they've given.\n\n1744\n01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:06,474\nBut, I selected our particular website and\nDon, look,\n\n1745\n01:27:06,474 --> 01:27:09,340\nI'm, I don't have that broken page there.\n\n1746\n01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:10,990\n>> You know that happens sometimes.\n\n1747\n01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:15,210\nIs that the older browser goes to a site\nand it's broken, things aren't working.\n\n1748\n01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:17,930\nLike, I can recognize here\nthe movie is not playing and stuff.\n\n1749\n01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:21,770\nAnd you don't see that option\nto turn on compatibility view.\n\n1750\n01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:23,230\nAnd who knows why that doesn't turn up.\n\n1751\n01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:25,500\nBut there is another way to set it, right?\n\n1752\n01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,790\n>> Yeah.\n>> If we go into our Tools menu.\n\n1753\n01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:29,660\nYou'll see in there,\ncompatibility view settings.\n\n1754\n01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:33,710\nNow, I like this screen,\nbecause you can set this up ahead of time.\n\n1755\n01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:37,190\nYou can do this in a group policy\nobject to affect your whole company and\n\n1756\n01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:39,130\nyou can do wild cards.\n\n1757\n01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:42,080\nSo you could say, like *.Microsoft.com.\n\n1758\n01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,650\nSo any Microsoft website,\nthrow it in compatibility view.\n\n1759\n01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:47,570\nOr, you know, for\nus it's edutainmentlive.com.\n\n1760\n01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:48,440\nSo it shows up there.\n\n1761\n01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,050\nWe can just add that in.\n\n1762\n01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:52,170\nYou don't have to do a wildcard.\n\n1763\n01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:53,430\nBut we can chuck that one in.\n\n1764\n01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:55,840\nYou'll see www.msn.com\nis already in the list.\n\n1765\n01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,730\nAgain, just saying,\nif I come back to this page,\n\n1766\n01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:59,540\nautomatically fill it\nin compatibility view.\n\n1767\n01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:00,630\n>> Yeah.\n\n1768\n01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:03,170\nThe other option that you have of course,\nis this last option.\n\n1769\n01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:03,850\nDisplay all websites in\n\n1770\n01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:04,550\ncompatibility view,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1771\n01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:06,056\n>> That way you don't even have\n\n1772\n01:28:06,056 --> 01:28:07,130\nto make a decision.\n\n1773\n01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:10,815\nBut again, if you're only hitting a few\nsites that are constantly doing this,\n\n1774\n01:28:10,815 --> 01:28:12,740\nwhy render everything in that order?\n\n1775\n01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:14,767\nSo there we go.\nAnd I can click close.\n\n1776\n01:28:18,424 --> 01:28:19,580\nHere we go.\n\n1777\n01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,440\nSo, if we look at it, it's still.\n\n1778\n01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:27,120\nThese older versions of Internet Explorer,\nour website uses HTML5 pretty heavily and\n\n1779\n01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,390\nthe older versions of Internet Explorer\njust don't do a great job with HTML5.\n\n1780\n01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:35,290\nYou get into Internet Explorer 10 and\n11, they work great.\n\n1781\n01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:39,496\nChrome, Firefox, Safari, they all work\ngreat because they all support HTML5.\n\n1782\n01:28:39,496 --> 01:28:42,240\nIt's one of the reasons why we need\nto keep our web browsers up to date\n\n1783\n01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,040\nis to be able to support the newer\nfeatures that are on there.\n\n1784\n01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,260\nIf you don't, you get things like this.\n\n1785\n01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:48,575\nSo normally when you come to our website,\n\n1786\n01:28:48,575 --> 01:28:50,570\nthere's a nice little video\nthat plays at the top.\n\n1787\n01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:53,850\nWe don't see that cuz we're not\nsupporting the HTML5 rendering for that.\n\n1788\n01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:57,520\nAnd then other little things,\nlike our On Air button up there is\n\n1789\n01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,826\na square instead of a circle,\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n1790\n01:28:59,826 --> 01:29:03,034\n>> Because it's not supporting\nthe CSS3 border strings.\n\n1791\n01:29:03,034 --> 01:29:07,630\nAnd so you get weird little quirks like\nthat, but the pages look good enough to\n\n1792\n01:29:07,630 --> 01:29:11,280\nbe able to function, so that's really\nwhat compatibility view is all about.\n\n1793\n01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,440\nHopefully your web pages have been\nupdated to support the new standards, but\n\n1794\n01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,320\nthe other side is you.\n\n1795\n01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:19,350\nYou need to update your version\nof Internet Explorer too.\n\n1796\n01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:22,780\nCompatibility view can help us to\ngain access to the older sites\n\n1797\n01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:25,260\nas they adapt to support\nthe newer browsers.\n\n1798\n01:29:27,190 --> 01:29:29,410\nAll right, so\nthat's basically compatibility view.\n\n1799\n01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:31,090\nNot too much excitement there.\n\n1800\n01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:33,700\nThere's a handful of other\nthings they want us to\n\n1801\n01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:37,900\ntake a look at just to be aware of\nin IE that we might be exposed to.\n\n1802\n01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:42,720\nMost of it just centers around your\nbasic settings for security and\n\n1803\n01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:47,200\nother content providers' add ons that\nwe have and in private browsing.\n\n1804\n01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,068\nSo let's take a look at\neach of these real quick.\n\n1805\n01:29:49,068 --> 01:29:51,620\nAgain, nothing earth-shattering in here.\n\n1806\n01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:52,900\nWe'll start with security settings.\n\n1807\n01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,060\n>> All right.\n\n1808\n01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:58,720\nSo if I go to Tools and then from\nthe Tools menu, Internet Options.\n\n1809\n01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:02,950\nWhat we of course have here in\nthe Internet Options are multiple tabs.\n\n1810\n01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:06,630\nAnd we're gonna center in on\nthe Security tab is what we're gonna do.\n\n1811\n01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:10,670\nAnd, so, notice that there are multiple\nzones in which we can put websites into,\n\n1812\n01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:15,470\nand again, that actually relaxes or\nrestricts our security settings, right?\n\n1813\n01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:19,480\n>> Yeah, so you might have a website\nthat makes extensive use of scripts, so\n\n1814\n01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:24,630\nit might have JavaScript or Visual Basic\nscript runs as part of that site, and\n\n1815\n01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:27,600\nInternet Explorer might block that for\nsecurity purposes.\n\n1816\n01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,220\nSo if you want to allow that,\n\n1817\n01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:32,580\nyou can add the site to what's\ncalled your trusted sites.\n\n1818\n01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:37,500\nEach of these levels here, Internet,\nlocal intranet, trusted sites,\n\n1819\n01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,810\nand the last one, restricted sites,\n\n1820\n01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:44,900\neach one is a different security level\nthat allows or reduces the access.\n\n1821\n01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:47,850\nDown at the bottom of the screen you'll\nsee where Ronnie's got the option\n\n1822\n01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:50,390\nto set the security level for each zone.\n\n1823\n01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:52,950\nAnd they're not really showing\na whole lot of information there.\n\n1824\n01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:54,930\nAnd that's because he's got\nit kind of at the defaults.\n\n1825\n01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:56,390\nBut if he hits Custom Level\n\n1826\n01:30:58,570 --> 01:31:02,250\nyou'll see a bunch of options here\nthat you can specify for each zone.\n\n1827\n01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:05,140\nAnd if you go to restricted sites,\nall the scripting,\n\n1828\n01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:06,780\nall the dynamic stuff is turned off.\n\n1829\n01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:08,000\nVery restrictive.\n\n1830\n01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,230\nIf you go to the trusted sites,\nall of that stuff is turned on.\n\n1831\n01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:13,610\nIt's very allowing or forgiving.\n\n1832\n01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:17,260\nSo if I know that I trust\nedgetainmentlive.com,\n\n1833\n01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:19,820\nI know that I want to allow things to run.\n\n1834\n01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:22,200\nWe can go into the sites and\nwe can add it in.\n\n1835\n01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:26,874\nNow, by default it wants your trusted\nsites to be SSL enabled, https.\n\n1836\n01:31:26,874 --> 01:31:30,830\nSo if it's a non secure site, that you're\ntrusting, you'll need to uncheck that box,\n\n1837\n01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:33,320\nlike Ronnie just did,\nbefore adding that in.\n\n1838\n01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,380\nThis screen also supports wild cards, so\n\n1839\n01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:38,390\nif you wanted *.edutainmentlive.com,\nyou could.\n\n1840\n01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:42,450\nIt will take that, and\ncatch all the sub domains also.\n\n1841\n01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:44,590\nOtherwise, it's just getting\nthe domains we enter in.\n\n1842\n01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:46,380\nAll right.\n\n1843\n01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:48,510\nOnce we're in the trusted site.\n\n1844\n01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:52,660\nNow we'll allow more sensitive\napplications to occur,\n\n1845\n01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:54,148\nthings like Web based scripting and stuff.\n\n1846\n01:31:54,148 --> 01:31:57,670\nIn fact Ronnie if you hit Okay,\nand then refresh,\n\n1847\n01:31:57,670 --> 01:32:02,160\nyou can see at the bottom of his Internet\nExplorer window, there's a little marker,\n\n1848\n01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,770\nthat tells you what zone you're in.\n\n1849\n01:32:03,770 --> 01:32:06,230\nAll right.\nAnd right now it's saying Unknown Zone,\n\n1850\n01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:07,225\nbecause the page loaded.\n\n1851\n01:32:07,225 --> 01:32:10,090\nOh, you know what it's doing?\n\n1852\n01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:12,150\nIt's showing unknown mixed, and\n\n1853\n01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:15,820\nthat means that our page is actually\nloading content from more than one domain.\n\n1854\n01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:18,170\nSo, we've got content\nfrom edutainmentlive.com,\n\n1855\n01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:22,820\nand that's trusted, and apparently we're\nloading some content from another domain.\n\n1856\n01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:24,660\nAnd so that's making it show up as mixed.\n\n1857\n01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:26,370\nSo we're getting a little warning there.\n\n1858\n01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:30,320\nYou may have to kind of tweak it a bit to\nfind exactly which domains you need to\n\n1859\n01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,310\ntrust to get it fully trusted.\n\n1860\n01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:35,020\nBut that's how these can be worked.\n\n1861\n01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:38,730\nIf there's a website that you absolutely\ndo not trust, you wanna block any of these\n\n1862\n01:32:38,730 --> 01:32:40,962\ncrazy scripts from running you\ncan put it in restricted side.\n\n1863\n01:32:40,962 --> 01:32:44,220\nBut I'll warn you,\nthat will break a lot of websites.\n\n1864\n01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:48,010\nA lot of websites won't function properly\nanymore because the restriction one is\n\n1865\n01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:48,720\nvery restricted.\n\n1866\n01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:49,960\nIt'll block cookies.\n\n1867\n01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:54,316\nSo you won't be able to log in to a site\nthat is in your restricted site zone.\n\n1868\n01:32:54,316 --> 01:32:55,900\nAll right.\n\n1869\n01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:57,818\nWhat are some of the other\nsettings that we've got in here?\n\n1870\n01:32:57,818 --> 01:33:00,823\nIf we get out of Security.\n\n1871\n01:33:00,823 --> 01:33:04,245\n>> Oops, no, no,\nI launched it from that little win.\n\n1872\n01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:04,745\n>> Yep.\n\n1873\n01:33:05,790 --> 01:33:10,140\nSo we've also got our Connections tab.\n\n1874\n01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:12,740\nThe connections tab is where\nwe can start to define\n\n1875\n01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:14,580\nhow we get connected to the internet.\n\n1876\n01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:17,450\nThe default is that we\nhave a straight up network\n\n1877\n01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:20,500\nconnection like a LAN connection\nthat gets us on the internet.\n\n1878\n01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,380\nBut you may not.\n\n1879\n01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:23,329\nYou may have dial-up, hopefully not.\n\n1880\n01:33:23,329 --> 01:33:25,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You might require a VPN to\n\n1881\n01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:26,410\nget to the internet.\n\n1882\n01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:29,470\nAnd so you can add those settings here And\nwhat that just says is,\n\n1883\n01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:34,370\nif I launch Internet Explorer, and my dial\nup or VPN connection, isn't turned on,\n\n1884\n01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:35,890\ngo ahead and turn it on for me.\n\n1885\n01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:42,075\nSo it will VPN or dial up, right then as\nneeded, but those are not normal right.\n\n1886\n01:33:42,075 --> 01:33:45,160\nBut your company might introduce a proxy.\n\n1887\n01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:47,950\nA proxy server you have to pass through,\nto get to the internet.\n\n1888\n01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:51,130\nA lot of companies do this to\nbe able to record web traffic,\n\n1889\n01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:55,940\nto track employee activities, or\njust to filter out malicious websites.\n\n1890\n01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:58,060\nRight.\nYou can use software like Websense\n\n1891\n01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:00,140\nto be able to block malicious traffic.\n\n1892\n01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:03,370\nSo if you go under LAN settings, you'll\nsee there's where you can punch in your\n\n1893\n01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:07,510\nproxy server, the address of the server,\nthe port number that it uses.\n\n1894\n01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:10,310\nAnd you can even specify credentials\nif necessary, like username and\n\n1895\n01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:14,860\npassword, to be able to access\nthat proxy and work with it.\n\n1896\n01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:16,980\nYou went, deep down in the advance there.\n\n1897\n01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:19,040\nYou've got where you can\nget really specific and\n\n1898\n01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:23,110\nsay here's the proxy for http,\nhere's for ftp and so on.\n\n1899\n01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:25,130\nSo, you can kind of lay that\nout based on the protocol.\n\n1900\n01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:28,368\nSo, a lot of cool stuff in here to\nbe able to provide that access.\n\n1901\n01:34:30,055 --> 01:34:31,544\nAll right.\n\n1902\n01:34:31,544 --> 01:34:33,910\nThat's really about it for this screen.\n\n1903\n01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:37,310\nThere are a few other bells and whistles\nin IE that we need to take a look at.\n\n1904\n01:34:37,310 --> 01:34:39,260\nFor example, add-ons.\n\n1905\n01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:42,090\nIn Internet Explorer,\nI think it was starting with IE7,\n\n1906\n01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:44,620\nthey gave us the ability to do add-ons and\n\n1907\n01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:47,960\nmost commonly the add-on we mess\nwith is our search provider, but\n\n1908\n01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:52,210\nthere's a ton of add-ons we can use\nto extend the functionality of IE.\n\n1909\n01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:54,720\nSo let's jump back over\nto Ronnie's machine.\n\n1910\n01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,890\nAnd Ronnie can you cancel out of that?\n\n1911\n01:34:56,890 --> 01:34:58,410\nLet's show how you got there.\n\n1912\n01:34:58,410 --> 01:35:00,880\n>> So, if I click on Tools\n>> And\n\n1913\n01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:06,080\nnotice that there is this option here for\nmanaging add-ons.\n\n1914\n01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:10,360\nAnd then from here, we have different\nadd-on types, toolbars and extensions.\n\n1915\n01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,930\nEverybody loves the Yahoo toolbar.\n\n1916\n01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:13,478\n>> Oh, you gotta have it.\n\n1917\n01:35:13,478 --> 01:35:15,570\n>> And then search providers,\nyeah like you said,\n\n1918\n01:35:15,570 --> 01:35:19,900\nif anything, this is the one I would\nagain actually mess with anything.\n\n1919\n01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:22,940\nAnd then we have these accelerators,\nDon what's about these accelerators here?\n\n1920\n01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:26,570\n>> You know the accelerators, the idea,\nand I don't use them myself, but\n\n1921\n01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:29,270\nthe idea is they give you\nthe ability to quickly do things.\n\n1922\n01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:32,490\nSee how it's got like email,\nBlog with Windows Live, Map with Bing,\n\n1923\n01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:33,930\ntranslate with Bing.\n\n1924\n01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:36,550\nSo let's take like Map with Bing.\n\n1925\n01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:40,300\nIf you go to a website that\nhas an address on it, right?\n\n1926\n01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:44,760\nYou can highlight the address and\nthe accelerator icon will show up right.\n\n1927\n01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,760\nAnd when that does you will see\nthe ability to map with Bing, and\n\n1928\n01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,500\nit will take you right to that map.\n\n1929\n01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,510\nYou can get accelerators for\nall sorts of things.\n\n1930\n01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:52,870\nGoogle Maps, whatever.\n\n1931\n01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:55,170\nAnd it's just quick and easy stuff.\n\n1932\n01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:59,987\nSo if you, Ronny jump back to\nthe ITv Pro page there and\n\n1933\n01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:03,210\njust highlight some text on there.\n\n1934\n01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:06,758\nWhen you highlight text, that's kind\nof what keys off the accelerator, and\n\n1935\n01:36:06,758 --> 01:36:09,060\nyou'll see it,\nthat icon appear, right there.\n\n1936\n01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:09,620\nYeah.\n\n1937\n01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:12,520\nThat's the accelerator icon,\nand if you click on that,\n\n1938\n01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:16,000\nit'll show things that you can\ndo with the word approach.\n\n1939\n01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,381\nAnd so you'll see map with Bing,\nsearch with Bing, translate with Bing.\n\n1940\n01:36:19,381 --> 01:36:21,320\nSo, these are the functionality.\n\n1941\n01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:23,861\nThese are the ones that\nare built into IE and\n\n1942\n01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:27,990\nusers can add more if they want\nto extend that functionality.\n\n1943\n01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:32,290\nThe problem is when users add stuff,\nit can obviously cause problems.\n\n1944\n01:36:32,290 --> 01:36:34,220\nSo you do need to be\ncareful with the add ins.\n\n1945\n01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:35,930\nYou can get malicious ones.\n\n1946\n01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:39,650\nThere are some out there that\nexploit the add-in system, so\n\n1947\n01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:44,410\nbe aware of that and just know that\nthere's quite a bit you can add.\n\n1948\n01:36:44,410 --> 01:36:45,810\nFor me, it's always changing Bing.\n\n1949\n01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:47,770\nSee how Bing's that default provider?\n\n1950\n01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:49,140\nNot a big fan of Bing.\n\n1951\n01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:53,830\nAnd so, I'll go into Manage my add-ons.\n\n1952\n01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:54,720\nThere we go.\n\n1953\n01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:57,740\nAnd under Search Providers,\nif I don't want bing,\n\n1954\n01:36:57,740 --> 01:37:00,520\ndown at the very bottom you'll see a link\nthat says Find more search providers.\n\n1955\n01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:04,040\nIt will take you to\nthe Microsoft Add-ins gallery.\n\n1956\n01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:06,579\nAnd you can come in here and you'll see\na bunch of them down at the bottom.\n\n1957\n01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:11,972\nSo you can pick which search provider\nyou want, Bing, Google, Yahoo, whatever.\n\n1958\n01:37:11,972 --> 01:37:13,714\n>> [CROSSTALK] Fourcovering?\n\n1959\n01:37:13,714 --> 01:37:14,585\n>> I've never even heard of that one.\n\n1960\n01:37:14,585 --> 01:37:19,472\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Google only got three stars?\n\n1961\n01:37:19,472 --> 01:37:20,854\n>> Oh dear.\n\n1962\n01:37:20,854 --> 01:37:22,271\nI wonder if Bing got four.\n\n1963\n01:37:22,271 --> 01:37:24,302\n>> It was probably five.\n\n1964\n01:37:24,302 --> 01:37:26,390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll add that one in.\n\n1965\n01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:27,610\nNow this is gonna add it in and\n\n1966\n01:37:27,610 --> 01:37:30,800\nwe have the opportunity to make\nit our default search provider.\n\n1967\n01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,220\nAnd let's do that Ronnie.\n\n1968\n01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:35,390\nSee at the top right, his little search\nbox, how it says Bing right now?\n\n1969\n01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:36,830\nThat's because it's the default.\n\n1970\n01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:40,580\nWhen you add this one in,\nwell, It switches to Google.\n\n1971\n01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:43,070\nNow, Google is the default\nsearch provider.\n\n1972\n01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:44,430\nAnd you still have Bing.\n\n1973\n01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:46,470\nIt's still there, but\nGoogle's the default.\n\n1974\n01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:49,180\nAnd you can change the priorities\nin the Manage Add-ons screen to\n\n1975\n01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:50,030\nchange that if you want.\n\n1976\n01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:53,180\nAll right.\n\n1977\n01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:57,420\nAnother feature that's available\nin IE is the in-private browsing.\n\n1978\n01:37:57,420 --> 01:38:02,350\nAll right, when you go to a website,\nwebsites create cookies, tracking tokens,\n\n1979\n01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:04,610\nall sorts of different\nthings while you're there.\n\n1980\n01:38:04,610 --> 01:38:07,550\nAnd if you're logged in,\nit's gonna know who you are.\n\n1981\n01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:09,780\nWell, what if you're testing a website,\nand\n\n1982\n01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:12,210\nyou need to test as\nlike an anonymous user?\n\n1983\n01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:14,630\nWell if you've already got\ncookies that show it's you,\n\n1984\n01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:17,700\nthen it's gonna recognize you and\nyou're logged in.\n\n1985\n01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:22,030\nSo what you can do is you can go up to the\nSafety menu and hit In Private Browsing,\n\n1986\n01:38:22,030 --> 01:38:26,460\nand it will launch a window that\nkeeps no history, no cookies,\n\n1987\n01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:29,600\nno information, and it's a unique session.\n\n1988\n01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,314\nSo now you can browse to\nthe site as a unique person.\n\n1989\n01:38:32,314 --> 01:38:34,875\nSo for example, Ronnie were you\nlogged in to the ITProTV site?\n\n1990\n01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:35,820\n>> No I was not.\n\n1991\n01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:36,470\nAll right.\n\n1992\n01:38:36,470 --> 01:38:40,130\nSo, if Ronnie were logged in to\nthe ITProTV site in the other window and\n\n1993\n01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:44,020\nhe browsed again in a separate normal\nwindow it would auto log him in.\n\n1994\n01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:48,556\nBut if he did it here in private it's an\nall new session, so he'd not be logged in.\n\n1995\n01:38:48,556 --> 01:38:52,520\nHe could log in as a different user,\nweb developers use this all the time for\n\n1996\n01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,042\ntesting websites.\n\n1997\n01:38:54,042 --> 01:38:58,240\nAll right, the joke early on was this was,\nthey called it porno mode, right,\n\n1998\n01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:02,300\nthat if you wanted to browse sites and\nnot leave a history, you'd use in private.\n\n1999\n01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:04,985\nBut where it really shines is testing.\n\n2000\n01:39:04,985 --> 01:39:07,123\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If you're testing websites and stuff,\n\n2001\n01:39:07,123 --> 01:39:11,148\nit's really useful to have an independent\nwindow that's got separate credentials,\n\n2002\n01:39:11,148 --> 01:39:12,813\nseparate tracking and all of that.\n\n2003\n01:39:12,813 --> 01:39:15,861\n>> I clutched on making a joke,\nso here we go.\n\n2004\n01:39:15,861 --> 01:39:18,450\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n2005\n01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:22,070\nAnd then the last thing I want\nto talk about are certificates.\n\n2006\n01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:25,100\nWhen you browse to secure websites,\n\n2007\n01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:29,420\nany website that uses SSL, there's\na certificate that gets checked to verify\n\n2008\n01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:34,540\nthat it is a safe and\ntrusted website, right?\n\n2009\n01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:37,210\nSo Ronnie,\nwhy don't you fire up Amazon.com.\n\n2010\n01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:38,440\n>> Amazon.com.\n\n2011\n01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:41,340\n>> Right, so when you go to Amazon.com,\nthe shopping site,\n\n2012\n01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:44,230\nit's not secure by default,\nyou're just browsing for products, Right?\n\n2013\n01:39:44,230 --> 01:39:45,610\nNo need to secure that.\n\n2014\n01:39:45,610 --> 01:39:48,614\nBut if you hit that sign\ninto your account button,\n\n2015\n01:39:52,074 --> 01:39:57,097\nthe sign in page, notice up at the top,\nits address bar now says https://,\n\n2016\n01:39:57,097 --> 01:40:02,030\nit's a secure page and all the way\nto the right, there's a yellow lock.\n\n2017\n01:40:02,030 --> 01:40:04,470\nThat means there's\na certificate on this page.\n\n2018\n01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:08,800\nWe trust the certificate so\nwe've got a secure connection.\n\n2019\n01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,120\nWell, why do we trust that certificate?\n\n2020\n01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:13,070\nWe trust it because Microsoft told us.\n\n2021\n01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:15,680\nAnd Microsoft said,\nyou should trust the certificate.\n\n2022\n01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:19,200\nBut you may have your own certificate\nprovider that you want to trust that\n\n2023\n01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,100\nMicrosoft doesn't know about.\n\n2024\n01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:21,470\nMaybe you have an internal one.\n\n2025\n01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:22,760\nSo we can manage this.\n\n2026\n01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:25,480\nWe can change who we trust and\nwho we don't.\n\n2027\n01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:26,170\nAll right.\n\n2028\n01:40:26,170 --> 01:40:27,930\nIn fact,\nwe were kind of on this screen earlier.\n\n2029\n01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:31,788\nIf we go back into our\nInternet Options and\n\n2030\n01:40:31,788 --> 01:40:37,420\ngo to our Security tab or wait,\nis it Privacy, Privacy tab.\n\n2031\n01:40:39,684 --> 01:40:40,462\nNope.\n\n2032\n01:40:40,462 --> 01:40:41,310\nHang on, where is it?\n\n2033\n01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:41,810\nContent?\n\n2034\n01:40:44,410 --> 01:40:45,410\n>> Yes.\n>> There we go.\n\n2035\n01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:47,160\nWe'll find it, there's only so many tabs.\n\n2036\n01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:51,130\nIf we go under our Content tab right there\nin the middle, you'll see Certificates.\n\n2037\n01:40:51,130 --> 01:40:56,060\nAnd it's got in here the ability for us to\nsee our own certificates, if we have any.\n\n2038\n01:40:56,060 --> 01:40:57,180\nWe normally don't.\n\n2039\n01:40:57,180 --> 01:41:00,190\nBut, you'll see trusted root\ncertification authorities.\n\n2040\n01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:00,930\nThat fourth tab.\n\n2041\n01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:01,840\nThere we go.\n\n2042\n01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,380\nHere's all of the certification\nauthorities that\n\n2043\n01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:06,270\nMicrosoft says we should trust.\n\n2044\n01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:07,300\nAnd, these are the big guys.\n\n2045\n01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:10,330\nThese are the ones that sell the majority\nof the certificates out there\n\n2046\n01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:11,570\non the Internet.\n\n2047\n01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:15,580\nBut if there's somebody in here you\ndon't trust, you can remove them.\n\n2048\n01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:18,420\nYou can click on any of these roots and\nyou can remove them.\n\n2049\n01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:19,775\nYou're going to remove Microsoft, nice.\n\n2050\n01:41:19,775 --> 01:41:21,923\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think that's the one that they don't\n\n2051\n01:41:21,923 --> 01:41:22,984\nallow you to remove.\n\n2052\n01:41:22,984 --> 01:41:24,784\nActually you know what, it's not\nletting you remove, most of these.\n\n2053\n01:41:24,784 --> 01:41:26,210\n>> None of them, yeah.\n\n2054\n01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:28,980\n>> Are you not an administrator?\n\n2055\n01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:33,330\n>> I am.\nNo, apparently you have to go to Advanced.\n\n2056\n01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:37,450\nNope.\nIt's not letting me.\n\n2057\n01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:39,660\n>> Well I'll show you guys a work around,\nfor that then.\n\n2058\n01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:40,250\n>> All right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n2059\n01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:41,700\n>> If you add ones, in here,\n\n2060\n01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:44,460\nit'll let you remove, apparently it's not\nletting you remove those, there is a way\n\n2061\n01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:48,790\nto remove them, I'll show you guys in\njust a second, but we can add in our own.\n\n2062\n01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:52,900\nSo if we have our own root CA,\nwe can add it's certificate here.\n\n2063\n01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:56,180\nAnd once it's added,\nwe'll trust not just that root CA but\n\n2064\n01:41:56,180 --> 01:41:57,930\nevery certificate that it issues.\n\n2065\n01:41:57,930 --> 01:42:00,250\nAnd that's really useful in\nan enterprise environment.\n\n2066\n01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:03,050\nIf you're trying to do like\n802.1x authentication or\n\n2067\n01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:05,840\njust have your own certificates,\nit's a great way to do it.\n\n2068\n01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,900\nSo you can manage it right here.\n\n2069\n01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:11,340\nNow, this screen is a little bit\nlimited in what it lets us do.\n\n2070\n01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:14,240\nSo, let me show you another way\nthat we can manipulate these.\n\n2071\n01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:19,080\nInternet Explorer is actually loading\nthese from the Window security database.\n\n2072\n01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:22,750\nSo, Ronnie, if you just bring up\nyour start menu and type in MMC,\n\n2073\n01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:27,700\nMMC is short for\nMicrosoft Management Console and\n\n2074\n01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:31,376\nin here we can go to file and\nadd/remove snap in.\n\n2075\n01:42:31,376 --> 01:42:32,910\n>> [LAUGH] Maybe.\n\n2076\n01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:34,940\n>> And\nwe want to add the certificate snap in.\n\n2077\n01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:37,950\nAnd we'll do it for your user account.\n\n2078\n01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:38,660\nThat's the default.\n\n2079\n01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:39,830\nSo my user account, that's fine.\n\n2080\n01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:45,260\nAll right, so\nthis is the full certificate panel.\n\n2081\n01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:47,170\nWe can see basically the same information.\n\n2082\n01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:49,870\nInstead of tabs though,\nwe get nice little folders, and\n\n2083\n01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:54,270\nif you click on let's see,\nwhere are the trusted, yeah there we go.\n\n2084\n01:42:54,270 --> 01:42:56,900\nTrusted roots certification authorities.\n\n2085\n01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:59,970\nWe'll see the same exact\nlist from Internet Explorer.\n\n2086\n01:42:59,970 --> 01:43:03,400\nThe difference here though, is we should\nbe able to remove the search, right.\n\n2087\n01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:06,880\nIf you right-click on one of those,\nthere we go, yep.\n\n2088\n01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:09,010\nSo, Internet Explorer wasn't\nletting us remove it,\n\n2089\n01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:11,190\nbut we can remove right\nhere through the full MMC.\n\n2090\n01:43:11,190 --> 01:43:12,840\nSo there is a way.\n\n2091\n01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:13,860\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2092\n01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:17,470\n>> But basically, we don't normally remove\nthese, cuz these are the big companies.\n\n2093\n01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:19,370\nThey're issuing search all\nover the Internet, and\n\n2094\n01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:21,460\nthese are trustworthy companies.\n\n2095\n01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:23,170\nBut, you might want to add to it.\n\n2096\n01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:25,059\nAnd so again, we can add in pretty easily.\n\n2097\n01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:27,690\nAll right.\n\n2098\n01:43:27,690 --> 01:43:29,840\nSo, those are some of the things\nthat we need to think about when\n\n2099\n01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,740\nit comes to managing Internet Explorer.\n\n2100\n01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:35,080\nWe did all this locally, here on\nthe machine, but like I said earlier,\n\n2101\n01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:38,980\nif you wanna see how to deploy this\nacross your entire environment,\n\n2102\n01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:40,320\njump over to the 7411 show.\n\n2103\n01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:44,880\nIt's a Windows server 2012 show and I\nshow in that one, I think it was Nate and\n\n2104\n01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:48,490\nI that did it, or it might have been you\nand I, Ronnie, where we created a group\n\n2105\n01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:51,690\npolicy object that managed\nInternet Explorer settings and\n\n2106\n01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:54,320\ncertificates and\npushed it across the Internet.\n\n2107\n01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:58,560\nWe actually did like a four episode\nseries on group policy objects and\n\n2108\n01:43:58,560 --> 01:43:59,550\nshowed how to do all that.\n\n2109\n01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:03,200\nSo really good stuff to be found there.\n\n2110\n01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:06,390\nRonnie, can you think of anything\nelse in IE we need to worry about?\n\n2111\n01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:07,180\n>> No.\nI think that\n\n2112\n01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:08,460\npretty much covers everything.\n\n2113\n01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:11,550\n>> All right.\nSo in our first two episodes,\n\n2114\n01:44:11,550 --> 01:44:14,320\nwe've talked about getting\nWindows 7 installed.\n\n2115\n01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:19,240\nIn this episode, we got that chance to see\nhow we start to manage Windows 7 itself,\n\n2116\n01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:22,650\nas far as the applications we run and\nthe other software, compatibility,\n\n2117\n01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:24,020\nwe spent a lot of time on that.\n\n2118\n01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:27,495\nSo all really good information,\nnot just because it's on the exam,\n\n2119\n01:44:27,495 --> 01:44:31,890\nwhich of course it is, because it's\nvery useable in real life land.\n\n2120\n01:44:31,890 --> 01:44:35,870\nIf you're company's still on Windows XP,\nyou need to get to Windows 7 as soon as\n\n2121\n01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:38,230\nyou can,\ncuz Windows XP is no longer supported.\n\n2122\n01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:40,040\nSo, you don't want to\nbe caught in that jam.\n\n2123\n01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:42,020\nAll right.\n\n2124\n01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:46,070\nWell, let me just remind everybody\nif you have any questions on this\n\n2125\n01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:49,300\njump on over to itpro.tv slash live.\n\n2126\n01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,560\nLive during the show\nyou'll see the chat box.\n\n2127\n01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,740\nRight beneath your video you\ncan post your questions.\n\n2128\n01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:55,800\nWe monitor and answer during the show.\n\n2129\n01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,200\nIf you're watching this after hours,\nyou're watching it recorded, well you're\n\n2130\n01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:05,590\nnot left out to dry there, use the Q&A\nlink at the top of every itpro.tv page.\n\n2131\n01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:07,210\nThat'll take you to our Q&A forums,\n\n2132\n01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:10,030\nyou can post your questions there,\nwe monitor and answer.\n\n2133\n01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:12,170\nWe wanna make sure you guys get\nthe information you need so\n\n2134\n01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:13,960\nyou can be successful on the exams.\n\n2135\n01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:17,200\nSo take advantage of that resource,\nit is there for you.\n\n2136\n01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:19,650\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n2137\n01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:22,361\nSigning out for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n2138\n01:45:22,361 --> 01:45:23,325\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n2139\n01:45:23,325 --> 01:45:25,264\n>> And we will see you next time.\n\n2140\n01:45:25,264 --> 01:45:35,264\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:39,231\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:42,220\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\ntoday with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,210\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,348\n>> I am very pleased today, because I can\nannounce I will be the next Spiderman.\n\n7\n00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:48,184\n>> Really?\n\n8\n00:00:48,184 --> 00:00:49,720\n>> No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n9\n00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,510\n>> Hang on,\n\n10\n00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,710\nbecause Ben Affleck's gonna\nbe the next Batman, so\n\n11\n00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,980\nthey've pretty much opened the floodgates.\n\n12\n00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,330\n>> I thought that it would be a welcome\nchange in the Spiderman series there.\n\n13\n00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,329\n>> Do you remember in the 80s\n>> When anybody who wanted one could have\n\n14\n00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,184\ntheir own talk show?\n\n15\n00:01:03,184 --> 00:01:04,060\n>> Yes.\n\n16\n00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,130\n>> Now, anybody who wants to\ncan be Spiderman and or Batman.\n\n17\n00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,150\n>> Well, there you go.\n\n18\n00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,140\n>> So [LAUGH],\nthat's our backup career, guys.\n\n19\n00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,980\nIn case this whole IT thing\ndoesn't work out, Batman.\n\n20\n00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,440\n>> So it's either Batman or Spiderman,\nor a Subway sandwich artist?\n\n21\n00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,260\n>> So there is so\nmany opportunities available.\n\n22\n00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,025\nAnd then in that commercial truck driving.\n\n23\n00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:27,820\n[LAUGH] All right,\nenough of the alternatives.\n\n24\n00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,395\nLet's get back to our actual,\nhopefully, future careers.\n\n25\n00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:32,640\n>> Right.\n>> Which is IT.\n\n26\n00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,295\nSo, we're continuing with another\nepisode of Windows 7 today.\n\n27\n00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,370\nRight?\nWe've had some really good episodes\n\n28\n00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,690\nleading up to this.\n\n29\n00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,160\nWe're going to move into\nGeneral Networking.\n\n30\n00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,780\nAnd if you've already done\nthe Network+ certification or\n\n31\n00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,410\nat least watched the Network+ show,\n\n32\n00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,050\nwe're probably not gonna blow your\nmind with anything exciting here.\n\n33\n00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,120\nRight?\nBecause networking is pretty standard.\n\n34\n00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,515\nBut if you're just jumping here,\nthis is really important to know.\n\n35\n00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:57,010\n>> Right.\n>> Because it is so rare, these days,\n\n36\n00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,203\nto have a computer that isn't\nconnected to a network.\n\n37\n00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,905\n>> Yeah.\n>> That is pretty much a given,\n\n38\n00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:04,210\nthat if you are gonna be using windows or\nreally any PC,\n\n39\n00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,490\nthat you are gonna be connected\nphysically or wireless to a network.\n\n40\n00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,108\nSo, we need to take a look at that.\n\n41\n00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:14,280\nWe are gonna be taking a look at IPv4,\nwhich is still, the most\n\n42\n00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,580\ncommon network protocol in the world but\nwe're also gonna take a look at IPv6.\n\n43\n00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,670\nAnd for some people this might\nbe your first exposure to IPv6.\n\n44\n00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,000\nThere's a lot of misinformation out there.\n\n45\n00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,030\nThere's a lot of people\nwho get intimidated by it,\n\n46\n00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,520\nbecause it's a weird protocol,\nbut it's actually really nice.\n\n47\n00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,770\nIt works really well,\nand it is the future.\n\n48\n00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,070\nSo it's something that we need to\nlearn and get comfortable with.\n\n49\n00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,130\nSo that's what we're gonna be launching\nwith as we start the episode,\n\n50\n00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,320\nwe've got some more stuff down the road,\n\n51\n00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,570\nwe'll have to play it by ear\n>> Right.\n\n52\n00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,930\n>> To see how much we\nactually get through.\n\n53\n00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,500\nBut simple things like network settings,\nI'm sure we'll get to that.\n\n54\n00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,845\nAnd then we'll get to some\nfirewall stuff later on.\n\n55\n00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:49,800\n>> Right.\n>> We'll talk about too.\n\n56\n00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,750\nSo, Ronnie, let's get started.\n\n57\n00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,320\n>> Sure.\n>> Let's jump into IPv4.\n\n58\n00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,820\n>> Yeah.\n\n59\n00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,620\n>> So, the first thing I want\nto mention is something I\n\n60\n00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,230\nalways forget to say in shows.\n\n61\n00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,260\nI can't say always anymore\ncuz I remembered this time.\n\n62\n00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,080\nIs what does that name mean, IPv4?\n\n63\n00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,595\nIP stands for Internet Protocol and\nv4 means it's version four.\n\n64\n00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:13,295\nNow, there is no version\none through three.\n\n65\n00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:16,268\nThere may have been at some point,\nbut they never were released.\n\n66\n00:03:16,268 --> 00:03:18,125\n>> Right.\n>> So, when somebody is running IP,\n\n67\n00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,465\nthey're pretty much running IPv4,\nthat's pretty much what's out there.\n\n68\n00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:23,655\nSo, this is a pretty common thing.\n\n69\n00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:29,080\nIt's really a standard of addressing\nthat was designed for the Internet.\n\n70\n00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,300\nDesigned for networks that are really,\nreally, really big.\n\n71\n00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,040\n>> Yeah.\n\n72\n00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,830\n>> And the Internet is\nthe biggest of the networks.\n\n73\n00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,320\nSo, that's what IPv4 was designed for.\n\n74\n00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,730\nAnd now we use it not just on the Internet\nbut you use it on our local area networks,\n\n75\n00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,200\non private networks, we use it all\nover the place, very flexible.\n\n76\n00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,330\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then IPv6 is\n\n77\n00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,960\njust Internet Protocol version six,\nit's the next kind of generation.\n\n78\n00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,330\nYou might ask yourself,\nwhat happened to IPV5?\n\n79\n00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,940\nThe back story,\nI've never actually looked it up.\n\n80\n00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,010\n>> Yeah.\n>> But the back story that I was told was\n\n81\n00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,470\nthat there was actually a little\nbit of a trademark dispute.\n\n82\n00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,620\nThat, apparently IPv5,\nthat name was trademarked by some company.\n\n83\n00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,030\nSo, they said we'll just skip over it and\njump to IPv6.\n\n84\n00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,760\nSo, there is no V5.\n\n85\n00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,660\nSo, really in the world,\nyou're gonna see IPv4 very,\n\n86\n00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,090\nvery common and IPv6, which is growing.\n\n87\n00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,390\nYou're not gonna see IPv1 or\nv5 or whatever.\n\n88\n00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,372\n>> So\nin a couple of different scenarios for us.\n\n89\n00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:25,870\nRight?\nWhen we are actually at home and\n\n90\n00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,280\nwe're connecting to the Internet\nwe're gonna get an IPv4 address and\n\n91\n00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,890\neven an IPv6 address at times.\n\n92\n00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,570\nSame thing if you're actually\ninside of a business network.\n\n93\n00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,510\nYou'll see most of us are probably\nstill configuring IPv4 inside\n\n94\n00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,440\nof our networks to make sure\nthat machines have them.\n\n95\n00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,250\nAnd now again people\nare starting to test with IPv6.\n\n96\n00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,950\nWe even see IPv6 addresses\nthat are actually being\n\n97\n00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,040\nautomatically generated as well.\n\n98\n00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,810\nSo this is incredibly common topic.\n\n99\n00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,330\nIt's something that you and I should\nactually be incredibly familiar with.\n\n100\n00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,710\nAnd so we're gonna at least\ngo over the basics here.\n\n101\n00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,890\n>> Yeah.\nNow we kind of start out simple,\n\n102\n00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,440\njust going through our objectives here and\nwe start off with Connect to a Network.\n\n103\n00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:03,990\nRight?\n\n104\n00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,580\nHow do we connect to a network?\n\n105\n00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,980\nThere are a number of different ways.\n\n106\n00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,850\nThe two most common ways\nare with a physical network\n\n107\n00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,120\ncable run into what's called a RJ-45 jack.\n\n108\n00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,950\nSo, like on my laptop,\nand yours too, Ronnie.\n\n109\n00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,024\nNeither of us have physical\nnetwork jacks on our laptops.\n\n110\n00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:24,310\n>> Right.\n>> So we actually have to use\n\n111\n00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,220\na little adapters, which I've got\none sitting around here somewhere.\n\n112\n00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,740\nHere we go.\n\n113\n00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,790\nSo your laptop may or\nmay not have a network connection.\n\n114\n00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,080\n>> Right.\n>> You might have to add one.\n\n115\n00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,900\nAnd this one, it just has a USB connection\non one side, and an RJ-45 network\n\n116\n00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,929\njack right here, which is just a,\nit kinda looks like a big phone plug.\n\n117\n00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:46,500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because is what it looks like.\n\n118\n00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,170\nBut you can plug a physical cable into\nthat and get connected to a network.\n\n119\n00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,660\nNow, this was the most common way\nof connecting up until about,\n\n120\n00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,750\nI don't know, eight years ago or so,\nwhen wireless really started to take off.\n\n121\n00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,230\nAlmost every laptop and\n\n122\n00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,890\na lot of desktops these days have wireless\nconnectivity built right into them.\n\n123\n00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,485\nAnd so\nwe have a number of standards there.\n\n124\n00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:11,599\n802.11, A, B, G, N, AC.\n>> Yeah.\n\n125\n00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:17,690\n>> All these different standards that\nare out there for wireless communications.\n\n126\n00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,846\nWith those,\nit's nice because you don't need a cable.\n\n127\n00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:20,810\n>> Yeah.\n>> You don't need something that you\n\n128\n00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,510\nphysically plug in.\n\n129\n00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,780\nIt's just, it's native and\nit's right there.\n\n130\n00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,090\nAnd that's why neither of our laptops have\nphysical connections because they have\n\n131\n00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,730\nwireless in them and\nthey can use that, and\n\n132\n00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,025\nif you want a physical\nconnection you can add it.\n\n133\n00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,540\nRight?\nSo,\n\n134\n00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,775\ngetting connected to the network is\nnormally as simple as plugging in a cable.\n\n135\n00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:39,450\nRight?\nOr choosing a wireless network.\n\n136\n00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,060\nRight?\n\n137\n00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,270\nWell, let's take a look at that.\n\n138\n00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,120\nRonnie, on your laptop because I\nknow mine's a little bit different.\n\n139\n00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,520\nCan you show them how you're\nconnected to a wireless network?\n\n140\n00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,930\n>> Sure.\n\n141\n00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,310\nOkay.\nSo, even though we're actually taking\n\n142\n00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,040\na look at the idea of Windows 8 here, the\nconnection network inside of the operating\n\n143\n00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,980\nsystem is just about the same here.\n\n144\n00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,670\nSo, for me, if I actually go ahead and,\noh, let me see if I can bring this up.\n\n145\n00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,472\n>> Oh there we go.\n\n146\n00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:07,290\n>> [LAUGH]\nTrying to get, there we go.\n\n147\n00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,550\nLet's see, settings.\n\n148\n00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,705\nAnd then into the Control Panel.\n\n149\n00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:19,385\n>> And, this is Windows 8, here.\n\n150\n00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:20,410\n>> Yeah.\n>> What we're looking at,\n\n151\n00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,795\nbut in Windows 7,\nit's really the same basic way.\n\n152\n00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:26,825\nIt's a little bit different in the system\ntray, you'll see a little wireless signal.\n\n153\n00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:28,605\nAnd if it's green,\nthat means you're connected.\n\n154\n00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,105\nIf it's gray, it's means that you're not.\n\n155\n00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:33,505\nAnd when you click on it, you get a list\nof wireless networks just like this.\n\n156\n00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:35,915\nNow in Windows 8 makes it look flat and\nnew.\n\n157\n00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:39,035\nWindows 7 it's a little bit\nmore like a gray pop-up.\n\n158\n00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:43,230\nBut basically, you just see your wireless\nnetwork and click on it to connect.\n\n159\n00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,600\nIf it's a protected network you\nmay have to put in a password but\n\n160\n00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,620\notherwise you get connected.\n\n161\n00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,150\nAll right.\n\n162\n00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,406\nNow a physical network connection\nis a little bit different.\n\n163\n00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:56,632\nAnd let me bring up my machine here and\nI'll show you a physical connection.\n\n164\n00:07:56,632 --> 00:08:00,163\nAnd again my head's gonna cover it so\nlet's go.\n\n165\n00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:00,951\nThere we go.\n\n166\n00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:02,670\nAnd you can see down here, whoops.\n\n167\n00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,970\nAnd you can see down here that I\ndon't have a little wireless signal.\n\n168\n00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,858\nAnd this is, actually, you know, what?\n\n169\n00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:10,000\nThis is Windows 8 also.\n\n170\n00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,150\nShoot.\nDo you have Windows 7 machine pulled up?\n\n171\n00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,280\n>> I do\n>> Let's switch to that.\n\n172\n00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,150\n>> Yep\n>> I keep pulling up a Windows 8 machine.\n\n173\n00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,410\nSo on my computer here,\n\n174\n00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,990\nI do have a Windows 7 machine\nrunning in our labs here.\n\n175\n00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,720\nYou can see the icon here\nlooks a little bit different.\n\n176\n00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400\nNow to me, when I first saw it,\nI was like,\n\n177\n00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,790\nwhy do they have a pitchfork right beside\nan actual computer screen that you see?\n\n178\n00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,680\nNow, this particular virtual machine\nis not connected to the network.\n\n179\n00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,550\nIf you get a little symbol that says,\nhey, it's not connected to the internet.\n\n180\n00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,840\nBut it's not a pitchfork.\n\n181\n00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,410\nI found this out.\n\n182\n00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:41,460\nIt's actually a little network RJ45\nconnector on the left hand side.\n\n183\n00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,158\n>> It's microscopic but.\n\n184\n00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,860\n>> Yeah, it's microscopic, but\nthat's what I always thought.\n\n185\n00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,200\nSo there's the actual physical connection\nin terms of what it looks like now for us.\n\n186\n00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,540\n>> Now if that cable were unplugged,\n\n187\n00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,390\nthere'd be a little red x on it letting\nyou know that the cable wasn't plugged in.\n\n188\n00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,250\nIn Ronnie's case, he has a cable plugged\nin, but it has no internet access.\n\n189\n00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,260\nSo there's that little yellow circle\nwith a black exclamation point.\n\n190\n00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,460\nIt's really hard to tell what that is,\nbut it is what it is.\n\n191\n00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,590\nThat's a warning saying,\ncable's plugged in.\n\n192\n00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,920\nWe can't get to the internet.\n\n193\n00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,010\nWindows automatically tries to\nget out there to the internet.\n\n194\n00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,250\n>> Yeah, a lot of times if\nyou end up hovering over it,\n\n195\n00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,495\neven in Windows 7 as you see, mine\njust tells me that no internet access.\n\n196\n00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:24,175\nIf you gotta red x,\nit's gonna tell you it's not connected.\n\n197\n00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:25,715\n>> Yeah.\n>> So very easy to spot when you're\n\n198\n00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:27,105\nconnected or not.\n\n199\n00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:29,895\n>> Now, almost all of our network\nconfiguration in Windows 7 is\n\n200\n00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:33,185\ndone through what's called the Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n201\n00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:35,775\nAnd all you have to do is\nright-click on your Network icon.\n\n202\n00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,735\nAnd it doesn't matter\nif it's a wireless one.\n\n203\n00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:39,990\nYou'll see the little strength bars.\n\n204\n00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,990\nIn the wired connection,\nyou just see the port there.\n\n205\n00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,820\nYou can right click and choose,\nopen network and sharing center.\n\n206\n00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,980\nYou can also get to this\nthrough the control panel.\n\n207\n00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,780\nI never go that way.\n\n208\n00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,920\nSo I have to hunt around for it.\n\n209\n00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,520\nBut you can go through the control panel\nor you can search through your Start menu.\n\n210\n00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,530\nEither way, you can get to the Network and\nSharing Centre.\n\n211\n00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,680\nNow, the main page in the Network and\n\n212\n00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,867\nSharing Centre focuses on some of\nthe various services that we can provide.\n\n213\n00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:07,542\nThings like sharing files, and so on.\n\n214\n00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:10,940\nBut what I want to look at,\nis the adaptor itself.\n\n215\n00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,140\nSo on the left side, we'll see a link\nthat says, change adaptor settings.\n\n216\n00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,520\nAnd when you click on that,\nyou will see all of your wired and\n\n217\n00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,530\nwireless adapters and\nyou can go and manipulate them.\n\n218\n00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,180\nOn the wireless side, there's not a whole\nheck of a lot that we need to manipulate.\n\n219\n00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,850\nBut on the wired side, there may be some\nadditional things that we need to tweak.\n\n220\n00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,542\nWith the wireless network, you're either\nconnected or you're not connected.\n\n221\n00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:37,570\nYou know, that's basically,\nit as far as the network itself.\n\n222\n00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,670\nOn a wired network though, when you're\nconnected there's various things like your\n\n223\n00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,640\nspeed and your duplex that\nwe may need to manipulate.\n\n224\n00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,780\nNow, if you're not\nfamiliar with those terms,\n\n225\n00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,770\nlet me just kind of summarize them quick.\n\n226\n00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:53,650\nOn speed, most networks are either\ngoing to be either 10 megabit,\n\n227\n00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:59,000\n100 megabit or\na gigabit which is a 1,000 megabit.\n\n228\n00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,940\nI mean, when I say megabit,\nI mean, megabits per second.\n\n229\n00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,530\nAll right?\n\n230\n00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,710\nAnd that means that mega is one million.\n\n231\n00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:11,610\nSo one million bits per second can be\ntransmitted through that network adapter.\n\n232\n00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,510\nSo if I have a 100 megabit adapter,\n\n233\n00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,870\nI can send 100 million bits\nper second out that adapter.\n\n234\n00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,300\nThat's a lot.\n\n235\n00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,570\nGigabit though.\n\n236\n00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,890\nIt's even higher.\n\n237\n00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,509\nThat's where it becomes again,\nit would be what?\n\n238\n00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:27,263\nA billion.\n\n239\n00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:31,260\nOne billion bits per second\nout that network adapter.\n\n240\n00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,520\nWhat is yours?\n\n241\n00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,220\nTen gigabit, are you kidding me?\n\n242\n00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:39,480\n>> [LAUGH] Being a virtual machine, we can\npretty much set it at whatever we want to,\n\n243\n00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,490\nbut here's what Dom's talking about.\n\n244\n00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,610\nThe speed that you actually\nsee right here, okay?\n\n245\n00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,070\nMIne is apparently a ten gigabits.\n\n246\n00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,075\nSo you're not gonna beat him.\n\n247\n00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:48,850\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, and it's true.\n\n248\n00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,590\nSo ten gigabits is the fastest\ncommercially available\n\n249\n00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,820\nconnection right now.\n\n250\n00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,620\nIf you go to CDW or TigerDirect,\nor Newegg, or whatever,\n\n251\n00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,590\nyou go to buy network adaptors,\nyou can buy ten gigabit network adapters.\n\n252\n00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,630\nThey're incredibly expensive, and\nmost networks don't support it just yet.\n\n253\n00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,360\nNow, I say that today.\n\n254\n00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,350\nTwo years from now they'll\nprobably be common place.\n\n255\n00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,350\nBut right now, ten gigabit is\nstill prohibitively expensive.\n\n256\n00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,930\nThe network adapter itself would\ncost you several hundred dollars.\n\n257\n00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,080\nThe switches cost you thousands\nupon thousands of dollars.\n\n258\n00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,670\nSo, they do get very, very expensive.\n\n259\n00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,520\nBut you'll see that speed there.\n\n260\n00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,990\nThe speed by default in\nWindows is auto negotiated.\n\n261\n00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,210\nIn other words, your computer will\nlook at the network connection and\n\n262\n00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,230\ntry and\nfigure out the fastest that it can run.\n\n263\n00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,070\nAt the same time, it's gonna figure\nout what's called the duplex.\n\n264\n00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,940\nDuplex means whether or\nnot you can send and\n\n265\n00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,280\nreceive data at the same time.\n\n266\n00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,360\nWhen we take a standard network cable,\n\n267\n00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,280\nwhich- Do we have one of\nthose sitting around here?\n\n268\n00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,820\nYes, here.\n\n269\n00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,350\nWhoops, sorry.\n\n270\n00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,720\nI could practically break myself here.\n\n271\n00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,280\nSo this is kind of\na standard network cable.\n\n272\n00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,490\nAnd it's gonna be hard to see here\n>> Yeah.\n\n273\n00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,030\n>> Just cuz they're not very big, right?\n\n274\n00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,370\nYou can see it's smaller\nthan my fingernail.\n\n275\n00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,680\nBut inside of a standard network cable,\nthere's actually eight wires.\n\n276\n00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,910\nAnd when you send the communication\nover the eight wires,\n\n277\n00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,930\nwell different network technologies can\ndivide those cables up in different ways.\n\n278\n00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,680\nAnd so some of them can use\nsome cables to send data or\n\n279\n00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,310\ntransmit, and\nother cables to receive data.\n\n280\n00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,570\nSo you have transmit and\nreceive wires inside of there.\n\n281\n00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:34,570\nIf you're network card supports it,\nyou can send and receive at the same time.\n\n282\n00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,600\nWhich effectively doubles your bandwidth,\nright?\n\n283\n00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,180\n>> Yeah.\n\n284\n00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,190\n>> If I have a gigabit connection and\nI can send and receive at the same time,\n\n285\n00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,950\nI can actually be moving\ntwo gigabits of data.\n\n286\n00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,550\nOne gig out, one gig in.\n\n287\n00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,790\nAnd you can really get\nsome good performance.\n\n288\n00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,970\nOlder systems couldn't do that.\n\n289\n00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,070\nOlder systems could either send or\nreceive.\n\n290\n00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,940\nThey couldn't do them\nboth at the same time.\n\n291\n00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,210\nSo if you had a ten megabit connection,\nyou were either sending ten megabit or\n\n292\n00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,760\nreceiving ten megabit.\n\n293\n00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,700\nYou couldn't divide between\nthe two at the same time.\n\n294\n00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,531\nThat communication is called half-duplex.\n\n295\n00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:14,085\nFull-duplex means you can send and\nreceive at the same time.\n\n296\n00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:16,595\nHalf-duplex means you can only do one or\nthe other.\n\n297\n00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:20,555\nNow on physical network connection,\nif you are gigabit or\n\n298\n00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:22,845\nhigher, it forces full duplex.\n\n299\n00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:25,155\nSo most of us are using full duplex now.\n\n300\n00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,215\nBut I bring it up here,\nbecause of wireless networks.\n\n301\n00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:34,045\nWireless antennas can only send or\nreceive to one person at a time.\n\n302\n00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:39,500\nSo wireless communications are half duplex\nunless you have more than one antenna.\n\n303\n00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,910\nAnd a lot of access points these days,\ndo have more than one antenna.\n\n304\n00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,270\nBut a lot of laptops don't.\n\n305\n00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,340\nAnd so, often times, wireless\nconnections on laptops are half duplex.\n\n306\n00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,200\nNot always, right?\n\n307\n00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,660\n>> Right.\n>> They do make them with more than one\n\n308\n00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,530\nantenna, but a lot of times,\nthey are half.\n\n309\n00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,390\nSo, so be aware of that duplexing.\n\n310\n00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,417\nAnd if we go back to Ronnie's machine,\n\n311\n00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:01,530\nyou know,\nhe went into the adapter settings there.\n\n312\n00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,450\nAnd you can right click on an adapter.\n\n313\n00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,608\nOh, you just double clicked on it.\n\n314\n00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:06,270\n>> Yep.\nSo if you double click on an adapter,\n\n315\n00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,770\nyou can see that information\nto see what the speed is.\n\n316\n00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,400\nNow you don't see the duplex here, but\n\n317\n00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,510\nagain with a gigabit connection like\nthat you know, it's full duplex.\n\n318\n00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,510\nBut you can see some basic details.\n\n319\n00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,050\nHow much data we've sent.\n\n320\n00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,310\nHow much data we've received.\n\n321\n00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,190\nHow long that connection has been up.\n\n322\n00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,500\nSo Ronnie's been plugged in for\nalmost an hour, right?\n\n323\n00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,120\n>> Yep.\n>> So we see that basic information there\n\n324\n00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,790\n>> And if you hit that properties button,\n\n325\n00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,530\nwe can go in and see additional settings.\n\n326\n00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:40,350\nNow some of these settings are related\nto the software running on the adapter.\n\n327\n00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,074\nSome are related to the hardware.\n\n328\n00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:46,435\nThe hardware settings are nested under\nthat configure button at the top.\n\n329\n00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:49,945\nAll of the other stuff on that screen\nis software settings,all right?\n\n330\n00:15:49,945 --> 00:15:51,985\nSo,let's start with the hardware side.\n\n331\n00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:56,026\nSo,here in the hardware, you'll see\ninformation about what the card is.\n\n332\n00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:57,389\nAnd under that driver tab,\n\n333\n00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,361\nyou'll see information about the driver\nthat we're using Software driver and\n\n334\n00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:05,047\nunder details, you'll see information\nabout the card itself, right?\n\n335\n00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:09,770\nYou can't really change anything on this\nscreen, you can just see information.\n\n336\n00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,900\nBut the Advanced tab,\nthat's where the action is.\n\n337\n00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,090\nUnder the Advanced tab, we can manipulate\nhow the card is actually working.\n\n338\n00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:21,620\nYou'll see things in here like\napparently you support TCP offload and\n\n339\n00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,730\na few other things.\n\n340\n00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,180\nBut often times,\nyou'll see the duplex in here and\n\n341\n00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,240\nyou can manipulate what the duplex,\nthat adapter is.\n\n342\n00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,490\nAnd it looks like your\nadapter doesn't support that.\n\n343\n00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,020\n>> Yeah.\n\n344\n00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,200\n>> Different adapters\nhave different options.\n\n345\n00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,870\nSometimes, you'll come in here and\nyou'll just see, what do you have,\n\n346\n00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,888\nmaybe 10 things there?\n\n347\n00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:41,360\nOther times, you come in and there might\nbe 40 or 50 things in that list, right.\n\n348\n00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,950\nDifferent hardware adapters\nhave different features,\n\n349\n00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,630\ndifferent things that can be enabled and\ndisabled.\n\n350\n00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,650\nSo some of them will have a duplex setting\nin there and you could physically set it\n\n351\n00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,050\nrequiring it to be full duplex or\nrequiring it to be half duplex.\n\n352\n00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,140\nOthers will have speed settings and so\n\n353\n00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,430\nyou can force it to run at 100 megabit or\nforce it to run at a gigabit.\n\n354\n00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,090\nSo you can manipulate those settings.\n\n355\n00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,320\nAgain, it varies by\nthe hardware manufacturer so\n\n356\n00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,820\ndon't expect to see the same\nsettings on every computer.\n\n357\n00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,260\nOn the hardware side,\nthings are different.\n\n358\n00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,960\nBut on the software side,\nthey're all the same.\n\n359\n00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,780\nSo back on this screen, we'll see the same\noptions here because this is software that\n\n360\n00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,310\nWindows has enabled on\nthat network adapter.\n\n361\n00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:25,790\nAnd we can manipulate this stuff and\nhandle our addressing, and so on.\n\n362\n00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,630\nSo, when it comes to\nconnecting to the network, for\n\n363\n00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,980\nthose of you who are familiar\nwith the OSI model.\n\n364\n00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,910\nIf you've done the network plus show or\n\n365\n00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,160\nexam, then you've learned\nabout the OSI model.\n\n366\n00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,090\nAnd if you haven't learned about it,\nI recommend you go and check that out.\n\n367\n00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,490\nJump over to those shows and watch,\n\n368\n00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,510\nI think it's the very\nfirst network flush show.\n\n369\n00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,800\nBut basically,\n\n370\n00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,650\nnetwork communications get divided up into\nlayers and what we're looking at here\n\n371\n00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:55,418\nis you have the physical network adapter\nwhich is at layer one and layer two.\n\n372\n00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:57,650\nAnd, that's what under\nthat configure button, so\n\n373\n00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,122\nwe're modifying the hardware\nof that adapter.\n\n374\n00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:04,755\nBut then, we also have the software\nsetting which are layer three and higher.\n\n375\n00:18:04,755 --> 00:18:07,635\nAnd all the little check boxes\nin the middle of that screen\n\n376\n00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:10,125\nis really layer three stuff.\n\n377\n00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:15,220\nAnd so we're seeing TCP IP version 4,\nIP version 6, and some of the other stuff.\n\n378\n00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,510\nThis is all dealing with the software\ncommunications on our system.\n\n379\n00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,810\n>> Yes.\n\n380\n00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,960\n>> All right, now when we get Windows,\na fresh install on a machine and\n\n381\n00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,820\nwe connect to a wireless network or\nwe plug in the network adapter,\n\n382\n00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,980\nit will try and automatically\nconfigure the network for you.\n\n383\n00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,050\nTries to make it as easy as possible,\nright?\n\n384\n00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,700\nSo, Ronnie, when you plugged in\nthis network adapter this morning,\n\n385\n00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,160\ndid you have to do any configuration?\n\n386\n00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,730\nDidn't have to do any\nconfiguration at all.\n\n387\n00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,750\n>> It just worked, right?\n\n388\n00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,770\n>> It did.\n>> So what's the Apple saying,\n\n389\n00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,460\nit's like magic?\n\n390\n00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,280\n>> It is magic.\n\n391\n00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,460\n>> They try and\nmake this stuff as simple as possible.\n\n392\n00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,120\nWhen you connect to a wireless network,\noften all you have to do is\n\n393\n00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,300\npick the wireless network and\npunch in a password if it has one.\n\n394\n00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,930\nBut other than that,\nthere's no configuration necessary.\n\n395\n00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,942\nWindows by default will try to\nautomatically configure itself,\n\n396\n00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:04,750\nall right, and it does this by using\na series of different protocols.\n\n397\n00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,940\nWe're starting with IPv4, so\nlet's talk about how IPv4 does it.\n\n398\n00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,630\nIPv4 uses a protocol called DHCP or\n\n399\n00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,420\ndynamic host configuration protocol and\nwhat it is does is basically when you plug\n\n400\n00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:22,870\nthe computer in, the computer has a set\nmessage that it can send out saying hey,\n\n401\n00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,010\nI'm the new guy, I don't know\nthis network, somebody help me.\n\n402\n00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,490\nSomebody give me the information\nto connect to this network.\n\n403\n00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,500\nAnd if you've got a DHCP\nserver on your network,\n\n404\n00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,210\nit'll hear that message and it will\nrespond back and say oh, you wanna talk.\n\n405\n00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,140\nHere's the settings you need to know and\nthat will configure the client,\n\n406\n00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,610\nand then you're in business.\n\n407\n00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,140\nNow, it used to be that you actually\nhad to have a server to do this.\n\n408\n00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,050\nSo you had to have a tech guy,\nsomebody who could set up that server and\n\n409\n00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,315\nget it in place but these days,\nalmost every home router,\n\n410\n00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:57,900\nWi-Fi devices, whatever, they're\nalmost all DHCP servers these days.\n\n411\n00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,200\nAnd so, you don't even have to\nset it up in a lot of cases.\n\n412\n00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,340\nAll right, so\nI imagine that's what yours did, Ronnie.\n\n413\n00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,480\nSo if we click on IP version 4 in\nthat list and go to Properties,\n\n414\n00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,700\nyou'll see right there obtain\nIP address automatically,\n\n415\n00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,060\nobtain DNS servers automatically,\n\n416\n00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,630\nall the options on the screen are grayed\nout because it's all set to automatic.\n\n417\n00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,560\nWe're going to learn those settings\nfrom the network, all right?\n\n418\n00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,495\nNow, I assume that happened.\n\n419\n00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:26,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How do we know if\n\n420\n00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,760\nit actually happened, right?\n\n421\n00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,470\nWell, we can drop to a command prompt and\nwe can use\n\n422\n00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,060\nwhat's probably gonna be the most useful\ncommand of this entire episode, ipconfig.\n\n423\n00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,510\nIpconfig will display our Internet\nprotocol configuration and\n\n424\n00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:47,380\nit merges IPv6 and IPv4 together, but it's\ngonna show you what your configuration is.\n\n425\n00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:53,240\nAnd I can see this machine is 192.168.1.2,\nthat's its IPv4 address.\n\n426\n00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,824\nAnd it got a subnet mask, and\n\n427\n00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:59,188\nprobably got some other settings that\naren't being displayed here, right?\n\n428\n00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:03,452\nSo if we modify that\ncommand a little bit and\n\n429\n00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:09,265\ndo ipconfig/all,\nnow we see even more data, all right?\n\n430\n00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:13,880\nAnd you can see here DHCP enabled yes.\n\n431\n00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,953\nDHCP server,192.168.1.1, that tells\nme that there is a server out there,\n\n432\n00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:25,260\n1.1 that is a DHCP server,\nand it gave us this address.\n\n433\n00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,241\nAnd I can see that it also\ngave me DNS servers, right?\n\n434\n00:21:29,241 --> 00:21:31,280\nNow, what is DNS?\n\n435\n00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,650\nDNS is pretty important.\n\n436\n00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:37,020\nIt's the domain naming system, or domain\nnaming service, depending on who you ask.\n\n437\n00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,450\nAnd what it does is,\nit helps us tie names to addresses.\n\n438\n00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,590\nIn the IPv4 world, if you wanna talk to\na server, you have to know their address.\n\n439\n00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,430\nWell, what about like us?\n\n440\n00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,710\nSo if you wanna get to\nthe ITProTV website,\n\n441\n00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,208\nyou might fire up a web browser and\nin your URL you might type ITPro.TV.\n\n442\n00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,590\nRight, that will bring you to us but\n\n443\n00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:06,400\nthe thing is, that's a name, and\ncomputers don't understand names.\n\n444\n00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,280\nThey understand IP addresses, so it's\ngotta figure out what that address is.\n\n445\n00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,730\nIf we knew the address, we could\njust type it into our web browser.\n\n446\n00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,770\nHere's the address,\n170 whatever and so on.\n\n447\n00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,624\nBut if you don't know,\nDNS is what resolves it for us, so\n\n448\n00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,414\nit's incredibly useful, right?\n\n449\n00:22:20,414 --> 00:22:26,319\nSo for example here on my machine,\nif I do like a ping or\n\n450\n00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,046\nsomething, if I ping itpro.tv, right,\n\n451\n00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:36,058\nthat's the domain name that I'm typing in.\n\n452\n00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:38,609\nThe computer,\nit's not gonna know what that name is,\n\n453\n00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,670\nit's gonna have to figure out the address.\n\n454\n00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,795\nAnd so, it's gonna reach out and\nresolve that to an IP address and\n\n455\n00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:48,634\nthere's my address, 173.255.277.128.\n\n456\n00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:55,400\nAll right, so now it knows my address and\nDNS is what made that possible.\n\n457\n00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,710\nNow, I used ping there just\nbecause it's easy, but\n\n458\n00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,171\nwe do have another command\nline on utility we can use for\n\n459\n00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:07,240\ntesting name resolution, and\nthat is nslookup, name server look up.\n\n460\n00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,820\nThis will use whatever DNS server you\nhave and resolve a name to an IP.\n\n461\n00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:19,240\nSo if I did Nslookup www.microsoft.com,\n\n462\n00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,910\nit's gonna reach out and find out what\nthe IP address of microsoft.com is.\n\n463\n00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,205\nAnd there it is 134.170.188.84.\n\n464\n00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:32,150\nAll right, now sometimes you'll see\nmore than one address for a system for\n\n465\n00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,240\nexample, if I do amazon.com.\n\n466\n00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,060\nNope, just one there.\n\n467\n00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,990\n>> Google.\n\n468\n00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,695\n>> Google?\n\n469\n00:23:38,695 --> 00:23:42,420\nYeah, Google definitely has more than one,\nthere we go.\n\n470\n00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,775\nSo you might have more than one address.\n\n471\n00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:47,887\nIf you can keep it on the screen and if\nyou have more than one address what it's\n\n472\n00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:52,191\ngonna do is called round robbining it's\ngonna move through each one of these and\n\n473\n00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:55,679\nyou'll see this with companies\nthat want to do load balancing.\n\n474\n00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,314\nThey have so\nmuch traffic that they need to send.\n\n475\n00:23:58,314 --> 00:24:01,298\nPeople with different IPs to\nbalance it out, all right.\n\n476\n00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:04,300\nSometimes this is very visible,\nlike with Google.\n\n477\n00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,900\nSometimes it's hidden,\nlike with Microsoft.\n\n478\n00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,280\nWhen I pulled up Microsoft,\nsee how it just got one IP but\n\n479\n00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,435\nthe name tied to it lb1\ndot blah blah blah.\n\n480\n00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:15,375\nThat's definitely going\nto be a low balancer, so\n\n481\n00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:21,155\nthere's more than one server behind that,\nbut we just see one IP.\n\n482\n00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:24,500\nInteresting names tied to it,\ntoggle dot whatever, anyhow.\n\n483\n00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,835\nSo that name says the mishappening\nin the background.\n\n484\n00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:33,950\nSo when Ronnie connected his machine said,\nhey, I need to talk, how can you help me?\n\n485\n00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,390\nAnd the system gave him\nan IP address to use.\n\n486\n00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,430\nIt gave him a DNS server to use,\nsomebody to help go native to IP.\n\n487\n00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:46,590\nThose are the basic elements that we\nneed to get connected to a network.\n\n488\n00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,400\nThere's one other thing,\nwhich is a default router to use.\n\n489\n00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,080\nWhat router should I use if I\nwant to get to another network.\n\n490\n00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,750\nNow Ronnie,\nyours didn't give you one, right.\n\n491\n00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,470\nIf we jump back to you,\nyou'll see the default gateway is blank.\n\n492\n00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,020\nSo why don't we have that, right?\n\n493\n00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,650\nWell the default gateway or the default\nrouter, that's the one that we're gonna\n\n494\n00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,210\nuse when we want to talk to\nsomebody on a different network.\n\n495\n00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,520\nWell Ronny's on one of\nour lab machines and\n\n496\n00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,640\nwe keep our lab machines isolated\nnot connected to the internet.\n\n497\n00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,640\nSo he has no internet,\nhe can't get to the internet.\n\n498\n00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,470\nSo he doesn't need a default gateway.\n\n499\n00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,840\nThere's no other network\nhe needs to talk to.\n\n500\n00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,210\nBut if we wanted someone to be\nable to get to the internet,\n\n501\n00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,410\nthey would need a default gateway.\n\n502\n00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,580\nSo if you take a look at like my computer.\n\n503\n00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,770\nWhen I do an IP config I can\nsee I have an IP address and\n\n504\n00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:39,290\nI have a default gateway which\nis effectively saying if\n\n505\n00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:43,800\nI wanna get to a network other\nthan the network I'm currently on.\n\n506\n00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,820\nWhich I'm attempting to highlight and\nfailing miserably, there we go.\n\n507\n00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,790\nIf I wanna get to a network\nother than the one I'm on I need\n\n508\n00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,440\nto go to this guy, 10.1.230.1.\n\n509\n00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,580\nThat's my router, that's who's gonna help\nme get out to the internet, all right.\n\n510\n00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,640\nOr, just to other networks,\nit doesn't have to be the Internet, right?\n\n511\n00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,608\nSo, the default gateway's\nnot actually required.\n\n512\n00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:06,330\nYou don't have have to have it, unless\nyou want to talk to other networks right.\n\n513\n00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,420\nSo it's pretty important,\nwe normally will have it.\n\n514\n00:26:09,982 --> 00:26:13,260\nAll right, so, let's say that\nwe don't have a DHCP server.\n\n515\n00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,920\nThere's nobody out there to\nhelp us get these settings.\n\n516\n00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,075\nWell, We can manually put them in, right.\n\n517\n00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:20,785\nSo, let's jump back to yours Ronnie.\n\n518\n00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:21,935\n>> Okay.\n\n519\n00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:23,025\nSo we're on my machine here.\n\n520\n00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:24,905\nYou can actually see where\nwe've got it set up for\n\n521\n00:26:24,905 --> 00:26:30,105\nDHCP to be able to obtain the information\nit needs to get connected to the network.\n\n522\n00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:31,475\nBut, if we wanted to manually do it,\n\n523\n00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:35,660\nthough, inside of our internet\nprotocol version four properties\n\n524\n00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,300\nsame place where we wer before under\nthe local area connection properties.\n\n525\n00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,278\nAnd then we selected it and\nwe selected properties,\n\n526\n00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:45,738\nthen we can choose this\nother option here and\n\n527\n00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:49,960\nnotice that it automatically\nselected these and moved them down.\n\n528\n00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,380\nSo this means I have to manually type\nin IP address here will I have to do.\n\n529\n00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,954\nSo us here, well, mine was 192.\n\n530\n00:26:56,954 --> 00:27:00,793\n>> It was 192.168.1.2 was\nthe DHCP address you got, so\n\n531\n00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:03,270\nyou can probably just stick with that.\n\n532\n00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,540\n>> Yeah.\n\n533\n00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,390\n>> I love your custom mouse cursor.\n\n534\n00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,980\n>> Yeah. I know. That's neat.\n\n535\n00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,550\nIt looks like a little spreadsheet\ndown there for one reason or another.\n\n536\n00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,910\nOkay.\n\n537\n00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,460\nAnd then down here on my\nDNS preferred server.\n\n538\n00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,780\nAll right, give it 1.1.\n\n539\n00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,540\nAnd so normally,\n\n540\n00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:25,100\nwe would at least give four pieces of\ninformation in today's network, right?\n\n541\n00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,150\nWe need an IP address, we'd have to\nmanually type in a sub-net mask.\n\n542\n00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:33,200\nThe good thing is it tends to fill it in\nby default classes, default gateway and\n\n543\n00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,530\ntoday we really can't get away\nwithout a DNS server very often.\n\n544\n00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,634\nSo we need at least that [CROSSTALK].\n\n545\n00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:39,940\n>> And why don't you go ahead and\npunch in a default gateway.\n\n546\n00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,330\nIt's not gonna work cuz this machine's\nnot connected to the internet but\n\n547\n00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,890\nif your router was dot one or dot 254 or\nwhatever, you would just punch it in,\n\n548\n00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,070\nthat's the IP address of the router that\nwill help you get to other networks.\n\n549\n00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,960\nAll right, now, when you put that in,\nthat's what's called a static IP.\n\n550\n00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,620\nWe had a dynamic IP before, one that could\nchange based on what the server told us.\n\n551\n00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,860\nNow it's static,\nevery time we turn this computer on,\n\n552\n00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,390\nwe will have this IP address\nright here and no other.\n\n553\n00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,660\nThis is the IP address\nthat we're gonna go with.\n\n554\n00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,860\nAll right, so it doesn't take effect\nuntil you hit that close button, so\n\n555\n00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860\nthat that's important.\n\n556\n00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,830\nRonnie hit close so\nnow it's taken effect and\n\n557\n00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,880\nyou can see the network\ndetails right there.\n\n558\n00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,210\nWe now have that IP address.\n\n559\n00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,350\nDHCP is not enabled, and we've got the IP.\n\n560\n00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,420\n>> Now, lets effectively verify\nthat it actually did work, see?\n\n561\n00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:40,095\nSo I'm gonna ping 192.168.1.1, and so I am\ngetting connectivity by using that ping.\n\n562\n00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:40,710\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n563\n00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,350\n>> And we can also verify that\nname resolution is still working.\n\n564\n00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:48,295\nWhich is, we're actually getting an IPv6\naddress instead, of name resolution\n\n565\n00:28:48,295 --> 00:28:48,960\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n566\n00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,510\nwe'll talk about that a little bit later.\n\n567\n00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,460\nWindows 7 actually prefers\nto use IPv6 when possible.\n\n568\n00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,900\nRonnie, if you change that.\n\n569\n00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:02,510\nDo a ping dash 4 dc, there we go.\n\n570\n00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,990\nThat's gonna force it to use IPv4.\n\n571\n00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,670\nAnd we'll talk about that a little\nbit later in the episode.\n\n572\n00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,630\nBut Windows 7 is really the first\nMicrosoft operating system\n\n573\n00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,650\nthat truly prefers IPv6 whenever possible.\n\n574\n00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:22,130\nAll right, so there is a way that\nwe can mix dynamic and static.\n\n575\n00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:26,310\nAll right, let's go back into your\nnetwork properties there Ronnie and\n\n576\n00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,600\nwe're gonna put it back to DHCP.\n\n577\n00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,280\nSo, go into your settings there and\n\n578\n00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,700\nswitch it back to obtain\nIP address automatically.\n\n579\n00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,050\nAll right, with this setting,\nthe system's gonna boot up and\n\n580\n00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,730\nit's gonna ask the network, hey,\ncan somebody out there please help me?\n\n581\n00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,510\nGive me the configuration I need,\nall right.\n\n582\n00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,660\nBut, what if nobody is out there?\n\n583\n00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,640\nIf nobody is out there to answer us,\nyou'll see a new tab appear\n\n584\n00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,545\nwhen you flip through DHCP that\nsays Alternate Configuration.\n\n585\n00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:58,540\nAnd in here,\nwe can specify a backup plan a plan B.\n\n586\n00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,310\nWhat do we do if there is\nno DHCP server available.\n\n587\n00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,290\nOne of the options here is\nto pick User Configured and\n\n588\n00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,920\nyou can statically assign an IP.\n\n589\n00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,510\nYou can say, I'll try and get\nthe configuration from the network first,\n\n590\n00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,000\nthat's what I'd prefer.\n\n591\n00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,820\nBut, if it fails,\nhere's an address to use.\n\n592\n00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:20,950\nI wanna use 192.168.1.10\nwith this subnet mask and\n\n593\n00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,910\nso on, and this is what I wanna use.\n\n594\n00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:29,810\nAll right, you'll only use this if you\nfail to dynamically get an address,\n\n595\n00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,150\nthen you'll use this value here,\nall right.\n\n596\n00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,050\nSo that's kind of like a plan B.\n\n597\n00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:38,200\nThere's actually another setting there\ncalled automatic private IP address and\n\n598\n00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,640\nI wanna talk about that a bit, but\n\n599\n00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,150\nI just noticed we're kinda\nout of time on this segment.\n\n600\n00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,610\nSo let's do this,\nlet's stop here and take a break and\n\n601\n00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:49,030\nwhen we get back I want to talk about\nthat automatic private IP assignment or\n\n602\n00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,520\naddressing, and take a look at what\nthat means, what it's used for,\n\n603\n00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,410\nbecause it's kinda a neat one and\nit almost always shows up on the exam.\n\n604\n00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,780\n>> Right.\n>> So I definitely want to highlight that.\n\n605\n00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,170\nSo, Ronnie got anything else\nto throw in before break?\n\n606\n00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,660\n>> Nope.\nGood time to stop.\n\n607\n00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,862\n>> All right, so let's take a break here,\nwhen we get back, more IP excitement,\n\n608\n00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:05,567\nafter this.\n\n609\n00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:12,602\n[MUSIC]\n\n610\n00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:14,380\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n611\n00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,650\nSo before the break,\nI was talking about the plan B.\n\n612\n00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:23,120\nIf we set our system up to use\na dynamic address and nobody answers.\n\n613\n00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,090\nPlease, please give me an address and\nnobody answers, what do we do?\n\n614\n00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:30,120\nWell we saw the screen where we\ncan set a manual address, right.\n\n615\n00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,480\nWhich I think Ronnie you got it pulled up.\n\n616\n00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,980\nLet's look at Ronnie's screen.\n\n617\n00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,860\nSo he's got it pulled up where you say,\n\n618\n00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,155\nall right, I didn't get an answer Here's\nwhat I'm gonna go with 192.168.1.10.\n\n619\n00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:43,465\nAnd we want to try that?\n\n620\n00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:47,145\nSo we go ahead say okay, what it's going\nto do is, the machine's going to try and\n\n621\n00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:50,194\nuse DHCP and get an address, and\nif it fails, it'll get this one.\n\n622\n00:31:50,194 --> 00:31:53,259\nSo let's fire up a command prompt.\n\n623\n00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:56,903\nAnd see, I can't remember if we have\nto release the address you already\n\n624\n00:31:56,903 --> 00:31:57,519\ngot or not.\n\n625\n00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,710\nSo he's just gonna do an IP\nconfig here to see what it's got.\n\n626\n00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,551\nAnd 192.168.1.10.\n\n627\n00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:09,760\nThat was that backup, that plan B.\n\n628\n00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,908\nLooking at it here, I can recognize that,\nwe didn't use DHCP, but\n\n629\n00:32:12,908 --> 00:32:16,830\nit kind of looks like what a static\naddress would look like, doesn't it?\n\n630\n00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:21,570\nSo let's do an ipconfig/all.\n\n631\n00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:26,660\nAnd what you can notice in\nhere is DHCP enabled yes.\n\n632\n00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:33,160\nIt tried to use DHCP, but\nit didn't get an answer.\n\n633\n00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,870\nSo if we look at the DHCP server field,\nactually,\n\n634\n00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,430\nit does still say DHCP server,\nno it doesn't sorry, that was DNS server.\n\n635\n00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:45,400\nSo there's no DHCP server listed cuz\nwe didn't get a response back from one.\n\n636\n00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,830\nAnd so instead, we went with 192.168.1.10\nwhich is an autoconfiguration.\n\n637\n00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,280\nAnd so\nyou'll see autoconfiguration enabled, yes.\n\n638\n00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,310\nThat's our plan B,\nif Ronnie hadn't set that though,\n\n639\n00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:04,010\nanother system would have kicked in\ncalled Automatic Private IP Addressing.\n\n640\n00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:09,460\nAnd on the exam, they almost always write\nit as the abbreviation which is APIPA,\n\n641\n00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,843\nA-P-I-P-A, I have a hard time remembering\n>> Yeah\n\n642\n00:33:12,843 --> 00:33:14,160\n>> What it stands for,\n\n643\n00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,500\nbut it's automatic private IP addressing.\n\n644\n00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,210\nAnd I know it right now, cuz I-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n645\n00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,290\n>> Looked at it during the break.\n\n646\n00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,160\nBut I always forget it for some reason.\n\n647\n00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,960\nBut with APIPA, what your system will do\nis it'll reach up for a DHCP address,\n\n648\n00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,552\nand if it can't find one,\nit will make up its own address.\n\n649\n00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:33,600\nIt will just pick one up out of thin air.\n\n650\n00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,760\nBut there's certain rules that apply\nthat make it really easy to spot.\n\n651\n00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,980\nLet's see it in action here.\n\n652\n00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,150\nRonnie, go ahead and set yours up for\nautomatic private IP's.\n\n653\n00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,086\n>> All right.\nSo inside of our local area connection\n\n654\n00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:47,218\nproperties, I'm gonna select our\ninternet protocol version four.\n\n655\n00:33:47,218 --> 00:33:49,640\nAnd then select Properties here.\n\n656\n00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,470\nAnd we already have left it set up for\nDHCP, and\n\n657\n00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:55,395\nthat's where we got that\nautoconfiguration tab.\n\n658\n00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:58,070\nAnd it's right here where\nwe type in the automatic,\n\n659\n00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,960\nother configuration that we have.\n\n660\n00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,620\nIf we wanna use the APIPA,\n\n661\n00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,910\nAutomatic Private IP Address,\nthis is where it should default then.\n\n662\n00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,980\nIf it doesn't actually talk to the DHCP\nserver, this is saying look, go ahead and\n\n663\n00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:17,780\ngive my own computer, in other words self\nassign an IP address is what we have here.\n\n664\n00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:22,260\nSo if I select that,\nI should click OK, and\n\n665\n00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,850\nthen go on to click Close here,\nand let's see.\n\n666\n00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,798\n>> So that should kick in pretty quick.\n\n667\n00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:31,460\nNow with DHCP it's gonna send\nout a request for an address and\n\n668\n00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,820\nyou have to wait for that to time out.\n\n669\n00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,445\nIt can take 30 seconds or so.\n\n670\n00:34:34,445 --> 00:34:35,610\n>> Right.\n>> I think it does ten\n\n671\n00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,790\nseconds three times, so each attempt.\n\n672\n00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,250\nSo once it fails three times,\nthen it does the automatic assignment.\n\n673\n00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:42,968\nLet's see if it did it.\n\n674\n00:34:42,968 --> 00:34:43,635\n>> All right.\n\n675\n00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,140\nSure enough.\n\n676\n00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,750\nNow, when we look at this,\nnotice it doesn't say IPv4 address.\n\n677\n00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,020\nNow, it says autoconfiguration\nIPv4 address.\n\n678\n00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:01,020\nIt did an Automatic Private IP Address,\nan APIP address.\n\n679\n00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,750\nAnd they're easy to spot, oh yeah, Ronnie,\nyou're highlighting it right there.\n\n680\n00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:08,800\nThe 169.254, when you see that\nthe beginning of an address,\n\n681\n00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,370\nanytime that you see 169.254,\nthat's your indicator, your warning,\n\n682\n00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,140\nthat's what let's you know\nthis was an APIPA address,\n\n683\n00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:20,060\nnot one that was manually assigned or\none that came from a DHCP server.\n\n684\n00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,880\nWhat the client does is it makes up\nan address, it starts with 169.254 and\n\n685\n00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,520\nthen the last two numbers it makes up.\n\n686\n00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,510\nIt just picks them, picks them at random.\n\n687\n00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:35,150\nAnd the idea is if you had 100 computers,\nand your DHCP server was down,\n\n688\n00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,300\nall of your computers would pick\naddresses in the 169.254 range and\n\n689\n00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,960\nthey'd still be able\nto talk to each other.\n\n690\n00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,210\nThat's the idea.\n\n691\n00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,530\nBut you'll notice there's no default\ngateway, so they won't be able to get to\n\n692\n00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,180\nany other network, but at least,\nthey'll be able to talk to each other.\n\n693\n00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,110\nWhich may be enough to keep your business\nrunning while you've got this failure.\n\n694\n00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,240\nThat's the idea behind APIPA addresses.\n\n695\n00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,330\nMore often than not,\n\n696\n00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:59,470\nwe just use them as an indicator\nthat something's wrong with DHCP.\n\n697\n00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,270\n>> Right.\n>> So that's basically it.\n\n698\n00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,960\n>> Ronnie, do an ipconfig/all real quick,\nwe'll just take a look,\n\n699\n00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,330\nat the extended output.\n\n700\n00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,100\nYou can see in here,\nthat autoconfigoration IP address.\n\n701\n00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:19,460\nDHCP is still listed as enabled, but\nthere is no DHCP server in the list.\n\n702\n00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,030\nWe didn't reach a DHCP server,\nso we didn't get an address.\n\n703\n00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,870\nSo those are our 8 bit addresses.\n\n704\n00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,880\nNow, when we looked at these addresses,\nwe also noticed another field\n\n705\n00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,350\ncalled a subnet mask, and the subnet\nmask can be a little hard to explain.\n\n706\n00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:40,820\nWhat I wanna do is, I wanna take a step\nback from the actual command line stuff.\n\n707\n00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,690\nAnd just talk a little bit about\nIPv4 addressing in general.\n\n708\n00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,460\nHow these addresses work?\n\n709\n00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,540\nWhat makes them up?\n\n710\n00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,460\nAnd then we'll be able to see how the\nsubnet mask kind of plugs into that and\n\n711\n00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,550\nhas a very important meaning.\n\n712\n00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,840\nLet me fire up a notepad screen here.\n\n713\n00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,650\nLet's go over to my machine, and\n\n714\n00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,670\nI'm gonna highlight a few different\naspects of an IP address.\n\n715\n00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:10,218\nRonnie originally,\nhad an IP address of 192.168.1.2.\n\n716\n00:37:10,218 --> 00:37:12,800\nSo that was your IP address.\n\n717\n00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,240\nAnd what else did you have?\n\n718\n00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,010\nYou had a subnet mask-\n>> Right.\n\n719\n00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:23,420\nBut no default gateway.\n\n720\n00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:27,051\n>> And your subnet mask was 255.255.255.0,\nI believe.\n\n721\n00:37:27,051 --> 00:37:28,135\n>> Correct.\n\n722\n00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:33,920\n>> And your default gateway was blank, but\nI'm gonna just pretend like you had one.\n\n723\n00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:39,386\nAnd we'll say that it was 1.1, which I'm\npretty sure is what you had for DNS.\n\n724\n00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,990\nAll right, make it all nice and even.\n\n725\n00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,800\nSo those are three of the values\nthat he had on his machine earlier.\n\n726\n00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,630\nI'm kinda making some of those up.\n\n727\n00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,010\nSome of the other ones that we\nsaw like the APIPA address.\n\n728\n00:37:56,885 --> 00:38:03,740\nSo this was just Ronnie's Workstation.\n\n729\n00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:09,390\nAnd then, we saw an APIPA address,\nand that APIPA address\n\n730\n00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:15,605\nwas, what was it, I didn't get it.\n\n731\n00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:18,224\n>> 169.254225.167.\n\n732\n00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,885\n>> And it had a subnet mask.\n\n733\n00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,470\nAnd it had no default gateway.\n\n734\n00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,343\n>> No default gateway.\n\n735\n00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,150\nOkay, so what do these numbers mean?\n\n736\n00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,210\nWhat exactly are we looking at here?\n\n737\n00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:38,820\nAll right.\n\n738\n00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,479\nWell, let's take an address,\n\n739\n00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:47,093\nlet's take 192.168.1.2.\n\n740\n00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:48,240\nIf I could type, there.\n\n741\n00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,301\nAnd we're gonna break that address down\nand kinda see what it is that makes it up?\n\n742\n00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:59,760\nWhen we look at 192.168.1.2,\nthat is an IPv4 address.\n\n743\n00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,100\nThey're easy to spot.\n\n744\n00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,980\nBecause they're made up of four\nnumbers separated by periods.\n\n745\n00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,176\nNow, each number is\nreferred to as an octet.\n\n746\n00:39:08,176 --> 00:39:10,370\nAnd an octet is a really weird word.\n\n747\n00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,670\nWhat the heck does that mean?\n\n748\n00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:15,800\nIt means that each number is\nactually made up of 8 bits.\n\n749\n00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,875\nAn IPv4 address is 32 bits, so\n\n750\n00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:25,850\nIPV4 addresses are 32-bit binary numbers.\n\n751\n00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,500\nNow, if you're familiar with binary,\n\n752\n00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,530\nbinary is a numerical system also\ncalled base two mathematics,\n\n753\n00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:37,060\nthat is where everything can be\nrepresented as either a zero or a one.\n\n754\n00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:41,335\nBut when I look at this address,\nI've got nines and sixes and twos,\n\n755\n00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:42,693\nthat's not binary.\n\n756\n00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:47,495\nThe number that we see when we look at an\naddress like that is being represented in\n\n757\n00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:51,236\nwhat's called the decimal system or\nBase 10 Mathematics.\n\n758\n00:39:51,236 --> 00:39:54,917\nAs human beings when we go to\nelementary school and stuff-\n\n759\n00:39:54,917 --> 00:39:55,438\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n760\n00:39:55,438 --> 00:39:57,985\n>> We learn- 1 through 10, 10 to 100,\n\n761\n00:39:57,985 --> 00:40:03,590\n100 to 1000, 1000 to 10,000,\nwe learned it in values of 10s.\n\n762\n00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:07,820\nComputers don't work that way,\ncomputers work with 0s and 1s, so\n\n763\n00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:13,290\nan IPv4 address is 32 bits,\nor a string of 32 0s and 1s.\n\n764\n00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:17,580\nAnd if we were to look at that as human\nbeings it's very, very confusing, right?\n\n765\n00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:22,406\nSo for example 192.168.1.2,\n\n766\n00:40:22,406 --> 00:40:26,163\nthat is the decimal or base 10.\n\n767\n00:40:29,518 --> 00:40:32,223\nWay of representing that IPv4 address.\n\n768\n00:40:32,223 --> 00:40:32,920\nAll right.\n\n769\n00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,620\nIf we were to write it in binary or\nbase two, right?\n\n770\n00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,620\nIf we were to write it that way,\nit looks a lot different, all right.\n\n771\n00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,690\nAnd let me just show you\nwhat it would look like.\n\n772\n00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,844\nSo this would actually be,\nI'm gonna try and do this in my head.\n\n773\n00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,140\nAnd we're going to keep an eye out\nhere because I'm not the best at this.\n\n774\n00:41:02,646 --> 00:41:03,667\n>> That's good.\n\n775\n00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:06,495\n>> And I'm going to get rid of these dots.\n\n776\n00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:10,594\nSo, when the computer\nsees this same address,\n\n777\n00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:14,796\nwhen the computer sees 192.168.1.2\n\n778\n00:41:14,796 --> 00:41:19,514\nit's actually seeing this\nstring of 32 1s and 0s.\n\n779\n00:41:19,514 --> 00:41:21,475\nRight, that's what the computer sees.\n\n780\n00:41:21,475 --> 00:41:25,737\nAll right, well I remember from seeing\nRonnie's screen earlier that his address\n\n781\n00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:29,700\nis 192,168,12,\nI didn't have to have him pull that up.\n\n782\n00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,979\nAs a human being, that's a number\nthat I can grasp in my mind.\n\n783\n00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,669\nBut this right here these 32 bits.\n\n784\n00:41:36,669 --> 00:41:40,592\nIf I had seen that on the screen,\nthere's no way I'd remember what it was.\n\n785\n00:41:40,592 --> 00:41:42,970\nThese numbers are just not human friendly.\n\n786\n00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,346\nSo Windows is representing them\nin a way that we can understand.\n\n787\n00:41:46,346 --> 00:41:49,880\nAnd it's not just Windows,\nLinux, OSX they all do this.\n\n788\n00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,570\nSo, basically to make it human\nfriendly what the computer\n\n789\n00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:59,330\ndoes is it takes this 32-bit string and\n\n790\n00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:04,360\nit then breaks it up into pieces.\n\n791\n00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,920\nEvery eight bits, it breaks it up and\nputs in a period.\n\n792\n00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,457\nAnd it puts it in the right spot,\nunlike me,\n\n793\n00:42:11,457 --> 00:42:14,280\nwhere I just put it\narbitrarily wherever I want.\n\n794\n00:42:17,182 --> 00:42:19,410\nSo, it breaks it up like that.\n\n795\n00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:24,870\nAnd then it converts those four\nblocks into decimal numbers.\n\n796\n00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:30,664\nSo, if we take that number,\nthat equals 192.\n\n797\n00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:36,759\nAnd if we take that number It equals 168.\n\n798\n00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:41,868\nAnd if we take that number it equals one.\n\n799\n00:42:41,868 --> 00:42:43,504\nAuto-correct got me there.\n\n800\n00:42:43,504 --> 00:42:48,730\nAnd if we take that number\nthat equals two, okay?\n\n801\n00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,660\nSo, each of those octets,\n\n802\n00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:55,820\neach of those eight blocks can be reduced\ninto nice, human, manageable numbers.\n\n803\n00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,210\nAnd that makes it where even\nsomeone like me can remember it.\n\n804\n00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:03,800\nSo, when you look at an IP address, that's\njust for your own benefit right there.\n\n805\n00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,050\nThe computer's actually\nseeing 32 bits of data.\n\n806\n00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,780\nNow the 32 bits of data\nare broken into two pieces.\n\n807\n00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,920\nOne piece that represents\nwhat network you're on, and\n\n808\n00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,220\nanother piece that represents\nwhat computer or host your on.\n\n809\n00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:25,820\nThink of it as like a street address,\nthe building that I'm in right now.\n\n810\n00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:31,210\nSo the ITProTV Studios, we\n\n811\n00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:36,060\nare at 6933 North West Fourth..,\nBoulevard.\n\n812\n00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,170\nOkay, so that's the street address for\nour studio.\n\n813\n00:43:40,255 --> 00:43:46,470\n6933, that's our building number,\nthere is only one 6933 on this road.\n\n814\n00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,580\nNorthwest Ford Boulevard, that's our road\nthough, and there's a number of other\n\n815\n00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,935\nthings on this road,\nwe have like a tire shop and a home depot.\n\n816\n00:43:55,935 --> 00:44:00,320\nAnd there's all sorts of stuff that are on\nthis road, tons of other people, but\n\n817\n00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,690\nthey don't have 6933.\n\n818\n00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,050\nThat's just us.\n\n819\n00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:10,980\nSo, they might be 6930, or\n6937 or 6900 or whatever, right?\n\n820\n00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,210\nSome different number\nNorthwest Fourth Boulevard.\n\n821\n00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,990\nNow there's other streets, so\nthere's I don't know where it is,\n\n822\n00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,900\nbut there's probably a NW 5th Blvd.\n\n823\n00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,930\nSo there might be a 6933 NW 5th Blvd.\n\n824\n00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:27,280\nIt's okay that that other building is 6933\nalso because it's on a different street.\n\n825\n00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,020\nThat's how IP addresses are.\n\n826\n00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:32,180\nYou have a network and\nyour network is like your street name.\n\n827\n00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:32,850\nRight?\n\n828\n00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,360\nAnd then you have your host.\n\n829\n00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,704\nThat's like a building number.\n\n830\n00:44:35,704 --> 00:44:41,564\nSo, when I look at 192.168.1.2\npart of that is my network and\n\n831\n00:44:41,564 --> 00:44:45,970\nanother part of that is my host,\nmy computer.\n\n832\n00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,030\nHow do I know which is which?\n\n833\n00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,550\nWell that's where\nthe subnet mask comes in.\n\n834\n00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:54,640\nThe subnet mask, that other number and\nRonnie, I think that's what yours was.\n\n835\n00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,370\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oops.\n\n836\n00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:56,229\nThat's what yours was, right?\n\n837\n00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,730\nThat subnet mask, is telling me\nwhat part is the network ID and\n\n838\n00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,110\nwhat part is the host ID.\n\n839\n00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:11,610\nWhere I see 255's, those 255's are tell me\nwhich octets are part of the network ID.\n\n840\n00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:16,140\nAnd the zeroes, those are telling\nme which part is the host id.\n\n841\n00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:21,583\nSo if I look at this, it's telling me\nthat 192.168.1, that's my network, and\n\n842\n00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:27,020\nthen .2, that's me,\nthat's my individual machine.\n\n843\n00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:31,040\nIt maps those together and in fact,\nif I space it out a little bit better.\n\n844\n00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:37,460\nI can probably draw a line in here and\nsee it.\n\n845\n00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,510\nWell let me do it.\n\n846\n00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:41,995\nHere.\n\n847\n00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:45,960\nAll right.\n\n848\n00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:52,500\nSo, if I were to figure out\nhow I want to write this.\n\n849\n00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,040\nThere.\n\n850\n00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,610\nOkay.\n\n851\n00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:56,920\nSo if I were to write it like this,\nI'm just trying to get my spacing right.\n\n852\n00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,940\nIn fact, if I add some leading zeroes,\nthat would take care of it.\n\n853\n00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:07,490\nWe leave leading zeroes out because\nwe don't need them for normal humans,\n\n854\n00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:09,810\nbut I'll put them in here just to\nget things lined up, nice and neat.\n\n855\n00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:16,080\nYou can basically draw a line\nright where the numbers change.\n\n856\n00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,500\nRight where we go from 255s to 0s.\n\n857\n00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,706\nAnd you can say, that's where the network\nID stops and the host ID starts.\n\n858\n00:46:25,706 --> 00:46:32,930\nSo 192.168.1 that's my Network ID,\nand then .2, two is my Host ID.\n\n859\n00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,870\nThe subnet mast teaches us that,\nso we need a subnet mast,\n\n860\n00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:38,170\nto identify where that break is.\n\n861\n00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,158\nThe purpose of this,\nis if I want to talk to somebody else, and\n\n862\n00:46:42,158 --> 00:46:46,167\nthey're on the same network as me,\nI can go straight to them.\n\n863\n00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:49,626\nSo if I want to talk to, 192.168.5.\n\n864\n00:46:49,626 --> 00:46:52,482\nOr 192.168.1.200.\n\n865\n00:46:52,482 --> 00:46:55,640\n192.168.1.254.\n\n866\n00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,500\nThose guys are on the same network as me.\n\n867\n00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,667\nI can go straight to them.\n\n868\n00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:05,413\nBut if any of those numbers are different,\nif they're on 192.168.2, right?\n\n869\n00:47:05,413 --> 00:47:09,046\nOr 173.255.128.\n\n870\n00:47:09,046 --> 00:47:10,760\nThose are different.\n\n871\n00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,250\nThat's a different network.\n\n872\n00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,290\nI can't talk straight to them.\n\n873\n00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,070\nInstead I'll have to go to a router.\n\n874\n00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:17,720\nRight?\n\n875\n00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,820\nAnd that router we find,\nthanks to our default gateway,\n\n876\n00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,820\nthe default gateway is the router that\nwe'll use to reach out to other networks.\n\n877\n00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,990\nPeople that aren't on\nthe same network as us.\n\n878\n00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:34,886\nAll right, so with an APIPA address,\n169.254 is what it starts with and\n\n879\n00:47:34,886 --> 00:47:39,198\nyou'll see down here\n255.255.0.0 that tells\n\n880\n00:47:39,198 --> 00:47:43,689\nme the first two octets,\nthese first two values right here.\n\n881\n00:47:43,689 --> 00:47:45,220\nThose are the network ID.\n\n882\n00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:49,490\nThe last two are the whatever\nthey want to be.\n\n883\n00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:51,367\nRight?\n00, that's the host ID.\n\n884\n00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:56,966\nI can talk directly to anyone\nelse who starts with 169.254.\n\n885\n00:47:56,966 --> 00:47:58,300\nWithout going through a router.\n\n886\n00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,800\nAnd that's fortunate cuz I don't\nhave a router when we use APIPA.\n\n887\n00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:03,641\nAll right, so\nthat's pretty important stuff.\n\n888\n00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:07,183\nFor the exam, memorize 169.254.\n\n889\n00:48:07,183 --> 00:48:09,589\nPut that in your mind,\nremember that that is APIPA,\n\n890\n00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:11,399\nthat's how you spot those addresses.\n\n891\n00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:18,280\nNow, when Ronnie was punching\nin an IP address, it knew\n\n892\n00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,530\nwhat subnet mask to put in automatically,\nand you might not have noticed that, so\n\n893\n00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:23,590\nlet's jump back to your machine,\nRonnie, and see that.\n\n894\n00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:27,180\nSo if Ronnie goes in here\nto edit his IP address,\n\n895\n00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:31,890\nWindows does something really\ninteresting with that subnet mask.\n\n896\n00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:35,778\nSo if he chooses,\nuse the following address and punches in,\n\n897\n00:48:35,778 --> 00:48:39,604\nlet's do 192.168.1.2, like you had before.\n\n898\n00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,053\nWhen he clicks on the subnet mask field,\n\n899\n00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:51,388\nsee how it automatically\ntyped in 255.255.255.0?\n\n900\n00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:53,780\nHow did it know to do that?\n\n901\n00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:57,041\nOkay, well Microsoft has some\nnumbers pre-programmed in and\n\n902\n00:48:57,041 --> 00:49:01,100\nthey didn't make this up, this is all part\nof a standard that used to be in place\n\n903\n00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,069\nwhere it can predict what\nsubnet mask you're gonna use.\n\n904\n00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:05,544\nLet's punch in a different address,\nRonnie.\n\n905\n00:49:05,544 --> 00:49:12,626\nPunch in 172.16.0.5.\n\n906\n00:49:15,507 --> 00:49:19,023\n>> I should have erased the-\n>> Oh, yeah you gotta erase that.\n\n907\n00:49:23,449 --> 00:49:26,234\n>> My hidden cursor is\nthe challenge today.\n\n908\n00:49:26,234 --> 00:49:28,730\n[LAUGH]\n>> There you go.\n\n909\n00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,950\nSo now it automatically put\nit in 255.255.0.0, right?\n\n910\n00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,108\nAnd then let's do a ten dot address,\nRonnie.\n\n911\n00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:41,738\n>> Rid of my, Get rid of these first.\n\n912\n00:49:41,738 --> 00:49:43,956\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n913\n00:49:43,956 --> 00:49:49,331\n>> 10.10.30.105\n>> All right.\n\n914\n00:49:49,331 --> 00:49:51,490\n>> Oops, there we go.\n\n915\n00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:55,327\n>> There, and so it punched in 255.0.0.0.\n\n916\n00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:57,820\nHow did it know to make those decisions?\n\n917\n00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:02,198\nWell, IP addresses are divided\ninto what are called classes.\n\n918\n00:50:02,198 --> 00:50:06,583\nThere's different classes that\ndetermine how big your network is or\n\n919\n00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:08,329\nhow small your network is.\n\n920\n00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:14,900\nAnd the classes aren't strictly followed\nanymore, but they serve as a guideline.\n\n921\n00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:19,300\nAnd so Windows is using the class to\nfigure out what a recommended subnet mask\n\n922\n00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,360\nis for you to use.\n\n923\n00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,050\nYou can change it,\n\n924\n00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:25,290\nyou can overwrite it however you want,\nbut they just have a recommendation.\n\n925\n00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,950\nSo let me show you guys\nthe recommendation, show you that old\n\n926\n00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:31,830\nstandard so that you're aware of it\nbecause it can creep up on the exam.\n\n927\n00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,057\nThere were basically three classes.\n\n928\n00:50:33,057 --> 00:50:37,523\nThere was a Class A, a Class B, and\n\n929\n00:50:37,523 --> 00:50:41,842\na Class C that we had to deal with.\n\n930\n00:50:41,842 --> 00:50:43,052\nThere's actually a Class D and E but\n\n931\n00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:44,756\nyou don't have to worry about those for\nthe exam.\n\n932\n00:50:44,756 --> 00:50:50,282\nClass A used the 255.0.0.0 subnet mask.\n\n933\n00:50:50,282 --> 00:50:55,181\nClass B used 255.255.0.0.\n\n934\n00:50:55,181 --> 00:51:00,402\nAnd Class C used 255.255.255.0.\n\n935\n00:51:00,402 --> 00:51:02,050\nAll right.\n\n936\n00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:08,740\nThe system could tell if you were a Class\nA, Class B, Class C, or Class D address,\n\n937\n00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:14,020\nor whatever, based on the first number\nof the IP address, the first octet.\n\n938\n00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,570\nOkay, so remember we've got four octets.\n\n939\n00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:21,080\nWhen we write an IP address, it's made\n\n940\n00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,850\nup of four pieces and so\nwe have 111.222.333.444.\n\n941\n00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:30,010\nSo there's our four octets that we have.\n\n942\n00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:33,020\nOctet one, octet two,\noctet three, octet four, and\n\n943\n00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,400\nit would look at octet number one.\n\n944\n00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,438\nAll right, and based on the number\nthat was in that octet,\n\n945\n00:51:38,438 --> 00:51:40,620\nit could determine which class you were.\n\n946\n00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:47,850\nIf your first octet was 1 through 126, so\n\n947\n00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,250\nanything 1 through 126,\nthen you were a Class A.\n\n948\n00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:59,740\nIf it was 128 through,\n\n949\n00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:03,800\nlet's see, 191, you were a Class B.\n\n950\n00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:11,681\nAnd if it was 192 through 223,\n\n951\n00:52:11,681 --> 00:52:15,670\nyou're were Class C.\n\n952\n00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:21,929\nSo, just looking at that first number,\nwhen Ronnie typed in 192.168.1.2,\n\n953\n00:52:21,929 --> 00:52:28,240\nWindows noticed that that\nfell in the Class C range and\n\n954\n00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,380\nit should have a 255.255.255.0.\n\n955\n00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:35,470\nWhen he typed in 172.16, it said 172,\nthat falls in the Class B range.\n\n956\n00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:41,090\nAnd when he typed in 10.whatever, it said\nhey that falls in the Class A range,\n\n957\n00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:44,720\nand so it put in the recommended\nsubnet mask based on those values.\n\n958\n00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:51,230\nNow notice, that the amount of\noctets dedicated to the network\n\n959\n00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:54,540\nversus the host changes for each class.\n\n960\n00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:59,100\nThe more octets you have dedicated to the\nhost, the more hosts you can have, right?\n\n961\n00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:04,240\nThe more octets you have dedicated to\nthe network, the less hosts you can have.\n\n962\n00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:12,480\nSo, for example, a Class C can only\nhave 254 usable host addresses.\n\n963\n00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:18,240\nSo that's basically what\na Class C ends up with.\n\n964\n00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,106\nA Class B, on the other hand,\n\n965\n00:53:22,106 --> 00:53:27,690\nhas 65,534 usable host addresses.\n\n966\n00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:30,919\nAnd a Class A has-\n\n967\n00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:36,772\n>> 16,770,214.\n\n968\n00:53:36,772 --> 00:53:38,501\n>> You knew that exactly,\nthat's amazing Ronnie.\n\n969\n00:53:38,501 --> 00:53:41,311\nI was gonna say roughly 16 million,\nbut you knew the number.\n\n970\n00:53:41,311 --> 00:53:43,507\n>> Should be 777,000.\n\n971\n00:53:43,507 --> 00:53:45,932\n>> Oh, 777?\n\n972\n00:53:45,932 --> 00:53:47,570\n>> Yes.\n\n973\n00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:51,816\n>> What's a few thousand IP\naddresses here and there, right?\n\n974\n00:53:51,816 --> 00:53:54,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, there we go.\n\n975\n00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,772\nSo a Class A has over 16 million hosts.\n\n976\n00:53:56,772 --> 00:53:58,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's really impressive.\n\n977\n00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:01,210\nThat's a massive network.\n\n978\n00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:03,470\nSo we don't normally use Class As.\n\n979\n00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:07,680\nEven a Class B,\n65,000 IP addresses, that's a ton.\n\n980\n00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,690\nThat's a big network, so\nagain we don't normally use it.\n\n981\n00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,818\n254, that's a much more manageable number.\n\n982\n00:54:12,818 --> 00:54:16,151\nThat's why most home\nnetworks are 192.168.0 or\n\n983\n00:54:16,151 --> 00:54:20,920\n192.168.100, because those\nare Class C networks, they're small.\n\n984\n00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,570\n250 hosts, that's more than\nwhat most homes are gonna have.\n\n985\n00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:28,074\nThat's barely more than what we have here.\n\n986\n00:54:28,074 --> 00:54:29,206\nWe consume some IPs here.\n\n987\n00:54:29,206 --> 00:54:31,240\n>> Yes.\n>> In this day and\n\n988\n00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:35,940\nage where people have a laptop,\na desktop, a cell phone, a tablet,\n\n989\n00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,810\nyou can get every employee\neating up four IP addresses.\n\n990\n00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:43,150\nYou start throwing in cameras and\naccess points and all the other\n\n991\n00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:47,300\nlittle gadgets we have around here,\nyou can turn up some IPs pretty quick.\n\n992\n00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:51,190\nSo businesses will normally go Class B or\nClass A.\n\n993\n00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:51,910\nAll right.\n\n994\n00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:55,500\nNow when I had Ronnie make up\nsome addresses a minute ago,\n\n995\n00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,390\nI fed him some numbers.\n\n996\n00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:00,060\nAnd they were actually\nvery specific numbers.\n\n997\n00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,123\nThere's special networks that\nare set aside for private use and\n\n998\n00:55:03,123 --> 00:55:06,481\nthen there's networks that are set\naside for public use, all right?\n\n999\n00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:09,104\nSo we have private IPs.\n\n1000\n00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:16,314\nSo our private IP ranges,\nthey basically work out like this.\n\n1001\n00:55:16,314 --> 00:55:22,537\nWe have a Class A, which is 10.0.0.0.\n\n1002\n00:55:22,537 --> 00:55:27,402\nIn other words,\nanything that starts with a 10., right?\n\n1003\n00:55:27,402 --> 00:55:30,048\nAnd, in fact,\nlet me just write these as Xs, right?\n\n1004\n00:55:30,048 --> 00:55:37,090\nSo, 10.x.x.x, anything that starts with\na ten is a private Class A IP range.\n\n1005\n00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:41,260\nYou can use this, no big deal, use it\non your network, a lot of people do.\n\n1006\n00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,397\nRight, we use it here in the studio.\n\n1007\n00:55:43,397 --> 00:55:51,572\nClass B you have 172.16.x.x.\n\n1008\n00:55:51,572 --> 00:55:58,463\nAll the way through 172.31.x.x.\n\n1009\n00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:04,969\nSo you actually have quite a few\nclass Bs available, 172.16,\n\n1010\n00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:10,730\n172.17, 172.18 all the way to 172.31.\n\n1011\n00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:13,360\nThose are set aside for\nprivate use, class Bs.\n\n1012\n00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,503\nAnd then you've got Class Cs\n\n1013\n00:56:19,503 --> 00:56:24,897\nwhich are 192 to 168.0,\n\n1014\n00:56:24,897 --> 00:56:28,950\nlet me just do this here.\n\n1015\n00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:34,479\nIt is 0.x,\nall the way through 192.168.255.x.\n\n1016\n00:56:34,479 --> 00:56:39,577\nAll right, so another large series network\n\n1017\n00:56:39,577 --> 00:56:47,180\nis actually 256 networks\navailable there inside a Class C.\n\n1018\n00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:51,496\nSo you have 192.168.0, 192.168.1,\n\n1019\n00:56:51,496 --> 00:56:57,340\n192.168.2, all the way\nthrough 192.168.255.x.\n\n1020\n00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:01,824\nThose are all set aside\nas private addresses for\n\n1021\n00:57:01,824 --> 00:57:06,643\nyou to use in your own local networks and\nwhenever,\n\n1022\n00:57:06,643 --> 00:57:13,948\nanything outside of these ranges,\nso 9.55.172.32., right.\n\n1023\n00:57:13,948 --> 00:57:15,120\n192.169.\n\n1024\n00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:20,060\nAnything outside of these ranges\nis called a public IP address.\n\n1025\n00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:25,700\nAnd public IP addresses, they\n\n1026\n00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:31,890\nmust be registered with the IANA,\nwhich is the, what is it?\n\n1027\n00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:36,250\nThe Internet Authority of Naming and\nNumbering or something [LAUGH]\n\n1028\n00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,360\n>> Yeah, internet authority for\n\n1029\n00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,670\nnumber assigning or something.\n\n1030\n00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:41,510\n>> Here,\nwe'll just pull up their site, IANA.\n\n1031\n00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:44,650\nThe IANA,\nthe Internet Assign Numbers Authority.\n\n1032\n00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:45,840\nI was completely off.\n\n1033\n00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:50,070\nSo these are the guys that control IP\naddresses across the planet as far as IPv4\n\n1034\n00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:54,060\nand IPv6, so if you have a public address,\nit's got to be registered with them.\n\n1035\n00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,600\nYou can't just make it up and use it.\n\n1036\n00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,270\nYou've got to pay for\nit, in a lot of cases.\n\n1037\n00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,560\nSo those are the guys\nthat are heading that up.\n\n1038\n00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,320\nPublic IP addresses and private.\n\n1039\n00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,230\nPrivate you can use to your hearts\ncontent, you don't have to register them.\n\n1040\n00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,250\nYou don't have to get permission but\n\n1041\n00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,880\npublic ones,\nyou do have to get permission.\n\n1042\n00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,577\nSo Microsoft is aware of those, and so\n\n1043\n00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:16,730\nthey've made their user interface\nkind of recognize that.\n\n1044\n00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:20,970\nSo when we go back to these original\naddresses, now we kind of understand\n\n1045\n00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:24,650\nwhat makes up the IP address,\nwhat makes up the subnet mask and\n\n1046\n00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:28,510\nit what it does, and what a default\ngateway is, that's important.\n\n1047\n00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:31,340\nThere is a ton more on this.\n\n1048\n00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,840\nLike I did this binary\nconversion in my head\n\n1049\n00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,220\nthat's kinda a useful thing in some cases.\n\n1050\n00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,960\nThere's also other subnet masks\nthan the ones that we've seen here.\n\n1051\n00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,380\nBut for the Windows 7 exam they\nreally don't get into that.\n\n1052\n00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:48,080\nIf you wanna learn more about it,\njump over to our Network Plus show or\n\n1053\n00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,060\nour Cisco CC&A show.\n\n1054\n00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,490\nWe go into real depth there.\n\n1055\n00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:55,250\nWe show all sorts of different subnets you\ncan create, variable link subnet masks,\n\n1056\n00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:58,090\nand things like that that\nare very complex, but\n\n1057\n00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:00,190\nare kinda beyond the scope of this exam.\n\n1058\n00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:02,300\nSo, if that's the kind of\nthing that gets you excited,\n\n1059\n00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,350\nif you really like networking, definitely\njump over and check out those other shows.\n\n1060\n00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:09,370\nAll right, Ronnie, can you think\nof anything I've left out on IPv4?\n\n1061\n00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:10,070\n>> No, I don't think so.\n\n1062\n00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:11,430\nI think we've covered that pretty good.\n\n1063\n00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:16,010\n>> So those are kinda the general\nthings with IPv4, we still have IPv6\n\n1064\n00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,490\nto talk about, as well as some other\nstuff but I rambled on a little too long.\n\n1065\n00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:22,876\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So why don't we stop here and\n\n1066\n00:59:22,876 --> 00:59:29,338\ntake a break, and when we get back,\nwe'll take a look at IPv6.\n\n1067\n00:59:29,338 --> 00:59:29,845\n>> Yeah.\n\n1068\n00:59:29,845 --> 00:59:33,680\n[SOUND]\n>> All right so\n\n1069\n00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,950\nin the last segment,\nwe took a look at IPv4 addressing.\n\n1070\n00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:41,220\nOne of the new things that we're pushing,\nor Microsoft is pushing really hard\n\n1071\n00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:45,740\nin the Windows operating system\nis the IPv6 addressing scheme.\n\n1072\n00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:50,160\nOne of the problems we have with IPv4,\nif we take the full\n\n1073\n00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,390\naddress set it provides roughly\n4.3 billion IP addresses.\n\n1074\n00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:59,230\nNow the Earth's population\nis over 6 billion right now.\n\n1075\n00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:03,370\nSo it doesn't take a math wizard to figure\nout that there's really just not enough IP\n\n1076\n01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:06,620\naddresses to support our planet and\n\n1077\n01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:09,530\nthe way that we're using\ninternet technologies today.\n\n1078\n01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:13,070\nSo IPv6 was designed to correct that.\n\n1079\n01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:20,070\nIPv6 introduces a new address space that's\nnot 32 bits in size is 128 bits in size.\n\n1080\n01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:25,040\nAnd that gives us a massive address space,\nand Ronnie do you know what that?\n\n1081\n01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,790\nIt's got a name,\nthe number it's so insanely large.\n\n1082\n01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,090\n>> Something, a bazillion.\n\n1083\n01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:31,880\n>> It's so many digits,\nit's hard to put our mind around it.\n\n1084\n01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,170\n>> Right.\n>> So what I always do is,\n\n1085\n01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,770\nI give you guys an example.\n\n1086\n01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:38,490\nSo there's 6 billion people\non the planet right now.\n\n1087\n01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:44,660\nThe IPv6 address space is so big,\nthat every single person on the planet,\n\n1088\n01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:48,830\ncould have the equivalent of\nan entire IPv4 address space.\n\n1089\n01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:55,030\nSo all six billion people could each have\n4.3 billion addresses themselves and\n\n1090\n01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,800\nthere would still be plenty left over.\n\n1091\n01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right,\n\n1092\n01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:01,850\nthat's how big the IPv6 address base is,\nit's massive.\n\n1093\n01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:06,481\nAll right, but the way it achieves this\nis by going from a 32 bit number to\n\n1094\n01:01:06,481 --> 01:01:09,710\na 128 bit number,\nwhich is four times the size.\n\n1095\n01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:13,354\nIf you were just to write out\nthe characters it's four times the length,\n\n1096\n01:01:13,354 --> 01:01:14,021\nit's long.\n\n1097\n01:01:14,021 --> 01:01:18,017\nLet's go back on my\nscreen to where I wrote,\n\n1098\n01:01:18,017 --> 01:01:22,670\nearlier I wrote out an IPV\nfour address right here.\n\n1099\n01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:24,530\nOops,what did I just do?\n\n1100\n01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:27,950\n>> Oh.\n>> I'm just gonna break everything.\n\n1101\n01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:32,850\nHere we go, so here's the 32 bit\naddress that I wrote that's just 32.\n\n1102\n01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:37,100\nAll right,\nif I was to write that out as 128,\n\n1103\n01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:42,940\n32 bits looks something like that right.\n\n1104\n01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:46,102\nBut a 128 bits number, and\n\n1105\n01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:52,010\nI wanna do apples to apples here would be,\nlet's see, one, two, three, four.\n\n1106\n01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:56,920\nThere we go, stretching off my screen,\nit is considerably\n\n1107\n01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:01,140\nlarger than what that 32 bit address is.\n\n1108\n01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,090\nJust a huge difference there.\n\n1109\n01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:08,290\nSo, it's a massive number, so massive that\nif we were to break it up into octets,\n\n1110\n01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:12,290\nwe wouldn't have 4 octets, we would\nhave 16, it's just too big of a number.\n\n1111\n01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:17,800\nSo IPv6 addresses are generally\nrepresented in what's called hexadecimal.\n\n1112\n01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:24,230\nNow I mentioned decimal was base ten,\nbinary was base two and\n\n1113\n01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:29,832\nnow I am mentioning Hexadecimal or\nhex, which is base 16.\n\n1114\n01:02:29,832 --> 01:02:33,720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, and in a base 16 address,\n\n1115\n01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,830\nyou have zero through nine and\nthen A through F.\n\n1116\n01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:42,410\nSo you have 16 possible characters\nthat you can represent.\n\n1117\n01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:47,010\nSo an IPv6 address might\nbe something like this.\n\n1118\n01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:50,983\nI'm just making stuff up,\n\n1119\n01:02:50,983 --> 01:02:55,480\njust to kinda show an example.\n\n1120\n01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:03,920\nI'm gonna start using letters\nthat aren't allowed just because.\n\n1121\n01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,580\nLet's see, how many do I have?\n\n1122\n01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:13,510\nOne, two, three, four, five,\nsix, seven, I need one more.\n\n1123\n01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,420\nI'm gonna change some of\nthis just a little bit.\n\n1124\n01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:27,180\nLike that, okay, so when I write this out.\n\n1125\n01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:32,798\nI'm trying to think of a good\nexample to do here in a second, so\n\n1126\n01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:35,060\nI'm modifying the address a little bit.\n\n1127\n01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:38,010\nWhen I write an IPv6 address out,\nit looks like this.\n\n1128\n01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,350\nNotice it's a mixture of letters and\nnumbers.\n\n1129\n01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,980\nBut not every letter.\n\n1130\n01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,919\nHexidecimal is zero through nine and\nthen A through F.\n\n1131\n01:03:44,919 --> 01:03:46,704\nSo you won't see any\nletters higher than an F.\n\n1132\n01:03:46,704 --> 01:03:49,142\nI started to type an L in there,\nI think I did a K.\n\n1133\n01:03:49,142 --> 01:03:49,816\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1134\n01:03:49,816 --> 01:03:50,742\n>> So, I had to delete those real quick.\n\n1135\n01:03:50,742 --> 01:03:57,490\nBut 0 to 9, A through F, and\nwe have a pretty big address.\n\n1136\n01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:00,680\nNow the address can be scary big\nsometimes, people look at this and\n\n1137\n01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,530\nlike there's no way I'll remember that.\n\n1138\n01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:05,260\nWell you're right, there is no way\nyou're gonna remember that, and so\n\n1139\n01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:08,690\nIPv6 relies on DNS, very, very heavily.\n\n1140\n01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:12,380\nWe can assign a name to this\nlike www.microsoft.com.\n\n1141\n01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:15,260\nAnd DNS can resolve into\nthis hexadecimal address so\n\n1142\n01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:20,330\nthat we don't have to remember it, but\nthat's what an IPv6 address looks like.\n\n1143\n01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:24,724\nNow the address can be abbreviated\na bit to make it a little bit shorter..\n\n1144\n01:04:24,724 --> 01:04:30,103\nFor example, if you have leading zeros,\nlike that right there, the 0002.\n\n1145\n01:04:30,103 --> 01:04:33,361\nWell, you know what,\nI'm gonna take this and\n\n1146\n01:04:33,361 --> 01:04:38,470\nlet me just move it a little bit lower\non my screen so I have some more room.\n\n1147\n01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:44,490\nAll right, so\nI wanna talk about IPv6 addresses.\n\n1148\n01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:48,640\nSo, if I take that number right there,\nI can rewrite it a few different ways.\n\n1149\n01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,730\nAnd so, I'm just gonna take it and\nwe're gonna see about shortening it.\n\n1150\n01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:59,100\nSo, we can remove leading zeros,\n\n1151\n01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:08,240\nall right, so, this number becomes, and\n\n1152\n01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:13,620\njust like if I tell you guys 1, or 01,\n\n1153\n01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:19,580\nor 001, or 0001, right,\nthat's all the same number.\n\n1154\n01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:22,470\nLeading zeros to us,\nwe just delete those in our mind.\n\n1155\n01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:24,480\nThey don't mean anything, right?\n\n1156\n01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:30,009\nIPv6 is the same way,\nwe can delete leading zeros\n\n1157\n01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:36,930\nlike this anywhere that we encounter\nthem to make the address smaller.\n\n1158\n01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:39,110\nNow the address is much\neasier to remember, right?\n\n1159\n01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:42,570\n>> Not really, but it is a little smaller.\n\n1160\n01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:48,510\nThe other thing we can do in IPv6, if you\nhave more than one set of zeros in a row,\n\n1161\n01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:50,990\nyou can collapse them together.\n\n1162\n01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:57,482\nAnd so remove sequential zeros.\n\n1163\n01:05:57,482 --> 01:06:00,720\nIs there an E in zeros?\n\n1164\n01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:07,276\nSo basically we take this guy right here,\n\n1165\n01:06:07,276 --> 01:06:13,570\nand that becomes And\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm\n\n1166\n01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:17,550\ngonna take those two sets of zeros that\nare together, I'm just gonna delete them.\n\n1167\n01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,440\nSo notice how I've got colon colon.\n\n1168\n01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,340\nWhen IPv6 sees a double\ncolon like that it says,\n\n1169\n01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:26,030\neverything in between this is just a zero,\nright?\n\n1170\n01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:30,720\nKey thing about this shortcut,\nyou can only use it once per address.\n\n1171\n01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,250\nIf you only use it once, the server or\n\n1172\n01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,680\nworkstation will count\nthe numbers that you gave it.\n\n1173\n01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:40,380\nSo here I gave it 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n1174\n01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,420\nAnd it says, hey,\nI should have had eight numbers.\n\n1175\n01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:43,670\nYou only gave me six.\n\n1176\n01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:47,010\nThere must be two zeros in\nbetween the colon colon.\n\n1177\n01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:48,450\nIf I did it a second time,\n\n1178\n01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:51,030\nit wouldn't be able to figure\nout how many went in each spot.\n\n1179\n01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:53,330\nSo, that's why we can only\nuse it once per number.\n\n1180\n01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:56,680\nBut the number that I gave you guys\njust shrank a little bit more.\n\n1181\n01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,730\nSo, IPv6 addresses don't have to be so\nbad, they can be shortened up,\n\n1182\n01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:02,070\nbut they're still bad.\n\n1183\n01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:04,900\nThat's still quite the number\nto remember right there.\n\n1184\n01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:08,804\nSo that's gonna be a little bit heavy for\nus, all right.\n\n1185\n01:07:08,804 --> 01:07:12,670\nSo again, we're just gonna rely on\nDNS to handle a lot of this stuff.\n\n1186\n01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:17,700\nAside from this, IPv6 really works\nthe same way that IPv4 does.\n\n1187\n01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,620\nYou have a subnet mask, you have an IP\naddress, you have a default gateway.\n\n1188\n01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:25,300\nEverything else works the same, it's just\na different way of writing the address.\n\n1189\n01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:30,020\nNow the subnet masks can be really,\nreally long because there's 128 bits.\n\n1190\n01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:33,633\nSo you don't wanna have to deal with\nthat whole 255255, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1191\n01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:37,487\nSo the subnet masks are really\nwritten a different way.\n\n1192\n01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:41,399\nIf, for example,\nI have a 128 bit address and\n\n1193\n01:07:41,399 --> 01:07:47,698\nthe first half of the address, the first\n64 bits, makes up the subnet mask,\n\n1194\n01:07:47,698 --> 01:07:52,494\nthen in IPv6,\nwe would write that subnet mask as a /64.\n\n1195\n01:07:52,494 --> 01:07:57,880\nAnd in fact that's the most common subnet\nmask in IPv6, so the 64 is pretty common.\n\n1196\n01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:04,020\nSo by writing that /64, you're saying\nthe first 64 bits are the network ID,\n\n1197\n01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:08,470\nand the last 64 bits are the host ID.\n\n1198\n01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:13,325\nA /32 would mean the first 32 bits of\nthe network ID, and the remaining,\n\n1199\n01:08:13,325 --> 01:08:17,446\nwhat would be remaining,\n96 bits would be the host ID, right.\n\n1200\n01:08:17,446 --> 01:08:20,239\nSo slightly different way of\nwriting that subnet mask but\n\n1201\n01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:22,926\nit really does mean the same\nthing at the end of the day.\n\n1202\n01:08:22,926 --> 01:08:24,916\nAll right, so\nRonnie let's jump back to your machine and\n\n1203\n01:08:24,916 --> 01:08:27,850\nshow them what it's like to\nconfigure an IPv6 address.\n\n1204\n01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:31,360\n>> So in the same place where we've\nconfigured the IPv4 addresses,\n\n1205\n01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,500\nonce we bring up that local\narea of connection properties,\n\n1206\n01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,330\nremember that we actually have\ntwo of these options here.\n\n1207\n01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:41,075\nThe one that we've been taking a look at\nin our earlier segments here was IPv,\n\n1208\n01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,051\nInternet Protocol Version 4.\n\n1209\n01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:46,425\nRight above that is\nInternet Protocol Version 6 and\n\n1210\n01:08:46,425 --> 01:08:51,190\nthis shows you Windows 7's preference for\nactually using the address.\n\n1211\n01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:54,109\nIf it wants to do it, and\nit really wants to do IPv6 first,\n\n1212\n01:08:54,109 --> 01:08:56,140\nit shows it here in the list.\n\n1213\n01:08:56,140 --> 01:09:00,520\nAll I do is I select it and in the same\nmanner I click on Properties, and\n\n1214\n01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:05,100\nnow we're actually in our Internet\nProtocol properties here for IPv6.\n\n1215\n01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:10,320\nNotice I can obtain an IPv6\naddress automatically or\n\n1216\n01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,870\nI can actually type one in, okay.\n\n1217\n01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:17,270\nSo if I select use the following\nIPv6 address here.\n\n1218\n01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:21,315\nLet's see, we can just make one up here.\n\n1219\n01:09:21,315 --> 01:09:29,470\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That's the hardest part.\n\n1220\n01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:32,100\nIt's hard to quickly make one\nup because they're so long.\n\n1221\n01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,310\nWhat he could do,\nif you're just doing this in a lab or\n\n1222\n01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:39,159\nwhatever, you could say\nsomething like 2001::1, and\n\n1223\n01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:42,290\nthat basically just says that\neverything in between is all zeros.\n\n1224\n01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:45,580\nBut you know that's not a good address\nto use in real life a lot of times,\n\n1225\n01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,180\nso in a lab you can kinda cheat.\n\n1226\n01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:50,820\n>> And\nnotice that in terms of the sbnet mask,\n\n1227\n01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:54,830\nit's already seen that usually the most\npredictable one is gonna be 64,\n\n1228\n01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:57,080\nand all I did is I clicked in it and\nthere it is.\n\n1229\n01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,810\nIt gave me that 64 here.\n\n1230\n01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:01,800\nAnd then, of course, if you actually\nhad an actual default gateway you\n\n1231\n01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,220\nwould also put it in here as well.\n\n1232\n01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,360\nI'm just going to copy this.\n\n1233\n01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:12,400\nAnd I'm gonna cheat and\nI'm gonna make it a 1 at the end.\n\n1234\n01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,413\n>> Yeah, and your host needs a number at\nthe end too or otherwise it ends in 0.\n\n1235\n01:10:15,413 --> 01:10:16,283\n>> Oh, oh, there we go.\n\n1236\n01:10:16,283 --> 01:10:17,120\nI forgot that one.\n\n1237\n01:10:20,754 --> 01:10:23,490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The crazy mouse icon is killing me.\n\n1238\n01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:26,000\n>> It's not exactly easy\nto see underneath it.\n\n1239\n01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,660\n>> So he's punching in\nthe IP address here to use.\n\n1240\n01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:32,664\nAnd this is the IPv6 address so\nit's that nice big long number.\n\n1241\n01:10:32,664 --> 01:10:36,230\nAnd when we hit OK,\nit's going to assign that, and\n\n1242\n01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:39,600\nnow it's got an address, it's got\na gateway, and it's ready to rock.\n\n1243\n01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:46,620\nNow in Windows, Microsoft Windows\n7 prefers IPV6 over IPV4,\n\n1244\n01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:50,960\nso anytime it communicates, it's gonna\ntry and communicate using IPV6 first.\n\n1245\n01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,400\nAnd if that fails, then it uses IPv4,\nso we'll see that in\n\n1246\n01:10:55,400 --> 01:11:00,305\naction as it does its normal look ups and\nthings like that, right.\n\n1247\n01:11:00,305 --> 01:11:03,520\nSo how do we know that it\nprefers one over the other?\n\n1248\n01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,630\nWell, Ronnie, if you go back to\nthe Network and Sharing screen.\n\n1249\n01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,690\nOh yeah, back to your adapter\nscreen there in the background.\n\n1250\n01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:10,622\n>> All right.\nAnd\n\n1251\n01:11:10,622 --> 01:11:15,890\nhit Alt+F on your keyboard to\npull down the hidden menu, right.\n\n1252\n01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:20,580\nIn the hidden menu, you'll see\nAdvanced up there, and under Advanced,\n\n1253\n01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:25,170\nyou can go to Advanced Settings,\nand in here you'll see your\n\n1254\n01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:29,480\nlocal area connection and beneath it\nthe order of the preferred protocols.\n\n1255\n01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,800\nAnd actually this one's been changed.\n\n1256\n01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,972\nThe default is that IPv6 is preferred, and\n\n1257\n01:11:33,972 --> 01:11:36,269\napparently our lab\nmachines have it changed.\n\n1258\n01:11:36,269 --> 01:11:40,332\nYou can take it and you can\nhighlight IPv6 and hit the up arrow.\n\n1259\n01:11:40,332 --> 01:11:43,874\nLet's go ahead and do it, and do it for\nfile and printer sharing too.\n\n1260\n01:11:43,874 --> 01:11:47,909\nBy moving those to the top,\nour system will now try IPv6 first,\n\n1261\n01:11:47,909 --> 01:11:50,240\nunless it fails, then we use IPv4.\n\n1262\n01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,170\nAnd what you're looking at now,\nthis is the normal default.\n\n1263\n01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:56,130\nSo I guess in our lab machines\nwe must have that changed.\n\n1264\n01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:59,440\nBut the normal default in\nWindows 7 is to prefer IPv6.\n\n1265\n01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:01,730\nAll right.\n\n1266\n01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:03,080\nLet's go ahead and say OK to that.\n\n1267\n01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:06,190\nNow, all throughout our system it's\ngonna start preferring that and\n\n1268\n01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,600\nwe kind of saw that earlier.\n\n1269\n01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,496\nRemember, Ronnie,\nwhen you pinged the domain controller?\n\n1270\n01:12:11,412 --> 01:12:14,260\nSo he did a ping to our\ndomain controller to DC.\n\n1271\n01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:20,130\nAnd when he did that ping it actually\npulled an IPv6 address before and\n\n1272\n01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:23,970\nI had to have him force it using\nping-4 to make it use IPv4.\n\n1273\n01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:25,260\nAll right.\n\n1274\n01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:26,400\nAnd now it's not resolving.\n\n1275\n01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,760\n>> There it is.\nIt just took a moment.\n\n1276\n01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,850\n>> And so see,\nthere it is pulling the IPv6 address for\n\n1277\n01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:33,080\nthat server and pinging using that.\n\n1278\n01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,580\nYou can do ping-4 to\nforce it with IPv4 and\n\n1279\n01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:40,655\nping-6 to force it with\nIPv6 if you ever need to.\n\n1280\n01:12:40,655 --> 01:12:42,575\n>> It's probably cuz I\nset that unusual IP-\n\n1281\n01:12:42,575 --> 01:12:43,618\n>> The 2001, yeah.\n\n1282\n01:12:43,618 --> 01:12:44,488\nIt's probably trying on that on.\n\n1283\n01:12:44,488 --> 01:12:45,327\n>> Yeah.\n\n1284\n01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:48,890\n>> Now, notice a few things here.\n\n1285\n01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:53,326\nLet's do an IPconfig when you get a\nchance, Ronnie, when that thing lets you.\n\n1286\n01:12:56,576 --> 01:13:01,308\nAll right, notice you'll see\nthe address that Ronnie assigned,\n\n1287\n01:13:01,308 --> 01:13:04,950\n2001:AAAA:BBBB and so on, right?\n\n1288\n01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:09,780\nAnd then right after that, link local\nIPv6 address, fe80 blah, blah, blah.\n\n1289\n01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:12,398\nWhat is that?\n\n1290\n01:13:12,398 --> 01:13:17,530\nWell, in IPv6, every single network card,\nevery single machine,\n\n1291\n01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:22,910\nwill automatically generate an address\nthat is only good on the local network,\n\n1292\n01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:26,020\njust for talking to machines that\nare on the same network as it.\n\n1293\n01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:29,500\nAnd you can recognize them\nbecause they start with fe8.\n\n1294\n01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,788\nThere's some other numbers\nthat they can start with, but\n\n1295\n01:13:31,788 --> 01:13:34,830\nthat's the typical one is fe8,\nthat's what you're gonna see in windows.\n\n1296\n01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:38,440\nEasy to spot,\nthat's your link local address.\n\n1297\n01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,110\nSo whenever you talk to somebody\non the same network as you,\n\n1298\n01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:45,300\nyou're typically going to be using\nthe fe8 or the link local address.\n\n1299\n01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:49,760\nBut when you're going between networks,\nthat's when you use your IPv6\n\n1300\n01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:54,070\naddress that you assigned to that\n2001 address that Ronnie assigned.\n\n1301\n01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:58,160\nAnd, as far as public IPs on the Internet,\nmost of them today start with 200.\n\n1302\n01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:03,400\nThey can actually range in quite a big\nswath, but the address base is so\n\n1303\n01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:07,390\nbig right now that most of the public\naddresses are still in that 200 range.\n\n1304\n01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:11,640\nSo those are, kind of, some differences\nwe can see with IPv6 addresses.\n\n1305\n01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:16,900\nNow, Windows is running right now on\nwhat's called a dual stack mode, so\n\n1306\n01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:20,500\nit's running both IPv4 and\nIPv6 at the same time.\n\n1307\n01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:24,270\nAnd that's one of the keys\nto transitioning to IPv6.\n\n1308\n01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:27,720\nYou're probably not ready to\ngo 100% IPv6 today, right?\n\n1309\n01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:31,323\nNot all your applications are updated,\nnot all your services are updated.\n\n1310\n01:14:31,323 --> 01:14:33,800\nSo, the idea is you can run both and\n\n1311\n01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:37,480\nslowly transition over to\nIPv6 as time provides.\n\n1312\n01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:42,810\nSo, we can see that information in there,\nit's in place, we're good to go.\n\n1313\n01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:45,300\nWhen we do name lookups, right?\n\n1314\n01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,630\nSo, Ronnie, do a NsLookup for DC.\n\n1315\n01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:52,560\nWhen we do name lookups your\nDNS server may have IPv4 and\n\n1316\n01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,070\nIPv6 addresses registered.\n\n1317\n01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:56,010\nAnd if that's the case,\n\n1318\n01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:59,830\nwhen you start to do lookups\nit'll return both sets of values.\n\n1319\n01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:04,370\n>> It's probably not liking my,\nlet me change that adapter.\n\n1320\n01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:07,164\nGet out of my assigned\naddress [LAUGH] here.\n\n1321\n01:15:07,164 --> 01:15:09,150\nMy typed-in address.\n\n1322\n01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:09,950\nIt may not like that.\n\n1323\n01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,760\nAssumed that I have an easier time.\n\n1324\n01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,860\n>> And do we still have a DNS server set?\n\n1325\n01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:19,373\nOh yeah.\nIt was reaching out to 192.168.1.1.\n\n1326\n01:15:19,373 --> 01:15:23,863\n>> And so let's see, nslookup.\n\n1327\n01:15:23,863 --> 01:15:25,160\nSee if it looks it up.\n\n1328\n01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,415\nOh, dc.\n\n1329\n01:15:27,415 --> 01:15:29,321\n>> You know it's getting\nthat request timed out.\n\n1330\n01:15:29,321 --> 01:15:30,906\nI wonder, are we able to ping that server?\n\n1331\n01:15:33,618 --> 01:15:34,370\nI guess we were.\n\n1332\n01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:37,840\nWe were able to do a ping\na few moments ago.\n\n1333\n01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:40,954\nServer's taking a long time\nto respond though isn't it?\n\n1334\n01:15:40,954 --> 01:15:41,919\n>> Yeah.\n\n1335\n01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:46,600\n>> Interesting.\n\n1336\n01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,170\nBut yeah, when you do a name lookup,\nwhat'll happen a lot of times is you'll\n\n1337\n01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:54,060\nget both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address back,\nyou'll get both of them, and\n\n1338\n01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,680\nthat allows you to pick which\none you wanna connect to.\n\n1339\n01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:01,179\nBut if it's an IPv4 only host you'll\njust get the IPv4 address back and\n\n1340\n01:16:01,179 --> 01:16:05,697\nthat's it, so it kind of varies based\non how that server is configured.\n\n1341\n01:16:05,697 --> 01:16:12,032\nIt's kind of stuck.\n\n1342\n01:16:12,032 --> 01:16:13,917\nWhat IPv4 address-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1343\n01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:14,827\n>> Did we leave on our system?\n\n1344\n01:16:14,827 --> 01:16:16,970\nDid we leave it in some weird network?\n\n1345\n01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:18,520\n>> It's possible.\n\n1346\n01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,920\nOh yeah, that alternative.\n\n1347\n01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:23,270\n>> Well, now it's getting there though.\n\n1348\n01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:24,530\n>> Okay.\n>> Do an nslookup for dc.\n\n1349\n01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:27,670\nSo just nslookup dc and\nlet's see if it returns both.\n\n1350\n01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:29,880\nI don't know if the DNS records\nare there for it or not.\n\n1351\n01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:30,480\n>> It may not be, yeah.\n\n1352\n01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,910\n>> So we'll have to see.\n\n1353\n01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:33,930\nYeah, it might not.\n\n1354\n01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:37,100\nNow IPv6 has some neat\nstuff built into it.\n\n1355\n01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,040\nIf you've got a DNS server configured,\n\n1356\n01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,880\nit'll look to that and\npull the addresses from there.\n\n1357\n01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,300\nApparently we don't.\n\n1358\n01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:46,490\nIf you don't have a DNS server though,\nhow is it still able to look up DC,\n\n1359\n01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:48,350\nlike we were able to ping DC?\n\n1360\n01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:53,920\nWell, IPv6 uses multicast technology\nto do a lot of cool stuff,\n\n1361\n01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,060\nand one of those things is to do\nwhat's called peer name resolution.\n\n1362\n01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:02,870\nIt can find peers on your network,\nby name, by using IPv6 multicast.\n\n1363\n01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:05,650\nA multicast is where we send\nout a message that says,\n\n1364\n01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:07,880\nhey, I'm trying to\ncommunicate with this name.\n\n1365\n01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:08,900\nWho is it?\n\n1366\n01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:12,115\nAnd the person who has that name will\nhear it, catch that message, and\n\n1367\n01:17:12,115 --> 01:17:13,465\nrespond back and say, oh yeah that's me.\n\n1368\n01:17:13,465 --> 01:17:14,965\nYou can talk to me here.\n\n1369\n01:17:14,965 --> 01:17:19,185\nSo, even without a DNS server we can\nfind people locally on our network.\n\n1370\n01:17:19,185 --> 01:17:20,775\nNow, to make sure that's functional,\n\n1371\n01:17:20,775 --> 01:17:23,535\nthere's actually a service that\nwe need to start in Windows 7.\n\n1372\n01:17:23,535 --> 01:17:26,285\nSo, we're going to jump\ninto our services panel.\n\n1373\n01:17:27,695 --> 01:17:28,825\nAnd let's see if we can find it.\n\n1374\n01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:32,361\nIf you scroll down it's under network,\nI believe.\n\n1375\n01:17:40,945 --> 01:17:43,952\nAnd, we've got the.\n\n1376\n01:17:43,952 --> 01:17:44,877\n>> Peer name.\n\n1377\n01:17:44,877 --> 01:17:45,460\n>> There it is.\n\n1378\n01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,970\nYep, peer name resolution protocol, PNRP.\n\n1379\n01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:51,790\nAnd that's a part of what lets us\neasily find those hosts by name,\n\n1380\n01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:53,850\neven if we don't have a DNS server.\n\n1381\n01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:57,910\nAnd it's turned off here, but IPv6 can\nactually make use of it even when it's off\n\n1382\n01:17:57,910 --> 01:18:00,230\nbecause it uses link layer communications,\nor\n\n1383\n01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:03,995\nlayer two communication, to be able to\nreach out and identify those peers.\n\n1384\n01:18:03,995 --> 01:18:07,365\nThere is some neat stuff built in\nthe background for the local side.\n\n1385\n01:18:07,365 --> 01:18:08,965\nIn this case, it's set to manual.\n\n1386\n01:18:08,965 --> 01:18:12,315\nSo if IPv6 needs it can kick\nit on if it wants it, but\n\n1387\n01:18:12,315 --> 01:18:16,057\nwe could set it to automatic to\nstart it and facilitate that.\n\n1388\n01:18:16,057 --> 01:18:18,517\nNow I'll tell you that might fine for\nhome users, but\n\n1389\n01:18:18,517 --> 01:18:21,987\nmost businesses are not going to use that,\nthat's why it is set to manual.\n\n1390\n01:18:21,987 --> 01:18:24,217\nMost businesses are going to use DNS.\n\n1391\n01:18:24,217 --> 01:18:27,378\nHaving a good DNS\ninfrastructure is really,\n\n1392\n01:18:27,378 --> 01:18:29,448\nwhile it's not an absolute requirement,\n\n1393\n01:18:29,448 --> 01:18:34,018\nit's a really good idea in IPv6 because\nthe addresses are just unmanageable.\n\n1394\n01:18:34,018 --> 01:18:37,038\nThey're just so\nbig that you can't remember them.\n\n1395\n01:18:37,038 --> 01:18:42,198\nYou want to have those host names,\nso you want to have DNS servers.\n\n1396\n01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:44,348\nI feel like I'm leaving something out,\nRonnie.\n\n1397\n01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:49,610\nWe got the network locations,\nwe'll talk about those in a minute.\n\n1398\n01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:51,780\nWhat else is there?\n\n1399\n01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:53,080\nShoot.\n\n1400\n01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:57,069\nLet's talk a little bit about DHCP,\nwe got a few minutes left.\n\n1401\n01:18:57,069 --> 01:19:02,210\nIn IPv6, we can use DHCP, all right?\n\n1402\n01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:05,490\nYou can have a IPv6 DHCP\nservice handing out addresses.\n\n1403\n01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:10,160\nBut it's not necessary, and\nthat's because IPv6 actually has its own\n\n1404\n01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:13,870\nbuilt in addressing system,\nso we can generate addresses.\n\n1405\n01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:15,568\nWhat you do is you set up a router,\n\n1406\n01:19:15,568 --> 01:19:18,650\nand this goes a little bit beyond\nthe scope of what's on the exam, but\n\n1407\n01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:22,950\nyou set up a router with what's called\nyour suffix, your network ID, and\n\n1408\n01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:26,610\nyou router will start advertising\nthat network ID to the network.\n\n1409\n01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:31,461\nAnd when a new computer boots up,\nit can see that network ID and\n\n1410\n01:19:31,461 --> 01:19:34,837\nautomatically generate its own address.\n\n1411\n01:19:34,837 --> 01:19:38,054\nIt's generates that address\nthrough one of two methods.\n\n1412\n01:19:38,054 --> 01:19:40,144\nThere's one that's called EUI-64,\n\n1413\n01:19:40,144 --> 01:19:43,975\nwhere it uses the MAC address You'll\nsee that with Cisco and other systems.\n\n1414\n01:19:43,975 --> 01:19:47,663\nBut in Windows it uses a different method\nwhere it arbitrarily picks the address,\n\n1415\n01:19:47,663 --> 01:19:51,150\nand that's actually what's happening\nwith our link local address.\n\n1416\n01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:52,960\nRonnie if you go back to\nyour IP config screen.\n\n1417\n01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:02,417\nWhat it's doing is, the first 64 bits\nof the address are Fe80::, all right.\n\n1418\n01:20:02,417 --> 01:20:09,021\nSo, what that means is the first\nfour values are Fe80:0:0:0.\n\n1419\n01:20:09,021 --> 01:20:12,680\nSo, the first half of that address is\njust all zeros, basically and Fe8.\n\n1420\n01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:19,480\nThe last 64 bits, though, what identifies\nthis host, are just arbitrarily made up.\n\n1421\n01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:23,410\nThe workstation made those up, and it\nchecked the network to see if anybody else\n\n1422\n01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:27,310\nhad them, but, if nobody did,\nthis is what it goes with.\n\n1423\n01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:36,930\nSo, if you have a router saying, hey, your\nnetwork is 2001:1234:5678:abcd, right?\n\n1424\n01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:38,930\nIt just gave us the first four values.\n\n1425\n01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:43,720\nOur machine can take those four values and\narbitrarily generate the last four values,\n\n1426\n01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:47,370\nand now we've got an IPv6 address,\nand we know who the router is.\n\n1427\n01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:51,020\nSo, we just got our IP and\ndefault gatewaywithout using DHCP.\n\n1428\n01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:55,240\nThe only thing we didn't get were\nDNS servers, and again in IPv6,\n\n1429\n01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:59,020\nthe DNS servers can advertise themselves,\nand you can find them that way, or\n\n1430\n01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:02,300\nwe can statically assign DNS servers,\nthat's not such a big deal.\n\n1431\n01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:06,510\nYou'll also notice at the end\nof that address, the percent 11.\n\n1432\n01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:07,500\nAll right?\n\n1433\n01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:12,050\nIPv6 addresses are different than IPv4.\n\n1434\n01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:18,070\nWith IPv4, an IP address is specifically\nattached to a single interface.\n\n1435\n01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:23,070\nBut, in IPv6 you can have one address\nattached to more than one interface.\n\n1436\n01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:24,290\nThey call it anycast.\n\n1437\n01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:27,180\nAnd this is great for redundancy, right.\n\n1438\n01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:30,140\nIf one network card fails\nyou still answer for\n\n1439\n01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,780\nyour address on your other network card.\n\n1440\n01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:33,670\nIt's really cool.\n\n1441\n01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:36,800\nSo what that percent 11 does,\nis that identifies what's called a zone.\n\n1442\n01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,510\nBut what it really is,\nis identifying an interface.\n\n1443\n01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:42,330\nRight now it's attached to\nthe interface with index number 11.\n\n1444\n01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:47,250\nYou might have other interfaces\nwith other index numbers, and\n\n1445\n01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:49,980\nso it can be attached to\nthose too if it needs to.\n\n1446\n01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,470\nSo that's what that percent 11 is.\n\n1447\n01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:53,400\nThe percent 11 is really a Window's thing.\n\n1448\n01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,260\nIt's not a part of the IPv6 address.\n\n1449\n01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,940\nMicrosoft sticks it on there\nto identify that interface.\n\n1450\n01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:02,170\nSo, everything else before that percent\nsign is actually the IPv6 address.\n\n1451\n01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:05,769\nAll right.\n\n1452\n01:22:05,769 --> 01:22:07,884\nRonnie, I think as far as\nthe exam is concerned,\n\n1453\n01:22:07,884 --> 01:22:10,110\nthat's really all we\nneed to know about IPv6.\n\n1454\n01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:12,910\nLet me just make sure we\ndidn't miss anything there.\n\n1455\n01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:16,320\nWe do have a little bit more to talk\nabout here on the networking side.\n\n1456\n01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,180\nI wanna talk about network locations,\nwhich are IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n1457\n01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:24,410\nAnd I want to talk a little\nbit about wireless networking,\n\n1458\n01:22:24,410 --> 01:22:27,500\nwhich we may or\nnot have enough time for that actually.\n\n1459\n01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,990\nWe'll probably hold that off and\ndo a second show,\n\n1460\n01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:31,900\ncuz we still have firewall and\nall that to get into.\n\n1461\n01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:35,660\nSo I do want to come back and do one more\nsegment to tackle network locations and\n\n1462\n01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:38,585\na little bit of information there,\nand we'll probably wrap up from there.\n\n1463\n01:22:38,585 --> 01:22:40,495\n>> Sounds great.\n>> All right, so let's stop here and\n\n1464\n01:22:40,495 --> 01:22:43,797\ntake a break, stay tuned and when we get\nback we're gonna wrap up the showtime on\n\n1465\n01:22:43,797 --> 01:22:46,627\nnetwork locations, and\nthen we'll set ourselves up for part two.\n\n1466\n01:22:46,627 --> 01:22:48,375\nSo stay tuned we'll be back in a few.\n\n1467\n01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:55,805\n[MUSIC]\n\n1468\n01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:57,560\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1469\n01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,630\nSo the last thing we want to talk about in\nthis episode are what are called network\n\n1470\n01:23:01,630 --> 01:23:02,960\nlocations.\n\n1471\n01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:06,760\nIn Windows 7, the first time you\nconnect to a network, if you\n\n1472\n01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:11,320\nplug in a physical cable or connect to a\nwireless network, it asks you a question.\n\n1473\n01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,250\nIt says, what type of network is this?\n\n1474\n01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:19,230\nIs is it a home network, a work network,\nor a public network, all right?\n\n1475\n01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:22,670\nAnd the reason it's asking you is Windows\nhas a couple of different firewall\n\n1476\n01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:26,370\nprofiles or whatever that are set up that\n\n1477\n01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:30,770\nchanges how secure your machine is\nbased on the type of network you're on.\n\n1478\n01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:34,410\nAnd we're going to talk about\nthe firewall in another episode, but\n\n1479\n01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:36,920\nfor right now the network\nlocations work like this.\n\n1480\n01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:40,730\nIf you choose home network\nit allows file sharing and\n\n1481\n01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:45,100\nsystem discovery and a bunch of things\nthat you typically would want in a home.\n\n1482\n01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,410\nIf you choose work network\nit's very similar.\n\n1483\n01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:51,490\nIt turns on a lot of that stuff but it\ndoesn't turn on things like home group and\n\n1484\n01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:53,220\nstuff that you wouldn't use at work.\n\n1485\n01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:57,140\nIf you choose public it\nblocks almost all of that.\n\n1486\n01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:59,730\nYou don't want people on a public\nnetwork discovering your machine.\n\n1487\n01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:00,900\nIf you're at Starbucks,\n\n1488\n01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:03,560\nyou don't want somebody trying to browse\nthrough the file shares in your computer.\n\n1489\n01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,320\nSo it kind of locks things\ndown a little bit more.\n\n1490\n01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:10,150\nThis is regardless of whether\nthe network is IPv4 or IPv6.\n\n1491\n01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:12,130\nIt does it for both.\n\n1492\n01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:15,960\nThe first time you plug into a new\nnetwork right, it sees that domain name,\n\n1493\n01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,368\nIP address and so on.\n\n1494\n01:24:17,368 --> 01:24:21,999\nIt's then gonna prompt you and say, all\nright, well what type of network is this?\n\n1495\n01:24:21,999 --> 01:24:22,522\nAll right.\n\n1496\n01:24:22,522 --> 01:24:27,110\nNow, if you're like me, you accidentally\nclick or you move past it or whatever, and\n\n1497\n01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:30,190\nyou never see it again and\nthen it is kind of frustrating.\n\n1498\n01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:33,220\nSo, how do we know if\na network type has been set?\n\n1499\n01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:35,470\nLet's start there, and\nRonnie you've got yours pulled up?\n\n1500\n01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:36,270\n>> Yep.\n>> Perfect.\n\n1501\n01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:39,990\n>> Inside our Network and Sharing Center,\nyou can see right at the top of the screen\n\n1502\n01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:44,510\nhere that it shows me that I have\nthis nice little full map here, and\n\n1503\n01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:47,240\nI see a little park bench is what I see.\n\n1504\n01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:50,010\nBut down here under view\nof my active networks here,\n\n1505\n01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:52,730\nmine is currently set to a public network.\n\n1506\n01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:56,420\nThat's what mine's actually set to, and\nso you can see that if you were again\n\n1507\n01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:58,447\nconnected to a work network\nyou would see a work.\n\n1508\n01:24:58,447 --> 01:25:01,570\nIf you were again connected to home,\nyou'd see a little house.\n\n1509\n01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:04,870\nSo sometimes the work one shows up as\na building, or something like that.\n\n1510\n01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:07,868\nSo you actually see those different\nicons that show that you're\n\n1511\n01:25:07,868 --> 01:25:10,764\nconnected to that particular\nnetwork profile is what you do.\n\n1512\n01:25:10,764 --> 01:25:12,660\n>> And\nyou've got the same kind of problem.\n\n1513\n01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:16,385\nI have a defaults to a public network,\nso if you cancel the screen, or\n\n1514\n01:25:16,385 --> 01:25:19,855\nreboot before selecting, or\nwhatever, it'll go public, and\n\n1515\n01:25:19,855 --> 01:25:23,517\nonce it's find just public,\nyour firewall rules are very tight and\n\n1516\n01:25:23,517 --> 01:25:26,300\nthings might not be working\nthe way that we want it.\n\n1517\n01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:28,786\nYou might not be able to share files,\nshare printers, or whatever.\n\n1518\n01:25:28,786 --> 01:25:33,655\nSo you might notice that there's\nno change button on there.\n\n1519\n01:25:33,655 --> 01:25:37,785\nIt doesn't give us the ability\nto change what the network is.\n\n1520\n01:25:37,785 --> 01:25:42,755\nBy default, once you flag a network\none way, it stays that way and\n\n1521\n01:25:42,755 --> 01:25:44,207\nthere's no way to get around it.\n\n1522\n01:25:44,207 --> 01:25:46,827\nThat's one of the reasons that I wanted\nto bring this up specifically during\n\n1523\n01:25:46,827 --> 01:25:47,337\nthe show,\n\n1524\n01:25:47,337 --> 01:25:51,917\nis that we can change that behavior to\nallow us to come in here and change it.\n\n1525\n01:25:51,917 --> 01:25:55,227\nSo, if you've done like ours,\nwe want that to be a work network.\n\n1526\n01:25:55,227 --> 01:25:57,670\nThat's our business,\nour domain environment.\n\n1527\n01:25:57,670 --> 01:25:59,950\nSo we want to change that but\nit won't let us.\n\n1528\n01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:02,760\nSo we need to go into our local policy.\n\n1529\n01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:07,410\nSo we're just gonna bring up our\nStart menu and type in gpedit.msc.\n\n1530\n01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:11,850\nThat's the group policy editor,\ngpedit.msc.\n\n1531\n01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:14,770\nAnd we've gotta dig in here for a setting.\n\n1532\n01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:19,470\nIt's under the Computer Configuration,\nunder Windows Setting,\n\n1533\n01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:23,180\nSecurity Settings and then Network List.\n\n1534\n01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:26,580\nYou'll see the network list\nmanager policy is right there, and\n\n1535\n01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:30,430\non the right side,\nthere's contoso.com, okay.\n\n1536\n01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:31,800\nThat's our network.\n\n1537\n01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,550\nWe could modify just that one if we want.\n\n1538\n01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:38,860\nLike if you pull up the properties\nthere you'll see where you can modify,\n\n1539\n01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,420\nyou can change it's name.\n\n1540\n01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:42,990\nYou can change its network icon.\n\n1541\n01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:44,549\nYou got Icon tab up there.\n\n1542\n01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:47,846\nPicky about that.\n\n1543\n01:26:47,846 --> 01:26:50,520\nSo you can change the icon\nlike Ronny mentioned.\n\n1544\n01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:53,160\nAnd so you'll see some of\nthe different ones there.\n\n1545\n01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:57,845\nAnd you've got the Network Location\ntab up there that you can modify, and\n\n1546\n01:26:57,845 --> 01:27:03,325\nhere's where you can specify if it's\na private or public network, okay?\n\n1547\n01:27:03,325 --> 01:27:05,905\nRemembering that home and\nwork are very similar,\n\n1548\n01:27:05,905 --> 01:27:07,795\nthey both kind of get flagged as private.\n\n1549\n01:27:07,795 --> 01:27:13,820\nNow the setting that is really handy is\nthat one where it says User permissions.\n\n1550\n01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:16,980\nUser can change the location,\nuser cannot change the location.\n\n1551\n01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:20,470\nBy default,\nthe user cannot change the location.\n\n1552\n01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:24,995\nIt's locked, and the only way to change\nit is to come in here to the Policy.\n\n1553\n01:27:24,995 --> 01:27:28,778\nAll right?\nBut one of the things that I like to do,\n\n1554\n01:27:28,778 --> 01:27:31,245\nis I like to change this.\n\n1555\n01:27:31,245 --> 01:27:32,824\nAnd so let's do something here, Ronny.\n\n1556\n01:27:32,824 --> 01:27:36,225\nCan you cancel that?\n\n1557\n01:27:36,225 --> 01:27:37,050\nAll right.\n\n1558\n01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:39,660\nAnd how are you connected to that machine?\n\n1559\n01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:41,890\nIs that hyper v, is it-\n>> Yeah, I believe it is hyper v.\n\n1560\n01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:44,030\n>> Okay,\ncan you disable your network connection?\n\n1561\n01:27:48,075 --> 01:27:51,025\nSo we're gonna disable the network\nconnections, kind of like unplugging it.\n\n1562\n01:27:51,025 --> 01:27:54,315\nThis is a virtual machine so we can't\njust take the cable out of the back.\n\n1563\n01:27:54,315 --> 01:27:55,845\nBut he's gonna disable it.\n\n1564\n01:27:55,845 --> 01:27:58,715\nI asked how he was connected because if\nhe was like remote desktop this would\n\n1565\n01:27:58,715 --> 01:27:59,805\ndisconnect him.\n\n1566\n01:27:59,805 --> 01:28:01,585\nSo there we go, disabled the connection.\n\n1567\n01:28:01,585 --> 01:28:02,805\nGo back to your group policy.\n\n1568\n01:28:04,805 --> 01:28:06,555\nAnd just delete Contoso.\n\n1569\n01:28:06,555 --> 01:28:08,031\nIf you right-click on Contoso,\n\n1570\n01:28:08,031 --> 01:28:10,465\nyou know what it's not gonna\nlet you delete it, is it?\n\n1571\n01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:12,980\nNo.\n\n1572\n01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,222\n>> Well, that's lame.\n\n1573\n01:28:14,222 --> 01:28:15,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\n\n1574\n01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:20,980\nwell, let's leave that one be, then, and\npull up all networks, that last one.\n\n1575\n01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:24,550\nThe one that says all networks, these are\nlike the generic settings that'll apply to\n\n1576\n01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:29,620\nall of your adaptors, and let's set\nthat one to User Can Change Location.\n\n1577\n01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:32,980\nSo we're going to say it's okay for\n\n1578\n01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:36,860\nus to change location if it's not set\nright to be able to do it through the GUI\n\n1579\n01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:39,280\nas opposed to doing it\nthrough this policy here.\n\n1580\n01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,910\nGo ahead and apply that.\n\n1581\n01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:42,660\nAnd did you change the setting on Contoso?\n\n1582\n01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:44,325\nLet's double check that before we move on.\n\n1583\n01:28:46,135 --> 01:28:50,365\nAnd go under Network Location, and let's\njust make sure it's set to not configured.\n\n1584\n01:28:50,365 --> 01:28:51,105\nPerfect.\n\n1585\n01:28:51,105 --> 01:28:52,125\nIt's set to not configured so\n\n1586\n01:28:52,125 --> 01:28:55,495\nthe All Network settings is\nwhat's going to apply, all right?\n\n1587\n01:28:55,495 --> 01:28:59,400\nLet's go ahead and close out of this and\n\n1588\n01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:02,360\nthen you probably do a GP\nupdate to be on the safe side.\n\n1589\n01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:07,110\nPolicy settings like this usually\ntake effect immediately, but\n\n1590\n01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:11,104\nthere are some that don't take effect\nright away.So to be on the safe side I'm\n\n1591\n01:29:11,104 --> 01:29:15,097\nasking Ronnie to do a GP update to force\nit to update the group policy to make sure\n\n1592\n01:29:15,097 --> 01:29:16,579\nthose changes take effect.\n\n1593\n01:29:22,066 --> 01:29:26,710\nAll right, now that that's done,\nalmost done, there we go.\n\n1594\n01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:27,630\nNow it's done.\n\n1595\n01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:28,862\nGo ahead and\nturn your network adapter back on.\n\n1596\n01:29:32,267 --> 01:29:35,595\nAll right, and let's go back to\nthe Network and Sharing Center.\n\n1597\n01:29:39,105 --> 01:29:43,417\nOkay, so now he's got the Contoso network,\nit shows up right there.\n\n1598\n01:29:43,417 --> 01:29:44,927\nIt shows as a public network and\n\n1599\n01:29:44,927 --> 01:29:51,027\nif we click on that, now it gives\nus the screen to change our mind.\n\n1600\n01:29:51,027 --> 01:29:55,537\nThis is the screen you see the very first\ntime you plug in that network adaptor.\n\n1601\n01:29:55,537 --> 01:29:58,510\nBut if you just hit Cancel or\nif you reboot or\n\n1602\n01:29:58,510 --> 01:30:01,750\nwhatever before picking,\nit becomes a public network.\n\n1603\n01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:04,310\nThat's the default, and\nyou're stuck there.\n\n1604\n01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:07,070\nSo that policy setting that we just\nmodified allows us to see this\n\n1605\n01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:08,080\nscreen again.\n\n1606\n01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,630\nSo even though Ronnie was already\nconnected, now he can see it.\n\n1607\n01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:13,960\nAnd you see you've got Home,\nWork and Public, all right.\n\n1608\n01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,750\nThey change that a little\nbit in Windows 8.\n\n1609\n01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:19,850\nNow it's Home, Domain, and Public, but\nHome, Work, and Public in Windows 7.\n\n1610\n01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:23,580\nSo, this is a work network for\nus so we wanna choose that one.\n\n1611\n01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:29,020\nAll right, now that it's worked, just\nlike Ronnie said, the icon has changed.\n\n1612\n01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:30,710\nIt looks like a little building.\n\n1613\n01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:32,360\nIt's now a work network.\n\n1614\n01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:36,730\nI don't know why Microsoft chose not to\nallow us to change that after the fact.\n\n1615\n01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:37,790\nThey just did.\n\n1616\n01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:39,600\nSo that's how we get around it.\n\n1617\n01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,900\nBut this is really customizing\nwhich firewall rules will apply.\n\n1618\n01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:47,170\nSo later when we do a show\ncovering the Windows 7 firewall,\n\n1619\n01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:50,800\nyou'll see that each firewall\nrule has what's called a scope.\n\n1620\n01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:51,870\nWhich network does it apply to?\n\n1621\n01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:55,740\nDoes it apply to the work network, or\nthe public, or the home, or all three?\n\n1622\n01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,610\nSo those are our network locations.\n\n1623\n01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:02,930\nVery important, right, cuz they can\ncause certain things not to work,\n\n1624\n01:31:02,930 --> 01:31:05,050\nespecially file sharing.\n\n1625\n01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:06,460\nSo pretty useful thing.\n\n1626\n01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:11,300\nKeep in mind that what Ronnie sees here,\nsee how it says view your active networks?\n\n1627\n01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:12,780\nIt's not showing your inactive networks,\n\n1628\n01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:15,740\nso if he had connected to\na wireless network at home but\n\n1629\n01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:19,150\nnow he's at the office, the home\nnetwork doesn't show up here anymore.\n\n1630\n01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:22,030\nSo if you wanna manipulate networks\nthat aren't active right now,\n\n1631\n01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:25,225\nthat's where you have to go\nthrough the group policy editor,\n\n1632\n01:31:25,225 --> 01:31:27,490\ncuz that'll show all of them in there,\nand you can manipulate them.\n\n1633\n01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:33,081\nAll right, so\nthat is the basics on network location.\n\n1634\n01:31:33,081 --> 01:31:34,579\nAm I leaving something out there?\n\n1635\n01:31:34,579 --> 01:31:36,073\nI feel like I am.\nI don't think so,\n\n1636\n01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:39,470\nlet me pull up the objectives here,\nsometimes.\n\n1637\n01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:43,560\n>> Sometimes I feel like I'm leaving\nsomething out but I'm not so let's see,\n\n1638\n01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:46,542\nwe're gonna do wireless networks later,\nlet's see,\n\n1639\n01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:49,940\nnetwork location, no, I think we're good.\n\n1640\n01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:54,170\nKeep in mind, with anything that\nwe do through a group policy,\n\n1641\n01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:56,420\nwe did it right there,\nlocally on the machine.\n\n1642\n01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:58,508\nWe could do that for\nour entire domain if we wanted.\n\n1643\n01:31:58,508 --> 01:32:00,100\nSo, we could go into\nthe active directory and\n\n1644\n01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,960\ncreate a GPO there,\na group policy object, and\n\n1645\n01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:07,270\napply it to thousands of machines in our\ncompany, knocking it all out at once.\n\n1646\n01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:08,610\nAnd you can do that.\n\n1647\n01:32:08,610 --> 01:32:12,110\nYou can even manually create\nthe Contosa network, or whatever, and\n\n1648\n01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:13,940\nset it to have a certain value.\n\n1649\n01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:16,378\nSo that's pretty handy in\nan enterprise environment.\n\n1650\n01:32:16,378 --> 01:32:19,760\nIf you wanna learn more about applying\nGPOs at the enterprise level,\n\n1651\n01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,020\njump over to the server shows.\n\n1652\n01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:23,800\nWe cover there,\nit is a terribly useful thing.\n\n1653\n01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:24,620\n>> Yes.\n\n1654\n01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:28,190\n>> But on the exam, they're gonna try and\nkeep you limited to the Windows 7 world,\n\n1655\n01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:29,820\nso you'll normally see policy screens or\n\n1656\n01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:32,810\nwhatever that are based on\njust that Windows 7 machine.\n\n1657\n01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:37,800\nSo all right, so that's our introduction\nto network configurations there.\n\n1658\n01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:42,970\nSo we talked about, let's recap a little\nbit, the IPv4 addressing, IPv6 addressing.\n\n1659\n01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:46,720\nWe saw how to set those addresses and\nget our systems talking on the network.\n\n1660\n01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:51,820\nAnd we talked about network locations,\nwhich is what governs our firewall rules.\n\n1661\n01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:53,550\nThere's still a lot more to go.\n\n1662\n01:32:53,550 --> 01:32:55,360\nWe got wireless networks to tackle.\n\n1663\n01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,230\nSo how we get connected,\nhow we set up preferred ones there, and\n\n1664\n01:32:58,230 --> 01:33:02,700\nthere's also the firewall rules and\nremote management being able

right, welcome back to another\nfantastic episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,120\nI am Nathan Copeland\nhere with Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,010\n>> How's it going, Nate?\n\n7\n00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,800\nYeah, pretty good, pretty good, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,572\n>> Ready now that you\nhave your milkshake and-\n\n9\n00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:47,480\n>> [LAUGH] Not anymore.\n\n10\n00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,440\nI wish I did, though.\n\n11\n00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,560\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n12\n00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,595\nAt lunch,\nRonnie bought me a chocolate milkshake.\n\n13\n00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:55,385\nWhich I drank and it was great.\n\n14\n00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:58,515\n>> I bought it because I apparently\nlost a bet during our earlier episode.\n\n15\n00:00:58,515 --> 00:01:00,505\nOh, I think I won that one.\n\n16\n00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:01,995\nWell\n>> Oh, there we go.\n\n17\n00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,255\nWell, let's not dwell on the\n>> That's right.\n\n18\n00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:05,355\nLet's not dwell on it.\n\n19\n00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:06,815\n>> Let's not dwell on the past.\n\n20\n00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:08,430\nI mean, It happens.\n\n21\n00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,270\n>> Yeah.\nSo\n\n22\n00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,360\ntoday we've got part two of our\nnetworking set of objectives.\n\n23\n00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,060\nAnd specifically, we've got three little\nparts here that we will be covering.\n\n24\n00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,860\nWe've got networking settings,\nwe've got some wireless stuff,\n\n25\n00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,910\nsome wired things in there.\n\n26\n00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,810\nPretty cool.\n\n27\n00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,650\nWe've got good old Windows firewall.\n\n28\n00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,850\nWhich is pretty sweet, I like digging\naround in there and looking at stuff.\n\n29\n00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,560\nAnd then down there at the very bottom,\nwe have got, let me just scroll down.\n\n30\n00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,630\nYeah, I don't know why they put\nsuch a big gap between the pages.\n\n31\n00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,190\nSo we got remote management stuff,\nwe got executing these remote\n\n32\n00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,850\npower shell things that\nRonnie will brace us with.\n\n33\n00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,400\n>> Sure.\n\n34\n00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:49,900\nSweet.\n\n35\n00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,470\nAll right, well, Ronnie,\nanything intro-wise before we get started?\n\n36\n00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,600\n>> Well, remember that this is\nthe second part of the episode on\n\n37\n00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,040\nnetwork configurations\n>> So\n\n38\n00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,240\nif you're unfamiliar with\nthe idea of networking and IPv4,\n\n39\n00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,000\nIPv6 make sure you check out that first\nepisode, if you happen to skip here.\n\n40\n00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,260\n>> Again for a deep understanding of that,\n\n41\n00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,400\ndon't forget to check out our\nnetwork plus episodes as well, and\n\n42\n00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,470\neven our CC&A episodes if you actually\nneed a more complete understanding.\n\n43\n00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,830\n>> What we're doing here today, of course,\nis rounding out some of the different\n\n44\n00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,520\nconfigurations that we can make inside of\nWindows 7, and that of course includes\n\n45\n00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,900\nthe idea of making sure that you know how\nto configure wireless network adapters.\n\n46\n00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,790\n>> So we're gonna actually go\nover to Nate's machine now and\n\n47\n00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,230\nlet's see what we can actually do here,\n\n48\n00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,235\nsince Nate actually does have a wireless\nnetwork access card on his computer.\n\n49\n00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:37,735\n>> Mm-hm.\nYep.\n\n50\n00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,120\nAll right, so first thing's first,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n51\n00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,290\nconnect up to a wireless network.\n\n52\n00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,760\nAll right, so to do that, we might\nneed to go full screen just briefly.\n\n53\n00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,250\nSo down on the little task bar, down\nthere we've got this little computer guy.\n\n54\n00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,670\nRight now she's got a computer and\n\n55\n00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,470\nI believe that's a cord of some kind,\nlike a plug.\n\n56\n00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,730\nBut if we go ahead and\njust left click on this,\n\n57\n00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,810\nwe are greeted with some of our wireless\nnetworks that are currently in range.\n\n58\n00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,200\nAnd to connect to one of these guys, so\n\n59\n00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,040\nwe'll go ahead and\nwe'll just select this Studio network.\n\n60\n00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,250\nWe'll click on it,\nnow we can chose to connect\n\n61\n00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,450\nautomatically next time it's in range\nwe can change this setting later.\n\n62\n00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,420\nBut I'm going to go ahead and clear this\ncheck box, we will click on connect and\n\n63\n00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,050\nwe will now by default.\n\n64\n00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,820\nYou can see everything in there.\n\n65\n00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,550\nI am going to choose to hide it.\n\n66\n00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,198\nJust in case.\n\n67\n00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:43,380\nAnd if everything goes well,\n\n68\n00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,030\nsweet, which it did, then we are now\nconnected to our wireless network.\n\n69\n00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,590\nAnd just for old time's sake,\nlet's go ahead and connect to one more.\n\n70\n00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,040\nSweet.\n\n71\n00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,460\nAll right, there we go!\n\n72\n00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,640\nSo now you can do a wireless network.\n\n73\n00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,300\n>> Yeah.\n\n74\n00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,260\n>> Now Nate, I noticed that you have\nseveral wireless adapters there.\n\n75\n00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,570\n>> And this also means that with\nthose different network adapters,\n\n76\n00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,670\nhow do we know which one the actual\noperating system chooses, so\n\n77\n00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,030\nwe also can have the ability to\nset up the idea of preferences?\n\n78\n00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,240\n>> In other words, to actually\nmake our network adapter choose\n\n79\n00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,170\nwhich one to actually connect to.\n\n80\n00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,740\n>> Let's go ahead and\ngo into our connections here and\n\n81\n00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,970\nsee that on our Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n82\n00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,400\nAll right, I'll jump in.\n\n83\n00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,630\nSo you're talking about,\nlike our preferred networks?\n\n84\n00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,100\n>> Yep.\nPreferred networks.\n\n85\n00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,930\n>> Those sorts of things?\n\n86\n00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,500\n>> Yep.\n\n87\n00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,640\nSo what we'll do is up\ninto our Network and\n\n88\n00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,850\nSharing Center, we've got this\nlittle guy up here at the tippy top.\n\n89\n00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,450\nManage wireless networks.\n\n90\n00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,505\nWe will click on this guy.\n\n91\n00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:53,350\n>> Uh-oh.\n\n92\n00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,890\nAnd you know what?\n\n93\n00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,596\nAnd there.\n\n94\n00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:57,395\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well that's unusual.\n\n95\n00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:58,220\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n96\n00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,596\nI guess it does not think that\nwe have any wireless networks.\n\n97\n00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:05,733\nLet's just refresh.\n\n98\n00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:06,710\nNope.\n\n99\n00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,330\nSo that is a bit peculiar,\nbecause we do have two.\n\n100\n00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,270\n>> Multiple wireless networks there.\n\n101\n00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,490\nTwo multiple wireless networks in there.\n\n102\n00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,730\nI guess let's click\nconnect to a third one.\n\n103\n00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,087\nAnd this one is,\n\n104\n00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:29,136\n>> All right, let's go and\n\n105\n00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:33,950\nconnect up to that guy.\n\n106\n00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,450\nSo, okay.\n\n107\n00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,700\nSo, now we have three,\nthree networks, that\n\n108\n00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,120\n>> That are not showing up.\n\n109\n00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,490\nThat we got to change it to.\n\n110\n00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,960\nMaybe let's just give it a minute and\ngo back.\n\n111\n00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,000\nStill no wireless networks.\n\n112\n00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,260\nWell, in here we would be getting a.\n\n113\n00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,670\nMaybe it just takes a minute to populate,\nbut\n\n114\n00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,490\nwe would be getting our wireless\nnetworks that Windows has.\n\n115\n00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,870\nYou know what, Ronnie?\n\n116\n00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,420\nI believe I think I know\nwhat the problem is.\n\n117\n00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:03,920\n>> All right.\n\n118\n00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,750\nI think the connect automatically.\n\n119\n00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,110\nLet's try it.\nAll right,\n\n120\n00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,210\nlet me choose to hide that again.\n\n121\n00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,630\nSo this one was, I think the public.\n\n122\n00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,420\n>> Oh, there you go.\n\n123\n00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,610\n>> All right, okay, so there we go.\n\n124\n00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,650\nLet me go ahead and\nconnect to these other guys.\n\n125\n00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,130\nAll right, connect automatically.\n\n126\n00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,630\nType those in again.\n\n127\n00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,970\nAnd for good measure, let me pick\nthe third one, and choose that one again.\n\n128\n00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,880\nHide characters.\n\n129\n00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,290\n>> Good job, Nate.\n\n130\n00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:44,970\n>> Thanks, Ronnie.\n\n131\n00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,340\n>> I wasn't gonna figure it out,\nI can guarantee that.\n\n132\n00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,590\n[LAUGH]\n>> And this one.\n\n133\n00:06:53,130 --> 00:07:02,630\nOops, I got stage fright, hold on.\n\n134\n00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,760\nSweet, okay.\n\n135\n00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,590\n>> Good.\n\n136\n00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,378\n[LAUGH] If you want to have the option to\nmanage your wireless networks be sure to\n\n137\n00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:11,210\nchoose connect automatically.\n\n138\n00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,000\nThere we go.\n\n139\n00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,050\nOnce we're in here,\nwe have our wireless networks.\n\n140\n00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,710\nNow do we set the order\nof preferred networks,\n\n141\n00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,690\nit's just whatever is first\nthat is listed in here.\n\n142\n00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:29,310\nSo, whenever this PC here comes in\nrange of one of these networks,\n\n143\n00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,730\nor perhaps all three of these networks,\nas in this case is gonna try\n\n144\n00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,930\nthe studio network first, and then it\nwill move on to the private network.\n\n145\n00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,520\nAnd if it still cannot connect, then it\nwill fall back to that public network.\n\n146\n00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,880\nNow, let's say if we want to move,\n\n147\n00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,977\nif we want Private to become\nour preferred wireless network,\n\n148\n00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:54,290\nthen we'll just select it and we will move\nthat guy up the list, just like that.\n\n149\n00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,151\nSo now when I come in to range,\n\n150\n00:07:56,151 --> 00:08:00,255\nthe private network will now be\nour preferred wireless network.\n\n151\n00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,585\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n152\n00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:04,976\n>> All right, now let's see, so\n\n153\n00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:10,590\nonce we get into that,\nI see part of our objective.\n\n154\n00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,640\nLet me just jump back\nover into our objectives.\n\n155\n00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,870\nAll right, so our security settings.\n\n156\n00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,710\nAll right, now, for\n\n157\n00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,070\nour security settings we'll be\nconnecting to our wireless network.\n\n158\n00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,720\nMore times than not,\n\n159\n00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,910\nthose will be set by whoever is\nsetting up this wireless network.\n\n160\n00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,030\nOn the access point they'll\nchoose the encryption level.\n\n161\n00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,070\nThey'll choose the SSID.\n\n162\n00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,110\nAnd if we're using a shared secret,\na password,\n\n163\n00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,920\nthen whoever sets it up will also\ndetermine on that right there.\n\n164\n00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,630\nBut what we can do,\nlet's just take this NH Private.\n\n165\n00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,100\nWe can right click on this guy, and\nwe can go down into Properties.\n\n166\n00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,850\nAnd so, here we get some stuff,\nthe name of our network, the SSID.\n\n167\n00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,780\nAnd, Ronnie,\ndo you remember what the SSID stands for?\n\n168\n00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,470\n>> Secure set identifier.\n\n169\n00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,280\n>> Secure set identifier?\n\n170\n00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,910\nNice.\nAll right,\n\n171\n00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:11,130\nso we got the network type, access point,\nall users can connect to it.\n\n172\n00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,810\nAnd there's that little check box,\n\n173\n00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,310\nconnect automatically when\nthe network is in range.\n\n174\n00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,410\nNow, Ronnie,\nI'm going to go out on a limb here.\n\n175\n00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,810\nAnd I'm going to say that\nif I clear this checkbox,\n\n176\n00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,540\nIt will disappear from\nmy managed networks.\n\n177\n00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,524\n>> It's possible.\n\n178\n00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:25,190\n>> Should we-\n>> It's not gonna be there.\n\n179\n00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,160\n>> Should we bet a milkshake on it?\n\n180\n00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,378\n>> No, you still owe me from this morning.\n\n181\n00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:30,360\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\n\n182\n00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,790\nwell, I won't bet on it.\n\n183\n00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,870\n>> That's right.\n\n184\n00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:39,040\n>> So, we got this option here, to connect\nto a more preferred network if available,\n\n185\n00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,690\nalthough we can just move them\naround within our list behind there.\n\n186\n00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,450\n>> Yeah, but, that's actually\na good option for us, right?\n\n187\n00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,330\nThe very fact is maybe our\npreferred network is not available\n\n188\n00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,680\nwhere we actually are.\n\n189\n00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,740\nAnd so, what we can do is actually\ntell our wireless network access card\n\n190\n00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,430\non out laptops to go ahead and connect\nwith whichever one's actually there.\n\n191\n00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,970\nBut choose a more preferred\none if they do find one.\n\n192\n00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,720\nWe have that option available as well.\n\n193\n00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,090\n>> We do have this option here,\n\n194\n00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,300\nthe third one down, Connect even if\nthe network is not broadcasting its name.\n\n195\n00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,215\nRonnie, you wanna give us a little bit of\na background on that about a network not\n\n196\n00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:19,660\nbroadcasting?\n\n197\n00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,380\n>> Well, remember, you can actually\nhide the SSID on the access point so\n\n198\n00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,500\nit doesn't actually\nbroadcast out the name.\n\n199\n00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,880\nAnd that means that when you\ndo set up security, though,\n\n200\n00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,040\nwe'd have to actually provide both the\nSSID as well as the pass phrase to get in.\n\n201\n00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,080\nSo it's not really a big,\ngigantic security measure, but\n\n202\n00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,090\nit does at least hide your network from\npeople, so that they'd have to at least\n\n203\n00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,940\nfind that information before\nthey could try and connect.\n\n204\n00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,510\n>> All right so,\nalong with our wireless properties,\n\n205\n00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,800\nthere is one little,\nour fourth little check box down here.\n\n206\n00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,700\nThese Intel Connection settings.\n\n207\n00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,070\nNow I don't believe that\nevery card will have this.\n\n208\n00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,870\nI'd say maybe just Intel adapter cards.\n\n209\n00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,633\n>> I think you're on to a point there.\n\n210\n00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:01,377\n>> Right?\n>> Yeah.\n\n211\n00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:05,030\nNice.\n\n212\n00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:09,770\nWe can click Configure on this guy and\nwe get a couple of little options here.\n\n213\n00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,320\nWireless networks, the 2.4 GHz band and\n\n214\n00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,200\nthe 5 GHz band depending on\nwhether it's A, B, G, N, AC,\n\n215\n00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,990\nwhich is the newest one out.\n\n216\n00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,620\nAnd now this one here I think is\na pretty neat little option here.\n\n217\n00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,120\nYou know, a mandatory access point.\n\n218\n00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,220\nSo entering in the number for\nthe access point,\n\n219\n00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,460\nyou can only connect to just that one.\n\n220\n00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,210\nYeah.\n\n221\n00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:36,980\nKind of neat.\n\n222\n00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,720\nAnd, then, application auto launch.\n\n223\n00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,540\nSo, Ronnie, let me ask you this.\n\n224\n00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,330\nIf you had to pick an application\nthat would automatically\n\n225\n00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,580\nlaunch whenever you connected to\na wireless network, what would you pick?\n\n226\n00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,165\n>> Solitaire.\n\n227\n00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:52,020\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n228\n00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,490\n>> I'm joking, I don't have a clue.\n\n229\n00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,850\n>> What about the internet?\n\n230\n00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,880\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or Netflix?\n\n231\n00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,490\n>> Like the internet?\n\n232\n00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,500\nThe internet as an application?\n\n233\n00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,360\nAwesome.\n\n234\n00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,820\nThat's cool.\n\n235\n00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,650\nNo, Internet Explorer.\n\n236\n00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,650\nI can understand, sure.\n\n237\n00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,910\n>> Okay.\n\n238\n00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,900\n>> A browser?\n\n239\n00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,900\n>> I did a browser, thank you.\n\n240\n00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,440\n>> Yeah, there we go.\n\n241\n00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,510\n>> You always know the right words.\n\n242\n00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,970\n>> I do not know that right word.\n\n243\n00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,550\n>> So enter the security type.\n\n244\n00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,050\nAll right so\nwe can choose to change some things.\n\n245\n00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,300\nNow-\n>> Yeah you can, look at that.\n\n246\n00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,760\n>> So\nwe've got different encryption types that\n\n247\n00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,440\nwe have on here.\n\n248\n00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,940\nAnd 802.1X works with a certificates,\nis that right Ronnie?\n\n249\n00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,620\n>> It is.\n\n250\n00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,070\n>> All right, and we've got the WPA.\n\n251\n00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,790\nNow Ronnie, of this list here,\n\n252\n00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:37,530\nwhat would you say would be the most\nsecure, then the least secure?\n\n253\n00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,330\n>> It would be no authentication\nas being the least secure.\n\n254\n00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:40,989\n>> Oh, I didn't see that one.\n\n255\n00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:43,590\n>> [LAUGH] At least,\nthat's what I would say.\n\n256\n00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,754\nNow, Nate could disagree with me.\n\n257\n00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:51,482\nI would go all the way up to 802.1X in\nterms of using digital certificates as\n\n258\n00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:52,720\nbeing the more secured.\n\n259\n00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,742\nI don't know what the Intel CCKM is,\nthough.\n\n260\n00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,362\nIt may be more secured,\nbut I don't know for sure.\n\n261\n00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:02,920\n>> All right so we've go those security\ntypes there right, the encryption types,\n\n262\n00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,180\nwe've got AAS and TKIP in there and\n\n263\n00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,170\nthen there is our network security\nkey where we can change it.\n\n264\n00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,750\nYou know if the security key,\n\n265\n00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,220\nif it did change we can chose\nto forget the network or\n\n266\n00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,630\njust removed from our list and\nwe could have to enter it in again.\n\n267\n00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,260\nThat way, or\nwe can just change it right there.\n\n268\n00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,860\n>> Yeah.\nBefore we go on,\n\n269\n00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,140\nclick on that security type tab again, and\n\n270\n00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,600\nlet's make sure we point out\na couple of differences here.\n\n271\n00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,432\nAnd those that you see, WPA, Personal and\nEnterprise WPA2, Personal and Enterprise.\n\n272\n00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:37,050\nI wanna make sure that you actually\nunderstand the differences\n\n273\n00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,170\nbetween these two,\nbecause it's gonna be important to you.\n\n274\n00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,400\nWhen you implement the ID of personal,\nyou're actually using a pre-shared key.\n\n275\n00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,366\nThat means if I set up\na key on my access point,\n\n276\n00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:53,030\nit means you also, I would give you that\nkey and you would put that on as well.\n\n277\n00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,560\nBut if you're inside of\na business network and\n\n278\n00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,170\nyou are setting up the ID of a radia\nserver, in other words a remote\n\n279\n00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,440\nauthentication server, then you would\nuse the ID of Enterprise instead.\n\n280\n00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,050\nSo most people at home\nare probably not gonna do that.\n\n281\n00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,803\nMost of the time,\n\n282\n00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:10,731\nyou probably going to end up choosing\nthe ID of the Personal instead.\n\n283\n00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:14,902\nWindows 7, by default,\nrecommends that you use at least WPA2 and\n\n284\n00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:16,850\nnot any of the earlier ones.\n\n285\n00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,565\nNot that you can't, but\n\n286\n00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:21,420\nit's that they recommend that that\nbe your minimum level of security.\n\n287\n00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:28,040\n>> All right, sweet, so there we go,\nthere's our security settings for\n\n288\n00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,580\nour wireless networks.\n\n289\n00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:38,710\nAll right, let's jump back\nover here into our list here.\n\n290\n00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,730\n>> Lets just take a look at\nthe wireless network adapter itself and\n\n291\n00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,730\ngo through some of the settings there.\n\n292\n00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,360\nNow if you joined us in\na previous episode as well or\n\n293\n00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,440\nmaybe an episode that's\ncoming up later here.\n\n294\n00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,440\nWe do take a look at the actual\nphysical network adapter and\n\n295\n00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,670\ntalk about some of the properties\nthat are actually in them.\n\n296\n00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,855\nSo which one is, I guess pick one of\nthose I guess, yeah that looks good.\n\n297\n00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:06,310\n[LAUGH] And go down to our properties and\nyou'll see that its really nothing a lot\n\n298\n00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:11,010\ndifferent here in terms of the actual\nproperties that you see on the adaptor.\n\n299\n00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,790\nSo same way that you actually\nwould have on a regular\n\n300\n00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,780\nphysical network adaptor you have\nthe same ticker properties there.\n\n301\n00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,210\nYou click on that configure tab.\n\n302\n00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,920\nRemember that what we're looking at\nhere are the physical properties\n\n303\n00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,410\nof the network adapter.\n\n304\n00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,240\nSo again, you can actually see\nwhere you can change the driver,\n\n305\n00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,970\nyou can update that,\nyou have power management features,\n\n306\n00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,710\nyou have details, in terms of what\nthe physical adapter's all about.\n\n307\n00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,160\nAnd so, you can see all that and be able\nto actually use those to your advantage\n\n308\n00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,750\na lot of time if you're trying\nto manage this remotely as well.\n\n309\n00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,380\n>> Okay,\nI'm gonna click Cancel from there.\n\n310\n00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,575\n>> And then, oops, yeah, double-click\non that, Wireless Network Connection.\n\n311\n00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:53,555\nOkay, from here of course you\nhave your regular network\n\n312\n00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:55,485\nstatus details that we have.\n\n313\n00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:59,085\nAgain showing us graphically how\nmuch data's actually been received.\n\n314\n00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:02,375\nThe actual connection that you\nhave in terms of the connectivity.\n\n315\n00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,125\nAs well as the up time\nthat you have as well.\n\n316\n00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,545\nNotice that the speed\nright here is 58 megabits.\n\n317\n00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:12,048\nMost of the time when you\nactually think about it,\n\n318\n00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:17,090\nusually the idea of using 802.1g or\n802.1b,\n\n319\n00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:22,883\n802.11, I don't know what\nI'm saying 802.11a or\n\n320\n00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:27,740\n802.11b, excuse me and 802.11b here.\n\n321\n00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,650\nYou'll probably see 11 megabits,\nor the idea of 54 megabits for G.\n\n322\n00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:37,180\n802.11a, you'll see 54 megabits for\nA as well.\n\n323\n00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,510\nSo when you see that, again, a wireless\nconnection, 54 megabits, not exactly bad.\n\n324\n00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,270\nYep.\n>> Yeah, not bad there at all.\n\n325\n00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,750\n>> Yep.\n\n326\n00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,520\n>> All right.\n\n327\n00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,770\nAnything else to know about\nconnection properties.\n\n328\n00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,490\n>> Well, in the same way,\nwe have access to those secret properties,\n\n329\n00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,136\nright, that are hidden.\n\n330\n00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:57,259\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n331\n00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:57,823\n>> Yep?\n\n332\n00:16:57,823 --> 00:16:59,235\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n333\n00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:01,005\nYou know a key up here?\n\n334\n00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:01,555\n>> Yup.\n\n335\n00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:02,275\nAnd then the advanced.\n\n336\n00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,415\n>> All right.\n>> Advanced settings.\n\n337\n00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:10,625\nAnd so the same aspect of\nwhat we actually had before\n\n338\n00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:15,120\nwe can also do here per interface or\nproto connection as well.\n\n339\n00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,820\nOkay?\n\n340\n00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,950\nSo if you haven't seen that,\nremember go and\n\n341\n00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,410\ncheck out, I can't remember\nexactly what episode that was in.\n\n342\n00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,810\nBut you and Wes, I believe,\nwent through these particular settings.\n\n343\n00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,370\n>> Probably.\n\n344\n00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:26,900\n>> Yeah.\n\n345\n00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,000\nOkay?\n>> They all run together.\n\n346\n00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,950\n>> So\nmake sure to check those settings out.\n\n347\n00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:39,520\nAll right, let's see what else,\nall right location aware printing.\n\n348\n00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,540\nAll right, so laptops have this\nreally cool feature where,\n\n349\n00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,440\nwhen you are connected to different\nnetworks, it will choose a preferred\n\n350\n00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,370\nprinter or a default printer depending on\nwhatever network you are connected to.\n\n351\n00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,480\nAll right,\nsince I happen to be running Windows 7.\n\n352\n00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,062\nAnd I am on a laptop.\n\n353\n00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:03,345\nLet's go ahead and close this guy out.\n\n354\n00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:08,490\nAnd let's jump over\ninto our control panel.\n\n355\n00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,229\nAnd our hardware and sound,\ndevices and printers.\n\n356\n00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,220\nAll right.\nSo on this machine here, so\n\n357\n00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,600\nI have two printers.\n\n358\n00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,370\nI've got this Canon inkjet printer, which\nis set by default by that little checkbox.\n\n359\n00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,150\nAnd then an Epson laser printer,\nwhich, Ronnie,\n\n360\n00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,900\nhave you ever owned a Epson printer?\n\n361\n00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,910\n>> I have, but it was a .matrix printer.\n\n362\n00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,831\n>> A .matrix?\n\n363\n00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:31,419\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n364\n00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:33,310\n>> Which those ones that go bzz.\n\n365\n00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:33,880\n>> Yes, they are.\n\n366\n00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,000\n>> Oh, right.\n\n367\n00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,620\n>> Yes.\n\n368\n00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,972\n>> All right, good deal.\n\n369\n00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:42,970\nAll right, so to set up our preferred\nprinter location or printer,\n\n370\n00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:48,780\nthis feature is only available on laptops,\nor I think Microsoft doesn't call out\n\n371\n00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,910\nlaptops specifically but\nany kind of device that has a battery.\n\n372\n00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:58,340\nI suppose it would go along with our\nare tablets or battery powered desktop.\n\n373\n00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,930\n>> Yeah, we call them laptops [LAUGH]\n>> We call those laptops.\n\n374\n00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,270\nSo, if a battery is present,\n\n375\n00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,580\nthat's how they specify that\nyou would get the option.\n\n376\n00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,260\n>> Right.\n\n377\n00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,970\n>> But, to get in there,\nby just clicking, selecting a printer,\n\n378\n00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,360\nand then we get these options up here,\nmanage default printers.\n\n379\n00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,050\nClicking on this guy,\nwe have this first option up here.\n\n380\n00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,560\nAlways use the same printer\nas my default printer.\n\n381\n00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,370\nThis right here essentially just\nturns off location aware printing.\n\n382\n00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,300\nIf we want that location aware,\nwe can select this one.\n\n383\n00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:33,830\nAll right?\n\n384\n00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,030\nAnd then we can select a network.\n\n385\n00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,540\nAll right?\n\n386\n00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,510\nHow about this public network?\n\n387\n00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,760\nAnd so whenever I'm on this public\nnetwork, what printer do I want to use?\n\n388\n00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,860\nHow about the fax machine?\n\n389\n00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,030\n>> Sure.\n\n390\n00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,920\n>> All right, we'll go in and\nselect that one and let's see.\n\n391\n00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,210\nWhat if I am on, let's see do I have the\nstudio, yep studio network right there.\n\n392\n00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,250\nThen yeah the Canon that one works.\n\n393\n00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:04,470\nAnd then let's, this mouse, alright.\n\n394\n00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,340\nThen how about this network here.\n\n395\n00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,460\nSo now whenever I am\nconnected to this network,\n\n396\n00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,900\nlet's choose that Epson\nprinter right there.\n\n397\n00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,190\n>> There you go.\n>> There we go.\n\n398\n00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,300\nNow, whenever this laptop then roams\nbetween these different networks,\n\n399\n00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,270\ndepending on whichever one, whenever\nI go to print something by default,\n\n400\n00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,580\nthen if I'm on studio, I get the Canon.\n\n401\n00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,610\nIf I'm at this other crazy one, the Epson.\n\n402\n00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,110\nIf I'm on the public,\nthen I get to use the fax.\n\n403\n00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,148\n>> Yeah, sounds good.\n\n404\n00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,875\n>> Sweet.\n\n405\n00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:38,431\nAll right.\n\n406\n00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:41,157\n>> You know there's one other item\nI wanted to point out in terms of\n\n407\n00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,550\nthe wireless network and\njust briefly here.\n\n408\n00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,970\nWhen they were showing us\nthe network adapter, right?\n\n409\n00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,380\nAnd getting it configured here there was\na little link down at the bottom I just\n\n410\n00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,000\nkind of remember.\n\n411\n00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,755\nIf we can pull that up Nate and\nwe'll see what i'm talking about here.\n\n412\n00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:01,980\n>> In here?\n>> Go to the Manage ones.\n\n413\n00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,837\nI think that's where we were.\n\n414\n00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,010\nGo to the network and Internet and\nthen the manage wireless.\n\n415\n00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,380\n>> Let's see.\n\n416\n00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,390\n>> And go ahead and\nright click on Image NH Private.\n\n417\n00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,220\nAnd go to the Properties.\n\n418\n00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,980\nAnd down there at the bottom.\n\n419\n00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,630\nYep, that's what we're looking for.\n\n420\n00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,990\nNotice that if Nate had actually\nset this up one time for\n\n421\n00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,910\nus, if we had multiple devices that we\nare trying to connect into this network,\n\n422\n00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,890\nwe could go ahead and copy this\nnetwork profile to a USB flash drive.\n\n423\n00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,140\nFrom there, we could essentially\nhand it to whomever we needed to and\n\n424\n00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,890\ninstead of them having to type\nin all the stuff that we needed,\n\n425\n00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,920\nthey can actually run\nit from there as well.\n\n426\n00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,570\nNow the good thing about this\nis if it can be done this way,\n\n427\n00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:48,960\nit can also probably be pushed out through\nother things such as group policy as well.\n\n428\n00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,250\n>> You know Ronnie,\nI just happen to have a USB drive.\n\n429\n00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:52,920\n>> Well there you go.\n\n430\n00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,170\n>> It connected to this laptop.\n\n431\n00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,970\n>> Nice.\n>> Should we click on it?\n\n432\n00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,940\n>> You can click on it.\n\n433\n00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,890\n>> Okay we'll click on this all right?\n\n434\n00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,490\nSo and what this is a copy of\nthe pro audio USB flash drive.\n\n435\n00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:09,070\nSo here we go, so we got our little USB\ndrive plugged in, we'll click on next.\n\n436\n00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,272\nSo now our network settings have\nbeen copied to the flash drive.\n\n437\n00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:17,080\nAll right so then the little instructions,\nyou know, Don likes to read all of these.\n\n438\n00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,990\nYou move it between different PCs and\nstuff.\n\n439\n00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,538\nSo lets go ahead and browse.\n\n440\n00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:26,370\nAnd knowledge check running.\n\n441\n00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,650\nYou see these little lock icon on there.\n\n442\n00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,350\nDo you know what that means?\n\n443\n00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,590\n>> It normally means that you have\nactually run Bitlocker To Go,\n\n444\n00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,520\nor you're messing around with something.\n\n445\n00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,400\nI don't know.\n\n446\n00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,640\n>> All right first answer is correct.\n\n447\n00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,232\nAll right so here we go and there is.\n\n448\n00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:48,450\nAll right so we got this set up SNK\ni'm not sure what SNK stands for\n\n449\n00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,950\nbut we'll run this set up dot SNK.\n\n450\n00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,410\nYou want to add this computer to\nthe wireless network NH private.\n\n451\n00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,800\nNow you know so\nif we'd taken this USB drive and\n\n452\n00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:06,170\nwe plugged it into Ronnie's laptop and\npull this guy up, select Yes.\n\n453\n00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,620\nThere we go.\nWe have successfully added this computer\n\n454\n00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,950\nto the Private wireless network.\n\n455\n00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,580\n>> So it makes it very handy\nin terms of doing that, right?\n\n456\n00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,080\nIf you have a lot of people coming into\nyour network that may just need to\n\n457\n00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,340\nbe connected.\n\n458\n00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,190\nBut you don't want to\nactually again go ahead and\n\n459\n00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,610\nyell out what the passphrase\nis all across the entire room.\n\n460\n00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,510\nYou can just hand them the key and say\njust run this, should get you connected,\n\n461\n00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,110\nand you're up and ready to go.\n\n462\n00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,430\n>> You know, Ronnie, so\nI'll tell a little story.\n\n463\n00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,015\n>> Tell us a little story.\n>> So on my Android phone there's an app,\n\n464\n00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:36,300\nand I forget what app it was.\n\n465\n00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,645\nBut whatever wireless network that\nyour phone is connected to you\n\n466\n00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:45,547\nwould run this app and it would make\na QR code out of your wireless network.\n\n467\n00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:46,217\n>> Nice.\n\n468\n00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:47,717\n>> And so we did that at the house.\n\n469\n00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:52,575\nSo at the house I've got, it's a long\nridiculous, it's a pass phrase for\n\n470\n00:23:52,575 --> 00:23:55,130\nthe password on the wireless network.\n\n471\n00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,710\nAnd so I used this app,\ncreated a QR code, and I printed it out.\n\n472\n00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,250\nAnd then I used a magnet and\nI stuck it on the fridge.\n\n473\n00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,891\nAnd so now, when friends, family,\nrelatives, anybody comes over and\n\n474\n00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:09,292\nthey need to get on the wireless network,\ninstead of having to go and\n\n475\n00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:13,232\nshake someone down or having to figure\nout how to use somebody's smart phone or\n\n476\n00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:17,411\nwhat have you, I say hey, just scan this\nQR code and it will automatically populate\n\n477\n00:24:17,411 --> 00:24:20,250\nwhatever you need to connect\nto this wireless network.\n\n478\n00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:20,920\n>> Sounds good.\n\n479\n00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,070\n>> It works pretty, pretty slick.\n\n480\n00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,366\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n481\n00:24:25,366 --> 00:24:26,807\n>> Yeah.\n\n482\n00:24:26,807 --> 00:24:28,250\n>> What?\n\n483\n00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,590\nYeah, I don't.\n\n484\n00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,105\nNo, they don't need the the same not.\n\n485\n00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:33,665\nYeah, just that QR code.\n\n486\n00:24:33,665 --> 00:24:35,145\nIt's magic.\n\n487\n00:24:35,145 --> 00:24:36,005\nJust magic how it works.\n\n488\n00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:36,574\n>> Sounds great.\n\n489\n00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:38,324\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n490\n00:24:38,324 --> 00:24:39,874\nAll right.\n\n491\n00:24:39,874 --> 00:24:44,310\nLet's see, we've got a few minutes left,\nbut let's go and do this.\n\n492\n00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:49,180\nLet's go ahead and take our break here,\nand when we get back, we've got some more\n\n493\n00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,700\nPS remoting stuff and some other,\nwe've got Windows Firewall coming up.\n\n494\n00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,580\n>> Yep.\n>> Some real great things.\n\n495\n00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,150\n>> Sounds good.\n\n496\n00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,747\n>> All right.\nWe'll do all that stuff after the break.\n\n497\n00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:05,747\n[SOUND].\n\n498\n00:25:05,747 --> 00:25:08,050\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n499\n00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,700\nSo, where we left off, we were talking\nabout those wireless networks and\n\n500\n00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,950\nconnection properties and how we can\nmanage those wireless networks and\n\n501\n00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,240\na little bit of that\ndefault printing stuff.\n\n502\n00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,630\nPretty sweet, you know, I really enjoy\nthat location where we are printing,\n\n503\n00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:26,226\nkind of a feature that you just kind\nof wonder where you were without it.\n\n504\n00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:29,100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n505\n00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,280\nup next we're gonna get\ninto Windows Firewall.\n\n506\n00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,750\nWindows Firewall, a built in firewall.\n\n507\n00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,730\nThat will allow traffic in and\nout of RPCs.\n\n508\n00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:41,570\nBasically that is just set up on rules,\nfor the most part.\n\n509\n00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,890\nSo to get into our Window firewall.\n\n510\n00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,040\nSo it's built in here with Windows.\n\n511\n00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,460\nWe're gonna go and click on our start and\nget into control panel.\n\n512\n00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,949\nAnd into control panel systems and\nsecurity.\n\n513\n00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,680\nAnd Windows Firewall.\n\n514\n00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,080\nNow let's say that we a particular\nprogram that we either want to allow\n\n515\n00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,750\nthrough the firewall.\n\n516\n00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,120\nOr that we want to block\nthrough the firewall.\n\n517\n00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,440\nNow some programs,\n\n518\n00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,610\nI suppose we may want to block if\nwe don't want them calling home.\n\n519\n00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,480\nThere's some shareware applications,\n\n520\n00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,770\nthere's some freeware applications\nthat maybe I don't want connecting.\n\n521\n00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:27,040\nYou're calling home for who knows what\nreason why they do, but you may want to.\n\n522\n00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,780\nBlock a particular program, and some\nprograms or Windows features you may want\n\n523\n00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:36,530\nto allow through the Windows firewall,\nfor example, remote desktop.\n\n524\n00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,120\nWe definitely want remote desktop to be\nable to get out through the firewall.\n\n525\n00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,360\nSo to do that,\nwe'll start up here on the left hand side.\n\n526\n00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,940\nAllow a program or\nfeature through the firewall.\n\n527\n00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,450\nPretty straight forward.\n\n528\n00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,432\nAnd you get in here, of course we have\nto click on our change setting button.\n\n529\n00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:57,100\nAll right so\nnow we have a list of options.\n\n530\n00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,870\nDifferent programs and apps.\n\n531\n00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,142\nSo we have running on our machines here.\n\n532\n00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:07,080\nAll right, let's see remote desktops\nare down here, so remote desktop, right?\n\n533\n00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,290\nIt's checked off, we're letting it\nthrough, and so we are allowing it on\n\n534\n00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:16,400\nthe home and work network and\nnot allowing it on a private network.\n\n535\n00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,090\nAll right, so we do have different network\nconnectivity or network locations.\n\n536\n00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,050\nThere's three of them.\n\n537\n00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,610\nAnd Ronnie do you remember\nwhat those three are?\n\n538\n00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:31,990\nWe've got private, and we have our work,\nand then we've got our private ones.\n\n539\n00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,030\nOr public.\n\n540\n00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,890\n>> Public.\n>> Did I say private twice?\n\n541\n00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,070\nYeah.\n[LAUGH] Private work and public.\n\n542\n00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:42,060\n>> Now, this is a little bit strange for\nus because we've been moving on to Windows\n\n543\n00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,300\n8, and you might see the term\ndomain instead of private.\n\n544\n00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,780\nA lot of times,\nyou do see that in new operating systems,\n\n545\n00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,140\nthat's why we're getting\na little bit of differences here.\n\n546\n00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,780\nWork, again,\nwhen we take a look at these profiles\n\n547\n00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,480\na little bit less restrictive because\nwe have less security devices.\n\n548\n00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,150\nHome semi restrictive but\nagain still open and\n\n549\n00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,440\nthen the actual public one is the one\nwhere we don't want any body else\n\n550\n00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,670\nknowing that we're even connect network\nbut we still need our connectivity.\n\n551\n00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:12,450\nSo these profiles are on by\ndefault in Windows seven.\n\n552\n00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,170\nSo in earlier operating system\nright you actually had to choose.\n\n553\n00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,880\nIf you went from one\nnetwork to another one,\n\n554\n00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,550\nthey required you to actually\npick which one you turned on.\n\n555\n00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,560\nNow all three of them are on, so\nyou don't have to worry about it,\n\n556\n00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,520\ndepending on where you connect.\n\n557\n00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,060\n>> All right, let's say the program or\n\n558\n00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,450\nthe app that we're wanting to\nallow through isn't in this list.\n\n559\n00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,140\nWell, down below here,\n\n560\n00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,430\nlet me scroll down just a little bit,\nallow another program though the firewall.\n\n561\n00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:41,620\nWe click on this, and\nnow we get some more applications in here.\n\n562\n00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,550\nLet's see, how about this OpenVPN?\n\n563\n00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,730\nLet's go ahead and add OpenVPN.\n\n564\n00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,025\nAnd we will allow this guy on,\nyou know what VPN.\n\n565\n00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:55,005\nAnd I would use the VPN\nthe most on public networks.\n\n566\n00:28:55,005 --> 00:28:57,755\nThat way I can create\nthat secure connection\n\n567\n00:28:57,755 --> 00:29:02,860\nback to home to do my browsing or whatever\nclicky things that I'm looking to do.\n\n568\n00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,760\nSo we'll allow it for\nboth private and public networks.\n\n569\n00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,850\nAll right?\n\n570\n00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,990\nSo we'll go and click OK on that one.\n\n571\n00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,663\nAll right?\n\n572\n00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:18,010\nNow, with this firewall,\nit's a good thing to have it on, right?\n\n573\n00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,390\nBut if for some reason we\nare wanting to turn our firewall off\n\n574\n00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,970\nover on the left hand side.\n\n575\n00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,720\nTurn the firewall on or off.\n\n576\n00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:32,370\nAnd on here we can turn off for our home\nor work or our private network locations.\n\n577\n00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,810\nWe can it here or we can turn it\noff on the public settings and\n\n578\n00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,970\nclicking on this now of course\naction center down below.\n\n579\n00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:43,370\nIf I click on that action\ncenter is going to pop up.\n\n580\n00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,790\nSo very, very important, it says.\n\n581\n00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,380\nMake sure you have those\nfirewalls turned on.\n\n582\n00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,160\n>> Now by default,\nin Windows 7 that we have seen,\n\n583\n00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,800\nyou hear about being\n>> Control panel view of the firewall.\n\n584\n00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,970\nIt gives us the simple\nconnectivity that we need, or\n\n585\n00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,660\nthe simple protections that we need,\nright?\n\n586\n00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,800\nWe can allow a program through, we can\nturn it on and off and even then allow\n\n587\n00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,415\na program through, they've already pre\ndefined a lot of them, but remember if\n\n588\n00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:16,965\nyour particular program that you want\nto allow through is not showing up.\n\n589\n00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:18,535\nYou always have that option to go in and\n\n590\n00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:22,510\nbrowse and find the application\nthat you want to allow through.\n\n591\n00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,870\nMost of the time, for most users,\nthat's probably more than enough.\n\n592\n00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,930\nWe really don't have to get a lot deeper\nthan that the majority of the time.\n\n593\n00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:34,480\nBut what if you actually need\nmore control, and more ability,\n\n594\n00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,190\nmore granularity to be\nable to do a lot more.\n\n595\n00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,060\nWell Windows Firewall has advanced again,\nand\n\n596\n00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,810\nthey even have what they call\nWindows Firewall with advanced security.\n\n597\n00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,400\n>> All right Nate.\n\n598\n00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,520\n>> Show us what we're doing.\n\n599\n00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,300\n>> All right so let's go into this.\n\n600\n00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,590\nLet's go and create a rule.\n\n601\n00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:54,980\nWe'll create some rules on our\nfirewall and as for a quick scenario,\n\n602\n00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,100\ngoodness, if I had other stuff\ninstalled on this machine.\n\n603\n00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,320\nWell dig into the advanced settings,\nover on the left hand side.\n\n604\n00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,540\nAdvanced settings, you see it\nopens up another window here, so\n\n605\n00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:11,840\nwe've got Windows firewall, then we have\nWindows firewall with advanced security.\n\n606\n00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:13,840\nSo click on this guy.\n\n607\n00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,690\nIt does, so\nkind of have a busy window here.\n\n608\n00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,480\nLooks like there's quite a bit going on.\n\n609\n00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:27,790\nIf we had a particular firewall policy or\nsome kind of preset list of rules,\n\n610\n00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,640\nwe can import those policies under\nthe actions pane, import that stuff in.\n\n611\n00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,690\nIf we wanted to create some on our own,\nwell,\n\n612\n00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,440\nwe have to think what type of\nrules we're wanting to create.\n\n613\n00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,050\nWe have inbound rules and outbound rules.\n\n614\n00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:49,103\nSo, inbound rules will allow or deny\ntraffic that's coming into our computers,\n\n615\n00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:54,629\nwhether it's on our network or\nthat it's from the Internet or whichever,\n\n616\n00:31:54,629 --> 00:32:00,090\njust inbound rules, or programs that\nare originating from the outside.\n\n617\n00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:06,285\nAnd then we have outbound rules and\nthese rules here will restrict programs\n\n618\n00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:13,270\nthat are originating from our PCs,\nthat are leaving our PC and going out.\n\n619\n00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,480\nSo Ronnie what would you say?\n\n620\n00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,590\nIf we're wanting to block\na particular type of traffic.\n\n621\n00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,710\nWould you block it as it leaves the PC or\n\n622\n00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:27,350\njust block it as it\ncomes back in to our PC?\n\n623\n00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,500\n>> It just depends on what\nyour need is at the moment.\n\n624\n00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,190\nRight?\n\n625\n00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,070\nIf you want to ensure there's\nan application on your computer\n\n626\n00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,390\nthat doesn't actually communicate,\nlet's say, with somebody else.\n\n627\n00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,800\nWe're gonna actually block\nthe outbound connection.\n\n628\n00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,540\nBut if we want to prevent\nagainst something from getting\n\n629\n00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,690\naccess to our computers, we may want to\nactually block on the inbound connection.\n\n630\n00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,180\nThe idea of actually leaving\nthese things up and on, and\n\n631\n00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,320\nhaving a lot of these rules, notice\nthat they're pretty much predefined for\n\n632\n00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,950\nus, really does help to protect our\nparticular computers on the inbound side.\n\n633\n00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,900\nIf something has already gotten past,\n\n634\n00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,059\nlet's say the perimeter firewall\nthat you have in your network.\n\n635\n00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,340\nOn the individual Windows 7 machines here.\n\n636\n00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,550\nRight?\nWe have the Windows firewall, and\n\n637\n00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,502\nthe idea of advanced security here.\n\n638\n00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:11,460\nTo again look through all those lists\nto be able to filter out traffic\n\n639\n00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,030\nthat has gotten past your firewall.\n\n640\n00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,580\nNormally it doesn't get past it.\n\n641\n00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,870\nLet's say that someone has brought\nin a laptop that's a foreign laptop,\n\n642\n00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,100\ninside of your network here and\nthey've plugged right in.\n\n643\n00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,630\nThey could infect the entire network,\nbut your firewall helps you out here.\n\n644\n00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,005\nIt just depends on what you\nreally need at that moment.\n\n645\n00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:28,510\nYeah.\n\n646\n00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:33,220\n>> Now, as far as the applications go and\ncommunicating out, as an application\n\n647\n00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:38,340\nreaches from your PC and it's allowed\noutbound and it goes out to the Internet.\n\n648\n00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,210\nBy default, it's automatically\nallowed a return trip back in.\n\n649\n00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:46,070\nSo we think something along,\nlet's say, some kind of malware.\n\n650\n00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,530\nSo you got some kind\nof malware on your PC.\n\n651\n00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,787\nWell, if it can reach out of the Internet,\nwell it's gonna be allowed right back in,\n\n652\n00:33:53,787 --> 00:33:55,158\nby default.\n\n653\n00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:55,770\n>> Yeah.\n\n654\n00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,770\n>> All right.\n\n655\n00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,700\n>> So what Nate was mentioning and you\nmight see this term a little bit later,\n\n656\n00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,075\nand maybe even possibly on the exam,\nwhat they call a stateful firewall.\n\n657\n00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:03,970\nOkay?\n\n658\n00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,990\nSo if traffic that goes outbound and as\nreturning traffic is allowed to come back\n\n659\n00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,260\nin, that's what we're\nnormally talking about.\n\n660\n00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,690\nSo when Windows 7 here,\nin terms of the Windows firewall\n\n661\n00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,330\nwith advanced security is\na stateful connection.\n\n662\n00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:21,010\n>> All right, let's go ahead and\ncreate these rules.\n\n663\n00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,128\n>> Sounds great.\n\n664\n00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:23,284\n>> All right.\nSo, we'll go ahead and\n\n665\n00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:24,563\nhighlight our inbound rules.\n\n666\n00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,660\n>> All right.\n>> This will be for\n\n667\n00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,420\nconnections originating\nfrom outside our PC.\n\n668\n00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,070\nAll right, so, we'll right-click,\nwe will choose a new rule.\n\n669\n00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,650\nAnd so\nnow we got a couple of different options.\n\n670\n00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,590\nRight?\nWe can create a rule based on a program,\n\n671\n00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:43,060\nbased on a port number,\nor on a predefined rule.\n\n672\n00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,030\nPredefined rule we have some good\nold branch cache stuff in here.\n\n673\n00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:51,740\nThings for home group and\nremote assistance, we've got SNMP Trap.\n\n674\n00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,310\nRight?\nSimple Network Management Protocol, and\n\n675\n00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,410\nWindows Media Player.\n\n676\n00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:56,920\nYou know what?\n\n677\n00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,710\nShould we do Media Player?\n\n678\n00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,280\n>> Sure, let's do Media Player.\n\n679\n00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,930\n>> All right.\n\n680\n00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,390\nSo we'll go and click on Media Player.\n\n681\n00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,776\nWe'll click on Next.\n\n682\n00:35:03,776 --> 00:35:08,345\nAll right, so,we got which of\nthese types of predefined rules.\n\n683\n00:35:08,345 --> 00:35:10,630\nRight.\nAre we wanting to create?\n\n684\n00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,220\nAnd let's see,\n\n685\n00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,530\nwithout reading all of the description,\nlet's just create both of them.\n\n686\n00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,900\nClick on Next.\n\n687\n00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,310\nNow what do we want to\ndo with this connection?\n\n688\n00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,960\nDo we want to allow the connection?\n\n689\n00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,680\nDo we want to block this connection?\n\n690\n00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,065\nOr allow it if is secure?\n\n691\n00:35:28,065 --> 00:35:30,940\nNow this right here kinda\ngets a little bit more\n\n692\n00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,040\nin depth of what we were\noriginally wanting to get after.\n\n693\n00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,525\nBut these are our rules for\nto secure this traffic.\n\n694\n00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:42,470\nRight?\nLike you're using IP Sec or something.\n\n695\n00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,130\nTakes a bit more work on, not work, but\n\n696\n00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,790\na bit more configuring\naction on the back end.\n\n697\n00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,630\nBut that's what those rules are for.\n\n698\n00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,810\nWe will allow it.\n\n699\n00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,630\nRight?\nMedia Player,\n\n700\n00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,300\nmaybe it needs to stream something.\n\n701\n00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,110\nSo, we'll click on Create.\n\n702\n00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,432\nAnd there we go, the top of our list.\n\n703\n00:36:00,432 --> 00:36:01,370\nAll right.\n\n704\n00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:04,990\nWe got our firewall,\nfirewall rules are predefined ones.\n\n705\n00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:10,313\nBut real quick, let's go back into\na new rule, and let's do a custom rule.\n\n706\n00:36:11,688 --> 00:36:15,890\nAll right, so from custom,\nwe can choose what type of program.\n\n707\n00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:21,400\nThis thing is gonna be using form or\na type a service.\n\n708\n00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,400\nPutting it on custom, we can choose\nof our different services and\n\n709\n00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,720\nthose sorts of things there.\n\n710\n00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,040\nBut we'll go ahead and\nsay all right, all programs.\n\n711\n00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,370\nClick on Next.\n\n712\n00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:37,635\nNow we've got different protocol types.\n\n713\n00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:38,285\nYeah, goodness.\n\n714\n00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:41,375\nI'm trying to think of a scenario\nthat we can run with for\n\n715\n00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:43,345\nthis example off the top of my head.\n\n716\n00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:44,005\nWe'll just choose.\n\n717\n00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:45,865\n>> Just do a ping.\n\n718\n00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:47,515\n>> All right, ICMP before.\n\n719\n00:36:47,515 --> 00:36:48,125\nRight?\n\n720\n00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,290\nPing packets.\n\n721\n00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,440\nAll right, so this would be a rule for\nour ping packets.\n\n722\n00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,520\nAll right, and we click on Next.\n\n723\n00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,160\nNow which local IP addresses\ndo these apply for?\n\n724\n00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,170\nWe'll just leave it for\nthe defaults for this scenario here.\n\n725\n00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,020\nJust any IPs.\n\n726\n00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,180\nWhat's it going to?\n\n727\n00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,090\nAny IP addresses.\n\n728\n00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,530\nAnd then allow it or block it.\n\n729\n00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,313\nLet's allow it because I\nthink pings are a good thing.\n\n730\n00:37:14,878 --> 00:37:15,820\nAll right.\n\n731\n00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,090\nNow here we go are those network types.\n\n732\n00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,130\nNow on, so what we were discussing\nbefore is our three types.\n\n733\n00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:26,240\nWe have our Private,\nour Work, and our Public.\n\n734\n00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,090\nNow Work, in this case is now\nthe domain network profile.\n\n735\n00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,640\nAnd of these three types we\ncan control which one that\n\n736\n00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,110\nwe are allowing this rule to apply to.\n\n737\n00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:40,540\nSo if were gonna apply it to the domain,\nwe've got that one checked.\n\n738\n00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:47,070\nIf just the private,\nwe clear these other guys and so forth.\n\n739\n00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:51,020\nSo well go ahead and click on those,\nit was allowed for all of them.\n\n740\n00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,790\nWe'll give this a name.\n\n741\n00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:59,768\nWe'll say, allow ping's on all networks.\n\n742\n00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:02,234\nClick on Finish.\n\n743\n00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:05,300\nAnd there we go.\n\n744\n00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,670\nThere is our rule.\n\n745\n00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,560\nNow if we're wanting to let's\nsay block ping packets.\n\n746\n00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,280\nThen that would be an outbound rule.\n\n747\n00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,745\nI'm sorry,\nno that would be an inbound rule.\n\n748\n00:38:14,745 --> 00:38:15,480\nAll right.\n\n749\n00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,590\nSo if we're wanting to block pings\nleaving our PC you got to go through\n\n750\n00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:25,980\nthe same steps but we'd create that\nsame rule under the outbound rules.\n\n751\n00:38:27,855 --> 00:38:29,433\nAll right.\n\n752\n00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:36,030\nNow along with, so there is our advanced\nsecurity and creating these rules and\n\n753\n00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:41,330\nkind of controlling what leaves and\ngets into our PC.\n\n754\n00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:46,340\nOver here on the left hand side we\ndo have some of these other ones.\n\n755\n00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,975\nAnd one of these is this\nchange notification settings.\n\n756\n00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:53,400\n>> Yeah, in the change notification\nsettings, Nate if you'll go ahead and\n\n757\n00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,230\nclick on that,\nthere is a lot of information for us here.\n\n758\n00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,180\nNotice it says you can modify the actual\nfirewall settings for each type and\n\n759\n00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,600\nnetwork location you use.\n\n760\n00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,630\nAnd notice what it actually gives us here.\n\n761\n00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,230\nOkay?\n\n762\n00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,174\nWhich is what's marked here,\n\n763\n00:39:06,174 --> 00:39:10,730\nwhich it says notify me when\nWindows Firewall blocks a new program.\n\n764\n00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,410\nOkay.\n\n765\n00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,030\nSo, this actually alerts us.\n\n766\n00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,950\nWhen we do have where the firewall is\ntriggered by something that's coming in,\n\n767\n00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:22,200\nand we can actually do it per\nprofile location that we have.\n\n768\n00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,195\nIf you want those or if you don't,\nall you do is simply turn them off, or\n\n769\n00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:26,775\nyou can actually turn them on.\n\n770\n00:39:26,775 --> 00:39:28,875\nAnd so, why are my objectives to do this?\n\n771\n00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:33,255\nWell, remember that it could be that you\ndon't really care about the end user\n\n772\n00:39:33,255 --> 00:39:37,205\nreally seeing the idea that\nthe firewall is actually working, or\n\n773\n00:39:37,205 --> 00:39:39,835\nactually getting notified and\ngetting scared every time.\n\n774\n00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:44,870\nYou again, can of course turn this off for\nthat individual profile if you want to.\n\n775\n00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,484\nSo, in this sense here.\n\n776\n00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,104\nRight?\nThe ability for us to be able to do that,\n\n777\n00:39:49,104 --> 00:39:53,248\nto be able to change the actual\nnotification settings, very handy here.\n\n778\n00:39:53,248 --> 00:39:54,410\nOkay?\nIn terms of what we want\n\n779\n00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:58,288\nto actually allow, in terms of a lot of\ninformation coming across the screen.\n\n780\n00:39:58,288 --> 00:39:59,458\nYeah.\n\n781\n00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:00,048\n>> All right.\n\n782\n00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:02,734\nSo our last little bit\nthat we're gonna touch on\n\n783\n00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:07,050\nwith our Windows Firewall rules is\nconfigure authentication exceptions.\n\n784\n00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,000\n>> Yup.\n\n785\n00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,296\nNow if we go back in to the Windows\nfirewall with the advanced settings there.\n\n786\n00:40:12,296 --> 00:40:15,900\nYup, the advanced security.\n\n787\n00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,130\nNow, not only can of course we enable\nthe filters by doing inbound rules and\n\n788\n00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:24,380\noutbound rules but if you click on that\nconnection security rules there, okay?\n\n789\n00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,620\nWell remember that we want to actually\nprovide a secured connection between\n\n790\n00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,720\nend points here.\n\n791\n00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,270\nWe have the ability to do this and\n\n792\n00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,380\nnormally we're actually creating an IP\nset tunnel when we do this here.\n\n793\n00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,160\nIf Nate right clicks on it and\nselects new rule, okay.\n\n794\n00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,440\nNotice that we can actually select\nsome of the different types\n\n795\n00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,110\nof rule types that you actually\nsee right here as well.\n\n796\n00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:50,830\nOn the idea of the rule types\nthat you see right there,\n\n797\n00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,220\nyou have the idea of isolation.\n\n798\n00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,960\nRestricts connections based on\nauthentication criteria, okay.\n\n799\n00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,960\nSo once again if they authenticate,\nif they don't, we again can isolate that.\n\n800\n00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,540\nThe one that they specifically\ncall out is right here.\n\n801\n00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,300\nWhat is gonna be an exemption, okay.\n\n802\n00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,290\nSo authentication exemption.\n\n803\n00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:13,739\nSo it may be that we're not really\nwondering about the idea of authenticated\n\n804\n00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:15,540\nusers connecting in.\n\n805\n00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,680\nWe wanna create the idea of an exemption.\n\n806\n00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,250\nMaybe don't have the authentication that\nwe need or anything that they can support.\n\n807\n00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,970\nSo here they give us this.\n\n808\n00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:29,140\nDo not authenticate these connections\nfrom a specified computer.\n\n809\n00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,950\nServer to server authenticate\nconnections between specified ones.\n\n810\n00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:37,320\nOkay, and then of course authenticate\nconnection between gateway computers, and\n\n811\n00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,600\nof course you can create a custom, okay.\n\n812\n00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,950\nNow if you're just connecting in and you\nwanna ensure the idea of authentication,\n\n813\n00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,760\nin other words that's\ngonna be your requirement.\n\n814\n00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,990\nYou of course are gonna choose this\nfirst one in terms of isolation.\n\n815\n00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,620\nBut if they're asking you\nto make an exclusion or\n\n816\n00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:56,170\nan exemption, you want this one on\nthe authentication exemption here.\n\n817\n00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:59,660\nAnd from there you can click next and\nnotice what it asks us here.\n\n818\n00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:04,410\nWhich remote computers are exempt\nfrom authentication requirements?\n\n819\n00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:08,340\nOkay, so at this point if I click on\nthe add button you can actually go in and\n\n820\n00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:13,070\nput in a specific subnet if you\nwant to an entire subnet here.\n\n821\n00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,690\nSo the way that they actually show\nit is they show you actually in\n\n822\n00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:16,700\nthe slash notation.\n\n823\n00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,060\nSo Nate's typing in one,\nand then do a slash 24,\n\n824\n00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:28,440\nand notice you can put in IP version 4 and\nIP version 6, okay.\n\n825\n00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,840\nNow you don't wanna do the entire network,\nright.\n\n826\n00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,690\nNotice they give you the ability\nto just set an IP range.\n\n827\n00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:38,310\nSo, select that second option and so you\njust type the beginning address that you\n\n828\n00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:41,866\nwant to exclude, and then the ending\naddresses you want to exclude as well.\n\n829\n00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:47,187\n[NOISE] So,\nthose are all possibilities there and\n\n830\n00:42:47,187 --> 00:42:52,783\nthen that third option for\nus is, predefined set.\n\n831\n00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:55,550\nGonna click on that drop down list and\nyou'll see, okay.\n\n832\n00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:00,160\nNow if you'll notice, these predefined\nset of computers here are really\n\n833\n00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,550\nall about computers that are normally\nfound inside of a domain network, okay.\n\n834\n00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:09,840\nRight, notice WINS DHCP DNS,\nthe local subnet that we have.\n\n835\n00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:14,480\nSo, again, they are really set up to\nactually exclude the idea of servers from,\n\n836\n00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,560\nagain, being blocked by\nour firewall as well.\n\n837\n00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,870\nSo it just depends on\nyour particular need.\n\n838\n00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:23,340\nWe can leave the default or something.\n\n839\n00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,570\nYou don't have to do that\non your computer there.\n\n840\n00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:30,210\nAnd then once you actually do that.\n\n841\n00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,630\n>> I clicked on cancel do you\nwant me to go back in that?\n\n842\n00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,290\nI'll just add the gateway.\n\n843\n00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:34,880\n>> Yeah.\n\n844\n00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,130\nSo go on and click next and from there\nonce again the same way we applied some of\n\n845\n00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:43,890\nthose inbound rules you do the same\nthing here which particular profile.\n\n846\n00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:48,400\nSo if this is a laptop Mike and\ni move from network to another one.\n\n847\n00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,950\nI'm at Starbucks one day.\n\n848\n00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:50,990\nThat public would apply.\n\n849\n00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:53,790\nDo I want that rule to apply here,\nprobably not.\n\n850\n00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,060\nIf i'm on private or domain using it\nwe're gonna be on the domain to do this\n\n851\n00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,470\nwe might want this rule\nto apply at that point.\n\n852\n00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,255\nSo to give us those exemptions\nare pretty much key,\n\n853\n00:44:03,255 --> 00:44:05,735\nespecially in terms of\nservers a lot of times, okay.\n\n854\n00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:11,615\nSo there's the authenticated exemptions\nnetwork specifically called out on.\n\n855\n00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:12,785\nAnd of course you would provide a name.\n\n856\n00:44:13,805 --> 00:44:17,070\nNow notice that, [LAUGH] yeah,\nthat this particular name here right,\n\n857\n00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,580\nrelatively long because they\nwant you to be descriptive,\n\n858\n00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,470\nand they even give you\na description field as well.\n\n859\n00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:25,550\nNow even though these fields are optional,\nit may help later on in terms of\n\n860\n00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:29,483\ntrouble shooting especially if you\ngive it a name like firewall rule 12.\n\n861\n00:44:29,483 --> 00:44:33,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know so, that's it, yeah.\n\n862\n00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:36,030\n>> This keeps popping under.\n\n863\n00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:36,800\nSo there we go.\n\n864\n00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,340\n>> Yep.\n\n865\n00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,310\nThere it is.\n\n866\n00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,088\n>> There's our authenticated exemption.\n\n867\n00:44:40,088 --> 00:44:44,690\nSo these PC's are running,\nif my name was descriptive enough.\n\n868\n00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,140\nSo these are going to\nbe trusted computers,\n\n869\n00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,090\ncomputers that you will\naccept connections from.\n\n870\n00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,680\nThat would be exempt\nfrom these other rules.\n\n871\n00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,390\n>> Right.\n\n872\n00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,400\n>> Sweet.\n>> There you go.\n\n873\n00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,780\n>> All right, so Ronnie,\nwe do have a little bit of time left but\n\n874\n00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,350\nwe are switching gears a little bit,\n>> Right.\n\n875\n00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:01,980\n>> Getting into remote management.\n\n876\n00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,950\nShould we take our break now or\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n877\n00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:04,624\n>> Let's go ahead and\n\n878\n00:45:04,624 --> 00:45:06,420\ndo that and get ready for\nthe next segment.\n\n879\n00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,480\n>> Okay, sweet.\n\n880\n00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,193\nAll right, so\nwe've got some remote management stuff and\n\n881\n00:45:11,193 --> 00:45:14,616\nwe'll save that and\nwe'll get to it after the break.\n\n882\n00:45:14,616 --> 00:45:22,075\n[MUSIC]\n\n883\n00:45:22,075 --> 00:45:24,210\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n884\n00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,300\nSo where we left off,\nwe were talking about Windows firewall and\n\n885\n00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,020\nall that really neat stuff, and\n\n886\n00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:33,690\nthe last little bit that we have to\nget in to is remote administration.\n\n887\n00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,910\nTo be able to manage our PCs remotely.\n\n888\n00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,550\n>> Yeah, there's really a couple\nof different technologies for\n\n889\n00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,790\nus here that we've covered again,\nbut let's go ahead and\n\n890\n00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,410\njust review some of these technologies for\nus, right?\n\n891\n00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,520\nSo, one of the technologies that we have,\nof course,\n\n892\n00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,630\nis the idea of using what we call\nthe remote desktop connection.\n\n893\n00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:54,840\nThat allows us to be on\nanother computer and\n\n894\n00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,840\nconnect in to our Windows 7 machine,\nessentially sitting at that machine as if\n\n895\n00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,990\nwe're actually right there even\nthough we may be some place else.\n\n896\n00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:05,840\nBut theres another option for us as well\nwhich is the idea of remote assistance.\n\n897\n00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:11,520\nRemote assistance allows us again to\nactually be able to instead connect\n\n898\n00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,120\nin and then share the connection\nwith the actual end user itself.\n\n899\n00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,520\nNow normally if there's any tool that\nmost network administrators use,\n\n900\n00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,350\nit's probably gonna be\nthe idea of remote desktop.\n\n901\n00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:25,180\nSo let's go ahead and review that\nparticular technology right now.\n\n902\n00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,510\nSo over on my machine\nhere I've gone ahead and\n\n903\n00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,000\nI've set up the actual connection here for\nus.\n\n904\n00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,570\nNow I have got this bigger machine,\nwhich is actually another machine for\n\n905\n00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:38,560\nus instead that we can connect into.\n\n906\n00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,838\nBut here I am gonna go over\ninto my Windows Seven machine.\n\n907\n00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:45,050\nAnd then to set up the ID of\nthe remote desktop connection\n\n908\n00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:49,740\nI'm gonna click on Start right-click\non Computer and go to Properties.\n\n909\n00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,760\nAnd then,\non the left-hand side of my system window,\n\n910\n00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,950\nI'm gonna select the remote settings.\n\n911\n00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:04,000\nAnd notice it says allow computers\nrunning any version of remote desktop So\n\n912\n00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,700\nyou might actually choose to do this,\nagain,\n\n913\n00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,370\nif you actually don't know what\nthe computer might be running for us.\n\n914\n00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:12,640\nSo I'm gonna leave it at the default\nhere that somebody has already selected.\n\n915\n00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,384\nSo usually, it actually is don't\nallow people to connect in, but\n\n916\n00:47:15,384 --> 00:47:16,370\nI'm gonna allow this.\n\n917\n00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:21,000\nIf we had a more secured connection we\ncould actually allow it from connection\n\n918\n00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,820\nonly running remote desktop with\nnetwork level admin authentication.\n\n919\n00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,460\nAll right,\nnow these computers that I actually have,\n\n920\n00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,830\nthey're both joined to\nthe same network here.\n\n921\n00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:41,350\nIf I go back to my domain controller or\nmy DC I can run the remote desktop, okay?\n\n922\n00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,230\nSo I click on start, and accessories, and\n\n923\n00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:51,080\ninside of there notice I have the remote\ndesktop connection, from here.\n\n924\n00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:56,419\nAnd then all I need to do is type in\nthe name of my particular machine,\n\n925\n00:47:56,419 --> 00:47:59,616\nand now I need to type in my credentials.\n\n926\n00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,101\nOnce I do that, I can click OK,\nand in a moment,\n\n927\n00:48:05,101 --> 00:48:08,880\nit is actually gonna secure our\nremote desktop connection, okay.\n\n928\n00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,208\nSo it is now establishing a secure\nconnection for us and then,\n\n929\n00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:16,304\nregardless of where this machine\nactually is, if I'm on the fourth floor,\n\n930\n00:48:16,304 --> 00:48:20,510\nif this machine's on another floor,\nI should be able to connect to it.\n\n931\n00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,956\nAnd the first time it does it,\nit does take a little bit of time.\n\n932\n00:48:24,836 --> 00:48:27,734\nSo when we do this,\nespecially to a Windows 7 machine,\n\n933\n00:48:27,734 --> 00:48:31,720\nonly one person's gonna be able\nto be connected at any one time.\n\n934\n00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,700\nA user that's currently logged on to that\nmachine will be asked to disconnect or\n\n935\n00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,610\nthey'll actually be kicked off.\n\n936\n00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:43,020\nNotice now, on this machine I am actually\nusing Windows 7 Enterprise here.\n\n937\n00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,060\nSo I'm connected in and\nI can sit there and\n\n938\n00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,430\nactually work with this\nmachine as it were my own.\n\n939\n00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:54,990\nAnd so usually that's the tool\nthat we actually do use.\n\n940\n00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:57,030\nNow, the other tool that's\nactually available, but\n\n941\n00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,450\nit actually takes up a bit more.\n\n942\n00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:01,090\nAnd we're just gonna show this because\na lot of people don't end up using\n\n943\n00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,250\nthis too often.\n\n944\n00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:07,823\nIs the idea of allowing remote assistance\nconnection to this computer, right here.\n\n945\n00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:09,870\nAnd then, if I click on this Advanced,\n\n946\n00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:13,779\nit asked me if I will allow the actual\ncomputer to be controlled remotely and\n\n947\n00:49:13,779 --> 00:49:17,640\nhow long the invitation that we actually\ncould create here can use this.\n\n948\n00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,520\nBut for us when it does that,\nthat invitation sits there for\n\n949\n00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,310\nthe next six hours, if nobody makes that\nconnection back in, to ask to be able to\n\n950\n00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:30,020\nshare my desktop, then that invitation\nexpires and we don't allow that to happen.\n\n951\n00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:34,650\nBut usually, those are two of the actual\nfeatures that we have available\n\n952\n00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:38,410\nin terms of managing Windows\n7 from a remote aspect.\n\n953\n00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,095\nNow, the other thing that we\nalso have available to us,\n\n954\n00:49:44,095 --> 00:49:48,930\nis something else that really\nwe can use on Windows 7 here.\n\n955\n00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:53,638\nWhich is the idea of the Remote Server\nAdministration Tools for Windows 7 here.\n\n956\n00:49:53,638 --> 00:49:56,200\nNow, we're running Windows\n7 with Service Pack 1.\n\n957\n00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,100\nNow, this particular kit right here,\n\n958\n00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,850\nis not about really\nmanaging Windows 7 Itself.\n\n959\n00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:04,630\nIt's about us connecting\ninto while others servers.\n\n960\n00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:08,040\nSo other computers that are running in\nour network usually, they don't really\n\n961\n00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,000\nrecommend of course, that you\nactually go and log into the servers.\n\n962\n00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,560\nBut they give you this toolkit here\nthat you can download for free, and\n\n963\n00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,180\nyou can now connect in across your domain\nto be able to connect to certain servers,\n\n964\n00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,170\nand be able to manage it remotely.\n\n965\n00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:25,220\nSo the less people, the less actual\nphysical connections that you and\n\n966\n00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:30,270\nI actually go on, and get on those servers\nlike our domain controller and our DHCP\n\n967\n00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:35,740\nservers and DNS servers and anything else,\nthe less mis-configurations that go on.\n\n968\n00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:39,370\nWe can instead install this on\nNate's computer at his workstation.\n\n969\n00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,147\nAnd then he can pretty much manage\nthe entire network from there.\n\n970\n00:50:42,147 --> 00:50:43,354\nOkay?\n\n971\n00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:44,924\nYep.\n\n972\n00:50:44,924 --> 00:50:45,800\n>> Yep.\n\n973\n00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,960\nSo yeah,\nwith those remote administration tools.\n\n974\n00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,950\nFor those guys to appear.\n\n975\n00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:58,623\nSo after they are installed\non a Windows 7 machine,\n\n976\n00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:01,942\nyou will have to go and turn them on.\n\n977\n00:51:01,942 --> 00:51:06,544\nSo then to do that,\nit would be in the Windows,\n\n978\n00:51:06,544 --> 00:51:09,960\nthe settings and the features.\n\n979\n00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,100\n>> Let me show you what\nhe's talking about here.\n\n980\n00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,270\n>> Let's see.\n\n981\n00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:21,120\nWhat we'll do is, we'll go into our Start,\nand in our Control Panel,\n\n982\n00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:26,810\nand in Control Panel we'll go into\nPrograms, and then in Programs and\n\n983\n00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:32,470\nFeatures, and then we will choose\nto turn Windows features on or off.\n\n984\n00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,994\nAnd then once this box populates,\nwe'll see those options in there.\n\n985\n00:51:39,994 --> 00:51:44,522\nAnd they will be down here into\nthe Remote Server Administration tools.\n\n986\n00:51:44,522 --> 00:51:49,742\nNow, this box here would be cleared out,\nbut we can expand it out.\n\n987\n00:51:49,742 --> 00:51:54,080\nAnd that we can go ahead and click on\nthose items that we want to allow.\n\n988\n00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:59,120\nOnce those guys are allowed, we'll go and\nclick on good ole Server Manager.\n\n989\n00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,400\nWe'll click OK.\n\n990\n00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,500\nThat's gonna take a while here.\n\n991\n00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,340\nOn our break,\nI was getting these tools installed.\n\n992\n00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:13,258\nNow, on this PC here, so then after we\nhave those tools enabled, to get to those\n\n993\n00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:18,911\ntools, to use them we jumped clear to\nthe end and then it just kinda hangs out.\n\n994\n00:52:18,911 --> 00:52:22,355\nAll right, to get to these tools here and\n\n995\n00:52:22,355 --> 00:52:26,720\nto our control panel, and\nin System and Security.\n\n996\n00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,416\nLet's see.\n\n997\n00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:28,123\n>> Yeah.\n\n998\n00:52:28,123 --> 00:52:33,487\n[NOISE] Ronnie,\n\n999\n00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:36,983\nlet's use your PC to check it out.\n\n1000\n00:52:36,983 --> 00:52:41,450\n>> But I don't have the actual remote\nserver administration tools connected in.\n\n1001\n00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,625\nBut for us, we would just install\nthose pictor features here, and\n\n1002\n00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:48,550\nthen from that point, they normally would\nonly show up in administrative tools.\n\n1003\n00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:54,290\nSo I went to Start, and then Control\nPanel, and then System and Security.\n\n1004\n00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:59,920\nYou would see an additional list of tools\ninside of the Administrative Tools here.\n\n1005\n00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,060\nAnd so we're again having\na little bit of difficulty,\n\n1006\n00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,300\nbut that is actually\nwhere'd you see those.\n\n1007\n00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,120\nAdditional tools, you'd select them, and\n\n1008\n00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,900\nthen you'd be able to connect\ninto some network resources.\n\n1009\n00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,880\nBe able to manage them from there okay.\n\n1010\n00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,310\nNow, remember even though\nthat is an actual tool for\n\n1011\n00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:17,990\nus, it's not really one right there,\nreally designed for\n\n1012\n00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:23,050\nmanaging Windows 7, but it is one that\nyou can use on your Windows 7 machine to\n\n1013\n00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:26,729\nconnect somewhere else especially servers\nhere to manage those remote servers.\n\n1014\n00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:34,070\nNow, as far as those administration tools.\n\n1015\n00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:38,070\nThat would be the core of things\nthat we would use to remotely manage\n\n1016\n00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:38,700\nmass computers.\n\n1017\n00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,650\nNow, the idea of the config\nremote management.\n\n1018\n00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:46,460\nIt centers a lot around, those RSAT tools\n\n1019\n00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:51,670\na lot of times when we do configure\nservers, the new philosophy\n\n1020\n00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:57,680\nof Microsoft is that you don't really\nremote desktop into those servers anymore.\n\n1021\n00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,879\nOf course, not many people walk\ninto the server closet and\n\n1022\n00:54:00,879 --> 00:54:03,940\nsit at the console of\nthat server to manage it.\n\n1023\n00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:09,250\nA lot of times it will be from a Windows 7\nclient, Windows 8 client, computer running\n\n1024\n00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:14,910\nthose remote server administration tools\nand then managing the stuff that way.\n\n1025\n00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:17,810\n>> Yep.\n>> Now, another option that we do have for\n\n1026\n00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:21,280\nremotely managing things is\nthrough good old PowerShell.\n\n1027\n00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,277\n>> Right.\n\n1028\n00:54:22,277 --> 00:54:23,155\nYeah.\n\n1029\n00:54:23,155 --> 00:54:26,235\nSo we have a set of tools\nhere in terms of PowerShell\n\n1030\n00:54:26,235 --> 00:54:30,645\nthat we can actually use to be able\nto manage multiple machines as well.\n\n1031\n00:54:30,645 --> 00:54:32,055\nSo when we start doing this,\n\n1032\n00:54:32,055 --> 00:54:34,625\nwhy in the world would we do this\nrather than the point and click?\n\n1033\n00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:38,235\nWell, with point and click we have to do\nit individually, one machine at a time.\n\n1034\n00:54:38,235 --> 00:54:42,235\nBut being able to use some scripting\npower in PowerShell itself,\n\n1035\n00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:46,475\nwe can actually manage multiple computers\nat the same time by scripting this out and\n\n1036\n00:54:46,475 --> 00:54:48,230\nsending those commands across.\n\n1037\n00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,680\nWell, we're just gonna do a demonstration\nof a single management is\n\n1038\n00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,930\nwhat we're gonna do.\n\n1039\n00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:55,760\nSo in the same way we could use things\nlike R-SAT to manage a remote computer\n\n1040\n00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,880\nwe can now use our PowerShell\ncommands to do so, and\n\n1041\n00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,100\nif we need to configure something we can\nuse our PowerShell to do the same thing.\n\n1042\n00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,970\nBut we're just gonna show you\nhow the connection's made.\n\n1043\n00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:10,080\nSo in Windows 7, we're gonna actually\nset up two pick and rolls here.\n\n1044\n00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,250\nOne of course is gonna be the technicians\ncomputer, the one doing the managing.\n\n1045\n00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,090\nAnd then,\nwe of course need to set up the client,\n\n1046\n00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:18,400\nthe one that's gonna be managed as well.\n\n1047\n00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,960\nSo they begin by running\nthe exact same command here.\n\n1048\n00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,920\nSo if I click on Start, and\nthen I type in PowerShell.\n\n1049\n00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:32,170\nNotice at the very top there we have\nthis idea of the Windows PowerShell.\n\n1050\n00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:34,460\nNow, the reason why this\nis important as well,\n\n1051\n00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,050\nis because there's couple of\nthings that have to go on.\n\n1052\n00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:40,820\nI need to go ahead and make sure\nthat I run this as an administrator.\n\n1053\n00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:45,120\nSo I can right-click on it and run it\nas administrator or I can select it and\n\n1054\n00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,950\nthen do my Shift+Ctrl+Enter and\n\n1055\n00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:51,160\nthat will automatically also\nlaunch as the administrator.\n\n1056\n00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,880\nIf you are working on\ncomputers that are joined.\n\n1057\n00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,188\nTo an Active Directory Domain,\n\n1058\n00:55:57,188 --> 00:56:02,920\nyou have to use a Domain Administrator\naccount to do this, even on the clients.\n\n1059\n00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,372\nSo it doesn't matter if you\nhave every other one on there,\n\n1060\n00:56:06,372 --> 00:56:09,130\nthere have to be a domain\nadministrator here.\n\n1061\n00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:11,596\nSo from this particular point here,\n\n1062\n00:56:11,596 --> 00:56:15,340\nonce I've locked in\nthe administrative mode I type in.\n\n1063\n00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,750\nWhoops.\n\n1064\n00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,830\nLet me see,\nI didn't realize it was that small.\n\n1065\n00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:19,840\nI hope everybody can see that.\n\n1066\n00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,263\nBut maybe change that\nfont just to make sure.\n\n1067\n00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:25,920\nThat's terrible.\n\n1068\n00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,140\nThere we go.\nThat's a little bit better.\n\n1069\n00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:36,230\nAll right, so from here if I\ntype in enable psremoting, okay?\n\n1070\n00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:38,690\nThat's gonna go ahead and\nask and set it up here.\n\n1071\n00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,880\nThat, hey,\nyou're about to do this remote management,\n\n1072\n00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,140\nthere are some things\nthat I need to turn on.\n\n1073\n00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,390\nAnd what we want to do is go ahead and\naccept that.\n\n1074\n00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:45,940\nOkay?\n\n1075\n00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,250\nSo the first thing is hey, are you sure?\n\n1076\n00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,720\nHere are some of the things\nthat I need to go ahead and do.\n\n1077\n00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,670\nSo this is the WinRM,\nthe remote management quick configuration.\n\n1078\n00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:56,890\nSo, we're going to say yes here.\n\n1079\n00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,790\nAnd now, notice it actually goes ahead and\ndoes this and this updated here.\n\n1080\n00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:04,220\nAnd now we're confirming, okay,\n\n1081\n00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:08,570\nwhether or not we're actually going\nto register this and everything else.\n\n1082\n00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:12,930\nFor me to do this I need to go ahead and\ndo the same thing, and now it kind of\n\n1083\n00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:17,120\ndumps me out at the PowerShell Commander\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n1084\n00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,770\nSo, this is on my computer that\nI'm going to be using to manage.\n\n1085\n00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:24,900\nNow, over on another computer,\nI'm gonna use this domain controller here.\n\n1086\n00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,750\nAnd I'm gonna run that PowerShell again.\n\n1087\n00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:27,740\nOops.\n\n1088\n00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:28,800\nAnd right click.\n\n1089\n00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,090\nOh, let's see it won't\nlet me do it from there.\n\n1090\n00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,388\nLet me just type it in.\n\n1091\n00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,340\nAnd again,\nI'm going to run it as the administrator.\n\n1092\n00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,101\nOops, maybe not.\n\n1093\n00:57:40,101 --> 00:57:43,555\n[LAUGH] Well, that's nice.\n\n1094\n00:57:43,555 --> 00:57:45,185\nGive it a moment here.\n\n1095\n00:57:45,185 --> 00:57:46,632\nApparently I'm too fast for it.\n\n1096\n00:57:46,632 --> 00:57:51,638\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I guess, I don't know.\n\n1097\n00:57:53,848 --> 00:57:55,935\nLet me right click and\nrun as administrator.\n\n1098\n00:57:57,735 --> 00:58:05,180\nVerify it says administrator at the top\nand I'm gonna enable PS remoding as well.\n\n1099\n00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,549\nAnd notice it tells me it's set up a\ncertain exception in the firewall as well,\n\n1100\n00:58:13,549 --> 00:58:16,940\nsame thing that we had over on the other\nside, we're doing the same thing here.\n\n1101\n00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:20,330\nAnd go ahead and accept both of those.\n\n1102\n00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,790\nOkay, so once we have this and\n\n1103\n00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:27,020\nwe are now ready, okay,\nto go ahead and get this set up.\n\n1104\n00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:30,940\nOn the client computer, this could be a\nWindows 7 computer that you had run it on.\n\n1105\n00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:36,180\nYet, again, set up this computer now to\nactually be able receive those commands.\n\n1106\n00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:44,800\nSo what we do here is now on this\ncomputer is that we type in set- item.\n\n1107\n00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,570\nNow, the good thing is with PowerShell,\n\n1108\n00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:50,010\nright, you can actually allow\nthe auto-fill to happen.\n\n1109\n00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:54,480\nSo I just started typing in set-I,\nand then I went in and hit tab,\n\n1110\n00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,750\nand that can automatically help you to\ntype in a lot of these commands as well.\n\n1111\n00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:05,880\nNow at this point, I'm gonna do the idea\nof my Windows server management and\n\n1112\n00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,510\nthen a colon here, backslash.\n\n1113\n00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:17,110\nAnd at this point I'm\ngonna say local host.\n\n1114\n00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,930\nAnd then, do a client.\n\n1115\n00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:25,100\nNow again I just started typing\nin the actual words here, and\n\n1116\n00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,730\nthen I hit the tab to\nactually fill that in.\n\n1117\n00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,190\nThat's why you see its\ntyping a little bit fast.\n\n1118\n00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,620\nAnd then I need to set up\nwho it’s going to trust.\n\n1119\n00:59:35,263 --> 00:59:39,180\nNow in this instance I could\nsetup a single IP address.\n\n1120\n00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,800\nIf I had DNS working and\n\n1121\n00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,620\neverything else, I could also type\nin a fully qualified domain name.\n\n1122\n00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,950\nI can do all that.\n\n1123\n00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:51,244\nBut the other advantage that I have is I\ncan also use a wildcard as an asterisk.\n\n1124\n00:59:51,244 --> 00:59:55,140\nSo that way we're just gonna set that\nup for the ease of our demo here, and\n\n1125\n00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,500\nwhat we are going to do\nto make sure this works.\n\n1126\n00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,320\nSo what is this doing?\n\n1127\n00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,790\nThis is actually saying, hey,\n\n1128\n00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:02,660\nI will trust someone issuing\nthese remote power-up commands.\n\n1129\n01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,440\nThe important switch here for\nus is the word force.\n\n1130\n01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,590\nIn other words, we're telling it it\nhas to be able to respond to this.\n\n1131\n01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:12,270\nIs what we need to do.\n\n1132\n01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,490\nOkay?\n\n1133\n01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,100\nSo notice it accepted the commands.\n\n1134\n01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,500\nIt didn't actually tell\nus a lot of things here.\n\n1135\n01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,020\nBut it looks like it accepted it.\n\n1136\n01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,110\nEverything looks like it's ready to go.\n\n1137\n01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:29,330\nSo now over on the managing computer,\nokay, so I'm back on my Windows 7 machine.\n\n1138\n01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:34,760\nWe need to go ahead now and verify that\neverything is actually connected, okay.\n\n1139\n01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:38,690\nSo the good thing is notice it says\nthat the Windows Firewall exception\n\n1140\n01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:40,310\nhas been enabled, okay.\n\n1141\n01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:46,250\nAnd we of course can verify that through\nour firewall with advanced security.\n\n1142\n01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,620\nI don't need to go to the firewall\nwith advance security.\n\n1143\n01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:53,720\nI can do it from just this simple\ncontrol panel in this firewall.\n\n1144\n01:00:58,138 --> 01:01:00,663\nAnd then from here if I\ngo to allow a program or\n\n1145\n01:01:00,663 --> 01:01:03,480\nfeature through I can\nscroll down to the bottom.\n\n1146\n01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:09,340\nAnd I can verify that the Windows Remote\nManagement is set up to accept this\n\n1147\n01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:13,400\nconnection from the domain, as well\nas form the home or private network.\n\n1148\n01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,990\nSo again it’s just verifying it, even\nthough I read it and I know it’s there.\n\n1149\n01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,520\nBut we just wanna make sure.\n\n1150\n01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,020\nOkay?\n\n1151\n01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:21,880\nAll right.\nSo now that we've gone down,\n\n1152\n01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:26,910\nlet's see if we can actually go ahead and\nbe able to do a connection.\n\n1153\n01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:32,980\nSo I can do a test -wsman for management\nhere and then this is just the dc.\n\n1154\n01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:37,240\nAnd notice now I get some\ninformation that comes back.\n\n1155\n01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,000\nIt identifies the actual computer.\n\n1156\n01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,500\nIt actually says yes, I can connect, so\nthis is actually coming back to me, and\n\n1157\n01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,310\neverything that I need.\n\n1158\n01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:49,620\nAt this point,\nI can now enter what we call\n\n1159\n01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:55,920\na PowerShell session and\n\n1160\n01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,990\nI need to go ahead and\ntype in the computer name.\n\n1161\n01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:04,555\nThat's gonna be DC and then I'm gonna\ntell it to ask me for credentials.\n\n1162\n01:02:08,055 --> 01:02:10,170\nMaybe credential or credentials.\n\n1163\n01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:16,170\nI can't remember was it\nactually singular or plural.\n\n1164\n01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:18,620\nSo let me go ahead and press enter.\n\n1165\n01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,610\nOops.\nIt didn't like the credential here.\n\n1166\n01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,080\nI'm missing an argument.\n\n1167\n01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:26,846\nWhat am I missing here?\n\n1168\n01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:31,550\nLet me see.\n\n1169\n01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:37,050\nLet me try Contoso,\nbackslash, administrator.\n\n1170\n01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,660\nThere we go.\n\n1171\n01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:41,880\nSo I'd just forgotten the name.\n\n1172\n01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,360\nI knew I forgot something.\n\n1173\n01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,790\nAnd the other challenge, as always,\n\n1174\n01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:48,590\nNate knows this, is me actually\ntyping in the correct password.\n\n1175\n01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:50,846\nGonna click OK.\n\n1176\n01:02:57,638 --> 01:02:59,013\nAnd now, oops.\n\n1177\n01:03:01,138 --> 01:03:04,030\n[LAUGH] Okay, so\nit's just gotta wait here.\n\n1178\n01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,555\nSo hopefully it will connect in and\nthere we go.\n\n1179\n01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:10,138\nIt looks like it failed here.\n\n1180\n01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:14,560\nSo what did I enter in, incorrectly?\n\n1181\n01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,898\nOh, I misspelled administrator how's that?\n\n1182\n01:03:16,898 --> 01:03:18,971\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How's that?\n\n1183\n01:03:18,971 --> 01:03:24,680\nContoso\\administrator, all right?\n\n1184\n01:03:26,388 --> 01:03:28,055\nHelps if I can spell.\n\n1185\n01:03:30,263 --> 01:03:31,890\n>> It does come in handy sometimes.\n\n1186\n01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:32,639\n>> I know.\nTell me about it.\n\n1187\n01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,030\nLet's see now, there we go.\n\n1188\n01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:40,930\nNotice now in the square brackets\nat the beginning of my line,\n\n1189\n01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:44,940\nit shows me that I am now connected\nto the domain controller itself.\n\n1190\n01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:50,490\nSo once I have that I can now start\ngiving some information from this domain\n\n1191\n01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:57,650\ncontroller so I can now use\nthe invoke hash command here.\n\n1192\n01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:01,930\nAnd run something that\nwe call a script block.\n\n1193\n01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:04,180\nOkay?\n\n1194\n01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:07,585\nNow on this script block here I'm gonna\nask it to actually just show some\n\n1195\n01:04:07,585 --> 01:04:08,340\ninformation.\n\n1196\n01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:12,420\nAnd so I'm gonna tell it to get\nthe processes that are running.\n\n1197\n01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:15,920\nSo I use the fancy brackets.\n\n1198\n01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:16,460\nOops.\n\n1199\n01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,920\nAgain I can't spell something.\n\n1200\n01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,880\nRevoke.\n\n1201\n01:04:22,115 --> 01:04:23,340\nAnd script block.\n\n1202\n01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:26,540\nOh actually that's the one that I had.\n\n1203\n01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:33,300\nOh it doesn't like my,\nThe misspell process.\n\n1204\n01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:37,460\nOnce again spelling is actually key,\nand there we go, okay.\n\n1205\n01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:40,730\nSo just like the processes that\nare actually running on that machine,\n\n1206\n01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:43,200\nif I go to Start Manager and Processes,\n\n1207\n01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,590\nit's essentially showing\nme the same thing here.\n\n1208\n01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,750\nSo by using something like this,\n\n1209\n01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:52,430\nI can get a lot of information from\nthose picker remote computers here.\n\n1210\n01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:56,244\nSo that's and example being able to use\nthe idea of of PS remoting to manage\n\n1211\n01:04:56,244 --> 01:04:59,158\nour machines that we actually\nneed across the network.\n\n1212\n01:04:59,158 --> 01:04:59,990\nOkay?\nMm-hm.\n\n1213\n01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:04,543\nYeah, Ronnie, with this PS remoting and\nsetting up labs and\n\n1214\n01:05:04,543 --> 01:05:08,760\nhaving to, get into different machines and\ndo things.\n\n1215\n01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:14,520\nI do have to say that it's not too often\nwhere I would drop down to PowerShell.\n\n1216\n01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,130\n>> Right.\n\n1217\n01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:16,080\n>> I know, and do things that way.\n\n1218\n01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:16,970\nIt is, you know,\n\n1219\n01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:22,280\nit is a bit more, I guess routine to\nuse remote desktop and to get in there.\n\n1220\n01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:26,244\nBut I do have to say that\nthese PowerShell commands and\n\n1221\n01:05:26,244 --> 01:05:31,080\nmanaging stuff this way,right,\nit's not going anywhere.\n\n1222\n01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,390\n>> Nope.\n>> And it's getting more and\n\n1223\n01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:35,840\nmore popular, and\nit is all over the exams.\n\n1224\n01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,560\nIt is.\n\n1225\n01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:43,000\n>> If there is some scenario, oh,\nlet's just go into your remote desktop,\n\n1226\n01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,700\nprobably won't be in the scenario, but\nrunning PowerShell commands will be.\n\n1227\n01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:54,090\nSo even though it may not be the most\ncomfortable method at first,\n\n1228\n01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:59,860\nit is definitely going to be the method\nyou need to get comfortable with.\n\n1229\n01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:03,888\nAnd to get good at and\nto practice on your spelling.\n\n1230\n01:06:03,888 --> 01:06:05,790\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n1231\n01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:08,130\nSo, we'll go ahead and\nI'll post up these notes for\n\n1232\n01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,710\nus during this show as part\nof our episode as well, so\n\n1233\n01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:13,440\nthat we can see this demo and\nthat way you can test it out.\n\n1234\n01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,530\nNow, the good thing is you and\nI, or I say you and I, you and\n\n1235\n01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:18,560\nI have access to both the same machines,\nright?\n\n1236\n01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:23,880\nThe idea of using the The HOL, our\nsandbox labs here, to be able to do this.\n\n1237\n01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,310\nSo you can actually do that as well.\n\n1238\n01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:28,340\nOkay.\n>> Alright Ronnie,\n\n1239\n01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:33,630\nwell yeah it was a great series of\nlittle remote administration stuff.\n\n1240\n01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:34,840\n>> Right.\n>> I think that wraps\n\n1241\n01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,460\nup what we had set out for to do today.\n\n1242\n01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,490\nA good old wireless networks,\nand our firewall stuff, and\n\n1243\n01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:43,390\nthen finally remotely\nmanaging our servers.\n\n1244\n01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:43,930\n>> Right.\n\n1245\n01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:44,740\n>> Pretty good.\n\n1246\n01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:45,480\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1247\n01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,480\n>> Anything, any last little remaining\nbits, that you want to toss in,\n\n1248\n01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,800\nbefore we wrap it up.\n\n1249\n01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:54,060\n>> Just remember this exam, is not all\nabout knowledge, you have to get into\n\n1250\n01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:57,840\nWindows 7 here, and really be able to\nmanipulate the operating system, and\n\n1251\n01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,620\nbe able to manage the operating system.\n\n1252\n01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,680\nThis time not just from an end\nuser's perspective, but\n\n1253\n01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:07,180\nremember to actually make sure that you do\nfrom the management perspective as well.\n\n1254\n01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,810\nAll the tools that we've

00:00:39,633\nand welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:42,531\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\ntoday with Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:43,161\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:43,781\n>> Fantastic, Don.\n\n7\n00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:44,571\nHow are you doing today?\n\n8\n00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:46,371\n>> I tell you, I'm doing just swell.\n\n9\n00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:48,389\nIt's amazing.\n\n10\n00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:52,341\nAll right, so we've got another\nWindows 7 episode up in front of us.\n\n11\n00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:55,580\nAnd we're gonna be taking\na look at some of the bells and\n\n12\n00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,760\nwhistles as far as\ncontrolling resource access.\n\n13\n00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,380\nAnd what do we mean by resource access?\n\n14\n00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,590\nWell in Windows 7 we can share resources\nbetween our different computers or\n\n15\n00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,050\neven within a single computer.\n\n16\n00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,550\nBut it's normally sharing folders and\nfiles or printers, right?\n\n17\n00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,000\n>> Right.\n>> Those are some of the different things.\n\n18\n00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,150\nAnd actually, I don't think we're\ngonna get into printers today, are we?\n\n19\n00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,426\n>> Probably the next episode maybe.\n\n20\n00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:17,343\n>> All right.\n>> I guess a little further down.\n\n21\n00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,467\n>> Yeah, printers are lame anyway.\n\n22\n00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:19,893\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So [LAUGH] we're gonna\n\n23\n00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:23,712\ntalk about files and folders and\nthat's an important thing.\n\n24\n00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,360\n>> It is.\n\n25\n00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,840\n>> If you've got corporate documents or\nwhatever.\n\n26\n00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,780\nYou wanna be able to store those\nsomewhere and have it where your users\n\n27\n00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,600\ncan get at them easily, but\nthat they're centrally located so\n\n28\n00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,200\nthat it's not tied to any\none particular computer.\n\n29\n00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,270\n>> It's maybe not the most glamorous part\nof it, but I do always stress to people,\n\n30\n00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,955\none of of our main purposes as an IT\nperson is to make sure that our users have\n\n31\n00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:46,825\naccess to the resources that they need to\ndo their job, and in a secure fashion.\n\n32\n00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:50,125\nMeaning that if they have access,\nthey should be able to see it, they can.\n\n33\n00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,480\nIf they should be able to make changes,\nthey can.\n\n34\n00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,440\nAnd more importantly if they\nshouldn't be able to make changes or\n\n35\n00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,000\nshouldn't be able to see that\npayroll report, that they can't.\n\n36\n00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,830\nAnd that's all done through permissions\nand controlling our NTSF permissions and\n\n37\n00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,800\nour share permissions.\n\n38\n00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,617\n>> Yeah, and as long as they have access\nto their Facebook and their Twitter,\n\n39\n00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:04,433\nthen they're fine.\n\n40\n00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:05,222\n>> They're happy.\n\n41\n00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:07,179\n>> If they can get their corporate\ndocuments then that's nice too.\n\n42\n00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:08,137\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's a bonus.\n\n43\n00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:11,990\n[LAUGH]\n>> More and more today we're seeing this\n\n44\n00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:17,435\nmovement towards cloud services, web based\nemail, web based file servers and so on.\n\n45\n00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:20,180\nAnd that's cool because we don't\nhave to worry about a lot of stuff.\n\n46\n00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,110\nBut the problem is those\nweb based services,\n\n47\n00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,760\nyou're trusting them to ensure\nthe security of your data.\n\n48\n00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,000\nAnd it's been shown time and time again.\n\n49\n00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,292\nYou can't trust them.\n\n50\n00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:32,430\n[LAUGH]\n>> But they still do it.\n\n51\n00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,135\nYou know, they still do it.\n>> That's crazy you know Dropbox,\n\n52\n00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:34,992\nthey're the worst.\n\n53\n00:02:34,992 --> 00:02:39,578\nBut anyhow, by hosting our own file,\nsetting up our own file share and\n\n54\n00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:44,637\nhaving information locally on our\nnetwork lets us guarantee the security's\n\n55\n00:02:44,637 --> 00:02:49,060\nbeing carried out to the level\nthat we need for our organization.\n\n56\n00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,910\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n57\n00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,820\n>> All right, so Mike,\nlet's dive in first.\n\n58\n00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,490\nWe're kinda going along with the Microsoft\nobjectives here for the exam.\n\n59\n00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,780\nAnd under shared resources-\n>> There always in such a logical\n\n60\n00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,640\norder, aren't they?\n\n61\n00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,720\nI love the way they lay it out.\n\n62\n00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,780\n>> Well, and they start off.\n\n63\n00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,758\nYou can always tell when Microsoft has\na new feature they want to brag about.\n\n64\n00:03:06,758 --> 00:03:07,341\nOoh, folder virtualization.\n\n65\n00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:08,058\n>> Yes, yes.\nFolder virtualization.\n\n66\n00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:09,430\n>> Let's do that one.\n\n67\n00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,770\n>> This is one that, it's important,\nwe need to know it for the exam.\n\n68\n00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,680\nIt's kinda neat.\n\n69\n00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,070\nMike, be honest with me.\n\n70\n00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,190\nDo you use this feature?\n\n71\n00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,960\n>> Actually I do.\n\n72\n00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,230\n>> You do?\n>> I would tell you that I do.\n\n73\n00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,320\nBecause on my home systems the way\nI set it up, I've got my OS and\n\n74\n00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,500\napps on one partition and\nall my data is on a different partition.\n\n75\n00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,330\nSo, when I blow it away.\n\n76\n00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,110\nBecause I'm like you I like\nto reinstall quite often.\n\n77\n00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,380\nWhen I do that all I have to\ndo is go to my libraries.\n\n78\n00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,430\nPoint it back, add that folder to\nmy D drive back to my library and\n\n79\n00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,650\nit's right back into my documents and\nthings like that.\n\n80\n00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,920\nSo your documents are basically\na virtual directory.\n\n81\n00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,015\nYour pictures, your music and all that.\n\n82\n00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:48,113\n>> Sadly, now that you've explained it\nlike that I use symlinks on the hard\n\n83\n00:03:48,113 --> 00:03:53,320\ndrive to do the same thing kinda thing\nwhich is probably ten times harder.\n\n84\n00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,420\n>> It is, yes.\n\n85\n00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,550\n>> Why don't-\n>> You talk about symbolic links right?\n\n86\n00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,660\n>> Why don't you do a demonstration to\nshow everybody what you're talking about.\n\n87\n00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,658\nVirtual folders, it's a really neat system\nthat just allows us to kinda consolidate\n\n88\n00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:09,224\nall of our data, well, virtually\nconsolidate all of our data in one place.\n\n89\n00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:10,967\n>> Virtually consolidated, exactly.\n\n90\n00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,803\nIt makes it look like it's in one place,\n\n91\n00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:16,030\neven though it might be\nscattered across your computer.\n\n92\n00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,160\nSo, if Jason wants to throw me up here.\n\n93\n00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,200\nSo, all I'm gonna do here is\nopen up Windows Explorer.\n\n94\n00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,830\nAnd you've got by default it\nshows your libraries here and so\n\n95\n00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,100\nI've got My Documents,\nMusic, Pictures, and Videos.\n\n96\n00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,900\nIf I go to Documents, I'll see a file\nthat looks like there's something in it,\n\n97\n00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,250\nbut this is really not a folder on my\nhard drive, this Documents library.\n\n98\n00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,670\nIt's actually a virtual directory and\nyou can see when I expand it out, I have\n\n99\n00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,640\na folder called My Documents, which is\nour documents that we're used to having.\n\n100\n00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,220\nAnd then there's public\ndocuments in there.\n\n101\n00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,760\nAnd the advantage to, like I said,\nwhat I find, I do have a D Drive on here.\n\n102\n00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,680\nNate is good to us.\n\n103\n00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,030\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\npretend if this was my computer at home,\n\n104\n00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:58,510\nI would have a folder on my D drive called\nDocuments or Docs or something like that.\n\n105\n00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,820\nAnd I might have another file called Pics.\n\n106\n00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,810\nAll right, so that's over on my D drive.\n\n107\n00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,850\nI go back up here to my libraries and\nI pull up the properties for\n\n108\n00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,110\nmy Documents library.\n\n109\n00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,690\nI can see that I currently\nhave two locations in there.\n\n110\n00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,700\nI can choose include a folder, and\nI can go browse down to that D drive,\n\n111\n00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,300\ngrab that Docs folder, and include it.\n\n112\n00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,120\nThe other really cool thing I can do,\n\n113\n00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,040\nis I can set it as the default,\nI can set it as my save location.\n\n114\n00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,350\nThat way everything is going over to\nthat D drive, and if I have to blow my\n\n115\n00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,060\noperating system away,\nthere's really nothing in My Documents.\n\n116\n00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,910\nAnd you could do several folders,\nas many as you needed.\n\n117\n00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,400\nI can click OK, and now you see that\nthat D: location shows up in there.\n\n118\n00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,520\nAnd the same thing with dates,\nthey all work the same way.\n\n119\n00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,186\nSo I pull up the properties for the picks,\nadd a folder, go down to my D drive,\n\n120\n00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:56,870\nadd that Pics folder and\nif you choose to set it as a default.\n\n121\n00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,310\nAnd I'll tell you sometimes I have\nremoved the original location.\n\n122\n00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,080\nJust to ensure that everything goes\nthere and that way I don't have to\n\n123\n00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,780\nworry about trying to back this\nC: folder up, if I don't want to.\n\n124\n00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,100\nSo yeah, I use them a lot.\n\n125\n00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,480\nHandy if you've got that second drive or\nthat third drive.\n\n126\n00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,010\nWhere you can include all those\ndifferent folders in that one library.\n\n127\n00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:21,310\nSo now when I go to Documents library,\nyou see all those locations.\n\n128\n00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:27,170\nIf I had removed the other ones,\nyou really couldn't tell that it was\n\n129\n00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,810\nnot your standard My Documents folder,\nother than the path, they couldn't tell.\n\n130\n00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:37,432\nSo when you make a file here,\nit's actually\n\n131\n00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:41,520\nover here on my D drive.\n\n132\n00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,690\n>> Well, there you go.\n\n133\n00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,598\n>> Very good.\nI like them.\n\n134\n00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:46,200\nI like them.\n\n135\n00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,012\n>> I do the same kinda thing, but\n\n136\n00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:52,020\nI do symbolic links I guess just\nbecause I've kinda scripted it.\n\n137\n00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,370\nSo when I reformat my computer or\nwhatever, I just run a little script.\n\n138\n00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,340\nAnd it's effectively doing that same thing\nexcept, you did it with a mouse click, so.\n\n139\n00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,900\n>> Nice.\n>> Definitely an easier way to go\n\n140\n00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,530\nabout it.\n\n141\n00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,090\n>> It is handy and it is something you can\nteach your average end user to do even,\n\n142\n00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,450\nand things like that,\nso that is very nice.\n\n143\n00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,030\n>> So easy even your mom could do it.\n\n144\n00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,508\n>> Even my mom could do it.\n\n145\n00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:11,100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hey, mom.\n\n146\n00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,278\n>> Now we're gonna get bad emails.\n\n147\n00:07:15,278 --> 00:07:19,690\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nvirtual folders kinda cool you know,\n\n148\n00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,820\nneat functionality there.\n\n149\n00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,610\nIt definitely helps to organize that data.\n\n150\n00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,095\nWe also have shared folders and\n\n151\n00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:29,200\nthere's some interesting things going\non in the background on Windows 7.\n\n152\n00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,060\nYou probably noticed when Mike\nwas editing that document folder,\n\n153\n00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,100\nwhen he was editing the properties\nhe had his own documents folder.\n\n154\n00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,460\nAnd then right after it was another\none called Public, all right?\n\n155\n00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,049\nWell, what the heck is that, Public?\n\n156\n00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:45,766\nWell, in Windows, Windows 7 at least, if\nyou share your computer with other people,\n\n157\n00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:49,910\nso if you have four or five people using\nthe same computer Well by default their\n\n158\n00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,081\nindividual profiles are isolated from\neach other, they don't share data.\n\n159\n00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:56,637\nSorry, I'm trying to\nchoke back a sneeze here.\n\n160\n00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:58,680\nSo they don't share Shared data.\n\n161\n00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,910\nSo if you put something, like if Mike put\nsomething in his My Documents folder,\n\n162\n00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,260\nthan only he sees it and\nnobody else sees it.\n\n163\n00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,900\n>> Right.\n\n164\n00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,935\n>> But what if we wants to share it with\nthe other people on the same computer?\n\n165\n00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:09,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n166\n00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,870\n>> You've got the public folders.\n\n167\n00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,560\nOh yeah, you can browse to it right there.\n\n168\n00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,440\n>> Exactly, so if I went into users and\nthen public, I can see.\n\n169\n00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,000\nIf I can make my cursor do what\nit's supposed to, there we go.\n\n170\n00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,325\nPublic documents,\nPublic Downloads, etc, et., etc.\n\n171\n00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:22,802\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, as Don was saying,\n\n172\n00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,883\nthis is a way you can easily share it\nwith other users on the same computer.\n\n173\n00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:31,260\nThe tricky part is the fact that public\nfolder sharing is turned off right now.\n\n174\n00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,960\n>> Yup.\n\n175\n00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,125\n>> The confusing part is when public\nfolder sharing is turned off,\n\n176\n00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:40,580\nanybody that has access to the machine,\na log on can access those public folders.\n\n177\n00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,290\nBut we can turn public folder sharing on,\nand\n\n178\n00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,950\nthat's gonna expose those folders\nto anybody on the network.\n\n179\n00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,450\n>> Yeah.\n\n180\n00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,350\nThe default functionality is that\nthat person would have to sit down\n\n181\n00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,250\nat your computer and log in.\n\n182\n00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,320\nAnd then they would have\naccess to those files.\n\n183\n00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,300\nSo this is good for like a family.\n\n184\n00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,190\nYou got mom, dad, couple a kids, and\nthey all share the same computer.\n\n185\n00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,170\nAnything they all need access to can\ngo in one of those public folders.\n\n186\n00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,360\nBut if they have two or three computers,\n\n187\n00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,790\nthey're not gonna be able to see each\nother's public folders by default.\n\n188\n00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,308\nAll right, but we can turn that on\npretty quickly if we jump into our,\n\n189\n00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:18,520\nlet's go do the training\nwheels way [LAUGH].\n\n190\n00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,450\nGo into our network and sharing center and\ninside of the network and\n\n191\n00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,230\nsharing center, you'll have\nthe option in here to configure\n\n192\n00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,880\nhow we're doing public folder sharing and\nstuff like that.\n\n193\n00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,440\nIt's buried away in there somewhere.\n\n194\n00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,670\nThere it is.\n\n195\n00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,940\nSo in here you'll see,\nit's kind of in that middle.\n\n196\n00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,000\nYou've got file and\nprinter sharing we can turn on.\n\n197\n00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,920\nThen right after it Public Folder Sharing.\n\n198\n00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,990\nAnd we've already got it\nturned on on this machine.\n\n199\n00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,280\nI believe the default is it's off right?\n\n200\n00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,240\n>> It is turned off by default.\n\n201\n00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,530\nCorrect.\n>> But\n\n202\n00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,540\nyou can see there in the notes\nhow it says, turn on sharing so\n\n203\n00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,720\nanyone with network access can read and\nwrite in the public folders.\n\n204\n00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,430\nSo not the folders that you\nhave in your own profile but\n\n205\n00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,755\nthe ones that are in the public folders.\n\n206\n00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:01,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And those kinda show up as libraries.\n\n207\n00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,600\n>> Right.\n\n208\n00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,580\nYou can actually do\n\n209\n00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,000\nvirtual folders inside of the public\nfolders to link other data in there and\n\n210\n00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,500\nthen it becomes available to\nall the people on your network.\n\n211\n00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,040\nNot the most incredibly secure thing\nthough because it's really designed for\n\n212\n00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,660\nhome users and small business.\n\n213\n00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,200\n>> It is.\n\n214\n00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,120\nIt is.\nThere's a couple of those built in\n\n215\n00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,380\ngroups that it actually uses.\n\n216\n00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,380\nYou've got the interactive log on group.\n\n217\n00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,900\nAnd you've got the network log on group.\n\n218\n00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,560\nAnd so if you log on to a machine locally,\n\n219\n00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,470\nsit at it, you're now part\nof that interactive log on.\n\n220\n00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,900\nIt's the interactive log on that has\npermissions over that public folder.\n\n221\n00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,050\nWhen you turn public folder sharing on,\n\n222\n00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,570\nit adds the network log on\nto the access control list.\n\n223\n00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,660\nAnd now anybody with\nnetwork access can get it.\n\n224\n00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,680\nSo they tell you you don't change\nthe permissions on the public folders\n\n225\n00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,560\nthemselves if you wanna control access\nto a resource within the public folder.\n\n226\n00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,320\nCuz once you put it in there,\nanybody on the network has read and\n\n227\n00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,870\nwrite access to that public\nfolder if you've turned it on.\n\n228\n00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,230\nSo if you wanna prevent somebody\nfrom making changes to a file,\n\n229\n00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,390\nyou change the permissions\non the file itself,\n\n230\n00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,920\nwhich we're gonna get into later when\nwe get into our NTFS permissions.\n\n231\n00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,920\n>> All right, so those public folders,\npretty straight forward.\n\n232\n00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,760\nWe're gonna take a look later on,\nand I say later on,\n\n233\n00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,100\nit's really kind of coming,\nwe might as well jump ahead and do it.\n\n234\n00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,915\nWe're talk about homegroups.\n\n235\n00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:13,792\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n236\n00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:18,090\n>> With homegroups, it gives you way\nto connect your computers together, so\n\n237\n00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,860\nthey can share not just the public\nfolders, but any folder.\n\n238\n00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,288\n>> Right.\n>> And do it pretty easily,\n\n239\n00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:24,913\nwithout having to go through,\ncrazy permissions and stuff.\n\n240\n00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:27,080\nSo we talked about folder virtualization.\n\n241\n00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,280\nWe just talked about those shared folders,\nthe ones that are flagged as public.\n\n242\n00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,230\nLet's jump ahead.\n\n243\n00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,180\nI'm gonna skip past printers and queues.\n\n244\n00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,797\n>> Yeah\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n245\n00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:36,790\n>> Printers [INAUDIBLE].\n\n246\n00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,360\nWe'll come back to them, but\n\n247\n00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,222\nwe'll take a look at configuring homegroup\nsettings first and kinda see that.\n\n248\n00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:47,720\nNow, homegroup, like the name implies,\nis designed for home users.\n\n249\n00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,430\nYou really shouldn't be using\nhomegroups in a company or\n\n250\n00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,940\ncorporate type environment.\n\n251\n00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,310\nThat's what the active directory is for.\n\n252\n00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,790\nBut for a home an active directory\nlike having a domain control and\n\n253\n00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,740\nall that stuff is really overkill for\nwhat we need.\n\n254\n00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,090\n>> Exactly, and even setting up a work\ngroup in a homegroup, which we could do\n\n255\n00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,140\nbefore, was still a little more\nthan your average person could do,\n\n256\n00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,070\nI think, and\nreally understand what was going on.\n\n257\n00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,530\nSo, homegroups make it super easy.\n\n258\n00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,120\n>> Yeah.\nHomegroups\n\n259\n00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,530\nwere introduced in Window's Vista and so\nthey're not supported in XP and earlier.\n\n260\n00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,425\nAnd what they do is they\ngive you a quick and\n\n261\n00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:23,270\neasy way to connect your computer\nsecurely to share information.\n\n262\n00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,210\nThe old option was to use workgroups,\nlike Mike mentioned, and\n\n263\n00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,804\nif I wanted to do a workgroup, basically\nI'd go to each computer in my house and\n\n264\n00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:31,670\nset their workgroup name to be the same.\n\n265\n00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,696\nThen I would have to create user\naccounts and passwords on each machine.\n\n266\n00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:38,642\nAnd if I change my password on one,\nI'd have to go and\n\n267\n00:12:38,642 --> 00:12:39,720\nchange it on all the others.\n\n268\n00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,382\nIt was a big hassle.\n\n269\n00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:43,930\nWith homegroups that\ninformation is exchanged so\n\n270\n00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,230\nwe don't have to deal with that.\n\n271\n00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,630\nAnd then we can define quick and\neasy permissions based on what we're\n\n272\n00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,670\ntrying to achieve with the homegroup,\nall right.\n\n273\n00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,960\n>> That's very cool.\n\n274\n00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,670\n>> So,\nstep one is to get the homegroup set up.\n\n275\n00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,350\nNow, you can only have one\nhomegroup on a network.\n\n276\n00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,100\nSo if somebody already created\na homegroup on a machine on your network,\n\n277\n00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,500\nthen you won't be able\nto create a new one.\n\n278\n00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,200\nSo that's a little quirk\nthat you can bump into.\n\n279\n00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,420\nBut if you're the first person to do it,\n\n280\n00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,070\nyou just run the Home Group Wizard\non one machine.\n\n281\n00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,360\nAnd then it's gonna generate a key.\n\n282\n00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,900\nAnd you take that key,\nwhich is like a password, and\n\n283\n00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,870\nyou enter it in on any machine you\nwant to be a part of that homegroup.\n\n284\n00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,270\nAnd as soon as that's done,\nthey can start to exchange information.\n\n285\n00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,870\n>> Very handy, like I said,\njust very easy to do.\n\n286\n00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,110\nI use it at my house,\n\n287\n00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,938\nit makes it easy to access resources\non my other machines in my house.\n\n288\n00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:33,560\nI like it.\n\n289\n00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,060\n>> Yeah, my only problem, like for the\nlongest time I had a Windows home server\n\n290\n00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,510\nat home, and sadly, the Windows home\nserver didn't support homegroups.\n\n291\n00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,600\n>> Oh, really? [LAUGH] >> And so, you have\na homegroup between your workstation but\n\n292\n00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,850\nthen they couldn't talk\nto the server user.\n\n293\n00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,370\nIt was really frustrating.\n\n294\n00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,880\nSo if you've got a Linux machine or\na Windows server or a Mac.\n\n295\n00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,100\nThey can't participate in the homegroup.\n\n296\n00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,980\nSo, it's really designed for people who\njust have a bunch of Window's boxes at\n\n297\n00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,910\nhome and\nit does make things easy to share.\n\n298\n00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,220\n>> And that's another good point too.\n\n299\n00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,140\nOne other thing I thought about,\n\n300\n00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,820\nwhen I first set it up,\none of the things I realized was\n\n301\n00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,450\nI could no longer connect to my\nadministrative shares in my homegroup.\n\n302\n00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,350\nBecause when you establish that home\ngroup, as soon as that machine hits\n\n303\n00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,590\nthe network, it sees that homegroup\npartner and it establishes connection.\n\n304\n00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,040\nIf you open up Windows Explorer, you can\nsee the files that you've shared out,\n\n305\n00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,070\nthings like that.\n\n306\n00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,800\nSo the computer says well, I've already\ngot a connection to this machine.\n\n307\n00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,040\nSo if you try to open up Windows Explorer\nand try to do your C$ or something like\n\n308\n00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,930\nthat, it says nope, I can only establish\none connection on that machine at a time.\n\n309\n00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,900\nSo it does kind of hose up some\nof your more advanced techniques\n\n310\n00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,890\nthat you would use.\n\n311\n00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,251\n>> Stuff that a home\nuser wouldn't use anyway.\n\n312\n00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:37,878\n>> They would have no idea or\nwhatever we wanna do.\n\n313\n00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:38,785\nExactly.\n\n314\n00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:40,830\n>> But for\na home environment it's pretty cool.\n\n315\n00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,018\nLet's show them something.\n\n316\n00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:42,795\nMike?\n>> Let's do it.\n\n317\n00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:44,653\n>> Do you wanna create the home group or\nyou want me to?\n\n318\n00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:45,500\n>> Eeny meeny miny mo.\n\n319\n00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,684\nI'm already there.\n\n320\n00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:48,129\n>> Well we'll let you do it.\n\n321\n00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:50,660\n>> Choose back in control panel.\n\n322\n00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:56,600\nAnd underneath my network and\nInternet I have a big blue screen.\n\n323\n00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,770\nAnd then I just choose Homegroup and\nSharing Options.\n\n324\n00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,480\nAnd then we can say Create a Homegroup\nbecause I'm not a part of Homegroup yet.\n\n325\n00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,350\n>> And it's right on this screen that\nit'll let you know if there's already\n\n326\n00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,520\na homegroup present,\n\n327\n00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,140\nbecause it won't let you create\na new one while one already exists.\n\n328\n00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,250\nSo Mike is clearly seeing\nthere's just no homegroup.\n\n329\n00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,160\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n330\n00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,854\nSo I click Create a Homegroup,\nand then I can choose, and\n\n331\n00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:20,670\nI can make changes after the fact,\nI'm not stuck with it.\n\n332\n00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,960\nBut I can choose what I want to\nallow the the homegroup to see.\n\n333\n00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,900\nI want to see Printers, Music,\nVideos, Pictures, Documents.\n\n334\n00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,230\nI'll go ahead and choose it all.\n\n335\n00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,860\nI trust the Homegroup here.\n\n336\n00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,655\nMight be a mistake.\n\n337\n00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:34,895\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'll click Next.\n\n338\n00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:38,808\nAnd it should set up my Homegroup and\ngive me, wow.\n\n339\n00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:42,560\nI don't think I've ever seen it paint\nthe password out quite that slow.\n\n340\n00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,300\n>> It just draws it out, huh?\n\n341\n00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,880\n>> Anyway, yeah, so there's my password.\n\n342\n00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,800\nSo now If Don wants to join my homegroup,\n\n343\n00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,840\nI'm gonna have to send\nhim this information.\n\n344\n00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,710\n>> And it's got that nice little\nlink there to print the password and\n\n345\n00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,400\ninstructions, again,\ntrying to make it real easy.\n\n346\n00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,270\nYou can just print it out.\n\n347\n00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,954\nAnd you can pull this key up later on,\nso let's say Mike hits Finish and\n\n348\n00:15:59,954 --> 00:16:03,512\nit's a month later He buys a new\ncomputer at home and he wants to get it\n\n349\n00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:07,258\non the homegroup, you can come right\nback in here and you've got view or\n\n350\n00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:11,750\nprint the homegroup password right there\nso you can pull it up again later on.\n\n351\n00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,830\nYou can actually change\nthe homegroup password too.\n\n352\n00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,760\nI didn't notice, Nate showed me one day.\n\n353\n00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,760\nThere's even like a or yeah, she can\ngo right there and change the password.\n\n354\n00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,710\nAnd the nice thing about changing it,\nlet's go ahead and do it.\n\n355\n00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,190\nGo to change the password.\n\n356\n00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,540\nIs you can change it to whatever you want.\n\n357\n00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,640\nSo set it to ITProTV so that I don't\nhave to write out some crazy password.\n\n358\n00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,750\n[LAUGH]\n>> I honestly did not know you\n\n359\n00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,250\ncould do that.\n\n360\n00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,310\n>> I didn't either, Nate.\n\n361\n00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,750\n>> Now this randomize it again?\n\n362\n00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,190\n>> Yeah, it'll do a random generation.\n\n363\n00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,800\nThat's probably more\nsecure in the long run,\n\n364\n00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,700\nbut we're talking about\na homegroup anyway.\n\n365\n00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,000\nSo setting it to something like\nthis makes it a little bit easier.\n\n366\n00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,540\nOh, at least eight characters.\n\n367\n00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,870\n>> What happens if I six,\nlet's see itprotv,\n\n368\n00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,013\n>> Do itpro, that'll work itprotvshow, or\n\n369\n00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:59,200\nyou can do like your phone number,\n\n370\n00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,260\nsomething that's easy to remember, that\nmakes life a little bit easier, all right.\n\n371\n00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,120\n>> Absolutely, cuz you buy\na computer three months from now,\n\n372\n00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,060\nyou want to add it to your homegroup.\n\n373\n00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,047\nWhat the heck was that password?\n\n374\n00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:08,603\nYou've gotta come back here and look.\n\n375\n00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:10,508\nIf you set it yourself,\nat least you know what it was.\n\n376\n00:17:10,508 --> 00:17:12,830\n>> Yep, so kind of a cool thing.\n\n377\n00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:17,130\nSo now I can go to my machine, so\nI'm gonna jump over here to my machine and\n\n378\n00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,700\nif I fire this up and I go to homegroup,\nwell, I don't have a homegroup, right?\n\n379\n00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,410\nSo I'm not in one.\n\n380\n00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,880\nEven though Mike's running one,\neven though it's out there on the network,\n\n381\n00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,010\nI'm not a part of it.\n\n382\n00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,910\nBut notice what this window is showing,\n\n383\n00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,530\nit's saying there is\na homegroup out there.\n\n384\n00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,660\nWindows detected a home group.\n\n385\n00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,520\n>> It's not giving you\nthe option to create one, is it?\n\n386\n00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,810\n>> Nope.\nThere can only be, there can be only one.\n\n387\n00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,483\nIt's like the highlander\nof networking technologies.\n\n388\n00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:42,045\n>> To rule them all.\n\n389\n00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:42,796\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n390\n00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:43,560\n>> All right, so\n\n391\n00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,845\na highlander I feel cool with.\n\n392\n00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:47,105\nLike The Lord of the Rings\nnow I kinda feel dorky.\n\n393\n00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:48,416\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n394\n00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,140\n>> [LAUGH] Differing tiers\n\n395\n00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,750\nof Nerd-dom on the show.\n\n396\n00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,830\nBut [LAUGH] anyhow it's telling me\nthat it's already found one and\n\n397\n00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,630\nI can join it if I want.\n\n398\n00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,465\nI just went straight through Explorer,\nbut had I gone the way that you did,\n\n399\n00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:08,465\nyou went originally through Network and\nSharing Center, and let's see,\n\n400\n00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:10,035\nadvanced, wasn't it?\n\n401\n00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:11,415\nOr no, it wasn't advanced, it was-\n>> Go back and\n\n402\n00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:14,895\nat the bottom of that back screen there,\nchoose homegroup, yeah.\n\n403\n00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:20,495\n>> Yeah, so if I go in this way, even\nhere, no creation option, just a join now.\n\n404\n00:18:20,495 --> 00:18:25,120\nAnd it's telling me that Mike on, and\neven give you the name of his machine,\n\n405\n00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,370\nis the one who created a homegroup\nthat's already in place.\n\n406\n00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,650\nSo let me just go back to that other\nscreen here, and I'm going to join now.\n\n407\n00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,230\nAnd-\n>> Same options,\n\n408\n00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,650\nchoose what it is that he's going\nto share with the homegroup.\n\n409\n00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,050\nAnd this is what I'm sharing,\nI could uncheck these,\n\n410\n00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,460\nmaybe I don't wanna share anything?\n\n411\n00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,430\n>> Right.\n>> Mike's sharing stuff.\n\n412\n00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,190\nI'll take all of his stuff,\nbut I don't wanna share mine.\n\n413\n00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,710\nSo I could clear all this.\n\n414\n00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,280\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\ncheck them all off.\n\n415\n00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,510\nAnd I'll just hit next.\n\n416\n00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,250\nAnd now it's asking for\n\n417\n00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,640\nthat password which thankfully\nis a nice easy one for me.\n\n418\n00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,130\nSo, we'll punch that in and\nnow I'm joining, I'm reaching out and\n\n419\n00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:58,760\ntalking to Mike.\n\n420\n00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,250\nNow, that password is being\nused like an encryption key.\n\n421\n00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,690\nA pre-shared key.\n\n422\n00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,520\nSo he and I share the same key.\n\n423\n00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,560\nAnd then the homegroup,\n\n424\n00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,762\nthis is something a lot of people\ndon't know, it's actually using IPv6.\n\n425\n00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:13,590\nHomegroups require IPv6.\n\n426\n00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,150\nIf you've disabled IPv6 on your\nnetwork card, this will not work.\n\n427\n00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,310\nAnd so it's building a secure\nIP set connection between me and\n\n428\n00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,820\nMike and\nit's actually encrypting that data.\n\n429\n00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,790\nSo not only is it easy to use.\n\n430\n00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,260\nIt's very secure but that also\nmeans that it only works on a LAN.\n\n431\n00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,490\nIt won't work if you're on\ntwo different networks.\n\n432\n00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,730\nYou have to be on the same subnet.\n\n433\n00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,640\n>> And now if we go into Windows Explorer\nthere you can see My Computer.\n\n434\n00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,770\nAnd all my libraries that I have.\n\n435\n00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,900\n>> Yep, and if I go into Documents there's\nthat New Text Document you created.\n\n436\n00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,150\nNow I don't, that's on your D drive,\nright, cuz the virtual folder,\n\n437\n00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,820\nI have no way of knowing that here.\n\n438\n00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,330\nI just see, oh,\nyou've got this DOCs folder and\n\n439\n00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,220\nbecause you gave, you went with the\ndefault, so I should have full control.\n\n440\n00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:04,810\nSo I can create, oh, no, nope, we need to\nadjust the permissions on that folder.\n\n441\n00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,290\nAs part of that homegroup,\nit now has certain access.\n\n442\n00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,240\nBut I don't have the permission\nto actually write to it.\n\n443\n00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,060\n>> Yep.\n\n444\n00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,190\nYeah, and you are sharing\nlibraries with that homegroup.\n\n445\n00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,180\nAnd you can add other folders.\n\n446\n00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,440\nYou can actually,\nI don't know if I've mentioned it.\n\n447\n00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,450\nYou can create your own libraries.\n\n448\n00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,150\nYou can create additional\nlibraries as well.\n\n449\n00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,490\nKind of cool.\nAll right, so what do we want to do?\n\n450\n00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,580\nI'm going to come here-\n>> You know what?\n\n451\n00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,510\nWhy don't you do this, Mike?\n\n452\n00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,700\nJust to do the whole thing,\n\n453\n00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,220\nlet's on your D drive let's\njust create an all new folder.\n\n454\n00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,400\nIt's separate from the library.\n\n455\n00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,440\nSo you can create just a general.\n\n456\n00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,800\nSo maybe I want to create\na family storage folder, right.\n\n457\n00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,890\nSo we'll just create one called\nfamily storage, family photos,\n\n458\n00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,430\nwhatever it is you're doing.\n\n459\n00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,110\nYou can create a folder\nanywhere on your computer and\n\n460\n00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,340\nthen you can just right-click on it.\n\n461\n00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,445\nAnd you'll see that option in there\nto share it with the homegroup.\n\n462\n00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,440\nYou've got Share with, and\nthen Homegroup Read, Homegroup Write.\n\n463\n00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,020\nYour whole homegroup, anybody who's\na part of it, you can give them read, or\n\n464\n00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,280\nread and write.\n\n465\n00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,950\n>> All right.\n\n466\n00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:09,240\nSo now that he's done that, back on my\ncomputer, if I go back to my HomeGroup and\n\n467\n00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,000\nI go to Mike's computer,\nthere's that family storage.\n\n468\n00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,515\nAnd since he said everyone read write,\nI can come in here and do a new document.\n\n469\n00:21:21,555 --> 00:21:23,943\nAnd I can create that document and\nthere we go.\n\n470\n00:21:23,943 --> 00:21:27,357\n[LAUGH] And\nthat's being created on Mike's computer as\n\n471\n00:21:27,357 --> 00:21:32,010\npart of this shared storage that we\nmade so some very, very cool stuff.\n\n472\n00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,020\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n473\n00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:38,860\nAll right, so we've got our libraries that\nwe got there, we got the homegroup as\n\n474\n00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:44,090\nanother way to easily share files\nbetween computers on your home network.\n\n475\n00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,861\nLike Don said, not something we're\ngoing to use in the workplace,\n\n476\n00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:48,010\nwe've got ITPro for that.\n\n477\n00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,800\n>> You know, you'll notice that it never\nasked me for a username and password\n\n478\n00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,450\n>> When I did that,\n\n479\n00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,970\nit just made sure my computer\nwas on the homegroup.\n\n480\n00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,130\nSo if I had five different\naccounts on this computer,\n\n481\n00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,980\nall five accounts would now\nhave access to that folder.\n\n482\n00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,680\nIn a business environment,\nthat's not what you want.\n\n483\n00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,350\n>> Right.\n>> You want to do granular permissions and\n\n484\n00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,290\nyou can't do that with a homegroup.\n\n485\n00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:04,790\n>> Absolutely.\n\n486\n00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,550\n>> All right now, Mike,\nwe did that with files and folders.\n\n487\n00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So we talked about libraries and\n\n488\n00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,130\nfile and folders,\nlet's talk a little bit about printers.\n\n489\n00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,880\n>> Okay.\n>> Now we don't want to go crazy on\n\n490\n00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,910\nprinters, you know,\nbecause it is only so much.\n\n491\n00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,899\n>> Yes we do.\nWith a baseball bat and office space,\n\n492\n00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:18,698\nI'll love that.\n\n493\n00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:21,449\n>> [LAUGH] PC load letter.\n\n494\n00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:22,420\nAnyhow, so.\n\n495\n00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:28,090\nSo, but, just like files and folders,\nwe can share access to printers too.\n\n496\n00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,820\nAnd its' becoming more and\nmore common that you go to the store,you\n\n497\n00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,040\nbuy an inexpensive printer and\nit's' got a wireless card in it, so\n\n498\n00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,620\nit connects right to your wireless,\nevery computer can see it.\n\n499\n00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,100\nBut there's still a lot of us that\nhave more traditional computers.\n\n500\n00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,120\nMaybe not printers.\n\n501\n00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,900\nMaybe they hook up via USB\nright into your computer and\n\n502\n00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,020\nyou want to share it with the family.\n\n503\n00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,930\nSo, pretty easy to do that\nright through a homegroup.\n\n504\n00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,240\n>> Yeah, it really is.\n\n505\n00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,120\n>> All right so, Mike, you want to add\na printer or you want me to do it?\n\n506\n00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,910\n>> You know, I was just looking.\n\n507\n00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,210\nI think I might already have one but\nlet's go through it again.\n\n508\n00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,220\n>> Do you really?\n\n509\n00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,070\nAnd I just looked in here.\n\n510\n00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,580\nIn printers and faxes, I've got the Canon.\n\n511\n00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,690\n>> Oh look at that.\n\n512\n00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,470\n>> It load it up on here.\n\n513\n00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,279\nOn the virtual machine, nice.\n\n514\n00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:06,333\n>> How do you have that,\ndo you have access to that?\n\n515\n00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,440\nRight, I'm just double checking.\n\n516\n00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,820\n>> We have a giant copier, a business\nclass machine here at the office.\n\n517\n00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,690\nAnd I didn't think these lab machines had\naccess to it, but apparently they do.\n\n518\n00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,380\n>> Apparently it does.\n\n519\n00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,498\nWe might have to look\nat that after the show.\n\n520\n00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,410\n[LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n521\n00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,560\n>> But I could go through\nthe add printer wizard here.\n\n522\n00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,370\nDo you have them?\n\n523\n00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,350\n>> I'm going to double check.\n\n524\n00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,920\nIf I have the printer\nI'm going to remove it.\n\n525\n00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,460\n>> Okay.\n>> Oh,\n\n526\n00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,980\nyou know what, I've got it,\nit's redirected.\n\n527\n00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,380\nIs yours redirected also?\n\n528\n00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,860\nSo we're remote desktopped in so\nthat's actually coming from us.\n\n529\n00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,700\nBut you can see where\nthere's a Canon Inkjet MP980.\n\n530\n00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,190\nThat one is local,\nall those got little shared people on it.\n\n531\n00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,310\n>> And you've already shared it with me.\n\n532\n00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,040\nHere I'll remove it.\n\n533\n00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,560\nLet's get rid of it.\n\n534\n00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,323\n>> Or\nlet's just create an all new printer.\n\n535\n00:23:47,323 --> 00:23:48,510\n>> Okay, let's do that.\n\n536\n00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,460\n>> Right, and then we'll create maybe\nan HP Laser there, or something like that.\n\n537\n00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,690\n>> So here, I'll just go ahead and do it.\n\n538\n00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,380\nI'll add a new printer.\n\n539\n00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,448\n>> Go through the wizard, and\n\n540\n00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:58,612\nyou guys probably know from A+ and\nNet+ if you've gone through those already.\n\n541\n00:23:58,612 --> 00:24:01,106\nMost of your printers are gonna be,\nI think Don mentioned earlier,\n\n542\n00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,313\nmost of them are gonna be\nautomatically detected, right?\n\n543\n00:24:03,313 --> 00:24:04,520\nThey're USB-based.\n\n544\n00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,412\nYou plug it in, Windows detects it.\n\n545\n00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,595\nIf it's a wireless though,\n\n546\n00:24:07,595 --> 00:24:10,760\nyou would have to go through\nthis wizard to add your printer.\n\n547\n00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,070\nIf it's an older one, if you actually have\nan LPT port, or Serial port, for instance.\n\n548\n00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,840\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or something like that,\n\n549\n00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,468\nyou might have to go through\nthis wizard as well.\n\n550\n00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:23,610\nAnd he's just going through and\npicking one, I assume you picked like a.\n\n551\n00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,150\n>> I picked a HP Laser Jet 2300,\nwhich is a, if I recall correctly,\n\n552\n00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,725\nit's a hunk of junk.\n\n553\n00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:30,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I've installed it,\n\n554\n00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,835\nI did not choose the option to share it\nout, cuz I want to do that myself, right?\n\n555\n00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:38,510\nSo right now it's a local printer, I can\nprint to it to my heart's content, right?\n\n556\n00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,720\n>> Right, but I don't have a printer and\nI want to print, Don.\n\n557\n00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,630\n>> I know, and I don't want to buy\nanother printer cuz I'm a tightwad.\n\n558\n00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n559\n00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,335\nwhat I want to do is I want\nto share it with Mike.\n\n560\n00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:49,780\nWell, we're in the same Homegroup, right?\n\n561\n00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,390\nSo it's really easy for\nme to give that access, we can go in and\n\n562\n00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,040\nwe can pull up our Printer Properties.\n\n563\n00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,800\nAnd in our Printer Properties,\n\n564\n00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,530\nlet me just move that over here,\nlet me get rid of that stupid thing.\n\n565\n00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,930\nAll right, so in our Printer Properties,\nwe can go in here and\n\n566\n00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,930\nwe'll see our various tabs,\nand one of them is Sharing.\n\n567\n00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,780\nHere's my chance to share that printer\nout and give people access to it.\n\n568\n00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,540\nSo I can choose to share it,\nI'll call it the HP Laserjet 2300.\n\n569\n00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,630\nI'll apply that, so there we go,\nI'm now sharing this printer.\n\n570\n00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,670\n>> Nice.\n\n571\n00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,190\n>> Now I also have my Security tab\nthough where I can assign permissions to\n\n572\n00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,930\nwho can do what, and you'll see here,\neveryone has print right now.\n\n573\n00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,800\nSo anybody can connect to this and print\nto it, but if I want people to be able\n\n574\n00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,810\nto do like stop print jobs and manage it\nwhatever, I might have to adjust this.\n\n575\n00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,469\n>> Right, yeah,\n\n576\n00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:43,040\nby default everyone gets Print, and then\nthe Creator Owner gets Manage Document.\n\n577\n00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,890\nSo, you could stop your own job, but\n\n578\n00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,070\nyou couldn't stop anybody else's unless,\nDon assigns those permissions.\n\n579\n00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,090\n>> All right, so that printer's\nnow available on the network.\n\n580\n00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,650\nLet's jump over to your machine,\nMike, and hopefully it sees it.\n\n581\n00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,330\n>> Hopefully, we'll see.\n\n582\n00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,330\nLet's see here, Where did my Homegroup go?\n\n583\n00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,890\nDid we do printers on the Homegroup?\n\n584\n00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,280\nI think you did, maybe we didn't.\n\n585\n00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,070\n>> Apparently not.\n\n586\n00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,570\nHang on, let me.\n\n587\n00:26:05,351 --> 00:26:05,893\nOf course, I've had this [CROSSTALK].\n\n588\n00:26:05,893 --> 00:26:09,733\n>> Well you can get to it through\nthe network icon also, but.\n\n589\n00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:18,086\nYeah, the Homegroup,\nit really just shows those files,\n\n590\n00:26:18,086 --> 00:26:20,854\nat least by default it does.\n\n591\n00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:22,000\n>> Oh, that's your media player.\n\n592\n00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,266\nYeah, so what I would normally do,\nand in most situations,\n\n593\n00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:29,700\nI'm gonna go into my devices and printers,\nand I'm gonna browse, and find his.\n\n594\n00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,600\nI'll go up here and\nclick Add a printer, and\n\n595\n00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,730\nthen choose to add a network wireless or\nBluetooth printer,\n\n596\n00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,260\nwhich would be a printer that somebody\nhad shared out to the network.\n\n597\n00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:47,624\nAnd I should find his HP Laserjet 2300 on\nWin7cl4 listed there, I'll click Next.\n\n598\n00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:53,409\nAnd unfortunately,\n\n599\n00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:56,500\nit tells me I cannot connect to that-\n>> You know, I'm just double checking here\n\n600\n00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,540\nreal quick, and I've got printers\nadded to my Homegroup option.\n\n601\n00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,611\nSo when we enabled the Homegroup, you had\nthe various things you could check off,\n\n602\n00:27:04,611 --> 00:27:06,684\npictures, music, video, documents.\n\n603\n00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:10,573\nPrinters was one of those options, and\nI just went back in and checked, and\n\n604\n00:27:10,573 --> 00:27:12,510\nI've got it checked, so it should.\n\n605\n00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,600\n>> It could be a time kind of thing.\n\n606\n00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,450\n>> Yeah, I might have to reboot\nmy machine or something, so it.\n\n607\n00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,020\n>> Yeah, because I have it too.\n\n608\n00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,310\n>> Yeah, you got it checked too?\n\n609\n00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,835\n>> Oh wait, here we go.\n\n610\n00:27:21,835 --> 00:27:23,950\nHomegroup found a new shared printer,\nso it did detect it.\n\n611\n00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,830\n>> Oh, all right.\n\n612\n00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:30,210\nAll right, so I'll click on Install\na printer, and see if she shows up.\n\n613\n00:27:31,802 --> 00:27:34,720\n>> Yeah, it's best to do it through the\nHomegroup because the authentication is\n\n614\n00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,050\ntaken care of by the Homegroup.\n\n615\n00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,940\nIf you do it through the network,\njust browsing to the machine or\n\n616\n00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,860\nwhatever, you've gotta provide\na username and password for it, and\n\n617\n00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,970\nthat becomes a little more challenging for\nthe home user.\n\n618\n00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:44,570\n>> Right.\n\n619\n00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,580\nI did click that, did I not?\n\n620\n00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,190\n>> It seems to be taking its time,\ndoesn't it?\n\n621\n00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,100\n>> I hate it when you don't get like at\nleast a spinning cheerio or, whatever.\n\n622\n00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,810\nThis is Windows 7, where's my hourglass?\n\n623\n00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,160\nNo, Windows 7 had the cheerio.\n\n624\n00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,173\n>> We need instant gratification.\n\n625\n00:27:58,173 --> 00:27:58,675\n>> Yeah.\n\n626\n00:27:58,675 --> 00:27:59,714\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n627\n00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:03,190\n>> Wow.\n>> So it's thinking about it, maybe.\n\n628\n00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,067\n>> We pushed it too hard.\n\n629\n00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:07,451\n>> We did. [CROSSTALK] >> All right,\nwell anyhow we'll let that sit maybe and\n\n630\n00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:10,040\nit's almost time for a break anyway.\n\n631\n00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,560\n>> Okay.\n>> But\n\n632\n00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,940\nbasically once we share\na printer into the Homegroup,\n\n633\n00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,220\nit's just like the files and folders.\n\n634\n00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,190\nIt'll turn up, people can connect to it,\nand now they can print.\n\n635\n00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,240\nYou don't have to buy\nan expensive network printer,\n\n636\n00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,700\nyou can stick with the one that's\ndirectly attached to your machine.\n\n637\n00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The only negative is\n\n638\n00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,310\nif I shut my computer down,\nMike can't get to the printer anymore.\n\n639\n00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:29,540\n>> That's right.\n>> He's going through me to get to it, so\n\n640\n00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,930\nmy machine will have to stay online.\n\n641\n00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,750\nAlright, well why don't we do this?\n\n642\n00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,073\nWhy don't we stop here and take a break?\n\n643\n00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:36,940\n>> All right.\n>> And that'll give the Homegroup\n\n644\n00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,600\na chance, and I might actually\nreboot my machine during the break,\n\n645\n00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,135\njust because it should have\nadded that printer by now.\n\n646\n00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:44,220\nSo,we'll take a break here and\ngive it a minute.\n\n647\n00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,890\nWhen we get back,we'll\nwrap up with printers and\n\n648\n00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,090\nthen we've got a lot more ahead of us,\nright?\n\n649\n00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:52,650\n>> We do,we're going to get into,\nwhat are we doing next?\n\n650\n00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,480\nLocation where print.\n\n651\n00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,562\nWeve got a little bit more to do about\n\n652\n00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:57,230\nprinting cuz we haven't talked\nabout location to where printing.\n\n653\n00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,970\nWe also have to get into some encryption,\nI believe, we're gonna get nto some EFS.\n\n654\n00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,022\n>> Good times there.\n\n655\n00:29:02,022 --> 00:29:03,400\n>> Fun stuff.\n>> All right, so ladies and\n\n656\n00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,290\ngentleman stay tuned.\n\n657\n00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,155\nMore exciting Window's 7\ntopics when we get back.\n\n658\n00:29:07,155 --> 00:29:15,740\n[SOUND]\n>> All right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n659\n00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,750\nSo prior to the break,\nwe shared a printer out, and\n\n660\n00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,420\nnow we just need to connect to it.\n\n661\n00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,940\nAnd, Mike had thrown up the Homegroup\nscreen that detected the printer but for\n\n662\n00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,290\nsome reason it wasn't connecting.\n\n663\n00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,320\nSo I'm just gonna connect to\nhis printer from my side.\n\n664\n00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,970\n>> Okay.\n>> And\n\n665\n00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,720\nbasically if I go into my Printer\nsettings, I can see some of the printers.\n\n666\n00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,290\nLet's see, yeah, there we go.\n\n667\n00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,260\nI can see some of\nthe printers that I have.\n\n668\n00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,640\nMike added a, what was yours,\nlike a Lexmark?\n\n669\n00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,444\n>> I had a Lexmark, yeah.\n\n670\n00:29:42,444 --> 00:29:44,337\n>> Okay.\n>> T1000, I mean not T, T22.\n\n671\n00:29:44,337 --> 00:29:46,710\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, the taking over Skynet.\n\n672\n00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,230\nSo I don't have any Lexmark\nprinters here so I don't see it.\n\n673\n00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,980\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna browse,\nand I'm just gonna browse to the network.\n\n674\n00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,670\nAnd, I'll find Mike's machine,\nhe's Windows 7 Client 3.\n\n675\n00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,910\nAnd there's the Lexmark,\nit looks like you did two of them.\n\n676\n00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:01,660\n>> I did, just in case.\n\n677\n00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,760\n>> I'll go with the T632, that number's\nhigher, so it's gotta to be better, right?\n\n678\n00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,700\n>> It has to be, right?\n\n679\n00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,180\n>> So, Windows 7 has this nice\nthing called Click and Print.\n\n680\n00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,750\nAnd what it means is,\nwhen you browse over the network and\n\n681\n00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,320\nsee a printer, all you have to\ndo is double-click on it, and\n\n682\n00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,770\nit will automatically add it to your\nmachine and get you ready to print.\n\n683\n00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,920\nSo, when you double-click on a click and\nprint printer,\n\n684\n00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,480\nif you can double-click it, there we go.\n\n685\n00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:30,420\nIt's actually copying the driver from the\nother server, so it just copied the driver\n\n686\n00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,340\nfrom Mike's machine over to mine\n>> Right.\n\n687\n00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,720\n>> Installed it, and\nnow I'm ready to print.\n\n688\n00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,770\nAnd here's my print queue,\nand I'm ready to print away.\n\n689\n00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:43,950\nI could go into my printing preferences\nand send out a, where is the test page?\n\n690\n00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,420\nOh, you know what, test pages\naren't under preferences, are they?\n\n691\n00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,490\nThey're under Properties,\nyep, there we go.\n\n692\n00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,530\nSo I'm gonna print out a test page and\nthere it goes.\n\n693\n00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:56,870\nI'm now printing a notice to the owner\nof that print job is, right?\n\n694\n00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,915\n>> It still says HomeGroupUser.\n\n695\n00:30:57,915 --> 00:31:00,290\n>> HomeGroupUser, and\nthat's because we're in a Homegroup,\n\n696\n00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:03,130\nI don't actually have a user\naccount on his machine.\n\n697\n00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:07,140\nI'm able to print thanks to the Homegroup\npermission set on that printer, right?\n\n698\n00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:12,470\nSo I'm able to print, and if I go\nback to my printer screen, back here,\n\n699\n00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:18,790\nI can now find somewhere in here,\nthere we go, Lexmark T632 on WIN7CL3.\n\n700\n00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,420\nThere's Mike's printer,\nI can print to it, and off we go.\n\n701\n00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,720\nSo no need to have a seperate\nprinter on everybody's machine,\n\n702\n00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,800\nno need to even have\na network enabled printer.\n\n703\n00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,040\nIt can be a traditional printer,\n\n704\n00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,730\nplugged right into his machine,\nand we share it on the network.\n\n705\n00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,585\nSo, pretty cool stuff there.\n\n706\n00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:33,150\n>> Mm-hm, I like it.\n\n707\n00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,670\nOnly downside is like you said earlier,\n\n708\n00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:38,970\nif that machine gets shut off,\nthen nobody else can access that printer.\n\n709\n00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,840\n>> Yep, now let's take a minute to talk\nabout something really cool in Windows 7\n\n710\n00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,690\ncalled Location Aware Printing, all right?\n\n711\n00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,330\n>> Sweet.\n\n712\n00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,220\n>> Now if I have a Homegroup,\nthat's for me at home, right?\n\n713\n00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,880\n>> Right.\n>> So on my machines at home and\n\n714\n00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,855\nthere might be a printer that I use, and\nI might set that as my default printer.\n\n715\n00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:55,875\n>> Right.\n>> If we go back to my printer list,\n\n716\n00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:59,555\nyou'll notice that my default printer\nis this Canon MG6200 whatever.\n\n717\n00:31:59,555 --> 00:32:02,575\nLet's say I want Mike's printer\nto be my default printer.\n\n718\n00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:07,250\nYou can right click on it and\nchoose set as default printer.\n\n719\n00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,570\nNow, whenever I go to print,\n\n720\n00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,940\nthe print screen will default to\nchoosing this printer right here.\n\n721\n00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:18,240\nWell, if that's on my home group, what\nhappens when I take my computer to work?\n\n722\n00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,610\n>> Looking for that darn Lexmark, and\nyou go to print, and you've got to, okay,\n\n723\n00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,185\nnow I've got to pick a different printer,\nand things like that.\n\n724\n00:32:25,185 --> 00:32:27,010\nSo, it's a pain in the butt.\n\n725\n00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,190\n>> It really is.\n\n726\n00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:32,370\nSo, in Window's 7 we got a new feature\nthat allows what's called location\n\n727\n00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,880\naware printing.\n\n728\n00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,540\nWe can set different default printers for\nthe different networks that we connect to.\n\n729\n00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,480\nNow, I don't have the option\nhere because I'm actually\n\n730\n00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,970\nremoted into a desktop machine.\n\n731\n00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,470\nIt only works on laptops.\n\n732\n00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,630\nSo, it actually keys off of, you know,\nwhether your on a mobile device.\n\n733\n00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,090\nI guess it looks to see if you\nhave a battery or something.\n\n734\n00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:57,160\nAnd basically on a laptop if you click\na printer, you'll see a button up here and\n\n735\n00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,400\nI don't have the button, but\nit'll say manage default printer.\n\n736\n00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,320\n>> Right?\nAnd when you click on that,\n\n737\n00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,340\nyou'll see a screen.\n\n738\n00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,060\nLet me bring it up.\n\n739\n00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,610\nI grabbed a shortcut from Microsoft here.\n\n740\n00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,610\nThe location of our printing.\n\n741\n00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,800\nWhen you click on that manage default,\nyou'll see this screen right here.\n\n742\n00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,320\nAnd you'll have a drop\ndown box where you can\n\n743\n00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,490\npick the different networks\nthat you connect to.\n\n744\n00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,747\nAnd you can pick a default printer for\neach one.\n\n745\n00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:20,625\n>> So cool.\n\n746\n00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:24,070\nBecause every time you connect to\na network, you guys with your laptops,\n\n747\n00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,080\nyou connect to different networks.\n\n748\n00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,480\nYou gotta set whether it's a home network\nor a work network or the main network, and\n\n749\n00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,130\nit remembers those\nnetworks you connected to.\n\n750\n00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,230\nSo, each one is going to\nshow up in that list.\n\n751\n00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,010\nYou just go in there and\nclick Add, and it drops it down.\n\n752\n00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,520\nAnd you have a different\ndefault printer for each one.\n\n753\n00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,420\nSo, when you go home,\nit automatically switches over to that HP.\n\n754\n00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,260\nWhen you get back to work, it switches\nright back over to the buis hub, and\n\n755\n00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,590\nI didn't have to do anything.\n\n756\n00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,330\nI click print and\nit knows which printer to go to.\n\n757\n00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:51,804\n>> Yeah, I can't tell you how many times,\nMike, I've gone home,\n\n758\n00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:55,100\nfired up my laptop and\nwe decided to go and see a movie, right?\n\n759\n00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,470\nSo, I go to Fandango, I buy some\nmovie tickets and I hit print, and\n\n760\n00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,400\nthey print here at the office, right?\n\n761\n00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,500\nYou know we've got a VPN in some\nof the offices, so it connects.\n\n762\n00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,560\nSo, then we go and see the movie.\n\n763\n00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,430\nMeanwhile, sitting on the printer here,\npeople can come in and\n\n764\n00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,520\nthey can see, oh,\nDon went to see Snow White in 3D.\n\n765\n00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,940\n>> If I could've just beat you to the\ntheater I might've been able to slip in\n\n766\n00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,523\non your tickets.\n\n767\n00:34:14,523 --> 00:34:17,190\n[LAUGH]\n>> At the minimum you're wasting paper,\n\n768\n00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,990\nbut it's one of the things that happens.\n\n769\n00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:24,990\nWe send those print jobs up and they go\nthe wrong place, so this kinda helps.\n\n770\n00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,430\n>> It is one of those things\nwhere you're like, wow,\n\n771\n00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,270\nwhere has this feature been all this time?\n\n772\n00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,910\nIt just makes sense that it\nshould just work that way.\n\n773\n00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,210\nIt's a beautiful thing.\n\n774\n00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,120\n>> So, that's a neat feature.\n\n775\n00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,840\nJust keep in mind that\nit is a laptop thing.\n\n776\n00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,180\nThey assume that you're not\ncarting your desktop back and\n\n777\n00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,890\nforth so we don't have to.\n\n778\n00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,020\nAll right, let's take a look at some of\nthe other things that we have inside of\n\n779\n00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,630\nour printers.\n\n780\n00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:52,240\nI'm gonna just switch back here and\ntake a look at some of these.\n\n781\n00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,460\nWhen we take a printer.\n\n782\n00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,328\nLet me go back to the one that I had made,\nthis guy right here.\n\n783\n00:34:55,328 --> 00:34:57,860\nWhen you right-click on a printer,\n\n784\n00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,980\nthere's really two main screens\nthat we go in to modify it.\n\n785\n00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,253\nYou'll see printing preferences and\nprinter properties.\n\n786\n00:35:04,253 --> 00:35:07,910\nIt's confusing because there's also\nanother option down here that says\n\n787\n00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,810\nstraight up properties.\n\n788\n00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,582\n>> Right.\n>> So, there's three different setting\n\n789\n00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:11,660\nscreens for it.\n\n790\n00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,270\nWell, the bottom was practically useless.\n\n791\n00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:16,490\nIf we go to the bottom one,\nit just tells you about the printer.\n\n792\n00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,690\n>> How many times have you clicked on that\nand go oh crap, that's the wrong one.\n\n793\n00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,460\n>> This one's pointless.\n\n794\n00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,590\nSo yeah, this one,\nnot a lot to be found in there.\n\n795\n00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:29,000\nBut if we go to printing preferences,\nthis is where we\n\n796\n00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,610\ndefine how that printer's going to\nbehave when I send a print job to it.\n\n797\n00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,580\n>> Huh.\n\n798\n00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,560\n>> At a minimum, there's usually two\nsettings we worry about in here.\n\n799\n00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,910\nOne, is whether we print in color or\nblack and white.\n\n800\n00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,140\nAnd the other one is whether\nwe print double-sided or not.\n\n801\n00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,650\nBut there's other things like you can set\nyour paper source whether it's letter or\n\n802\n00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,870\nA3 or whatever it is that you're printing.\n\n803\n00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:55,290\nYour print quality, this one has 1200 and\n600 dpi, I can pick between.\n\n804\n00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,210\nApparently it's not a color one,\n\n805\n00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,170\nbecause normally you'll see\nthe color options right down here.\n\n806\n00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,630\n>> I was gonna say, a lot of it really\ndoes depend on the printer itself and\n\n807\n00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,840\nwhat capabilities it has.\n\n808\n00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,960\nIf it's not able to do\ndouble sided printing,\n\n809\n00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,430\nthen you're not gonna see those options.\n\n810\n00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,570\n>> Yeah.\n\n811\n00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:11,340\nBut we'll have some other things, like\nhere we've got effects where we can change\n\n812\n00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,510\nkind of the scaling of it to make our\ndocument fit the page, or shrink it.\n\n813\n00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,270\nYou can actually do some neat stuff to get\n\n814\n00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,370\nmore than one page on\nthe same side of paper.\n\n815\n00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:24,440\nYou can apply watermarks\nif you've got some created.\n\n816\n00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,990\nAnd then there's finishing options.\n\n817\n00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:30,530\nNow, not every printer is going\nto have finishing options.\n\n818\n00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,300\nSome of them may have a hole puncher unit,\n\n819\n00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,210\nlike our big printer\nhere has a hole puncher.\n\n820\n00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,590\nIt also has a stapler.\n\n821\n00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:41,150\nAnd so, under finishing, you'll have that\noption to choose hole punch, staple.\n\n822\n00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,910\nThis one, I can choose to\ndo two pages per sheet, and\n\n823\n00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,580\nyou'll see it shrinks\nthe pages to fit them.\n\n824\n00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:51,080\nThat makes us take less paper,\nthus conserving the environment, right?\n\n825\n00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,770\nSave the planet.\n\n826\n00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,390\n>> Saving a tree.\n\n827\n00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,830\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n828\n00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,130\nAnd then some of it too,\nI don't think you have your,\n\n829\n00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,410\ndo you have profiles on that one?\n\n830\n00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,790\nSo, this particular printer\ndoesn't have profiles.\n\n831\n00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:04,710\nIt has what are called task quicksets.\n\n832\n00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,240\n>> Okay.\n\n833\n00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,270\nGood old HP changing it\nup just a little bit.\n\n834\n00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,380\n>> I know what you're talking about.\n\n835\n00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,510\nYou know, I mentioned I used to do this.\n\n836\n00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,470\nIf you have a printer\nwith a lot of features,\n\n837\n00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,150\nyou might have different ways\nthat you wanna print to it.\n\n838\n00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:21,060\nSome days you might wanna print\ndouble-sided, hole punched and stapled.\n\n839\n00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,240\nOther days you might\nwanna print single-sided,\n\n840\n00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,120\nno hole punch, with a staple or whatever.\n\n841\n00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:34,175\nSo, you can create, well in HP land\nthey're either quick task sets.\n\n842\n00:37:34,175 --> 00:37:37,425\nSo, basically, you go through and\nyou set everything the way you want and\n\n843\n00:37:37,425 --> 00:37:42,605\nthen maybe I set it to double sided,\nno staple, right?\n\n844\n00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:44,375\nBut you gotta go through and\nset the options.\n\n845\n00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:47,070\n>> Right, right.\n>> And once it's done, I hit Save.\n\n846\n00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,770\nAnd then I can go and change things again.\n\n847\n00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:52,260\nSo, I can go in and say,\nI don't want it double sided,\n\n848\n00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:57,430\nI want it single sided,\nno craziness whatever.\n\n849\n00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:00,560\nAnd so then I can go in and\nI can save that as single sided.\n\n850\n00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,170\nAnd save it, right?\n\n851\n00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:07,480\nAnd then in the future when I go to print,\nI can just drop that box down and\n\n852\n00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,660\npick between the ones.\n\n853\n00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,400\nHere's the defaults, and\nthen here's the ones that I created.\n\n854\n00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,180\nAll right?\n\n855\n00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,630\nMike, why don't you show on yours,\n\n856\n00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,260\nshow the pro because it does\nlook a little different.\n\n857\n00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,110\n>> Yeah, a little different,\nexact same concept though.\n\n858\n00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:22,560\nI'm just on the Lexmark over here and\ninstead of having the quick set\n\n859\n00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,900\noptions across the top,\nI have a tab called profiles.\n\n860\n00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,890\nBut exact same thing.\n\n861\n00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:31,230\nI go through and pick my settings,\nwhatever it was I wanted to configure.\n\n862\n00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:36,310\nAnd then click save and\nsay that maybe this was my book layout.\n\n863\n00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,860\nOop, if I could spell.\n\n864\n00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,770\nOr something like that.\n\n865\n00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,740\nChange some options up here.\n\n866\n00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,350\nChange that back over to portrait.\n\n867\n00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,981\nMaybe a couple of pages.\n\n868\n00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:55,223\nSave it as a or something.\n\n869\n00:38:55,223 --> 00:38:55,940\n>> There you go.\n\n870\n00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,990\n>> Did I over write the other one?\n\n871\n00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,220\n>> Nope.\n>> Okay there it is.\n\n872\n00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,490\nEyes are getting old.\n\n873\n00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,870\nSo, now I can switch back and\nforth just like he could and\n\n874\n00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:06,850\nchoose the different profile\nthat I wanted to print.\n\n875\n00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:10,830\n>> But the key thing you see is that\nit was different on Mike's versus mine.\n\n876\n00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:14,270\nWe both use built in Window's drivers but\neach vendor,\n\n877\n00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,480\neach printer manufacturer,\ncustomizes this a bit.\n\n878\n00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,800\nSo, you might see changes\nin terminology in there.\n\n879\n00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,730\nSome of the other things\nthat we can tweak.\n\n880\n00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,180\nLet's get out of this one.\n\n881\n00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,600\nSo, this was the printing\npreferences screen,\n\n882\n00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,240\nthat's like the default\nprinter qualities and stuff.\n\n883\n00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,770\nBut if you right click on the printer,\nyou've also got printer properties, and\n\n884\n00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,690\nhere's where some really neat stuff stays.\n\n885\n00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:40,550\nYou have your default junk in here,\nincluding a link to get to preferences as\n\n886\n00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:44,820\nwell as the test page, but if you start\nto look through, you'll see here sharing.\n\n887\n00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,210\nWe both shared our printers out earlier.\n\n888\n00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,250\nYou've also got additional drivers.\n\n889\n00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,140\nNow this is really cool.\n\n890\n00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,320\nWe showed you guys click and\nprint a minute ago right.\n\n891\n00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,350\nAnd I said how it grabbed the driver from\nthe other machine and loaded it down.\n\n892\n00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:02,491\nWell what if Mike had 64-bit version\nof Windows and I had a 32-bit?\n\n893\n00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:04,013\n>> Then that driver's not\ngonna work on my system.\n\n894\n00:40:04,013 --> 00:40:07,626\n>> Exactly So\nwe can go into additional drivers and\n\n895\n00:40:07,626 --> 00:40:11,450\nwe can add the other drivers for\nour printer.\n\n896\n00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,050\nI might want to add the X86 and Itanium.\n\n897\n00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,960\nYeah, I'm not going to\nbother with that one.\n\n898\n00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,660\nSo I can choose to add it.\n\n899\n00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,800\nI'll just check it off here and\nhit okay and it's going to\n\n900\n00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,990\nprompt from the Windows disk so that I can\nload that which I probably don't have.\n\n901\n00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,030\nWell, anyhow.\n\n902\n00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,640\nSo we can provide that driver.\n\n903\n00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,110\nIf we had loaded the driver ourselves we'd\nbe able to provide specific files but\n\n904\n00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,690\nsince it came from the disc in this\ncase that's what it's looking for.\n\n905\n00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,660\nBut you could add those other drivers and\nnow when that 32 bit client came along to\n\n906\n00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,700\nclick print you'd have the driver ready\nfor him and you'd be in business.\n\n907\n00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,350\n>> Exactly.\nSo if you're gonna share your printer out\n\n908\n00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,200\nwith your network you gotta think\nabout all the operating systems and\n\n909\n00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,850\nversions that your coworker's using.\n\n910\n00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,730\nMaking sure you've got\nthe drivers available or\n\n911\n00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,890\nthey're not gonna be able\nto print to your printer.\n\n912\n00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:57,160\n>> Yeah, and I've always found this\nscreens a little bit limited cuz\n\n913\n00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,480\nyou'll notice there's no add button.\n\n914\n00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,350\n>> Yeah, there's no add button.\n\n915\n00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,500\nSo if I want to stick\nolder drivers you can't.\n\n916\n00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,210\nYou know there's a secret way.\n\n917\n00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,240\nLet me get out of this.\n\n918\n00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,790\nBack here on our printer\nscreen if you do alt F you\n\n919\n00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,470\nsee how your secret menu appears?\n\n920\n00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,400\nSuper secret.\n\n921\n00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,390\nAnd in here you've got,\nactually you know what where's my.\n\n922\n00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,520\nSee it's so secret it's not showing up.\n\n923\n00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,516\nYeah where's my Print server.\n\n924\n00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:25,330\n>> Click on your printer.\n\n925\n00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,145\nI think they moved it.\n\n926\n00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:26,945\n>> They did move it.\n\n927\n00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:28,500\n>> Yeah they moved it out there.\n\n928\n00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,580\nIt's no longer hidden they want\neverybody to know about it now.\n\n929\n00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,890\n>> It's not so hidden yeah.\n\n930\n00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,250\nSo if you highlight a printer.\n\n931\n00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,240\nThere we go.\n\n932\n00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,680\nAnd you'll get print server properties and\nyou can go in here and\n\n933\n00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,070\nunder the drivers tab you'll\nsee it's the same basic thing.\n\n934\n00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,700\n>> Right.\n>> Here's all those drivers again.\n\n935\n00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,590\nBut now I've got a nice little add button\n>> Yeah.\n\n936\n00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,570\n>> And I can add in drivers.\n\n937\n00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,040\nAnd it's not adding a printer so\n\n938\n00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,650\nyou don't have to have a physical printer\n>> Right.\n\n939\n00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,220\n>> You're just adding the driver.\n\n940\n00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,830\nAnd you can come through and\nspecify what it is that you're adding,\n\n941\n00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:00,600\nyou know if its going to be 64 bit,\n32 bit, or both.\n\n942\n00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,040\nAnd then,\nthe nice thing here you can browse and\n\n943\n00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,150\nfind the one that you're looking for.\n\n944\n00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,380\nSo you say have disk.\n\n945\n00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,223\nOh, it's covered up by my head.\n\n946\n00:42:08,223 --> 00:42:09,660\nLet me move that, there we go.\n\n947\n00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,060\nSo you can hit have disk and\nthen browse and find it.\n\n948\n00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:16,990\nI usually go this route when I'm kind of\npreloading drivers for click and print.\n\n949\n00:42:18,742 --> 00:42:21,214\nAll right, what else do we have in here?\n\n950\n00:42:21,214 --> 00:42:24,235\n>> Well you know we probably should\ntalk about how we can set, we want to\n\n951\n00:42:24,235 --> 00:42:27,840\nreally talk about the way Microsoft calls\nprinters and print devices, we kind of\n\n952\n00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,253\nneed to if we're gonna talk about setting\npermissions on these [CROSSTALK].\n\n953\n00:42:31,253 --> 00:42:34,260\n>> That is true.\n\n954\n00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,220\n>> One of the quirky things about\nMicrosoft is the thing that sits on your\n\n955\n00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,250\ndesk that spits out the paper\nthat is not a printer.\n\n956\n00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:46,870\nThat is actually a print device.\n\n957\n00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:52,460\nThe icon that you see in your console\nin your computer that is the printer.\n\n958\n00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,880\nAnd the point is,\nyou can have several different printers,\n\n959\n00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,290\ndifferent icons that point back to\nthe same physical print device.\n\n960\n00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,490\nAnd then I can change the settings\non each one of those.\n\n961\n00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,630\nLike I can have one that's allowed to do,\n\n962\n00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:06,290\nthat's set up to do color through\nthose preferences and things.\n\n963\n00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,490\nBut only give marketing department\npermission to double click on that\n\n964\n00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,720\nparticular icon because they\nprint our brochures and\n\n965\n00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,920\nthings like that and\nthey need to do color.\n\n966\n00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,320\nAnd I can have another icon, another\nprinter putting the same print device\n\n967\n00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,450\nthat only does black and white and\neverybody has access to.\n\n968\n00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:29,290\nOr I can make a third printer that points\nthe same print device that the boss,\n\n969\n00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,560\nit has a higher priority.\n\n970\n00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,290\nSo anytime she prints her jobs\nautomatically jump to the top of the list\n\n971\n00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:37,720\nand her jobs print before everybody else.\n\n972\n00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,220\nSo that's just some terminology\nyou have to be familiar with.\n\n973\n00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,720\nThat thing that sits there on\nyour desk is a print device.\n\n974\n00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,010\nYou create printers within Windows\nthat point to the print device.\n\n975\n00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:49,560\nAnd then I can control all of\nthe security through those printers,\n\n976\n00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,000\nthose little icons.\n\n977\n00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,180\nSo it's just, I think Microsoft's\nthe only one that does it that way.\n\n978\n00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,120\n>> Yeah, it really is just terminology.\n\n979\n00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,090\nThey could call it whatever they wanted.\n\n980\n00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,942\nBut that is what they do.\n\n981\n00:44:00,942 --> 00:44:02,743\nSo, let me.\n\n982\n00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:06,000\n>> We can see, and while he's looking at\nthat, I'm going to pull up my screen.\n\n983\n00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,730\nI have the properties of that\nLexmark that I have there.\n\n984\n00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,300\nAnd I can see that I can say\nalways available or I can choose.\n\n985\n00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,655\nMaybe I want it to, HR, not HR,\n\n986\n00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:20,500\nmaybe marketing prints large documents, so\nI don't want them printing between 9AM and\n\n987\n00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,600\n1PM, because their jobs take 30\nminutes to print or something.\n\n988\n00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,160\nSo I let them print after lunch.\n\n989\n00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,280\nWith this particular icon,\nI could set those hours, to okay,\n\n990\n00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,850\nyou're only allowed to\nprint from 1 PM until\n\n991\n00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:42,410\nsay 5 PM so\nwe can change things like that.\n\n992\n00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:46,330\nAny of these settings basically I can\nconfigure for this particular group.\n\n993\n00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:50,309\nAnd then I would go to my security tab and\nI might remove the everyone group.\n\n994\n00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,864\nI don't know if we have\nany other groups to add.\n\n995\n00:44:53,864 --> 00:44:56,655\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's find out.\n\n996\n00:44:56,655 --> 00:45:00,122\nBut I can say,\nlet's pretend that the backup operators,\n\n997\n00:45:00,122 --> 00:45:02,044\nhave anything else good to use?\n\n998\n00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:05,340\nLet's say the power users.\n\n999\n00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,910\nThere we go.\n\n1000\n00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:11,280\nSo now the power users are added and\nthey're gonna have print permissions.\n\n1001\n00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,510\nSo I removed the everyone group.\n\n1002\n00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,560\nI've added power users and given them\nprint, so now only the power users,\n\n1003\n00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,230\nif you're in that group,\ncan you double click on that icon.\n\n1004\n00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,210\nAnd it's only gonna print between one and\n\n1005\n00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,380\nfour because of what I've\nset on my advanced settings.\n\n1006\n00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,255\nSo, if they go to print at 10 o'clock\nat night, it will still print.\n\n1007\n00:45:27,255 --> 00:45:29,700\nIt'll look like it actually\nsent that print job but\n\n1008\n00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,455\nit won't actually spool up and\nprint until 1 o'clock in the afternoon.\n\n1009\n00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:35,720\n>> Yup,so it's pretty cool stuff.\n\n1010\n00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,020\nThere's a lot of different things that\nare in there that are kind of tucked away.\n\n1011\n00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:44,040\nWe talk about printer pools, right?\n\n1012\n00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,370\nPrinter pools where you might have\nmore than one of the same printer.\n\n1013\n00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,920\nLet me show you an example\nof what I mean there.\n\n1014\n00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,260\nBy default when you go into your printer\nproperties, and you go to the ports tab,\n\n1015\n00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:02,590\nyou'll see basically a check mark by where\nyour port is whether it's an LPT port,\n\n1016\n00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:05,560\na COMM port, or a TCP port, or whatever.\n\n1017\n00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,700\nYou basically just see one check mark and\nthat's it.\n\n1018\n00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,040\nAnd if you check a different value,\nsee how it moves along with it.\n\n1019\n00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,990\n>> Yeah, it only selects one.\n\n1020\n00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:16,200\n>> But you can check off\nEnable Printer Pooling and\n\n1021\n00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,590\nwhen you do that,\nnow I can check more than one.\n\n1022\n00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,990\nAll right, now why would I want that?\n\n1023\n00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:25,670\nWell, let's say that you've got\na couple of printers available.\n\n1024\n00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:26,780\nAnd you've got a lab.\n\n1025\n00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,510\nSo maybe it's like a college lab.\n\n1026\n00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:31,860\nSo you've got a hundred\ncomputers in a room and\n\n1027\n00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,900\nall these college students\nprinting to the printers.\n\n1028\n00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,231\nWell, if you make them pick between three\nprinters, the majority of your print jobs\n\n1029\n00:46:38,231 --> 00:46:41,660\nare going to go to the first printer\nas people pick them [CROSSTALK].\n\n1030\n00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,903\nSo by setting up a printer\npool you can manage it\n\n1031\n00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:48,840\nwhere everybody sends their\nprint job to one printer.\n\n1032\n00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,280\nThis printer right here I\ncreated HP laser jet 2302 right?\n\n1033\n00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,990\nSo all the print jobs are going\nto go to this one printer but\n\n1034\n00:46:55,990 --> 00:47:00,890\nthen it's going to round robin\nthem across these three ports.\n\n1035\n00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,330\nJob number one, we got to LPT one,\njob number two, port two,\n\n1036\n00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:07,930\njob number three to port three, job\nnumber four will go back to port one and\n\n1037\n00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:11,280\nthen five,six, and so on,\nbouncing across these ports.\n\n1038\n00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,040\nThat makes it where your jobs are evenly\ndistributed across the printers and\n\n1039\n00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,390\nyou print in theory three times faster.\n\n1040\n00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,880\nYou're not having to wait in line.\n\n1041\n00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,520\n>> Exactly.\n\n1042\n00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,830\n>> You get access to\na printer more quickly.\n\n1043\n00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:24,330\n>> It's a great way to add both\navailability and scalability to it,\n\n1044\n00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:25,840\nbecause if one of those\nprinters goes down,\n\n1045\n00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,770\nwell the print pool is just gonna\nskip that one and go to the next one.\n\n1046\n00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:31,090\nThis one.\nSo the print job still gets printed.\n\n1047\n00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:34,290\nIf you're finding that three\nprinters can't handle the workload,\n\n1048\n00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:37,350\nyou can come back here and\nadd another port, add another physical\n\n1049\n00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,250\nprinter to that print pool, and now you've\ngot four printers instead of three.\n\n1050\n00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,370\nSo you've expanded your\ncapabilities there.\n\n1051\n00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:46,880\nSo great way to add, again, availability\nand scalability to your printers.\n\n1052\n00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,890\nAnd they'll tell you that they really need\nto be the same printers because that job\n\n1053\n00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:54,594\ngets rendered and at least one of those\nprinters need to read that render job.\n\n1054\n00:47:54,594 --> 00:47:55,440\n>> Yeah.\n>> It'll\n\n1055\n00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,770\nalso tell you that they need\nto be in the same location.\n\n1056\n00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,262\nI always tell people that's\nnot actually a requirement.\n\n1057\n00:48:00,262 --> 00:48:02,364\n>> It makes it easier\nto find your print job.\n\n1058\n00:48:02,364 --> 00:48:02,947\n>> Yeah.\nUnless..\n\n1059\n00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:05,786\nUnless that's part of your\ncompanies exercise program, and\n\n1060\n00:48:05,786 --> 00:48:09,280\nthey have to run around to different\nplaces, to figure out, what printer,\n\n1061\n00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,880\nactually spit their job out, so.\n\n1062\n00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,158\nGood idea to put them\nall in the same place.\n\n1063\n00:48:12,158 --> 00:48:13,564\n>> Now Mike mentioned\nsomething a second ago and\n\n1064\n00:48:13,564 --> 00:48:14,904\nI want to make sure\nthat we're clear on it.\n\n1065\n00:48:14,904 --> 00:48:17,830\nHe said, they recommend that\nit be the same printer.\n\n1066\n00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,640\nNow he didn't say they have\nto be the same print device.\n\n1067\n00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,280\nThey could actually be different models of\nthe print device, using Microsoft's term.\n\n1068\n00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,904\nBut because it's all tied to one printer\nin Windows, that means it's one driver.\n\n1069\n00:48:29,904 --> 00:48:30,421\n>> Right.\n\n1070\n00:48:30,421 --> 00:48:31,070\n>> Right?\nSo,\n\n1071\n00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:36,440\nif you get different physical printers\nthey have to support the same driver and\n\n1072\n00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,915\noften times that means that they have\nto be the identical print device.\n\n1073\n00:48:39,915 --> 00:48:41,618\nSo,you're always better off doing that.\n\n1074\n00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:42,158\nRight?\nTaking\n\n1075\n00:48:42,158 --> 00:48:45,310\nwhere all three of them are identical, or\ntwo of them, or however many you have.\n\n1076\n00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:46,955\n>> Right.\n>> They can vary a little bit as long as\n\n1077\n00:48:46,955 --> 00:48:48,030\nthey use the same driver.\n\n1078\n00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,120\n>> Exactly.\n>> Some of the other little\n\n1079\n00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,790\nbells and whistles.\n\n1080\n00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:53,280\nMike you already mentioned schedules and\npriorities.\n\n1081\n00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,300\nWe've got the principal options.\n\n1082\n00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,140\nDid we talk about these?\n\n1083\n00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,090\n>> Yeah, we did that.\n\n1084\n00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:01,575\n>> Okay, the default is,\nwhen I start to receive a print job.\n\n1085\n00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:05,415\nIf it's a hundred pages\nwhen I get page number one,\n\n1086\n00:49:05,415 --> 00:49:09,085\nI will immediately try and\nprint starting with page number one.\n\n1087\n00:49:09,085 --> 00:49:13,080\nWell, if we get through fifty pages and\nall of a sudden the other end\n\n1088\n00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,520\ndisconnects or whatever,\nthe print job gets aborted and it's dead.\n\n1089\n00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,800\nI just wasted my time printing 50 pages.\n\n1090\n00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,670\nYou can change it to say\ndon't start printing\n\n1091\n00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,580\nuntil we've received the entire job.\n\n1092\n00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:28,990\nThey have to send us all 100 pages\nbefore we even print page number one.\n\n1093\n00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:29,700\n>> Right.\n\n1094\n00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,540\n>> This ensures that we don't\nwaste paper printing failed jobs.\n\n1095\n00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,340\nBut it kinda slows things down a good bit.\n\n1096\n00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,240\nRight?\nThe printer\n\n1097\n00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,080\ncould've gotten a head start\nprinting my document, but it didn't.\n\n1098\n00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,990\n>> I always liked it though because I\nthought that if it printed page one,\n\n1099\n00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:48,200\nand it's a 50 page document, and the rest\nof the pages are slow getting there,\n\n1100\n00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,730\nnobody else can print.\n\n1101\n00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,580\nRight?\nBut if you say wait until the last page,\n\n1102\n00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:54,400\nit can go ahead and\nprint other jobs waiting for\n\n1103\n00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,230\nthat thing to spool up\ncompletely before it starts.\n\n1104\n00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,220\nSo you're really not tying up\nthe printer as long, I don't think.\n\n1105\n00:49:59,220 --> 00:49:59,720\n>> Yeah.\n\n1106\n00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,370\nAll right, there is one other\nthing I want to point out,\n\n1107\n00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,720\nand it's this guy down here,\nthe separator page.\n\n1108\n00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,210\nIf you have a lot of people\nsharing the same printer,\n\n1109\n00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,295\nit's inevitable that you're\ngonna print something.\n\n1110\n00:50:13,295 --> 00:50:13,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You go to the\n\n1111\n00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:14,710\nprinter and it's not there.\n\n1112\n00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,260\n>> It's not there.\n\n1113\n00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,790\n>> Somebody else grabbed it.\n\n1114\n00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,821\nRight?\nIt happened to me yesterday.\n\n1115\n00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:19,858\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I mean,\n\n1116\n00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:22,839\nthis is not something that\nonly happened a long time ago.\n\n1117\n00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:24,920\nSo, it just happens all the time.\n\n1118\n00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,840\nSo what a separator page does, is it's\na page that prints in between jobs.\n\n1119\n00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:34,600\nAnd it shows the user name of the person\nthat print job belongs to, the name of\n\n1120\n00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:39,560\nthe document, some basic information to\nidentify who's stuff that is It's useful.\n\n1121\n00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,086\nSome people view it as wasting paper.\n\n1122\n00:50:41,086 --> 00:50:42,630\n>> Right.\n>> If you're the only one who\n\n1123\n00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:46,020\nuses the printer, yes, you're\nwasting paper with a separator page.\n\n1124\n00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:51,490\nBut, if you have a shared printer like we\ndo here at our office, it's really handy.\n\n1125\n00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:54,340\nIf you click that Separator Page button,\nyou'll see a little\n\n1126\n00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,360\nbrowse window where you can browse\nto pick your separator page.\n\n1127\n00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,009\nAnd if we browse it\ntakes you unintuitively\n\n1128\n00:51:00,009 --> 00:51:02,011\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1129\n00:51:02,011 --> 00:51:04,224\n>> Just right into C:/Windows/System32.\n\n1130\n00:51:04,224 --> 00:51:05,755\n>> And you're like,\nI don't see any separator pages.\n\n1131\n00:51:05,755 --> 00:51:07,820\n>> But if you browse down,\nyou'll see them down there.\n\n1132\n00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,670\n>> There we go\n>> The print job,\n\n1133\n00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:13,600\nthe separator pages, the language that\nthey're written in, it's really kind of\n\n1134\n00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,280\nbizarre because it's got to be written\nin a language the printer understands.\n\n1135\n00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,210\nSo, Microsoft includes one for\nPCL printers, Print Control Language, and\n\n1136\n00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:25,520\nthe post script or PS printers.\n\n1137\n00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,450\nSo, you've got two for those.\n\n1138\n00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,180\nThose are the two that I normally use.\n\n1139\n00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,660\nThey also include system print and\nthat's for like raw printing.\n\n1140\n00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,070\nAnd this last one,\nI don't really know what it is.\n\n1141\n00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:36,030\n>> I don't either.\n>> System Print J.\n\n1142\n00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:36,690\n>> System Print for J.\n\n1143\n00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,732\n>> I've never used that one.\n\n1144\n00:51:38,732 --> 00:51:40,847\nSo, I almost always use PostScript or PCL.\n\n1145\n00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,750\n>> Right.\n>> Because if you want good font\n\n1146\n00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:46,570\nrendering, you're gonna use printers that\nare either PCL printers or PostScript.\n\n1147\n00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,450\nI usually use PostScript.\n\n1148\n00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:49,780\nSo I've never really had to\nuse any of the other ones.\n\n1149\n00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:54,030\nBut they are there and if you crack\nthem open you can actually edit them.\n\n1150\n00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,180\nThey don't make a whole\nheck of a lot of sense.\n\n1151\n00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,190\nLike let's do this PCL one for example.\n\n1152\n00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,860\nSo I just set that as my cover page.\n\n1153\n00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:05,130\nAnd if I go into system 32 and\n\n1154\n00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:09,420\nI look for the separator pages,\nthere they are.\n\n1155\n00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,680\nI'll take this one.\n\n1156\n00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,202\nOf course I picked the biggest one.\n\n1157\n00:52:12,202 --> 00:52:15,124\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Oh no actually it's not, 114 bytes.\n\n1158\n00:52:15,124 --> 00:52:15,920\nThat's not bad.\n\n1159\n00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,500\nI thought it was 114 k.\n\n1160\n00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,154\nAll right,\nlet's open that up with Wordpad.\n\n1161\n00:52:24,589 --> 00:52:25,925\nThere we go.\n\n1162\n00:52:25,925 --> 00:52:26,565\nAll right.\n\n1163\n00:52:26,565 --> 00:52:29,705\nSo when we look at this,\nit doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\n\n1164\n00:52:29,705 --> 00:52:36,553\nBasically each of these characters,\nlike \\h1b, \\L%12345x.\n\n1165\n00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:39,664\nAll of those are variables.\n\n1166\n00:52:39,664 --> 00:52:40,973\n>> Right.\n>> That are controlling the information\n\n1167\n00:52:40,973 --> 00:52:41,960\nthat's gonna be displayed.\n\n1168\n00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,345\nSo like you've got job and then \\i,\n\\i is the name of the document,\n\n1169\n00:52:46,345 --> 00:52:48,700\nit's actually short for identity.\n\n1170\n00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,289\n>> Okay.\n>> And then you've got the date:\\d, so\n\n1171\n00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:52,419\nthat's the date.\n\n1172\n00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,520\nTime \\t.\n\n1173\n00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,120\nEach of those are indicating some kind of\nvariable that references something itself.\n\n1174\n00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,190\n>> So you have to decode the variables\nif you wanted to try that.\n\n1175\n00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:05,170\n>> Yeah, and Microsoft has some very light\ndocumentation on their website for that.\n\n1176\n00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:11,903\nSo if you go, separator page,\nthey've got a TechNet article on it.\n\n1177\n00:53:11,903 --> 00:53:12,531\nHere we go.\n\n1178\n00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:16,620\nAnd so they break down some of those\nvariables that are available, so\n\n1179\n00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,740\nthey talk about where it goes.\n\n1180\n00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,270\nAnd then here's a bunch of\nthe variables that are available.\n\n1181\n00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:25,360\nSo they've got D is the date, T is the\ntime, and all the different other things,\n\n1182\n00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,520\nand for the name of the person printing\nit, and so you can create your own.\n\n1183\n00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,795\nNotice these all have @?\n\n1184\n00:53:30,795 --> 00:53:33,285\nWell I believe that's in\nthe postscript document you use @.\n\n1185\n00:53:33,285 --> 00:53:36,650\n>> Okay.\n>> But in the PCL one you use slashes so\n\n1186\n00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,968\nnice and confusing.\n\n1187\n00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:39,046\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n1188\n00:53:39,046 --> 00:53:41,730\nyeah, so those are the kind\nof things that are in there.\n\n1189\n00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:45,370\nYou can build your own separator page,\nyou don't need it to be flashy,\n\n1190\n00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:47,045\njust to say whose document that is.\n\n1191\n00:53:47,045 --> 00:53:47,720\n>> Right.\nExactly, so\n\n1192\n00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,605\nthey can tell,\nthey're picking up my job, put it back.\n\n1193\n00:53:50,605 --> 00:53:52,830\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n1194\n00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,426\nI think we've covered most\nof the printing stuff.\n\n1195\n00:53:54,426 --> 00:53:56,271\n>> Okay.\n>> There is one other thing I can think\n\n1196\n00:53:56,271 --> 00:53:57,398\nof, that we left out.\n\n1197\n00:53:57,398 --> 00:53:59,040\n>> Okay.\n>> And that's Printer Redirection.\n\n1198\n00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,050\n>> That's right.\n\n1199\n00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:03,261\n>> Mike and I are both,\nare on machines, running Windows 8.\n\n1200\n00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:04,480\nAll right?\n>> Right.\n\n1201\n00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,130\n>> But we're doing a Windows 7 show.\n\n1202\n00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:07,260\nSo what have we done?\n\n1203\n00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:11,370\nWe've remote desktop into\nWindows 7 machines for the show.\n\n1204\n00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,810\nSo I'm on one, Mike's on one.\n\n1205\n00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:20,260\nWhen you remote desktop in, by default\nremote desktop will map whatever printer\n\n1206\n00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:25,270\nyou've got on your own laptop to the\nremote machine that you're connecting in.\n\n1207\n00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:29,670\nSo, when I was in my printers a moment\nago, it was right there, we could see it.\n\n1208\n00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,550\nHere's the ones that I added.\n\n1209\n00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,990\nBut notice I've got Microsoft XPS.\n\n1210\n00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,840\nI've got two of them.\n\n1211\n00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,660\nOne is the local one for\nthat Windows 7 machine.\n\n1212\n00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,890\nThe other one says Redirected One.\n\n1213\n00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:45,550\nRedirected, that's coming from\nmy remote desktop session.\n\n1214\n00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:50,750\nHere's the fax,\nCanon MG6200 redirected from my machine.\n\n1215\n00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:55,770\nSo the reason those are there is if I\nhave a printer attached to my laptop and\n\n1216\n00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:59,550\nI remote desktop into another machine,\nand I print on that other machine,\n\n1217\n00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:02,034\nI might want it to come out\nto my printer right here.\n\n1218\n00:55:02,034 --> 00:55:02,680\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\nYeah, you're at home.\n\n1219\n00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,370\nYou're remoted into a computer at work.\n\n1220\n00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:07,230\nIt's not gonna do you any good if that\nprint job spits out on the Cannon\n\n1221\n00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:07,790\nback at work.\n\n1222\n00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:08,830\nRight?\n>> Yep.\n\n1223\n00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:11,530\nAnd that works mostly\nwithout configuring it.\n\n1224\n00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:12,420\nI didn't have to configure that.\n\n1225\n00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,070\nIt just did it.\n\n1226\n00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:15,740\n>> It is the default in the remote\ndesktop connection options.\n\n1227\n00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,190\n>> The only challenge is that if you\nhave a special driver needed for\n\n1228\n00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,740\nthat printer and you're remoting to\na machine that doesn't have the driver.\n\n1229\n00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,700\nThen it won't work.\n\n1230\n00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,910\nSo we might need to use that Add Driver\nscreen we saw earlier when we went in\n\n1231\n00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:28,190\nthe Print Server properties and\nyou add the driver there.\n\n1232\n00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,455\nSo once you've got the driver to work\njust fine, but without it, it may not.\n\n1233\n00:55:31,455 --> 00:55:32,270\n>> Right.\n\n1234\n00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,810\n>> So, not really something\nyou have to configure.\n\n1235\n00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,080\nNow, if I, let me actually show you.\n\n1236\n00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,498\nI'm gonna disconnect here.\n\n1237\n00:55:37,498 --> 00:55:38,130\n>> [CROSSTALK] pulled up here.\n\n1238\n00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,205\n>> Oh you do?\n\n1239\n00:55:39,205 --> 00:55:41,023\nOkay.\nYeah,if we jump over to Mike's, so\n\n1240\n00:55:41,023 --> 00:55:42,810\nthere's the remote desktop client.\n\n1241\n00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,893\n>> I'm on that local\nresources tab there and\n\n1242\n00:55:44,893 --> 00:55:47,720\nI'm getting ready to\nremote into that computer.\n\n1243\n00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,630\nAnd by default I unchecked it to\ntest our home group thing earlier.\n\n1244\n00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:52,495\nBy default both of these are selected.\n\n1245\n00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:56,460\nAnd I'm saying I wanna bring printers\nthat are attached to the machine I'm\n\n1246\n00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,440\nsitting at.\n\n1247\n00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,310\nI wanna bring them with me on\nmy remote desktop connection.\n\n1248\n00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:02,957\nSo just like Don show you, I connect up.\n\n1249\n00:56:02,957 --> 00:56:09,575\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Put focus back on that bad boy there.\n\n1250\n00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,734\nSilly touchpads.\n\n1251\n00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:13,116\nKix are for trids.\n\n1252\n00:56:13,116 --> 00:56:15,936\nAnd if go back into Devices and Printers,\n\n1253\n00:56:15,936 --> 00:56:18,927\nthere is my [CROSSTALK]\nredirected printer.\n\n1254\n00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:20,820\n>> And there were other options in there.\n\n1255\n00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,830\nIt redirects the clipboard\nby default also.\n\n1256\n00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:24,530\nBut you can do your local hard drives.\n\n1257\n00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:25,670\n>> Yes.\n>> You can redirect those.\n\n1258\n00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:26,460\nSerial ports.\n\n1259\n00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,770\n>> USB ports.\n\n1260\n00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:28,930\n>> Oh yeah. [CROSSTALK] >> The whole nine.\n\n1261\n00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,310\nAll sorts of fancy stuff.\n\n1262\n00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,040\n>> Pretty cool.\n>> So,\n\n1263\n00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,860\nthat's kind of the last thing\nthat I've got on printers.\n\n1264\n00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:33,860\nCan you think of anything else Mike?\n\n1265\n00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,729\n>> I can't think of anything else except,\nI really don't like printers.\n\n1266\n00:56:36,729 --> 00:56:37,883\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1267\n00:56:37,883 --> 00:56:39,370\n>> I don't know, printers are one of those\n\n1268\n00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,840\nthings that it just seems like\nthey always have a problem.\n\n1269\n00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,330\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know you fix them one day and\n\n1270\n00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,695\nyou've got to fix them again the next day.\n\n1271\n00:56:44,695 --> 00:56:47,820\nFortunately save to pdf is\nkind of killing off printers.\n\n1272\n00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,310\n>> Yes, yes we're going to go green.\n\n1273\n00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:50,245\nNo more paper.\n\n1274\n00:56:50,245 --> 00:56:51,750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n1275\n00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:54,850\nwe talked about sharing\nresources between machines.\n\n1276\n00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:58,200\nWe didn't really talk about permissions\nthat we set on them, so we've got that\n\n1277\n00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,990\ncoming up, and we've got some other\nthings, we need to talk about advance\n\n1278\n00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:04,100\nsharing, so we've got some really cool\nthings coming up in the rest of the show.\n\n1279\n00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:08,460\nBut for right now, it's time we took a\nbreak, so let's stop here, and stay tuned!\n\n1280\n00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,698\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n1281\n00:57:09,698 --> 00:57:13,403\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1282\n00:57:13,403 --> 00:57:18,837\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n1283\n00:57:18,837 --> 00:57:23,000\nSo we've still got a bit more to go\nthrough as far as sharing resources and\n\n1284\n00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,027\nstuff between machines but\nwe're going to go a little bit divergent,\n\n1285\n00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:30,290\nfollowing the Microsoft\nobjectives we try and do.\n\n1286\n00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:35,070\nThe next thing they call out is EFS,\nthe Encrypting File System, and\n\n1287\n00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:38,645\nI know what they call it here, because\nwe're about to get into file permissions.\n\n1288\n00:57:38,645 --> 00:57:40,705\n>> Right.\n>> Which is important.\n\n1289\n00:57:40,705 --> 00:57:43,585\nWhen you store a file on your hard drive,\n\n1290\n00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:47,685\nregardless of what permission you set to\nit, you could secure it all day long.\n\n1291\n00:57:47,685 --> 00:57:50,505\nSomebody could rip the hard\ndrive out of your computer.\n\n1292\n00:57:50,505 --> 00:57:52,940\n>> Right.\nStick it as a second hard drive in their\n\n1293\n00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,670\ncomputer and access your files.\n\n1294\n00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,390\nIt doesn't matter what\npermissions you set on it.\n\n1295\n00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,070\nThey can get around it.\n\n1296\n00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:02,360\nSo Microsoft gives us a tool called EFS,\nthe Encrypting File System, and\n\n1297\n00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:07,180\nit allows us to encrypt individual files\nand folders on our hard drive to ensure\n\n1298\n00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:10,130\nthat that scenario I just\nsaid isn't going to happen.\n\n1299\n00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:10,690\n>> Exactly.\n\n1300\n00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:11,290\n>> Somebody.\n\n1301\n00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:11,790\nGo ahead.\n\n1302\n00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:15,090\n>> It's another layer of security because\nwe know we can control most of the access\n\n1303\n00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:18,490\nwith NTFS, but it's another layer to\nprotect against what Don was saying.\n\n1304\n00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:22,560\nAlso, if you give me read permissions\nover a file, I can't write to it, but\n\n1305\n00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,740\nI can surely copy that file and\nsave that as a new file and\n\n1306\n00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,130\nthen I can make changes to it.\n\n1307\n00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,490\nIf it was encrypted,\nthat could not be done.\n\n1308\n00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:31,120\n>> Yep.\nAnd\n\n1309\n00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,715\nyou know I'm glad you mentioned NTFS mike.\n\n1310\n00:58:32,715 --> 00:58:33,460\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1311\n00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:38,410\n>> EFS, the Encrypting File System\nis actually an extension of NTFS.\n\n1312\n00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:41,551\n>> When you format a hard\ndrive in Windows 7,\n\n1313\n00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:46,364\nyou've got two choices,\nyou can format it as FAT32 or as NTFS.\n\n1314\n00:58:46,364 --> 00:58:49,550\nNow NTFS, that stands for\nthe New Technology File System.\n\n1315\n00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:54,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Windows NT or NT4, when it came out,\n\n1316\n00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:57,920\nor actually it was NT3 when\nit got that name originally.\n\n1317\n00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,040\nBack then it was new technology\nas an alternative to Windows 3.1,\n\n1318\n00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,260\nyou know the really old Windows.\n\n1319\n00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:06,580\nSo it's not so new anymore,\nbut the NT file system,\n\n1320\n00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:10,865\nor NTFS,\nwas designed as a successor to FAT32.\n\n1321\n00:59:10,865 --> 00:59:17,000\nFAT32 was the file allocation cable,\n32 bits and that's the older style.\n\n1322\n00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,520\nNow with FAT32, it's a perfectly good\nfile system, got some limitations.\n\n1323\n00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,550\n>> Size wise.\n\n1324\n00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,610\n>> Oh, yeah,\nsize is probably the biggest one.\n\n1325\n00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:28,270\nThe biggest file you can store\non a FAT32 drive is 2 gigabytes.\n\n1326\n00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:32,176\nIf you have a file bigger than 2\ngigabytes you can not store it on a FAT32\n\n1327\n00:59:32,176 --> 00:59:33,750\nformatted drive.\n\n1328\n00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:37,400\nYou also have no encryption and\nno file permissions.\n\n1329\n00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,240\nYou can't.\n\n1330\n00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,700\n>> You had those general attributes.\n\n1331\n00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,600\nYou had read only and hidden.\n\n1332\n00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,700\nI think something like that.\n\n1333\n00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,100\nAnd there was about all you got.\n\n1334\n00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,230\n>> Yeah not too much there.\n\n1335\n00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:46,740\nSo NTFS gave us much more.\n\n1336\n00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:50,220\nIt gave us the ability to have files\nthat can be considerably larger, right?\n\n1337\n00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,020\nIt's petabytes or exabytes in size.\n\n1338\n00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,830\n>> Yeah. Way up there.\n>> Some of those ridiculous\n\n1339\n00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:55,360\n>> So I was looking at some number that\n\n1340\n00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,120\nnext year will be like, oh I've only got\none exabyte free on my stupid hard drive.\n\n1341\n00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,460\nBut for now it's an insane amount of data.\n\n1342\n01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,630\nSo it does that,\nit also give us file permissions and\n\n1343\n01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:07,570\nencryption and file compression.\n\n1344\n01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:08,920\nRight?\nWhich I don't think they even call it on\n\n1345\n01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,150\nthe objectives anymore.\n\n1346\n01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:11,880\nBut a lot of cool stuff.\n\n1347\n01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,770\nThat's a part of the file system.\n\n1348\n01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:18,360\nSo the majority of the time,\nwe want to format our drive NTFS.\n\n1349\n01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,520\nIn fact, when wouldn't we want to do NTFS?\n\n1350\n01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,530\n>> Maybe, I don't know.\n\n1351\n01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:24,530\nI can't think of any reason, really.\n\n1352\n01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:27,745\n>> Cross compatibility's really\nthe only thing I can think of.\n\n1353\n01:00:27,745 --> 01:00:32,380\nFAT32 is an open standard, so\nLinux supports it, OSX supports it.\n\n1354\n01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,950\nBut NTFS, that's Microsoft only.\n\n1355\n01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:38,630\nSo like Apple machines can only read NTFS,\nthey can't write, and\n\n1356\n01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:42,160\nsame thing with most Linux distributions,\nthey can read it but not write it.\n\n1357\n01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,720\nSo if you need cross\ncompatibility NTFS not so great.\n\n1358\n01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:50,030\nBut most people don't and so NTFS is\nthat kind of perfect option for us.\n\n1359\n01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:54,270\nAlso, if you have a really small drive,\nthe NTFS table is pretty big.\n\n1360\n01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:54,780\n>> Right.\n\n1361\n01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,030\n>> Like it's bigger than a floppy disk.\n\n1362\n01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:00,370\nHopefully you're not dealing\nwith floppy disks anymore.\n\n1363\n01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:01,030\n>> And another thing we\n\n1364\n01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:03,850\nshould point out while we're talking about\nthis as Don mentioned, it is a property or\n\n1365\n01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:06,560\nextension of NTFS so\nsomething you have to keep in mind.\n\n1366\n01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,786\nYou can encrypt the file\non an NTFS partition one,\n\n1367\n01:01:08,786 --> 01:01:11,490\nit's only encrpytive while\nit's on the file system right?\n\n1368\n01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:15,130\nIf you transfer that encryptive\nfile from that server down to your\n\n1369\n01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,320\nlaptop for example.\n\n1370\n01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,350\nIt's not encryptive while it's\ntraveling across a network.\n\n1371\n01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:20,590\nIt's while it's on the NTFS partition.\n\n1372\n01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:24,260\nIf you try to copy it to a Thumbdrive\nthat's FAT32 or if you try to email it\n\n1373\n01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:28,660\nto somebody, burn it to a DVD, it has\nto remove that encryption to do that,\n\n1374\n01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,870\nbecause it's not NTFS so\nit's not as important.\n\n1375\n01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:34,060\n>> So Mike why don't you\nshow us encrypting a file?\n\n1376\n01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,990\n>> Let's do it.\n>> Show us the magic of file encryption.\n\n1377\n01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:36,580\nAll right, so\n\n1378\n01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:40,890\nI'm just going to come here to my\ndesktop and create a new text document.\n\n1379\n01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:41,840\nPretty straight forward.\n\n1380\n01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,470\nI'm going to go into my Properties and\non my General tab,\n\n1381\n01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:48,400\nI have my standard attributes down here,\nread only and hidden.\n\n1382\n01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,930\nI go to my Advanced attributes, this is\nwhere you're going to see the ability to\n\n1383\n01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:55,960\ncompress the contents to to encrypt\nthe contents to secure the data.\n\n1384\n01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,280\nYou know choose, to encrypt the contents,\nand then it's going to prompt me,\n\n1385\n01:01:59,280 --> 01:01:59,830\nwhen I click OK.\n\n1386\n01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:01,880\nWell actually since it's on my desktop,\nit might not.\n\n1387\n01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:02,398\n>> It's just one.\n\n1388\n01:02:02,398 --> 01:02:07,210\nIt still does, so I can choose to\neither encrypt the file and the folder,\n\n1389\n01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:08,300\nthat contains the file.\n\n1390\n01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,828\nIn this case, that would be my desktop,\nnot a good idea.\n\n1391\n01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:13,500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> encrypt just the file.\n\n1392\n01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,419\nAnd I'm going to do just the file for\nthis one, but\n\n1393\n01:02:15,419 --> 01:02:16,850\nI'm going to show you one more time.\n\n1394\n01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:19,180\nThere's one more thing\nI do want to point out.\n\n1395\n01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:21,720\nSo let me come into Windows Explorer and\njust do the same thing, make a new file.\n\n1396\n01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:27,293\nLet's make a new folder and\ninside there we'll make a new file.\n\n1397\n01:02:30,229 --> 01:02:31,358\nAnd I'm going to do the same thing.\n\n1398\n01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:37,380\nRight-click Properties, Advanced,\nEncrypt the contents, then click OK.\n\n1399\n01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,690\nAnd I'll do both this time.\n\n1400\n01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:44,060\nAnd I wanted to point out that\nthat file is going to turn green,\n\n1401\n01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,290\nthat name of the file.\n\n1402\n01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:48,950\nThat is a way that I can quickly\nsee that that guy is encrypted.\n\n1403\n01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:53,410\nNow blue, if I had chosen to compress\nthe file, green if I chose to encrypt.\n\n1404\n01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:56,530\nAlso those two attributes\nare mutually exclusive.\n\n1405\n01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:58,400\nYou cannot compress and encrypted file.\n\n1406\n01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,680\nYou cannot encrypt a compressed file.\n\n1407\n01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,320\nSomething to keep in mind there.\n\n1408\n01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,340\n>> Now because Mike chose\nto encrypt the folder also,\n\n1409\n01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,350\nif he creates a new file in there.\n\n1410\n01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,700\nWell the folder shows is green so\nwe recognize that, but\n\n1411\n01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:13,840\nif you create a new file in there,\nwhatever type, it will automatically\n\n1412\n01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:17,610\nencrypt that file too because\nthe folder itself is encrypted.\n\n1413\n01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:19,400\nSo that's kind of a nice thing.\n\n1414\n01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,960\nIf somebody were to rip this\nhard drive out and try and\n\n1415\n01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,260\nget to these files right here,\nthey wouldn't be able to get there.\n\n1416\n01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:29,011\nAnd too keep in mind that the folder, it's\nencrypted, as Don says but it's kind of\n\n1417\n01:03:29,011 --> 01:03:32,885\nmarked as encrypted, it's a container so\nit's not like it has anything to encrypt.\n\n1418\n01:03:32,885 --> 01:03:37,817\nSo if I encrypt the folder, let's say I go\nto a network share and I encrypt a folder,\n\n1419\n01:03:37,817 --> 01:03:42,557\nif Don then creates a file inside the\nfolder, it is encrypted with Don's keys.\n\n1420\n01:03:42,557 --> 01:03:44,480\nAnd Don's going to be the one\nto be able to access it.\n\n1421\n01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,020\nJust because I encrypted the folder\ndoesn't mean I have access to\n\n1422\n01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,310\nall of the documents inside there.\n\n1423\n01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:51,990\nSo it's still based on whoever\nactually does the encryption.\n\n1424\n01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:54,520\nEncryption is transparent to the end user.\n\n1425\n01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,560\nIt's transparent to the applications.\n\n1426\n01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,985\nSo you can see see I double-clicked on\nthe file and it opens up just fine.\n\n1427\n01:03:59,985 --> 01:04:02,045\nI can type in here whatever I want.\n\n1428\n01:04:04,675 --> 01:04:05,575\nOops, I missed my r.\n\n1429\n01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:06,987\nOn my little joke there.\n\n1430\n01:04:06,987 --> 01:04:10,257\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can save it and close it.\n\n1431\n01:04:10,257 --> 01:04:14,210\nAnd because what's happening,\nNTFS is going to decrypt that file and\n\n1432\n01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:16,363\nthen hand it over to the application.\n\n1433\n01:04:16,363 --> 01:04:20,410\nSo the application receives it in\nan unencrypted format Notepad has no idea\n\n1434\n01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:21,705\nthe file is encrypted.\n\n1435\n01:04:21,705 --> 01:04:27,150\nI type in there, I save it, I close it,\nand Notepad hands it back to NTFS.\n\n1436\n01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:30,430\nNTFS then encrypts the file again and\nstores it on the hard drive.\n\n1437\n01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:34,220\nSo transparent to the end user,\nassuming you're the authorized user.\n\n1438\n01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,840\nAnd it's transparent to\nthe applications as well.\n\n1439\n01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,170\n>> So pretty straightforward,\npretty easy to use.\n\n1440\n01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:41,730\nIf somebody ripped this hard drive out and\n\n1441\n01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:44,610\nstuck it in their own computer,\nthey wouldn't be able get to these files.\n\n1442\n01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:46,240\nSo we're pretty cool there.\n\n1443\n01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,350\nAnd it's nice and secure.\n\n1444\n01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:52,690\nNow in a later episode we're gonna talk\nabout BitLocker, another neat technology\n\n1445\n01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:57,240\nin Windows 7 that allows you to\nencrypt the entire hard drive.\n\n1446\n01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,900\nPros and cons with doing that.\n\n1447\n01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,390\nThe nice thing about EFS is you pick and\nchoose, so\n\n1448\n01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:07,440\nno sense encrypting things like your page\nfile, you're not that worried about that.\n\n1449\n01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,460\n>> It's true and EFS is protecting\nmy files while they're online.\n\n1450\n01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:14,440\nMy computer's tuned on and\nsomebody can get to those files and\n\n1451\n01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,000\ntry to double-click on them,\nEFS is gonna protect me.\n\n1452\n01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,490\nBitLocker is really protecting\nmy files when it's offline.\n\n1453\n01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:21,680\nWhen you turn that computer on,\n\n1454\n01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:25,000\nif it's in the right machine,\nit decrypts that entire volume.\n\n1455\n01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,920\nIf you turn it off and\n\n1456\n01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,200\nsteal that hard drive then it encrypts\nthe entire volume for when you power down.\n\n1457\n01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,440\nSo it's really protecting your\ndata at a different state.\n\n1458\n01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,196\nIt's protecting it when\nthat machine is offline.\n\n1459\n01:05:35,196 --> 01:05:39,430\n>> Yeah, now somebody could still\nsteal your entire computer.\n\n1460\n01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:42,010\nAnd if they have your user name and\npassword that's how they gain\n\n1461\n01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:45,510\naccess to that key and the encrypted\nfile so you do have to be aware of that.\n\n1462\n01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:46,450\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1463\n01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:51,140\n>> All right, so we mention the EFS\nhere because it is an extension of NTFS.\n\n1464\n01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:55,540\nWell, the biggest part of NTFS,\nat least in my opinion\n\n1465\n01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:58,360\nis another extension which\nis simply file permissions.\n\n1466\n01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,460\nThat we can assign permissions\non the NTFS, on any file or\n\n1467\n01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:07,970\nfolder stored in NTFS, to dictate\nwho is allowed to have access to it.\n\n1468\n01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,430\nNow we've been running pretty\nmuch all defaults this show.\n\n1469\n01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:13,220\nEvery time we created a folder\nit just has default permission.\n\n1470\n01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,190\nBut we can fully manipulate\nthat however we want.\n\n1471\n01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:18,530\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n1472\n01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:20,240\nWe'll just use your folders you made,\nMike.\n\n1473\n01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,740\n>> Sounds like a plan.\n\n1474\n01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,190\nSo let's see, if we go in here,\nlet's start with a folder.\n\n1475\n01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:25,140\nI'm just gonna make another one.\n\n1476\n01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:26,840\nI think I deleted that guy.\n\n1477\n01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:31,070\nAnd I'll call it our ItProTV folder.\n\n1478\n01:06:33,695 --> 01:06:36,994\nAnd I'm gonna pull up\nthe properties of this guy and\n\n1479\n01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:39,020\ntake a look at my security tab.\n\n1480\n01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:43,110\nSo my security tab is basically, we talk\nabout discretionary access control this or\n\n1481\n01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:44,370\nDACL systems.\n\n1482\n01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:46,340\nThis is my discretionary\naccess control list.\n\n1483\n01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:48,460\nThis entire tab is the list.\n\n1484\n01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:50,390\nAnd then each one of these lines, Mike,\n\n1485\n01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:54,630\nAdministrator System, is known as\nan ACE or an Access Control Entry.\n\n1486\n01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:57,660\nAnd if I want to give somebody\npermissions over this object,\n\n1487\n01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:00,470\nthey have to have an ACE, or\nan Access Control Entry, to get that.\n\n1488\n01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:05,840\nWindows works on an implicit deny, so\nif you're not on the list, either you or\n\n1489\n01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:09,770\na group you belong to is not on the list,\nyou don't get access to the resource.\n\n1490\n01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:12,770\nI can come in here and I can say,\nif I want to assign permissions.\n\n1491\n01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:16,810\nI would click, Edit and\nthen, I'll click Add.\n\n1492\n01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:20,760\nAnd again, I don't know what groups we've\ngot on our little test network here, so\n\n1493\n01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,730\nI'm just going to find\nthe backup operators.\n\n1494\n01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:25,720\nWe don't have an instructors group or\nanything, do we?\n\n1495\n01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:27,835\nNope.\n\n1496\n01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:31,236\nSo I'll use the back up operators and\nI'll click OK.\n\n1497\n01:07:31,236 --> 01:07:34,667\nAnd then once I've added an ACE for\nthe back up operators,\n\n1498\n01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:38,875\nI can now control what permissions\nthey have over this resource.\n\n1499\n01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:41,590\nSo if I wanna give them say,\nmodified permissions.\n\n1500\n01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,028\nI select that, I click OK.\n\n1501\n01:07:44,028 --> 01:07:45,486\nAnd I click OK.\n\n1502\n01:07:45,486 --> 01:07:46,980\nAnd I've applied that change.\n\n1503\n01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:52,140\nNow what we just did was known\nas an explicit permission.\n\n1504\n01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:57,020\nI explicitly assigned the backup\noperators permissions over this folder.\n\n1505\n01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:01,403\nOne of the cool things about NTFS is\nthe fact that these permission's inherent.\n\n1506\n01:08:01,403 --> 01:08:04,050\nAnd when you assign\npermissions to a parent object,\n\n1507\n01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:07,240\nthey'll inherit down to all\nthe objects inside there.\n\n1508\n01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,520\nAnd it makes it much easier for\nus as administrators.\n\n1509\n01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:14,480\nIf I've got a lot of resources that people\nneed access to, if I've got them all in\n\n1510\n01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,520\na single folder, I don't have to go to\neach resource and assign the permissions.\n\n1511\n01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,560\nI can assign at that top level, and\n\n1512\n01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,840\nlet that inherit down to\nthe objects inside there.\n\n1513\n01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:28,528\nFor example, if I go into this ITProTV\nfolder and I make a new document.\n\n1514\n01:08:31,278 --> 01:08:34,414\nAnd I'll just call it Show List, and\n\n1515\n01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:38,570\nI take a look at the properties\nof this document.\n\n1516\n01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:45,260\nI'm gonna see that the backup\noperators are listed there.\n\n1517\n01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:47,070\nAnd you guys just saw\nme make the document.\n\n1518\n01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:49,480\nI haven't added them explicitly to this.\n\n1519\n01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:54,660\nSo this permission is actually\ninheriting down from the parent object.\n\n1520\n01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:58,960\nAnd you can tell, if I put these guys side\nby side and choose my backup operators,\n\n1521\n01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,130\nyou might notice a subtle difference\nthere between those checkmarks.\n\n1522\n01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:05,010\nWe've got it on the left,\nI've got the permissions of the folder,\n\n1523\n01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:08,870\nwhich is where I explicitly assigned\nthe permissions to the backup operators.\n\n1524\n01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:09,720\nOn the right,\n\n1525\n01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:13,420\nI've got the file within the folder,\nwhere it inherited the permissions.\n\n1526\n01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,670\nAnd you'll see that\nthe check marks are gray.\n\n1527\n01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:18,390\nAnd that's my indication that those\npermissions are actually being\n\n1528\n01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:20,830\ninherited down from that parent object.\n\n1529\n01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:24,280\nSo it makes it a lot easier for us,\ncuz I can assign the permissions once and\n\n1530\n01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:29,150\nlet those permissions inherit down\nto all the objects inside there.\n\n1531\n01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:31,710\n>> And when you've got inherited\npermissions like this,\n\n1532\n01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,570\nyou can actually add to it.\n\n1533\n01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:35,420\nSo on that Show List,\n\n1534\n01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,270\nMike could add people to it if he wanted,\n>> Correct.\n\n1535\n01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:41,530\n>> But you can't change or\ntake away what you've inherited.\n\n1536\n01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:45,650\nSo those gray check marks, think of\nthose as like, do not change these,\n\n1537\n01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:47,030\nit's basically permanent.\n\n1538\n01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:48,360\nBut if you add to it.\n\n1539\n01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:51,420\nSo, backup operators,\nthey don't have full control, but\n\n1540\n01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,030\nlet's say you wanted to add that in there.\n\n1541\n01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:56,450\nSo we'll give backup\noperators full control.\n\n1542\n01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:00,111\nAnd notice those other check marks\nare kinda grayed out and you hit OK.\n\n1543\n01:10:00,111 --> 01:10:03,249\nAnd now Full Control has\na nice bold black check mark,\n\n1544\n01:10:03,249 --> 01:10:05,920\nbut all the other ones\nhave grey check marks.\n\n1545\n01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,210\nSo now it's a mixture of inherited\nversus explicitly assigned.\n\n1546\n01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,730\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n1547\n01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:14,290\nAnd what you really,\nas Don pointed out, you can't change,\n\n1548\n01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:16,830\nlike you notice when I come in here and\nclick Edit, and\n\n1549\n01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:21,110\ngo to my backup operators, I can't\nchange these inherited permissions.\n\n1550\n01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:23,750\nI can change the one I\nassigned to it explicitly, but\n\n1551\n01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,070\nI can't change them directly.\n\n1552\n01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:28,840\nThere's really three ways I can end up\nchanging, if I can remember all three.\n\n1553\n01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,350\nThere are three ways you can end\nup changing inherited permissions.\n\n1554\n01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:34,590\nOne, I could go to the parent object,\nright?\n\n1555\n01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:37,070\nIf I change the permissions\nof the parent object,\n\n1556\n01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:40,490\nthat's gonna change what inherits\ndown to the child object.\n\n1557\n01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:43,950\nSecond way is I could assign\nthe opposite permission.\n\n1558\n01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:47,360\nBackup operator's inherited,\nread and write and modify.\n\n1559\n01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,810\nWhat if I wanted to read this\ndocument document, but not modify it.\n\n1560\n01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:53,037\nI can actually assign\nthe opposite permission here,\n\n1561\n01:10:53,037 --> 01:10:56,070\nalthough that would take away all\nof their permissions, wouldn't it?\n\n1562\n01:10:56,070 --> 01:11:00,090\nMaybe I just want to take away\ntheir write permission there.\n\n1563\n01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:03,325\nSo now they can still read it, but I'm\ngoing to deny their write permissions, so\n\n1564\n01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:04,430\nthey wouldn't be able to.\n\n1565\n01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:07,220\nSo the second way is to assign\nthe opposite permission.\n\n1566\n01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,200\nAnd let's not deny him for right now.\n\n1567\n01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,460\nThe third way is to block inheritance.\n\n1568\n01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:18,260\nI can say all right, on this particular\ndocument, there can be several documents\n\n1569\n01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:21,790\nin there, but on this document I don't\nwant those permissions to inherit down.\n\n1570\n01:11:21,790 --> 01:11:26,930\nIn order to do that we would go to\nthe Advance tab, or the Advanced Security.\n\n1571\n01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:31,170\nAnd then I'm gonna edit this guy\nby clicking Change Permissions.\n\n1572\n01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:34,910\nAnd then I can clear the check mark for\nInclude Inheritable Permissions, and\n\n1573\n01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:35,640\nthat's the default.\n\n1574\n01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,590\nThat's the way NTFS works.\n\n1575\n01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:40,290\nWhen I uncheck that, I get two options.\n\n1576\n01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:41,960\nI can either choose to Add,\n\n1577\n01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:45,961\nand what that's gonna do\nbecause if we think about it,\n\n1578\n01:11:45,961 --> 01:11:51,620\nas soon as I made this file it inherited\nthe permissions from the parent object.\n\n1579\n01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:54,125\nSo, it's already inherited\nthe permissions,\n\n1580\n01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:55,903\nnow I'm deciding to change that.\n\n1581\n01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,006\nWhat does it want me to do,\n\n1582\n01:11:57,006 --> 01:12:00,690\nwhat does it want to do with the\npermissions that it's already inherited?\n\n1583\n01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:02,494\nSo, when I click Change and I clear that,\n\n1584\n01:12:02,494 --> 01:12:05,746\nit says do you want me to take those\npermissions I've already inherited and\n\n1585\n01:12:05,746 --> 01:12:08,710\nconvert them into explicit permissions so\nnow you can change them.\n\n1586\n01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:11,714\nOr do you want me to remove\nall inherited permissions,\n\n1587\n01:12:11,714 --> 01:12:15,977\nbasically start with a clean slate and\nassign just the permissions you want.\n\n1588\n01:12:15,977 --> 01:12:18,321\nIn my case I'm gonna click, add.\n\n1589\n01:12:18,321 --> 01:12:21,161\nSo now you'll see those same\npermissions are still listed there, but\n\n1590\n01:12:21,161 --> 01:12:24,090\nthey're no longer being inherited\nfrom the parent object.\n\n1591\n01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:28,650\nSo when I go back over here to my access\ncontrol list, you'll see they're black and\n\n1592\n01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:33,280\nif I click, edit, I can now change\nWhat permissions they have,\n\n1593\n01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,440\nwithout trying to assign\nthe opposite permission.\n\n1594\n01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:39,310\nSo three ways I can change inherited\npermissions, change them at\n\n1595\n01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:43,510\nthe parent object, assign the opposite\npermission, or remove inheritance.\n\n1596\n01:12:44,662 --> 01:12:47,710\n>> And just when Mike mentioned\nassigning the opposite permission,\n\n1597\n01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:53,210\nhe's using that deny option and the deny's\nin Windows are very, very powerful.\n\n1598\n01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:58,010\nDenies will override any other type\nof access that you might have,\n\n1599\n01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:01,000\nbecause a user might get access\nthrough more than one means.\n\n1600\n01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,340\nThey might have it directly\nassigned to their user account, or\n\n1601\n01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:05,725\nthey might get it through their\nmembership in another group.\n\n1602\n01:13:05,725 --> 01:13:06,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1603\n01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:07,450\n>> And so using that deny,\n\n1604\n01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:10,930\nthat ensures that no matter what,\nthey're not gonna have that access.\n\n1605\n01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:12,280\nIt's a very powerful thing.\n\n1606\n01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,985\nThat's why Mike got that warning message.\n\n1607\n01:13:13,985 --> 01:13:15,512\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And I know we cleared it cuz\n\n1608\n01:13:15,512 --> 01:13:19,337\nwe didn't save it [CROSSTALK] but\nwhen you go to apply it, it warns you.\n\n1609\n01:13:19,337 --> 01:13:21,589\nIt says, hey, you're setting a deny.\n\n1610\n01:13:21,589 --> 01:13:22,913\nYou need to be careful with this.\n\n1611\n01:13:22,913 --> 01:13:24,051\nNot that it's gonna break things.\n\n1612\n01:13:24,051 --> 01:13:24,681\n>> Yeah.\n>> But\n\n1613\n01:13:24,681 --> 01:13:27,162\nthat it's easy to forget that you did it.\n\n1614\n01:13:27,162 --> 01:13:28,849\n>> Yes.\n>> And then you've gotta track it down,\n\n1615\n01:13:28,849 --> 01:13:30,837\nand find it, and change it,\nit's gonna be a hassle.\n\n1616\n01:13:30,837 --> 01:13:33,484\n>> You're in that groove, everybody\nelse in that groove has access to it.\n\n1617\n01:13:33,484 --> 01:13:35,335\nWhy are you not getting access to it?\n\n1618\n01:13:35,335 --> 01:13:37,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because some admin had denied that\n\n1619\n01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:38,860\naccount somewhere along the way.\n\n1620\n01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:43,740\nIt's a nightmare, to troubleshoot in\norder to track that down sometimes.\n\n1621\n01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,750\nSo use them when you need to if you need\nto make sure that they never gain access,\n\n1622\n01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:49,630\nbecause remember what we just said,\nWindows works on an implicit deny.\n\n1623\n01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:52,030\nIf I don't want you to have\naccess to the resource,\n\n1624\n01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:55,190\nI just make sure your not in the list,\nand you're not gonna get access.\n\n1625\n01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:57,519\nBut you could pick up access, as Don said,\n\n1626\n01:13:57,519 --> 01:14:01,285\nlater by some other admin adding you\nto a group that does have access.\n\n1627\n01:14:01,285 --> 01:14:04,363\nSo, if I want to ensure you never\nget access no matter what happens,\n\n1628\n01:14:04,363 --> 01:14:05,767\nthat's when we use that deny.\n\n1629\n01:14:05,767 --> 01:14:06,324\n>> Yep.\n\n1630\n01:14:06,324 --> 01:14:06,997\nAbsolutely.\n\n1631\n01:14:06,997 --> 01:14:09,830\nSo definitely something that\nwe need to keep in mind.\n\n1632\n01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:12,955\nNow these permissions right here,\nthese NTFS permissions.\n\n1633\n01:14:12,955 --> 01:14:16,510\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> These always apply to people accessing\n\n1634\n01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:20,140\nyour files, whether they're sitting\ndown in front of your computer or\n\n1635\n01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:22,360\nwhether they're coming\nin over the network.\n\n1636\n01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,490\nNTFS permissions always apply.\n\n1637\n01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,240\n>> Right.\n>> We do have a second set of\n\n1638\n01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,870\npermissions though called\nshare permissions.\n\n1639\n01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:29,510\n>> You know what?\n\n1640\n01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:30,830\nI know you were getting ready to shares.\n\n1641\n01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:35,600\nI forgot to show them the,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n1642\n01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,580\n>> Must have been profound.\n\n1643\n01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:39,520\n>> Yeah, it must have been.\n\n1644\n01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,180\nI can show you here.\n\n1645\n01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:40,910\nLet me.\n>> There's the new.\n\n1646\n01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:41,510\n>> The new permissions.\n\n1647\n01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:42,730\nThere we go.\n\n1648\n01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:45,620\nBecause before we get into shares because\nthey're not included in effective\n\n1649\n01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:46,170\npermissions.\n\n1650\n01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:46,740\n>> Okay.\n\n1651\n01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,640\n>> We should show that real quick.\n\n1652\n01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,810\n>> I'll allow it.\nWe have time.\n\n1653\n01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:51,440\n>> Just to throw us\ncompletely off track there.\n\n1654\n01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,570\nWith effective permissions\nsometimes if we follow our best.\n\n1655\n01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:55,460\nPractices.\n\n1656\n01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:58,980\nWe're really not supposed to be assigning\npermissions directly to user accounts.\n\n1657\n01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:00,950\nWe should be assigning them to groups.\n\n1658\n01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:03,640\nAnd we talk about that in our other shows,\n\n1659\n01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:08,030\nbut it makes management of\npermissions a whole lot easier.\n\n1660\n01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:09,430\nSo sometimes when I go in here and\n\n1661\n01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:12,940\nlook at this access control list,\nI don't see users, I see groups.\n\n1662\n01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:16,450\nAnd I might not be familiar with\nwhat groups a particular user is in.\n\n1663\n01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:20,965\nLike, I don't know, if I look at this list\nright now, it does not look like Nate, for\n\n1664\n01:15:20,965 --> 01:15:23,300\nexample,has any permissions\nover this document.\n\n1665\n01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:30,950\nSo, if I go to my advanced button, and\nthen I go to effective permissions,\n\n1666\n01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:34,460\nI can throw in the name of a user or\na group, and I'll find Nate.\n\n1667\n01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:36,040\nI think Nate has\nan account on this system.\n\n1668\n01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:38,230\n>> He should.\n\n1669\n01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:38,760\nHe made it.\n\n1670\n01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,320\n>> Maybe not.\n\n1671\n01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,860\nDid he not make one for himself?\n\n1672\n01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:44,900\nAll right, Don wasn't in that list either,\nand I'm pretty sure Don has an account.\n\n1673\n01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:47,475\nSo there I found Don, and I'll click okay.\n\n1674\n01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:53,620\nAnd lo and behold,\nDonna has full control over this object.\n\n1675\n01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:55,960\nI can see all those\npermissions are selected.\n\n1676\n01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:58,340\nIf I go back and\n\n1677\n01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:02,040\nlook at that access control list though,\nDon is no where in this list.\n\n1678\n01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,510\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> And that's because Don happens to be\n\n1679\n01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:07,400\na member of that administrators' group.\n\n1680\n01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,190\nAnd I might not have been aware of that.\n\n1681\n01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:13,440\nSo that effective permission, usually\nwhen we're troubleshooting permissions,\n\n1682\n01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,930\nI'm not as worried about the fact\nthat you got read from this group,\n\n1683\n01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:19,160\nright from that group, etc, etc.\n\n1684\n01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,390\nI just want to know in the end,\n\n1685\n01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:22,519\nwhat permission does Don\nhave over this resource?\n\n1686\n01:16:22,519 --> 01:16:24,983\nSo if I use that effective\npermissions tab,\n\n1687\n01:16:24,983 --> 01:16:29,581\nWindows will go through all that tedious\nwork of looking at what groups Don belongs\n\n1688\n01:16:29,581 --> 01:16:33,510\nto, seeing what permissions those\ngroups have, adding them all up,\n\n1689\n01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:37,797\ntaking any denies into consideration\nthat might be overriding the allows.\n\n1690\n01:16:37,797 --> 01:16:40,978\nWindows does it all for me and then it\njust shows me that effective permission.\n\n1691\n01:16:40,978 --> 01:16:44,995\nSo, if you're ever troubleshooting\npermissions and you need to know what\n\n1692\n01:16:44,995 --> 01:16:48,900\na particular user has, use that\npermission tab, it makes it real easy.\n\n1693\n01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:53,220\nIt does not include share permissions\nwhich is where we're heading next.\n\n1694\n01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,120\n>> Mm-hm.\nAll right.\n\n1695\n01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,820\nSo figuring out how those\npermissions intermingle.\n\n1696\n01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,020\nThat's where I was headed.\n\n1697\n01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,985\nThat's what spawned Mike's memory there.\n\n1698\n01:17:00,985 --> 01:17:01,960\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1699\n01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,970\nTracking down denies, stuff like that,\ncan be really a hassle.\n\n1700\n01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:08,190\nWell, when you're dealing with somebody\nsitting right at your machine,\n\n1701\n01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,080\nthere's just one set of\npermissions that you go to.\n\n1702\n01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,220\n>> Right\n>> The NTS permissions for\n\n1703\n01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:12,910\nthat object\n>> That'll show you whether or\n\n1704\n01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:14,330\nnot they can get access.\n\n1705\n01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:18,940\nBut if they're coming in over the network,\nthere are two sets of permissions.\n\n1706\n01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:24,300\nThere's the NTFS permissions you just saw,\nand the share level permissions.\n\n1707\n01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:28,710\nWhen we create something on our hard\ndrive and we set it up, it's getting NTFS\n\n1708\n01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:32,720\npermissions automatically, inheriting them\nand all of that, when we share them out,\n\n1709\n01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:36,220\nwe have the opportunity to add\nadditional permissions, right?\n\n1710\n01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,700\n>> Right.\n>> And let me show you what I mean.\n\n1711\n01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,910\nI've created a little file on my\nhard drive here called test one.\n\n1712\n01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:43,850\nIt's just a folder and\nif I share that out,\n\n1713\n01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:46,600\nwell actually before I do that let\nme just pull up its properties.\n\n1714\n01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,520\n>> And we can see under security,\nhere's the NTFS permissions, and\n\n1715\n01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,790\nthese are just the defaults,\nauthenticated users can pretty much\n\n1716\n01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:56,350\ndo what ever they want, administrators\nhave full control and so on.\n\n1717\n01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:58,430\nNow if I share that out, whoops.\n\n1718\n01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:03,330\nI don't know if I can click on it here.\n\n1719\n01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:05,680\nWe can do share with particular people or\nwhatever.\n\n1720\n01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:09,960\nI want to do the advanced sharing though,\nso I'm gonna go to the sharing tab and\n\n1721\n01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,320\nadvanced sharing.\n\n1722\n01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:15,800\nWhen we share a folder out on the network\nfor people to get to it, you'll see this\n\n1723\n01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:20,620\npermissions button right here and\nwe can set a different set of permissions.\n\n1724\n01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:23,851\nAll right, so\nwhen somebody comes in over the network,\n\n1725\n01:18:23,851 --> 01:18:28,970\nnot only do they have NTFS but they also\nhave these share permissions right here.\n\n1726\n01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:35,030\nAnd what they end up with is a mixture of\nthe two and it gets very, very confusing.\n\n1727\n01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:37,090\nAt the NTFS level,\n\n1728\n01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:40,610\nyou may have permissions directly assigned\nto your account, and you might have\n\n1729\n01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:44,210\npermissions from group memberships like\nMike showed with my account a moment ago.\n\n1730\n01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:48,780\nWell what it does is Windows looks at\nthose, and it figures out which one\n\n1731\n01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:52,330\ngives you the best possible access and\nit awards that to you, so.\n\n1732\n01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:54,730\n>> The cumulative,\nyou get to add them all up.\n\n1733\n01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:58,780\n>> So you get the best of both,\nof everything that's available within TFS.\n\n1734\n01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:00,230\nWell share is the same way.\n\n1735\n01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:05,830\nSo here like everyone has read, I might\nadd administrators If I can spell it.\n\n1736\n01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:08,860\nIt had administrators in here and\ngive them full control.\n\n1737\n01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:11,460\nWell, I'm apart of everyone.\n\n1738\n01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,210\nI'm also apart of administrators so\nwhat Windows does, it look at them and\n\n1739\n01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:15,240\nfigures out the best.\n\n1740\n01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,850\nWell the best is full control.\n\n1741\n01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:21,760\nSo based on this, I would get full\ncontrol from the share permissions.\n\n1742\n01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,160\nBut then it does something kind of weird.\n\n1743\n01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:27,750\nIt combines the share and\nthe NTFS permissions, and\n\n1744\n01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:32,810\nwhen it does that,\nit actually picks The most restrictive.\n\n1745\n01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:33,380\nAll right.\n\n1746\n01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:36,890\nSo, if I left this at the default,\neveryone read.\n\n1747\n01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,770\nSo, there's the share permissions,\nbut then the,\n\n1748\n01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:43,710\nand it's not gonna let me\npull it up is it here?\n\n1749\n01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:45,190\n>> It's not gonna let\nvisible at the same time, no.\n\n1750\n01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:48,030\n>> I'll just pull up another folder\nthat has the default so we can compare.\n\n1751\n01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:48,530\n>> Okay.\n\n1752\n01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:51,690\n>> So here's the defaults on the right.\n\n1753\n01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:53,920\nHere's the share permissions\nthat I'm doing right now.\n\n1754\n01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:54,519\nI'm an administrator.\n\n1755\n01:19:54,519 --> 01:19:56,042\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So on the left,\n\n1756\n01:19:56,042 --> 01:20:01,078\nif the share permissions\nare Everyone Read, and on the right if\n\n1757\n01:20:01,078 --> 01:20:07,457\nthe NTFS permissions are Administrators\nFull Control, which do I end up with?\n\n1758\n01:20:07,457 --> 01:20:08,096\nRead.\n\n1759\n01:20:08,096 --> 01:20:09,166\nI get Read only.\n\n1760\n01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:11,742\nI get the most restrictive of the two.\n\n1761\n01:20:11,742 --> 01:20:16,610\nwhen I'm coming in over the network,\nthe share permissions apply.\n\n1762\n01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:19,110\nIf I come and sit right down\nin front of this computer and\n\n1763\n01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:23,920\nlog in, only the NTFS permissions\napply and I would get full control.\n\n1764\n01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,150\nSo this is another level\nof possible confusion,\n\n1765\n01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:29,720\nthe way these kind of work together.\n\n1766\n01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,920\n>> It is strange cuz like you were\nsaying if you sit locally, I don't know,\n\n1767\n01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,780\nmaybe you want to set\nit that way on purpose.\n\n1768\n01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:37,680\nIf you're sitting at that machine,\nyou've got full control.\n\n1769\n01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,520\nBut if you're connecting over the network,\nI just want you to have Read.\n\n1770\n01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:43,500\nI don't see that all that often.\n\n1771\n01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:48,620\nIn fact, Microsoft has kinda shifted\ntheir best practices a little bit.\n\n1772\n01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:53,340\nThey're basically now saying give everyone\nFull Control share permissions, and\n\n1773\n01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:56,670\nthen use your NTFS permissions because\nyou know they're always checked.\n\n1774\n01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:59,610\nAnd that's where I'm going to\nlimit what access they have.\n\n1775\n01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:02,550\nAnd it eliminates me having to\ntroubleshoot share permissions altogether.\n\n1776\n01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:06,330\n>> You know, what I normally do, so when\nI set up a share what I like to do is go\n\n1777\n01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:09,320\ninto the share permissions and\nI remove everyone.\n\n1778\n01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,090\nI like to do authenticated users.\n\n1779\n01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:15,520\nSo everyone includes everybody,\nincluding the guest account.\n\n1780\n01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,730\nSo users who haven't even provided\na password if it's enabled.\n\n1781\n01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:19,920\nAuthenticated users though,\n\n1782\n01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,170\nthat says that anybody who's successfully\ngiven you a user name or password.\n\n1783\n01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:27,220\nSo I like to say authenticated users,\nfull control.\n\n1784\n01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:29,710\nJust give them total\ncontrol of that folder.\n\n1785\n01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:31,500\nAnd then do just like Mike said,\n\n1786\n01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:36,070\nat the NTFS level here I start to specify\nwhat I want people to actually have.\n\n1787\n01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:38,710\nAnd from a troubleshooting perspective,\nit's a lot easier.\n\n1788\n01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:39,820\nAnd you mentioned it, Mike,\n\n1789\n01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:44,240\nthat the Effective Permissions tab, it\nworks for NTFS, it doesn't work for share.\n\n1790\n01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,120\nWell, I'm not worried\nabout a share anymore.\n\n1791\n01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:49,160\nAt the share level,\neveryone full control, who cares?\n\n1792\n01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,730\nSo now we control it at NTFS.\n\n1793\n01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:52,790\nLife becomes a lot easier.\n\n1794\n01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:57,230\nBut on the exam they're testing what you\nknow, how well you know this information.\n\n1795\n01:21:57,230 --> 01:22:01,750\nSo just understand if you're staring at\nshare permissions and NTFS permissions,\n\n1796\n01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:06,330\nwhichever's the most restrictive is\nwhat your user is going to end up with.\n\n1797\n01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:09,890\nIf you're just looking at NTFS or\nyou're just looking at share,\n\n1798\n01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:14,330\nyou get the best of what's in there so\na little confusing.\n\n1799\n01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:15,850\n>> I know we're getting\nclose on time here.\n\n1800\n01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:18,030\nDo we wanna talk about\nthe difference between the share and\n\n1801\n01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:20,420\nthe advance sharing yet,\nor should we go there?\n\n1802\n01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:21,230\n>> Let's do this.\n\n1803\n01:22:21,230 --> 01:22:22,590\nLet's stop and take a break.\n\n1804\n01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:25,730\nWhen we get back, we can talk about the\nshare and advance share, and we can talk\n\n1805\n01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:29,030\nabout what happens to our permissions\nwhen we copy and move files around.\n\n1806\n01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:29,940\nThat's always a good one.\n\n1807\n01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:30,960\n>> Crazy stuff.\n\n1808\n01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,390\n>> So yeah, so\nwe'll stop here and jump back.\n\n1809\n01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:34,700\nSo we got more on permissions coming up.\n\n1810\n01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:35,495\nStay tuned.\n\n1811\n01:22:35,495 --> 01:22:36,391\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n1812\n01:22:36,391 --> 01:22:43,494\n[MUSIC]\n\n1813\n01:22:43,494 --> 01:22:44,100\nAll right.\n\n1814\n01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,520\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n1815\n01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,540\nSo, a couple odds and\nends to tackle here in the last segment.\n\n1816\n01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:52,360\nWe took a look at sharing a folder\nat the beginning of the show through\n\n1817\n01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:55,070\nWindows Homegroup and\nit was super easy, right.\n\n1818\n01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:59,690\nBut there's actually some more advanced\nways of sharing things for businesses,\n\n1819\n01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:02,170\npower users, whatever that we can\ntake advantage of, and, Mike,\n\n1820\n01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:03,450\nyou're gonna show us some of that.\n\n1821\n01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:04,000\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1822\n01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,820\nIf you want a little more control over\nthe way you share, like if Don says,\n\n1823\n01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:10,830\nyou have the Homegroup, rasy for\nyour home users to share it, done.\n\n1824\n01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:15,580\nIn a corporate environment, enterprise,\nwe want to control what we're giving and\n\n1825\n01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:18,910\nbe able to specifically share it with\nspecific groups of individuals and\n\n1826\n01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,518\nthings like that.\n\n1827\n01:23:20,518 --> 01:23:23,290\nStarting with Windows,\nI'm not sure if this was in Vista or not,\n\n1828\n01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:24,840\nI know it started with Window's 7.\n\n1829\n01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,160\nOr it was at least there.\n\n1830\n01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,990\nWhen we go to the sharing tab we\nactually have two options now.\n\n1831\n01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:31,650\nWe have this share and\n\n1832\n01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:34,780\nthen we have the advanced sharing\nwhich Don went through earlier today.\n\n1833\n01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:36,250\n>> That's what I'm used to.\n\n1834\n01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,460\nIt's all we had back in the NC4 days.\n\n1835\n01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:39,050\n>> Exactly.\n\n1836\n01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:41,040\nBefore this it was not\nthe Advance Sharing.\n\n1837\n01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,590\nIt was the Sharing tab.\n\n1838\n01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:43,638\nAnd that's where you went.\n\n1839\n01:23:43,638 --> 01:23:47,335\nAnd the thing to remember about this\nAdvance Sharing is when you come in here\n\n1840\n01:23:47,335 --> 01:23:51,148\nand share something, you can share it\nout and you can set your permissions for\n\n1841\n01:23:51,148 --> 01:23:54,213\nwhomever you wanna give those\npermissions to specifically.\n\n1842\n01:23:54,213 --> 01:23:57,210\nBut you still have to\nprovide the NTFS permission.\n\n1843\n01:23:57,210 --> 01:24:00,070\nSo remember as Don said,\nNTFS permissions are always checked,\n\n1844\n01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:02,770\nwhether you go across the network or\naccess it locally.\n\n1845\n01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:05,377\nSo if I share it out and\nI give you share permission but\n\n1846\n01:24:05,377 --> 01:24:09,510\nI fail to give you any NTSF permissions,\nyou don't get access to the document.\n\n1847\n01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:12,320\nBecause when you go across the network,\nit's gonna say share?\n\n1848\n01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,240\nNo NTFS, which is the more restrictive.\n\n1849\n01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:16,030\nNo permissions.\n\n1850\n01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:17,420\nAnd that's what you're gonna get.\n\n1851\n01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:19,100\nSo you had to remember to do both.\n\n1852\n01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:22,080\nSo what Windows did is they\ngave us this Share Wizard, and\n\n1853\n01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,650\nthey call it the Basic Share Wizard here.\n\n1854\n01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:27,600\nAnd what it does is when you\nshare something, it's gonna\n\n1855\n01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,670\nlook at what permissions you're assigning\nsharewise, and then it's gonna attempt to\n\n1856\n01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:35,790\ngo ahead and assign the permissions for\nthe NTFS that matches share permissions.\n\n1857\n01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:37,090\nSo you don't have to do both.\n\n1858\n01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:40,640\nYou share it out, you set your\npermissions, it does the NTFS permissions.\n\n1859\n01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:41,178\nYou're good to go.\n\n1860\n01:24:41,178 --> 01:24:43,650\nAnd I will tell you, I'll go ahead and\nwalk through it here.\n\n1861\n01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:45,130\nI'm just gonna click share.\n\n1862\n01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:47,670\nAnd I can choose who I\nwant to share it with.\n\n1863\n01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:52,960\nAnd I created a group, what did I call it,\nHost I think or something crazy like that.\n\n1864\n01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:59,170\nAnd I'm gonna choose to give it read,\nwrite permission.\n\n1865\n01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:01,260\nSo I'm going to share read-write,\n\n1866\n01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:05,530\nand I'm gonna click share and\nI'm gonna click done.\n\n1867\n01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:07,250\nAnd you'll see,\nthis is really designed for\n\n1868\n01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:12,170\nyour average end user, gives them a link\nthat they can email to their coworkers.\n\n1869\n01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:15,960\nSo, again your end user that doesn't\nunderstand shared NTFS permissions,\n\n1870\n01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,180\nthey share it out.\n\n1871\n01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,800\nIt's gonna assign the NTFS permissions.\n\n1872\n01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:24,756\nSo if I go over to my security tab,\nand I'm gonna have to refresh this,\n\n1873\n01:25:24,756 --> 01:25:26,359\nso let me close it out.\n\n1874\n01:25:26,359 --> 01:25:27,324\n>> After it thinks.\n\n1875\n01:25:27,324 --> 01:25:29,240\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah pull up it back up.\n\n1876\n01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,000\nSee if it can resolve that SID this time.\n\n1877\n01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,740\nAnd there you're going to see that it did\nindeed add Hosts to the NTFS permissions.\n\n1878\n01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:37,660\nI did not do that.\n\n1879\n01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:39,050\nThat share wizard did it.\n\n1880\n01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:43,040\nBut what I want you to look at is\nwhat it actually assigned them.\n\n1881\n01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,390\nI gave them share, read, write.\n\n1882\n01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:48,197\nIt assigned them NTFS full control, and\n\n1883\n01:25:48,197 --> 01:25:51,426\nthat's a big difference from read and\nwrite.\n\n1884\n01:25:51,426 --> 01:25:54,823\nBecause with NTFS full control\nI can delete the object and\n\n1885\n01:25:54,823 --> 01:25:57,510\nI can modify the access control list.\n\n1886\n01:25:57,510 --> 01:26:02,295\nSo, like I said, for these typical end\nuser that just wants to share a folder\n\n1887\n01:26:02,295 --> 01:26:05,645\nwith their coworkers so they can take\na look at this spreadsheet, fine.\n\n1888\n01:26:05,645 --> 01:26:08,025\nIn a corporate environment where you're\nreally trying to control access to\n\n1889\n01:26:08,025 --> 01:26:10,435\nthe resources,\nyou're not going to use that share wizard.\n\n1890\n01:26:10,435 --> 01:26:13,810\nBecause if I have to go back and\ndouble check what the wizard did, and\n\n1891\n01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:18,480\nthen fix what the wizard did, I'm not\ngonna use the wizard in the first place.\n\n1892\n01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,540\nBut know that that option's there and\nknow that it does both the share and\n\n1893\n01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:22,240\nthe NTSF permissions.\n\n1894\n01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:27,330\n>> And then the advanced way is\nthe way that I went earlier and\n\n1895\n01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:28,370\nyou see a lot more, right?\n\n1896\n01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:29,841\nMike, jump into that advanced screen.\n\n1897\n01:26:29,841 --> 01:26:33,463\nBecause it lets you pick and choose\nthe individual permissions that you need.\n\n1898\n01:26:33,463 --> 01:26:38,073\nSo when you go into the advanced sharing\nand into your permissions, or no,\n\n1899\n01:26:38,073 --> 01:26:42,140\nactually here, this has full control,\nchange, and read.\n\n1900\n01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:46,310\nSo change would be like that read,\nwrite, and then full control is bigger.\n\n1901\n01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:49,400\nSo you have a little bit\nmore control there, but\n\n1902\n01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,700\nit doesn't set the NTFS so\nyou still into the NTFS side.\n\n1903\n01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:55,430\n>> And the advance gives you, in fact\nif I show one more folder here, and\n\n1904\n01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:58,440\nI'm just this share this out real quick,\nI don't think it's shared yet.\n\n1905\n01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:02,670\nThe other advantage of using that,\nit is already shared.\n\n1906\n01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,480\nAnd let's just make a new folder.\n\n1907\n01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:11,530\nBy using that, the other thing you get by\nusing that advance share is, f I can pull\n\n1908\n01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:16,270\nit up there, the ability to share the\nfolder, but you can also change the name.\n\n1909\n01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:19,280\nWith the basic sharing wizard you\ncan't change the name of share,\n\n1910\n01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,190\nit just takes the name of the folder.\n\n1911\n01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:26,170\nSo if you had a folder that was\nnamed something crazy like financial\n\n1912\n01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:30,340\nreports 2014, but you wanted to share\nit as something a little bit shorter,\n\n1913\n01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:32,690\nyou'd have to share it this way.\n\n1914\n01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:35,710\nYou can also get into your caching\nsettings by going into your advanced\n\n1915\n01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:39,830\nshare, as well as control how many\npeople can connect at the same time.\n\n1916\n01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:43,000\nNone of those are available when\nyou share it the other method.\n\n1917\n01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,080\n>> So it's all really useful stuff,\ndefinitely things that you can see a use\n\n1918\n01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,890\nfor in an enterprise or\ncorporate environment, again, home users,\n\n1919\n01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:50,212\nnot really going to be\nconcerned about that stuff.\n\n1920\n01:27:50,212 --> 01:27:55,120\nNow, earlier we talked\nabout NTFS permissions and\n\n1921\n01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:59,190\nhow we inherit those permissions\nfrom our parent folder, and\n\n1922\n01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:02,510\nthe folder's parent, and\nall the way up to the root drive.\n\n1923\n01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:04,223\nAnd that's usually okay.\n\n1924\n01:28:04,223 --> 01:28:06,566\nMike showed how we can turn\noff that inheritance and\n\n1925\n01:28:06,566 --> 01:28:08,321\nthen reset our permissions, right?\n\n1926\n01:28:08,321 --> 01:28:11,851\nThere's one other scenario that\nwe need to talk about, though,\n\n1927\n01:28:11,851 --> 01:28:15,844\nthat can affect Affect those permissions\nand that's when we move a file.\n\n1928\n01:28:15,844 --> 01:28:18,680\nWhen we move it from one place to another.\n\n1929\n01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,320\nInheritance kind of has\nsome weird behaviors.\n\n1930\n01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:21,860\n>> It does.\n\n1931\n01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:23,550\n>> Let me show you what I mean.\n\n1932\n01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:28,225\nSo here on my hard drive,\nlet me just take this folder here.\n\n1933\n01:28:28,225 --> 01:28:33,715\nI've got a folder called Test1 and if I\npull up the properties of that folder and\n\n1934\n01:28:33,715 --> 01:28:37,395\nI look at the secure, you'll see\nwhere I've got Don full control.\n\n1935\n01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:40,156\nSo I'm the only person who\nhas access to this file.\n\n1936\n01:28:40,156 --> 01:28:41,028\nAll right?\n\n1937\n01:28:41,028 --> 01:28:42,870\nTo this folder.\n\n1938\n01:28:42,870 --> 01:28:46,390\nSo anything that I create\ninside of that folder, so\n\n1939\n01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:49,810\nif I come in here and\ncreate document three.\n\n1940\n01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:53,910\nSo I'll create a document which I\nwill just call document three and\n\n1941\n01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:55,580\napparently it will be a ZIP file.\n\n1942\n01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,090\n>> Still works.\n\n1943\n01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:57,270\n>> Clicked the wrong they,\nbut yeah it works.\n\n1944\n01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:59,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So if I pull up the properties of that\n\n1945\n01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:03,900\nfile, it will have inherited\npermissions from the folder and\n\n1946\n01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:06,470\nyou'll see Don,\nfull control, and that's it.\n\n1947\n01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:07,170\nIt's all inherited.\n\n1948\n01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:09,540\nRight?\nThat's what Mike showed earlier.\n\n1949\n01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:13,935\nBut, what happens when we copy the file,\n\n1950\n01:29:13,935 --> 01:29:17,515\nor move the file is a little\nbit interesting okay?\n\n1951\n01:29:17,515 --> 01:29:20,785\nThere's some different things that\nhappen based on what we're doing.\n\n1952\n01:29:20,785 --> 01:29:24,360\nSo, for example,\nif I copy this file, all right.\n\n1953\n01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,640\nSo I'm just gonna right click on it and\nchoose copy.\n\n1954\n01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,090\nAnd I'm gonna move to another folder.\n\n1955\n01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:32,630\nSo on my C Drive,\nthat was my Test1 folder.\n\n1956\n01:29:32,630 --> 01:29:34,110\nI'm gonna go to Test2.\n\n1957\n01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:37,090\nNow the Test2 folder is set\nup a little bit differently.\n\n1958\n01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:41,550\nIf I look at the permissions on it,\nI'll see that Mike also has permission, so\n\n1959\n01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:44,130\nMike and\nI both have permissions on this folder.\n\n1960\n01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:48,150\nSo I'm gonna go into Test2 and\nI'm going to paste that file.\n\n1961\n01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:54,385\nAnd when I paste it this is a copy,\na duplicate of that other file.\n\n1962\n01:29:54,385 --> 01:29:59,035\nAnd if I look at the permissions\nthat are on it, you'll see that it\n\n1963\n01:29:59,035 --> 01:30:02,055\ninherited the permissions of\nthe folder I just sent it to.\n\n1964\n01:30:02,055 --> 01:30:03,115\n>> Right.\n>> So, when we\n\n1965\n01:30:03,115 --> 01:30:05,920\ncopy between folders like this.\n\n1966\n01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:09,320\nYou have the original file, and\nnow you have the duplicate.\n\n1967\n01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:13,890\nThe duplicate is an all new file,\nso it's going to obtain or inherit\n\n1968\n01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:17,280\nthe permissions of the destination,\nwherever it is we're putting it to.\n\n1969\n01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:17,960\nOkay?\n\n1970\n01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,150\nAnd if I take this window, and\n\n1971\n01:30:20,150 --> 01:30:23,210\nlet me just move it off to the side,\nand get me another window.\n\n1972\n01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:28,600\nAll right, so on the right here\nthat's my Test2 folder, and\n\n1973\n01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:31,040\non the left side here I'm just\ngonna go back into Test1.\n\n1974\n01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:35,770\nI see I've got Document3.zip and\nI've got Document3.zip.\n\n1975\n01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:38,802\nI made a duplicate of the original,\nall right.\n\n1976\n01:30:38,802 --> 01:30:42,169\n>> So it has its own access control list,\nand inherits from its new parents.\n\n1977\n01:30:42,169 --> 01:30:44,900\n>> Yeah, the two file are unique, right?\n\n1978\n01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:47,540\nIf I delete one of them does\nit delete the other one?\n\n1979\n01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,960\nNo.\nThey're completely separate.\n\n1980\n01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:52,230\nAnd so, in fact, I'll go and\ndelete that one.\n\n1981\n01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:52,870\nThere it goes.\n\n1982\n01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:54,090\nThe original's still there,\n>> Right.\n\n1983\n01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:55,900\n>> So it's just a copy.\n\n1984\n01:30:55,900 --> 01:31:01,230\nBut if I move, if I move\nthe file something weird happens.\n\n1985\n01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:02,120\nNow when you move,\n\n1986\n01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:05,860\nyou're not doing a duplicate,\nyou're relocating the original file.\n\n1987\n01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:08,100\n>> Yeah, you're really doing a cut and\npaste, aren't you?\n\n1988\n01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:08,630\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1989\n01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:11,370\nIn fact, I'll do that, because it's\neasier than drag and drop sometimes.\n\n1990\n01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:14,900\nI will cut, and\nthen over here I'm going to paste.\n\n1991\n01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:21,170\nNow unlike the copy, when we do a move,\nthe original is gone.\n\n1992\n01:31:21,170 --> 01:31:22,260\nRight.\nIt's not really gone,\n\n1993\n01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:23,890\nit's just linked to the other folder.\n\n1994\n01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:28,130\nBecause of the way,\nNTFS handles links like this,\n\n1995\n01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:32,410\nthe actual data itself did\nnot move on my hard drive.\n\n1996\n01:31:32,410 --> 01:31:34,730\nJust the little pointer in the NTSF table.\n\n1997\n01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:36,570\nIt said,\nhey instead of being in this directory,\n\n1998\n01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:38,350\nthat file is now in this other directory.\n\n1999\n01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:39,060\nAll right?\n\n2000\n01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:42,458\nBecause of that,\nwe'll see some interesting behavior.\n\n2001\n01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:47,610\nRemember this Test2 folder over here,\nMike and I both have full control over it.\n\n2002\n01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:50,690\nWell let's take a look at\nthe permissions on Document3.\n\n2003\n01:31:50,690 --> 01:31:55,520\nIf I take a look at the permissions\non that file, I got Mike and Don,\n\n2004\n01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,940\nand you know what, I forgot something.\n\n2005\n01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:58,570\n>> Yeah, we should have added\nit before we cut it, right?\n\n2006\n01:31:58,570 --> 01:31:59,480\n>> Shoot.\nYeah, yeah.\n\n2007\n01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:00,600\n>> Might want to try that again.\n\n2008\n01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,490\nWe'll try that again.\n\n2009\n01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:05,800\n>> So what I did wrong here is\n\n2010\n01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:11,560\nwhen you move the file, wait, hang on,\nlet me make sure I get this straight.\n\n2011\n01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:14,370\n>> If you're moving it within\nthe partition, so you're not crossing\n\n2012\n01:32:14,370 --> 01:32:18,670\npartition boundaries, those explicit\npermissions should stay with it.\n\n2013\n01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:21,952\nSo we need to assign the permissions\nto it before we move it,\n\n2014\n01:32:21,952 --> 01:32:25,510\nsomething different than what\nthat folder has so we can verify.\n\n2015\n01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:29,852\nYou could add hosts, and\noh no that was not on your machine.\n\n2016\n01:32:29,852 --> 01:32:32,690\n>> All right here, so I'm gonna,\nyou know what I'll do?\n\n2017\n01:32:32,690 --> 01:32:37,640\nI'm gonna take it, and\nI'm gonna go into the security on it.\n\n2018\n01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,150\nAnd so here it is.\n\n2019\n01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:42,175\nSo Don is the only person\nwho has access to it.\n\n2020\n01:32:42,175 --> 01:32:46,935\nAnd I'm going to edit that, and\nI'm going to add in, I'll add in Mike.\n\n2021\n01:32:46,935 --> 01:32:49,025\nAnd maybe I'll add Nate, also.\n\n2022\n01:32:49,025 --> 01:32:51,640\nOkay?\nSo there's Mike with full control,\n\n2023\n01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:52,340\nand I'll add Nate.\n\n2024\n01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:54,620\nAnd give him full control.\n\n2025\n01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:56,070\n>> Nice.\n\n2026\n01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:57,030\n>> All right.\n\n2027\n01:32:57,030 --> 01:33:00,010\nNow we're gonna move this turkey.\n\n2028\n01:33:03,490 --> 01:33:08,000\nAll right, and I'm gonna choose move\ninstead of copy, and now it's moved over\n\n2029\n01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:13,090\nhere, and when I pull up the properties\non that file, what do I see?\n\n2030\n01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:13,630\nWell.\n\n2031\n01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:17,060\n>> Ta dah\n>> Test2, this folder, Mike and\n\n2032\n01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:18,620\nI had permissions on it.\n\n2033\n01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:22,320\nBut see how Nate still has\npermissions to this file.\n\n2034\n01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,230\n>> Right.\n\n2035\n01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:27,280\n>> The reason is, when we move a file\nwithin the same partition, right?\n\n2036\n01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,010\nBoth of these folders are on the C drive.\n\n2037\n01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:30,733\n>> C:Test1, C:Test2.\n\n2038\n01:33:30,733 --> 01:33:34,821\nWhen you move it It will retain\nthe permissions that were assigned to it.\n\n2039\n01:33:34,821 --> 01:33:36,290\nIt'll keep those permissions.\n\n2040\n01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:37,170\nAll right.\n\n2041\n01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:39,320\nThat's important to remember.\n\n2042\n01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:44,080\nThe reason it did that is we\ndidn't actually create a new file.\n\n2043\n01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,930\nIt's when you create a new file\nthat you inherit permissions.\n\n2044\n01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:48,554\n>> Right.\n>> So when I copied,\n\n2045\n01:33:48,554 --> 01:33:50,814\nI was creating a duplicate.\n\n2046\n01:33:50,814 --> 01:33:51,950\nA new file.\n\n2047\n01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:53,419\nIt got new permissions.\n\n2048\n01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:56,043\nWhen I move it's just relocating.\n\n2049\n01:33:56,043 --> 01:33:58,310\nAnd so it keeps it's old permissions.\n\n2050\n01:33:58,310 --> 01:34:00,990\nIt retains those and\nI can see those set on that file.\n\n2051\n01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:03,080\n>> Because like you said you're\nreally not moving the file anywhere.\n\n2052\n01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:05,070\nAll you're doing is updating\nthe pointer to the file.\n\n2053\n01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:08,840\nAs long as you stay within that\nsame volume or same partition.\n\n2054\n01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:10,230\nNow, if you go between partitions.\n\n2055\n01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:12,420\n>> That's where it gets really confusing,\ndoesn't it?\n\n2056\n01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:15,620\n>> Yes.\nNow you're actually, in a sense,\n\n2057\n01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:16,730\ncreating a new document.\n\n2058\n01:34:16,730 --> 01:34:19,330\nYou're deleting the original one and\nmaking a copy of it and\n\n2059\n01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:21,615\nputting that copy in that new location.\n\n2060\n01:34:21,615 --> 01:34:24,585\n>> Yeah, so let's go here on my E drive.\n\n2061\n01:34:24,585 --> 01:34:25,605\nI've got a test one.\n\n2062\n01:34:25,605 --> 01:34:26,945\nSo this is my E drive.\n\n2063\n01:34:26,945 --> 01:34:28,965\nA completely separate partition.\n\n2064\n01:34:28,965 --> 01:34:31,525\nIn my case it's a completely\nseparate hard drive but\n\n2065\n01:34:31,525 --> 01:34:33,605\nit could be two partitions\non the same hard drive.\n\n2066\n01:34:33,605 --> 01:34:34,400\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n2067\n01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,500\n>> And\nwhat do we have set on that folder there?\n\n2068\n01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:37,360\n>> Great question.\n\n2069\n01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:40,432\nProbably should have checked\nthat before the show.\n\n2070\n01:34:40,432 --> 01:34:40,944\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2071\n01:34:40,944 --> 01:34:42,214\n>> Well, we'll check it right here.\n\n2072\n01:34:42,214 --> 01:34:42,844\nAll right, so\n\n2073\n01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:44,564\nwe've got Nathan, Mike, Don.\n>> So\n\n2074\n01:34:44,564 --> 01:34:45,940\nget rid of Nathan in that one, right?\n>> Yep.\n\n2075\n01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:48,281\nSo we'll go over here and\nwe'll get rid of Nate.\n\n2076\n01:34:48,281 --> 01:34:51,555\nBeen trying to do that for months.\n\n2077\n01:34:51,555 --> 01:34:55,350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so we'll take Nate and\n\n2078\n01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:56,230\nwe'll toast him, right.\n\n2079\n01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:59,810\nSo you got Mike and I are the only\npeople who have access to this file now,\n\n2080\n01:34:59,810 --> 01:35:01,840\nall right.\n\n2081\n01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:04,980\nIf I copy it right.\n\n2082\n01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:06,792\nWhen I copy it.\n\n2083\n01:35:06,792 --> 01:35:11,110\nAnd I'll just do a copy and paste.\n\n2084\n01:35:11,110 --> 01:35:12,530\nYou know what.\nI didn't really show it.\n\n2085\n01:35:12,530 --> 01:35:15,250\nI want people to not-\n>> See which one it is?\n\n2086\n01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:15,940\n>> Think I'm faking it.\n\n2087\n01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:16,530\nRight?\n\n2088\n01:35:16,530 --> 01:35:18,980\nSo here.\nSo I'm going to move it over here and\n\n2089\n01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:21,330\nI'm gonna choose to copy it.\n\n2090\n01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:24,380\nWhen I copy it,\nit created a new file, right.\n\n2091\n01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:26,360\nMy original one is still here.\n\n2092\n01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,980\nThat's a new file.\n\n2093\n01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:30,910\nSo it should have inherited\nthe permissions of the destination.\n\n2094\n01:35:30,910 --> 01:35:34,820\nAnd if I pull up the properties\nI can see that it did.\n\n2095\n01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:37,820\nSo Don, Mike, Nathan,\nthe three of us have access to that file.\n\n2096\n01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:41,140\nWhat if I move?\n\n2097\n01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:42,580\nHere's where things get a little weird.\n\n2098\n01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:48,620\nWhen we copy, obviously,\nwe're always creating a duplicate.\n\n2099\n01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:53,310\nWhen we move on the same partition\nit's just redoing the pointer.\n\n2100\n01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:59,400\nBut when we move between partitions,\nthere's one NTFS table for the C drive.\n\n2101\n01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:02,289\nThere's another NTFS table for\nthe E drive.\n\n2102\n01:36:02,289 --> 01:36:07,064\nSo if I move this file over here, what's\ngoing to happen is it's going to view that\n\n2103\n01:36:07,064 --> 01:36:11,518\nas a new file being created over here,\neven though the original one is gone.\n\n2104\n01:36:11,518 --> 01:36:12,064\nMm-hm.\n\n2105\n01:36:12,064 --> 01:36:17,238\n>> And if I pull up the properties of it,\nI'll see that it inherited the permissions\n\n2106\n01:36:17,238 --> 01:36:21,590\nof the destination, so Nate gets access,\nand he can see that file.\n\n2107\n01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:22,280\n>> Right.\n\n2108\n01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:23,525\n>> That's where it's confusing.\n\n2109\n01:36:23,525 --> 01:36:24,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2110\n01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:28,770\n>> If I move within one partition,\nwe keep our permissions.\n\n2111\n01:36:28,770 --> 01:36:29,400\n>> Right.\n\n2112\n01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:34,610\n>> If I move between partitions,\n>> I lose my permissions and\n\n2113\n01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:36,230\nI gain what the destination has.\n\n2114\n01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:39,260\nSo it's really confusing and\nthis is a hard one to grasp.\n\n2115\n01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:40,260\nMicrosoft knows that.\n\n2116\n01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:41,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it almost always shows\n\n2117\n01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,090\nup on the exam.\n\n2118\n01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:44,950\nSo let me do this here.\n\n2119\n01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:49,440\nI'm gonna write this out in a way\nthat's somewhat easy to understand.\n\n2120\n01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:53,190\nSo there were really four\ndifferent scenarios there right?\n\n2121\n01:36:53,190 --> 01:37:01,470\nSo, there was copy within a partition,\nthere was move within a partition.\n\n2122\n01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:08,460\nThere was copy between partitions.\n\n2123\n01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,340\nAnd move between, partitions.\n\n2124\n01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:14,910\nOkay, those are my four scenarios.\n\n2125\n01:37:14,910 --> 01:37:16,100\n>> Right.\n\n2126\n01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:21,000\n>> When we copy, What did we do?\n\n2127\n01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,180\nWell we inherit the permissions\nof the destination.\n\n2128\n01:37:29,081 --> 01:37:35,450\nIn fact, we inherit the permissions of\nthe destination in most scenarios, right?\n\n2129\n01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:38,130\n>> Yep.\nSo when we copied between partitions,\n\n2130\n01:37:38,130 --> 01:37:39,670\nwe also inherited.\n\n2131\n01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:42,470\nAnd when we moved,\nwe also inherited between partitions.\n\n2132\n01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:46,380\nSo now the only one that was really\ndifferent was this guy right here.\n\n2133\n01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:51,755\nWhen we moved within in\nthe partition we retain,\n\n2134\n01:37:55,249 --> 01:38:01,565\nThat's tough to type, [LAUGH] retain\nthe permissions of the source, right?\n\n2135\n01:38:01,565 --> 01:38:05,760\nThat's the one variation,\nthe one scenario.\n\n2136\n01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,570\nWhere we don't get the permissions\nof our destinations.\n\n2137\n01:38:08,570 --> 01:38:09,310\n>> Right.\n>> Right.\n\n2138\n01:38:09,310 --> 01:38:11,450\nAnd it still doesn't\ninherit the permissions.\n\n2139\n01:38:11,450 --> 01:38:13,840\nIt's really the explicit permissions.\n\n2140\n01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,070\n>> Good clarification.\n\n2141\n01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:17,080\nThat was the mistake I\nmade the first time.\n\n2142\n01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:21,070\nI had entirely implicit,\nentirely inherited permissions.\n\n2143\n01:38:21,070 --> 01:38:23,100\nAnd so, yeah, I inherited the destination.\n\n2144\n01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:25,430\nWe had to make a modification to it and\nthen it showed.\n\n2145\n01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:30,450\nSo we could change this to say like,\nretain the explicit\n\n2146\n01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:34,970\npermissions of the source and\nadd the inherited.\n\n2147\n01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,710\n>> And that's why this is so important.\n\n2148\n01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:41,540\nIf you're responsible for setting up these\npermissions, controlling access, and\n\n2149\n01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:44,700\nyou start moving files around,\nwhat's that gonna do to your permissions?\n\n2150\n01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:49,630\nYou've gotta understand that if\nI do move it between partitions,\n\n2151\n01:38:49,630 --> 01:38:51,650\nI'm gonna lose all those\nexplicit permissions.\n\n2152\n01:38:51,650 --> 01:38:53,180\nAnd I'm going to have to reassign those.\n\n2153\n01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:54,980\nIf I copy it, it's a new document\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2154\n01:38:54,980 --> 01:38:57,060\n>> And I'm going to have to\nrecreate those permissions.\n\n2155\n01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:01,070\nThe only time it retains them is if\nI move it within that same volume or\n\n2156\n01:39:01,070 --> 01:39:02,330\nthat same partition.\n\n2157\n01:39:02,330 --> 01:39:06,910\n>> And that's why Microsoft has\nutilities like there's the xcaclcs and\n\n2158\n01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:08,590\nicacls utilities\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2159\n01:39:08,590 --> 01:39:12,400\n>> Which it's been a while and I can't\nremember which one's built into Windows 7.\n\n2160\n01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,018\nLet's see, is it xcacls?\n\n2161\n01:39:15,018 --> 01:39:16,222\nNope.\n\n2162\n01:39:16,222 --> 01:39:18,630\nIcacls?\n\n2163\n01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:19,145\nThere we go.\n\n2164\n01:39:19,145 --> 01:39:21,810\nXcacls must be in XP.\n\n2165\n01:39:21,810 --> 01:39:24,600\nSo, they have these\ncommand line utilities and\n\n2166\n01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:27,890\nwhat these guys allow you to\ndo if you kind of look at it.\n\n2167\n01:39:27,890 --> 01:39:29,040\nThis is not on the exam.\n\n2168\n01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:29,830\nI just mention here for\n\n2169\n01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:33,700\nyour own knowledge, is that it'll\nactually allow you to copy files.\n\n2170\n01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:36,050\nAnd retain their permissions.\n\n2171\n01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:39,220\nSo you can set this kind of thing up,\nalso Robocop.\n\n2172\n01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:40,990\n>> Robocop is one of my favorite,\nI don't know why.\n\n2173\n01:39:40,990 --> 01:39:41,900\nI just like saying Robocop.\n\n2174\n01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:45,270\n>> I don't think Robocop,\nRobocop is a Windows 7, look at that!\n\n2175\n01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:47,710\nSo, Robocop is another one\nyou can copy files and\n\n2176\n01:39:47,710 --> 01:39:50,810\nretain their permissions regardless\nof where you're sending them too.\n\n2177\n01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:54,260\nSo,there are utilities like that that\nare built in to get around this but\n\n2178\n01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:58,210\nthe one you're gonna see\non the exam is not that.\n\n2179\n01:39:58,210 --> 01:40:03,770\nYou're gonna see, what is the normal\nbehavior, so this is the normal\n\n2180\n01:40:03,770 --> 01:40:08,820\nfile management behavior, right.\n\n2181\n01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:10,780\nAnd then it can be overridden.\n\n2182\n01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:13,670\nThat's not right.\n\n2183\n01:40:13,670 --> 01:40:17,420\nOverridden with,\nI don't know how to spell overridden.\n\n2184\n01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,004\n>> That's close.\n\n2185\n01:40:18,004 --> 01:40:18,850\n[LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n2186\n01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:22,090\nwith various command line\nutilities like these guys here.\n\n2187\n01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:24,350\nSo there are other ways to go about it.\n\n2188\n01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:26,910\nBut for the most part,\nthat's the thing we need to remember.\n\n2189\n01:40:26,910 --> 01:40:32,390\nWhen you move within a single partition\nany explicit permissions you have,\n\n2190\n01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:33,170\nyou'll retain those.\n\n2191\n01:40:33,170 --> 01:40:34,850\nSo just memorize that.\n\n2192\n01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:36,200\nKnow it for the exam.\n\n2193\n01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,840\nIn real life land,\njust know to always check.\n\n2194\n01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,440\n>> Right, yeah, but I do like that.\n\n2195\n01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,520\nLike you said,\nas long as you remember that one.\n\n2196\n01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:45,640\nRetains permissions when you move\nit within the same partition,\n\n2197\n01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:46,570\neverything else inherits.\n\n2198\n01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:51,431\nSo, It's really not that difficult to\nmemorize just that little bit there.\n\n2199\n01:40:51,431 --> 01:40:53,730\n>> Yeah.\n\n2200\n01:40:53,730 --> 01:40:54,860\nSpell checker.\n\n2201\n01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:57,742\nThere's a lot of double\nletters in that one.\n\n2202\n01:40:57,742 --> 01:41:01,505\nAl right, so, quite a bit in this\nepisode on file permissions.\n\n2203\n01:41:01,505 --> 01:41:03,965\n>> Yeah.\n>> And if you wanna see this stuff again,\n\n2204\n01:41:03,965 --> 01:41:06,225\nwe covered it in a number of shows.\n\n2205\n01:41:06,225 --> 01:41:07,975\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you've watched the A Plus show,\n\n2206\n01:41:07,975 --> 01:41:12,972\nI know we covered it in there, the Windows\n8 show, the Server 2012 shows, we covered\n\n2207\n01:41:12,972 --> 01:41:14,492\n>> Cover this topic, over and\n\n2208\n01:41:14,492 --> 01:41:17,102\nover again,\nbecause of how important it is.\n\n2209\n01:41:17,102 --> 01:41:19,102\n>> It really does stress,\nhow important it is, and\n\n2210\n01:41:19,102 --> 01:41:21,842\nthe fact that you could end up seeing it,\non any one of those exams.\n\n2211\n01:41:21,842 --> 01:41:23,822\nMaybe not a direct permission question,\n\n2212\n01:41:23,822 --> 01:41:26,390\nlike what do you get when\nyou have right permission.\n\n2213\n01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:28,900\nBut if you don't understand\nthe way the permissions combine,\n\n2214\n01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:30,670\nNTFS being cumulative,\n\n2215\n01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:34,830\nshared NTFS being the most restrictive of\nthe two, what happens when you move that.\n\n2216\n01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:36,790\nThey're going to give\nyou some scenario and\n\n2217\n01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:39,790\nif you don't understand what's going on\nin the background with those permissions,\n\n2218\n01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:41,130\nyou might not be able to\nget that question right.\n\n2219\n01:41:41,130 --> 01:41:44,000\nSo, it's gonna be a part\nof every one of your exams.\n\n2220\n01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:44,690\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n2221\n01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:46,260\nAll right.\n\n2222\n01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:49,850\nWell, if you guys have\nquestions on any of this stuff,\n\n2223\n01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:52,700\nremember live during the show\nyou

right, welcome back to another\nfantastic episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,090\nI am Nathan Copeland,\nhere with Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,950\n>> How's it going?\n\n7\n00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,980\n>> Pretty good, Mike, how are you?\n\n8\n00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,430\n>> I am doing well, ready for\n\n9\n00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,630\nanother exciting episode on Windows 7\n>> Yeah, Windows 7, I think I say this\n\n10\n00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,150\nevery time, but it's been awhile since\nyou and I have done an episode together.\n\n11\n00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,550\n>> Yeah, it is few and\nfar between, isn't it?\n\n12\n00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,195\n>> Yeah, our paths just they, oh, no.\n\n13\n00:00:57,195 --> 00:01:00,150\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, I'm glad they've crossed today,\n\n14\n00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,850\nlet's do some real good\nwork with Windows 7.\n\n15\n00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,620\nI miss Windows 7, I don't know about you,\nI mean nothing wrong with Windows 8.\n\n16\n00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,512\nDon't get me wrong, I love my Windows 8,\nbut sometimes I do miss Windows 7.\n\n17\n00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:13,980\n>> Yeah, you know, it-\n>> It's a good operating system.\n\n18\n00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,460\n>> Yeah, it was.\n\n19\n00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,380\n>> It's still very current and\nthat's why we're doing these shows, right,\n\n20\n00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,900\nbecause people still wanna\nget certified in it.\n\n21\n00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,820\nA lot of businesses are still running it\nand probably will for a quite some time.\n\n22\n00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,639\n>> Quite some time, and it was kind\nof a little blast from the past since\n\n23\n00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,500\nI've been on Windows 8 for a while now.\n\n24\n00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,161\n>> Yeah.\n>> And I've gotten used to the shortcuts\n\n25\n00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:39,020\nand where I go for things and even though,\nlike underneath they're pretty close.\n\n26\n00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,940\n>> Interacting with the operating system\nis way different in Windows 8 than\n\n27\n00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,990\nit was in Windows 7.\n\n28\n00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,340\nSo you get used to that and it feels like\nyou're going back in time when you start\n\n29\n00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,055\nplaying with Windows 7,\nlike it's got a start button.\n\n30\n00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:51,552\nWait, what?\n[LAUGH]\n\n31\n00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:53,382\n>> Yeah or like I'll get used to\n\n32\n00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:57,210\nthe modern UI shortcuts and\nmenus, where to go for things.\n\n33\n00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,710\n>> In Windows X and all that.\n\n34\n00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,885\nWindows 7 is a pretty operating system,\nnot that it has anything to do with\n\n35\n00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:05,400\nits functionality, but\nit was a good looking operating system.\n\n36\n00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,760\n>> Yeah, with the arrow glass and\nall of that transparency stuff.\n\n37\n00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,549\n>> Yeah, I remember when I first saw it,\nI was like, this is really slick.\n\n38\n00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,214\nAnd then Windows 8 comes out, and\n\n39\n00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:17,150\nI know the whole trend now\nis the minimalist design.\n\n40\n00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,130\n>> Yeah.\n\n41\n00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,010\n>> And all this just plain old square\nboxes that remind me of Windows 2000.\n\n42\n00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,858\n>> And it's so popular these days.\n\n43\n00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:26,110\n>> It is, it's the way it is.\n\n44\n00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,431\nIt's like in, it's the new thing,\n[CROSSTALK] flat, plain, even look at iOS.\n\n45\n00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:32,019\n>> Yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,980\n>> I mean, it looks, what?\n\n47\n00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,262\n>> So anyway,\nwe'll dive into some Window's 7 today and\n\n48\n00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:43,310\ncontinue on kind of where we left off\nthe other day or Don and I did some stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:49,283\n>> Yep, that's right, and\nspecifically we're gonna be covering,\n\n50\n00:02:49,283 --> 00:02:51,503\nso it is-\n>> Is it Objective 5.\n\n51\n00:02:51,503 --> 00:02:56,569\n>> All right, Objective 5,\nso we'll be picking up\n\n52\n00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:01,643\non letter C with Configure\nuser account control.\n\n53\n00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:03,360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know it.\n\n54\n00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,259\n>> Woohoo.\n>> So we've got good old user account\n\n55\n00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:07,764\ncontrol and then.\n\n56\n00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:12,070\n>> Local security policy,\nUAC behaviors, secure desktop.\n\n57\n00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,530\n>> I think I'm gonna go-\n>> You locked up there?\n\n58\n00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,110\n>> Let me go back to, there it is.\n\n59\n00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,430\n>> We'll get into some authentication,\n\n60\n00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,930\nauthorization, talking about issues\nI can have with authentication.\n\n61\n00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,890\nWhat else?\n\n62\n00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,600\nWe're gonna take a look at managing\ncertificates, managing credentials.\n\n63\n00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,360\nWhere are we going after that,\nmulti-factor authentication?\n\n64\n00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,880\n>> Yep, and we'll round out\nthe whole party with BranchCache,\n\n65\n00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,680\nan incredibly awesome\noptimization technology.\n\n66\n00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,125\nPretty in depth, and it's not something\nthat you're going to click a check box,\n\n67\n00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,230\nwell maybe from the client side.\n\n68\n00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,910\n>> For the client side,\nmaybe not as bad, but on the server,\n\n69\n00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,170\ncertainly a lot of setup to do.\n\n70\n00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,330\nAnd we cover that stuff in\nour server classes for sure,\n\n71\n00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,280\nbut it's a great way to end the day.\n\n72\n00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,667\nBranchCache is a pretty\ncool concept itself.\n\n73\n00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:58,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sounds like a fun day.\n\n74\n00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,637\n>> Great way to end\nthe day on BranchCache.\n\n75\n00:04:00,637 --> 00:04:01,469\n>> Yeah, man.\n\n76\n00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:02,308\n>> All right.\n\n77\n00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,037\n>> If you guys are geeks\nlike me that stuff is cool.\n\n78\n00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,988\n>> Okay.\n>> Being able to let those users at\n\n79\n00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:09,948\nthe branch office access\nthose shares really quick and\n\n80\n00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:12,990\nnot have to worry about that\nslow WAN link, fantastic.\n\n81\n00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,698\n>> Yeah, speaking of which,\nI'll share this.\n\n82\n00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:20,471\nSo when I first met this guy,\nhe was talking about something on like,\n\n83\n00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:22,815\noh what makes a fun Friday night?\n\n84\n00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:24,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And one of them, he's like,\n\n85\n00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,940\nhave you ever just looked\nthrough the event logs?\n\n86\n00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,192\nI'm like, well not if I don't have to.\n\n87\n00:04:30,192 --> 00:04:32,850\nHe's like, if you just pore through\nthe event logs, there's some really\n\n88\n00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,190\nfascinating things that go on in\nthe background, that Windows log.\n\n89\n00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:41,270\n>> Absolutely, I'm telling you event logs\nand the other one is packet capturer.\n\n90\n00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,990\n>> Packet capturer.\n\n91\n00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,840\n>> Yeah, firing up network monitor and\n\n92\n00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,255\nseeing what the heck is\ngoing on in your network.\n\n93\n00:04:45,255 --> 00:04:46,800\n[LAUGH] You always wonder,\n\n94\n00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,450\nI know when I first started getting into\ncomputers, I always wondered why that darn\n\n95\n00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,520\nactivity light was going on\non my router all the time.\n\n96\n00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,820\nRight, it's like I'm not\neven using the computer.\n\n97\n00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,110\nFire up Packet Capture one day and\n\n98\n00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,182\njust look at all the chatter that goes\non your network, it's pretty impressive.\n\n99\n00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:02,582\n>> Yeah, now everybody know I'm a geek and\nthat's where I spend my Friday nights.\n\n100\n00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:04,188\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n101\n00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:07,970\nI'll have to invite you over one day.\n\n102\n00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,870\n>> Yeah, we should.\n\n103\n00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,265\n>> And we can look at my packet captures.\n\n104\n00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:13,056\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Mike, come on over, oh,\n\n105\n00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:16,223\nhey look I just got in a new wireless log,\nlet's, anyway.\n\n106\n00:05:16,223 --> 00:05:17,478\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n107\n00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:21,070\nwe're gonna start this guy off\nwith user account control.\n\n108\n00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,900\n>> Cool.\n>> Right, user account control,\n\n109\n00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:29,580\nit was first introduced in Windows Vista\nand it's a little pop-up asking,\n\n110\n00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,255\nI guess, to allow or\ndeny certain actions to happen on your PC.\n\n111\n00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:35,690\n>> Right.\n\n112\n00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,768\n>> These pop up when installing things, or\n\n113\n00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:41,850\nanything that really needs\nelevated permissions.\n\n114\n00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,690\n>> It is, and now most of you,\nI don't know if anybody goes back,\n\n115\n00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,460\nit was introduced,\nlike you said, in Windows Vista.\n\n116\n00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,722\nAnd that was when they had the whole\nMac and PC commercial going on.\n\n117\n00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:51,342\n>> [LAUGH] Oh wow.\n>> Yeah,\n\n118\n00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:53,770\nMac is trying to send a salutation,\nallow or deny, that kind of thing.\n\n119\n00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,420\nAnd it did get a bad rap back in Vista,\nit was pretty, there wasn't a lot of\n\n120\n00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,510\nconfiguration options and\nit did seem a little intrusive.\n\n121\n00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,320\nBut yeah,\nthe UACs designed to protect us, right.\n\n122\n00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,030\nSo when I've got a user that is trying to\ndo something that requires administrative\n\n123\n00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,190\naccess, they're gonna have to type in,\nwell,\n\n124\n00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,670\nwe'll talk about the different behaviors\nof the prompt and things like that.\n\n125\n00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,010\nBut it protects me from things\nrunning in the background and\n\n126\n00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,930\ngrabbing administrative credentials,\nthat's one of the big things it does.\n\n127\n00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,870\nAnd it prevents my end users from trying\nto do things that require administrative\n\n128\n00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,730\ncredentials, if they don't\nhave that level of access.\n\n129\n00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,678\nSo I guess,\nI don't know where we wanna start,\n\n130\n00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:30,640\nwant to go pull up the policy first or\njust talk?\n\n131\n00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,810\n>> About this new one?\n\n132\n00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,120\nYeah, did it work, both?\n\n133\n00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,130\n>> Yeah, so\nwe can manage this user account control.\n\n134\n00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,820\nSo we can choose use how intrusive,\nis that the word that you would use?\n\n135\n00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,980\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n\n136\n00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,976\n>> How involved it is as we use RPCs and\n\n137\n00:06:46,976 --> 00:06:50,890\nthere's kind of an easy way\nthat we can modify it and\n\n138\n00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,452\na little bit harder way that we can modify\nit, through our local group policy.\n\n139\n00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:57,240\n>> Right, right.\n>> We can set that stuff and\n\n140\n00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,720\ndetermine, yeah it's how it interacts or\nhow we interact with it.\n\n141\n00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,792\n>> Right, exactly, and I think probably\nbefore we get into how we control it,\n\n142\n00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,050\nlet's just talk about what it does.\n\n143\n00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,570\nWhen you log on as a standard user,\n\n144\n00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,805\nyou're getting standard level\naccess to that machine.\n\n145\n00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:16,570\nAnd so if you try to do something that\nrequires administrative credentials,\n\n146\n00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,020\nthe UAC is gonna kick in.\n\n147\n00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,010\nAnd it's gonna say, hey,\n\n148\n00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,710\nyour account that you're logged on with\ndoes not have administrative access.\n\n149\n00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,630\nBut here's a chance for you to type\nin a username and a password that has\n\n150\n00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,150\nadministrative access and I'll let you\ndo whatever it is you're trying to do.\n\n151\n00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,300\nAnd the cool thing about it is,\nit's only gonna be that one task, right?\n\n152\n00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,950\nThat's the only task that's running\nunder those administrative credentials.\n\n153\n00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,007\nSo if you've got your email\napplication open in the background,\n\n154\n00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,508\nyou've got your web browser\nopen in the background,\n\n155\n00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:44,300\nthose are still running under\nyour standard user context.\n\n156\n00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,859\nJust the one task that the UAC kicked\nin for, is being escalated, so\n\n157\n00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:50,800\nthat's helping protect me and\nkeep that machine safe.\n\n158\n00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,560\nAnd if I don't have an administrative\naccount, Then I won't be able to\n\n159\n00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,090\ntype it in, and I won't be able to\ndo that, which is a good thing.\n\n160\n00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,175\nIf the user doesn't have\nan administrative account,\n\n161\n00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:01,190\nthey probably shouldnt be messing with\nwhatever it is they were trying to do.\n\n162\n00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,620\n[LAUGH] If you log on as an administrator,\n\n163\n00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,440\nyou're still actually gonna be\nrunning under standard user access.\n\n164\n00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,330\nAnd then, if you try to do something\nthat requires administrative control, or\n\n165\n00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,740\nadministrative access.\n\n166\n00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,670\nThe UACs gonna kick in and\nit's gonna say, all right.\n\n167\n00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,325\nI see that the account that you logged\non with, is actually an administrator.,\n\n168\n00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:24,180\nwwould you like to continue,\nor would you like to cancel?\n\n169\n00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,810\nSo you don't have to type in your\nusername and password again.\n\n170\n00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,500\nYou have to say yes or no.\n\n171\n00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,220\nAnd that way same thing.\n\n172\n00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,120\nBecause back in the day if you're\nlogged on as administrator.\n\n173\n00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,310\nI mean, and you're surfing the Interne,\nor you're clicking on a link in an email,\n\n174\n00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,290\nthere's a potential for\n\n175\n00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,890\nmalware to run as you, and\nhave administrative access to that system.\n\n176\n00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,450\nSo, this way it keeps us at\na standard user access, and\n\n177\n00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,970\nonly when we specifically say it's okay,\nit's going to escalate our credentials.\n\n178\n00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,930\nNow, back in Vista,\nthat was pretty annoying because, you and\n\n179\n00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,180\nI, since we're IT guys, everything we\ndo requires administrative access.\n\n180\n00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,050\nSo it was constantly popping up, right?\n\n181\n00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,830\nNow we have options that we can use,\nto kinda control that behavior, and\n\n182\n00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,560\nsay all right, look,\nif I click on it assume that it's okay.\n\n183\n00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,700\nI'm the one that did it.\n\n184\n00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,830\nIf something in the background\ntries to do it, prompt me.\n\n185\n00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,680\nAnd let me decide yes or no.\n\n186\n00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,580\nSo it helps again, keep,\nagain keep me safe.\n\n187\n00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,220\nAnd prevent things from running in\nthe background without my knowledge, and\n\n188\n00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,545\nhaving administrative access.\n\n189\n00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:25,210\n>> Mm-hm. Yeah.\nNow we can identify certain actions, or\n\n190\n00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:29,450\nthings that require that administrative\naccess that would prompt UAC.\n\n191\n00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,930\nAnd we could see it with a little shield.\n\n192\n00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,440\nA little blue and yellow shield.\n\n193\n00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,220\nWe can take an example on my PC here.\n\n194\n00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,250\nOne of the ways we can go\ninto our date and time.\n\n195\n00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,900\nBooyah!\nThat guy right there.\n\n196\n00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,470\nIt's right next to, change date and\ntime, that little shield, right.\n\n197\n00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,620\nThat tells me that, you know,\n\n198\n00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,680\nI need administrative access\nto change the date and time.\n\n199\n00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,505\nAnd Mike, let me just ask this.\n\n200\n00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,555\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Let me get your thoughts on this.\n\n201\n00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:56,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So why,\n\n202\n00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,940\nwhy is it that I can change the time zone.\n\n203\n00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,220\n>> Right.\n>> And that's perfectly fine.\n\n204\n00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,960\nBut why is just changing the date or\ntime on my PC So much worse, or.\n\n205\n00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,160\n>> It does seem kind of odd, doesn't it?\n\n206\n00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,770\n>> Or critical.\n>> Yeah, it does seem odd.\n\n207\n00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,480\nBut time,\n\n208\n00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,440\nin a Windows system, time's an important\npart of a lot of security features.\n\n209\n00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,900\nYou know, using time stamps.\n\n210\n00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,590\nIf your clock is off by more\nthan five minutes by default,\n\n211\n00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,030\non your client you won't be able to\nauthenticate with the domain controller,\n\n212\n00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,640\nbecause that's a way that bad guys\ncan try to manipulate the system.\n\n213\n00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,350\nRoll it back in time, or capture packets,\nand do replays, and things like that.\n\n214\n00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,970\nSo times are very important, so\n\n215\n00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,470\nit's going you from changing that time\nunless you have administrative access.\n\n216\n00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,020\nYour time is synchronized\nwith your PDC emulator.\n\n217\n00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,990\nWe'll talk a lot about it\nin the server episodes, but\n\n218\n00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,830\nit keeps all the systems on the network\nsynchronized within five minutes.\n\n219\n00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,820\nChanging your time zone,\ndoesn't really change your time, right?\n\n220\n00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,460\nSo if you're a user and you're traveling,\nand you need to go over to the west coast,\n\n221\n00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,710\nyou can update your time zone,\nwithout affecting the basic time.\n\n222\n00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,760\nYou're just doing an offset\non that same time,\n\n223\n00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,370\nso, that's why it'll let you change\nthe time zone and not the time.\n\n224\n00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,025\nIn fact, if I remember correctly though,\n\n225\n00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:07,880\ninitially, the time zone,\nyou had to be an administrator as well.\n\n226\n00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,130\nAnd they finally changed that, they said\nlook, users need to be able to change\n\n227\n00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,890\nthat, even the standard user,\nbecause they're travelling.\n\n228\n00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,470\nThat's why.\n\n229\n00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,550\n>> Even though we have this little shield,\nif I click on it,\n\n230\n00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,940\nwhat do you think's going to happen?\n\n231\n00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,640\nWell, since you're logged on,\nas an administrator, and\n\n232\n00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,980\nif you're, depending on the properties\nyou have set you told it,\n\n233\n00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,790\nhey if I'm clicking on it, then it's okay,\nyou don't have to prompt me.\n\n234\n00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,850\nIf something in the background was trying\nto do it, then it would have, if you had\n\n235\n00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,810\nclicked on a link in an e-mail, and\nit was trying to change your system time.\n\n236\n00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,910\nThen it would have prompted you, and\n\n237\n00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,324\nsaid hey wait are you sure\nyou want to allow this?\n\n238\n00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,690\nYeah now, so\ndo we wanna take a look at the UAC prompt,\n\n239\n00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,510\nlike what it looks like when it pops up?\n\n240\n00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,482\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n241\n00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:53,570\n>> All right, so you know,\nwe can invoke it.\n\n242\n00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:59,580\nOne way that would be pretty\neasy is to run a command prompt.\n\n243\n00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,110\nSo if I just type in CMD,\nmy little run menu there.\n\n244\n00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,805\nAnd cmd so to pull up the command prompt.\n\n245\n00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:06,860\nRight-click on this guy.\n\n246\n00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,270\nAnd run as administrator,\n\n247\n00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,135\nwhich we'll cover run as administrator\nin-depth, I guess a little bit more.\n\n248\n00:12:12,135 --> 00:12:16,863\nAnyway, left-click on that.\n\n249\n00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:17,363\nAw.\n>> Aw.\n\n250\n00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:17,863\n>> IVG didn't.\n\n251\n00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,636\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n252\n00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:20,752\n>> IVG didn't capture it.\n\n253\n00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:23,150\nLet me jump into a virtual machine.\n\n254\n00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,330\nAll right, and do the same thing, cmd.\n\n255\n00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,370\nAnd click that Run as administrator.\n\n256\n00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,430\nThere we go.\n>> There we go.\n\n257\n00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,950\n>> All right, so\nthere is the User Account Control.\n\n258\n00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,851\nThis is what we'll be basing.\n\n259\n00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:36,240\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n260\n00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,830\nSo this is what we'll base everything on.\n\n261\n00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,890\nThere you go.\nMm-hm.\n\n262\n00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,260\n>> And so yeah, as an administrator you\ndon't have to type in your user name and\n\n263\n00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:44,940\npassword again.\n\n264\n00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,170\nYou've already authenticated\nwhen you first logged on.\n\n265\n00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,180\nBut it wants to make sure that you\nare aware, and that you are okay with\n\n266\n00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,140\nwhatever it is, in this case CNPNDNG,\ngiving it administrative access.\n\n267\n00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,385\nSo you can just choose yes or no.\n\n268\n00:12:58,385 --> 00:12:59,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n269\n00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,310\nLet's do yes.\n\n270\n00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,010\nLet's say yes.\n\n271\n00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,050\n>> Hooray.\n>> And that's it.\n\n272\n00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,760\nThat's it.\n\n273\n00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,790\nAll right.\n\n274\n00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,530\nSo let's take a look at\nthe different settings of UAC,\n\n275\n00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,680\nand how we can control it.\n\n276\n00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,120\nAnd, first things first,\nlet's take a look at the easy way.\n\n277\n00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,105\nOkay, do you wanna do that?\n\n278\n00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:17,615\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Show them the easy way.\n\n279\n00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:20,780\n[LAUGH] To me the easy\nway is the group policy.\n\n280\n00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,118\nI'm trying to think of what\nyou think the easy way is.\n\n281\n00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:24,582\n>> [CROSSTALK] Through the control panel.\n\n282\n00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:25,180\n>> Control panel.\n\n283\n00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,780\n>> Okay.\nGotcha.\n\n284\n00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,442\nGotcha.\n[CROSSTALK] So it's a good control panel.\n\n285\n00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:29,320\n>> Yeah go ahead.\n\n286\n00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,470\n>> Okay I like it.\n\n287\n00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,284\nStart > Control Panel >\n\n288\n00:13:35,284 --> 00:13:40,556\nUser Accounts and Safety or\n\n289\n00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:48,110\nFamily Safety > User Accounts and\nthen down there.\n\n290\n00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,210\nChange user account control settings.\n\n291\n00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,485\n>> That is pretty darn easy, isn't it?\n\n292\n00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:53,230\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n293\n00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,225\nAnd we'll click on that.\n\n294\n00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:55,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n295\n00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,110\nAnd so now we get to this menu here.\n\n296\n00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,400\n>> Right.\n>> Now to change the settings,\n\n297\n00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,420\nthere's a little slider bar,\nwhich I'm a fan of sliders.\n\n298\n00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,775\nI prefer sliders to radio dials.\n\n299\n00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:05,715\n>> Full-size burgers?\n\n300\n00:14:05,715 --> 00:14:10,790\n[Laughs] So,\n\n301\n00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,550\nwe can move this guy up and move it down.\n\n302\n00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:18,170\nDepending on which way, it changes it.\n\n303\n00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,440\nIf we move it higher up, it becomes\nmore intrusive, more restrictive.\n\n304\n00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,310\n>> It's definitely going\nto prompt you more often,\n\n305\n00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,380\nbecause you're basically saying,\n>> all right,\n\n306\n00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,670\nany time you need an administrative\naccess, go ahead and prompt it.\n\n307\n00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,740\nWhether I do it or not.\n\n308\n00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,820\nPrograms try to install software, or\neven if I make changes to the system,\n\n309\n00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,380\ngo ahead and prompt me, and\nmake sure I'm meant to do that.\n\n310\n00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,540\nThey're pretty annoying, honestly.\n\n311\n00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,430\n>> All right.\nAnd the default setting is this one here.\n\n312\n00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,440\nLike, I guess the third level?\n\n313\n00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,600\n>> Yeah.\n>> There's three out of four, right?\n\n314\n00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,640\nAnd so this is the standard a little bit,\nright?\n\n315\n00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,430\nSo notify me,\nonly when programs try to make changes.\n\n316\n00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,810\nSo if things happen in the background,\nthat's fine.\n\n317\n00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,410\nJust go ahead and run the thing.\n\n318\n00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,510\nBut if other programs, so\nlike non-Windows System programs, right?\n\n319\n00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,920\nSo the date and time, that was fine.\n\n320\n00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,910\n>> Because you clicked on it,\n\n321\n00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,660\nand said all right, don't notify me\nwhen I make changes to Windows settings.\n\n322\n00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,675\nOnly notify me when programs\ntry to make changes.\n\n323\n00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:16,300\n>> Mm-hm.\nSo that command window, so\n\n324\n00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,370\nthat program, not a Windows setting.\n\n325\n00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,060\nSo it invoked it.\n\n326\n00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,420\nSo, the further down that we move it,\na little less.\n\n327\n00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:31,380\nSo this one, the same kind of thing as\nthe option above it, except one big\n\n328\n00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:37,670\ndifference, and this is that right there\nIn parenthesis do not dim my desktop.\n\n329\n00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,800\nNow the dimming of the desktop,\nthat's called the secure desktop.\n\n330\n00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,110\nAnd it basically just halts\nwindows more or less.\n\n331\n00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,700\nEverything in the background stops.\n\n332\n00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,695\nRight.\n>> Right, and\n\n333\n00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:52,146\nas you saw as Nate was launching that\ncommand prompt with administrative access,\n\n334\n00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:55,000\neverything else disappeared,\nkind of grayed out.\n\n335\n00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000\nAnd all you got was the yes or\nno dialog box.\n\n336\n00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,710\nAnd that's what we call a modal.\n\n337\n00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,116\nM-o-d-a-l, a modal dialog box meaning you\ncan't click on anything else other than\n\n338\n00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:05,000\nthat box.\n\n339\n00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,760\nYou have to answer that\nbefore you can move on.\n\n340\n00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,810\nThe problem is that can take a little bit\nof processing power and graphics power, so\n\n341\n00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,860\non an older system, that active\ndimming everything else out and\n\n342\n00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,890\nproviding that prompt can actually slow\nthe system down and make it drag along.\n\n343\n00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,010\nSo it's not as secure if I turn\nthat feature off but, again,\n\n344\n00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,100\nit might help with older systems.\n\n345\n00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,450\nSo we don't wanna use that option but\nif you've got a system that's\n\n346\n00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,890\ncrying every time the UAC kicks in and\nit's just dragging along.\n\n347\n00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,000\nYou can slide that down one.\n\n348\n00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,510\nYou're still getting\nthe protection from UAC.\n\n349\n00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,699\nIt's just that there's a chance somebody\ncould move the UAC window aside and\n\n350\n00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,090\ntry to do other things and\nthings like that.\n\n351\n00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,370\n>> So it's just that graphic thing, right?\n\n352\n00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,820\nIt can kinda slow the machine down.\n\n353\n00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,430\n>> Yep.\n>> So down there in the little\n\n354\n00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,040\nblue eye, right?\n\n355\n00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,766\nLittle information.\n\n356\n00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,382\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Choose this thing,\n\n357\n00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:54,200\nall of it takes a long time to\ndim the desktop on your computer.\n\n358\n00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,020\nI guess, yeah.\n\n359\n00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,717\n>> That's exactly what\nthey're talking about.\n\n360\n00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:57,500\n>> There you go.\n\n361\n00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,185\nSo the secure desktop, right?\n\n362\n00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It halts everything behind it and\n\n363\n00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,190\nit kind of freezes it,\nand it's a good thing.\n\n364\n00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:04,980\n>> It is.\n>> It's a good thing.\n\n365\n00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,200\nSo that let's say if there's\na particular malicious program.\n\n366\n00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,420\nAnd if it's trying to perform an action,\nand that UAC prompt pops up.\n\n367\n00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,580\nIf things in the background can still run\nand do things, then a malicious program\n\n368\n00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:24,670\ncould potentially hide it, minimize it,\nor if there's some other window open,\n\n369\n00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,950\nit can hide behind that-\n>> Select yes for you on that UAC prompt.\n\n370\n00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,060\nMm-hm.\n>> I mean yeah.\n\n371\n00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:37,730\nSo exactly, that's why we want to stop\neverything, why we're responding to that.\n\n372\n00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,140\nAnd then the lowest setting right there,\nso never notify me for basically anything.\n\n373\n00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,615\nAnd this essentially here just\ndisables user account control,\n\n374\n00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:48,784\nwhich you know user account control,\nit's a good thing.\n\n375\n00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:49,348\n>> It is.\n\n376\n00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:53,000\n>> And is it, Mike you know,\nwe kind of joke.\n\n377\n00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,210\nYou know and if it's like your following\ninstructions on how to do something and\n\n378\n00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,610\nif there is ever a point in\nthe instructions that say either one,\n\n379\n00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,960\nturn off your firewall,\nor B, turn off UAC.\n\n380\n00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,460\nIt's like okay, well hold on,\nsomething's going on here.\n\n381\n00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,203\n>> I know what you mean.\n\n382\n00:18:09,203 --> 00:18:11,776\nYou're looking at some tutorial online and\ntheir solution for\n\n383\n00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:14,280\nyour problem is just to\nturn off the firewall.\n\n384\n00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,710\nThat will fix it, just turn off UAC.\n\n385\n00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,180\nNot a good idea.\n\n386\n00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,400\nBecause it is, it's keeping us safe.\n\n387\n00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,020\nYou really want to make sure, and\nwhat I tell people, people come in and\n\n388\n00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,870\nthey say oh it's so annoying.\n\n389\n00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,750\nIn the end, in a corporate environment,\n\n390\n00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,510\nyour end users are not usually\nadministrators on a local machine.\n\n391\n00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,270\nAnd they're typically not doing things\nthat require administrative access.\n\n392\n00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,320\nThey're not going in and\nchanging TCP IP P sector.\n\n393\n00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,810\nThey're not doing things like that, and\nif they are they probably shouldn't be.\n\n394\n00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,730\nSo this is going to protect us from that.\n\n395\n00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:49,384\nAs an IT person, I can see where it gets\na little annoying, but the level of safety\n\n396\n00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:52,140\nthat I'm getting and the protection I'm\ngetting from it, I think is well worth it.\n\n397\n00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,960\nAnd if my end users get upset about it,\nI'm just gonna tell them look,\n\n398\n00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,560\nyou shouldn't be doing that anyway.\n\n399\n00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,140\nYou're not an administrator so you have to\nstay out of those settings, because you're\n\n400\n00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,440\ngoing to end up making more work for\nme, you're going to get in there and\n\n401\n00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,100\ngoof something up and\nI'm going to have to go fix it.\n\n402\n00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,839\n>> So you tell your end user, you just\nneed to stay out of those settings.\n\n403\n00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,295\n>> Yes.\n\n404\n00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:11,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's good, no?\n\n405\n00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,150\nIn the end, they should be sending emails\nor surfing the Internet, ordering product,\n\n406\n00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,110\nI don't know.\n\n407\n00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:22,200\nThey shouldn't be working with some of\nthe settings on their machine, right?\n\n408\n00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,900\n>> No, that's cool.\n\n409\n00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,800\n>> I like it.\n\n410\n00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800\n>> That's pretty sweet.\n\n411\n00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,110\nAnyhow, given in some situations or\nsome scenarios or some hypotheticals that\n\n412\n00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:38,160\nmay come up in conversation or\nif you're gonna be quizzed on it.\n\n413\n00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,830\nYou may at some point.\n\n414\n00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,850\nIs that If you ever need to lessen UAC.\n\n415\n00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:49,030\nIf there's an engineering department or\nan R&D department that they don't need or\n\n416\n00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,360\ndon't want to be bothered by it,\nor something or other.\n\n417\n00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,740\nThen there we go, we move this slider and\nquickly adjust its involvement.\n\n418\n00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,390\n>> The easiest Nate said this is\ndefinitely the easy way to go.\n\n419\n00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,700\nRight?\nIt's a nice little slider.\n\n420\n00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,370\nI can just slide that up and down.\n\n421\n00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,090\nAnd I can configure my UAC.\n\n422\n00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,350\nThe downside is you're only\naffecting that one machine.\n\n423\n00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,910\nRight?\n\n424\n00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,980\nAnd if I wanna do it to where\nI'm affecting multiple machines.\n\n425\n00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,980\nIf I wanna disable the UAC for\nthe entire R and D department, or\n\n426\n00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,890\nif I want to adjust the way\nthe admin behavior prompt works for\n\n427\n00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,410\nthe entire network or\na subset of machines,\n\n428\n00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,930\nthen we're going to go into a group\npolicy and a domain and do it that way.\n\n429\n00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,970\nWhich we'll cover in\nanother another episode.\n\n430\n00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,570\nYou can still set the settings\nwith a local policy as well.\n\n431\n00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,620\nAnd in fact, you get a little\nmore control if you go into your\n\n432\n00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,060\nlocal group policy on that machine,\nstill affecting just that one machine, but\n\n433\n00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,500\nyou've got a little more control over it.\n\n434\n00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,005\nSome cool options in that.\n\n435\n00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:40,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n436\n00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,740\n>> So why don't we take a look at those\nwhile we're talking about it, huh?\n\n437\n00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,150\n>> You want me to pull\nit up on my machine?\n\n438\n00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,630\n>> Either way, I've got it right here,\nif you want me to show it.\n\n439\n00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,000\n>> All right.\n\n440\n00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,800\n>> Either way.\n\n441\n00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,760\nThere we go.\n\n442\n00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,540\nSo what I'm gonna do is,\n\n443\n00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,720\nI'm just gonna type in gpedit.msc to\npull up my local group policy editor.\n\n444\n00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,760\nYou know what msc stands for?\n\n445\n00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,050\nMicrosoft console.\n\n446\n00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,220\n>> All right.\n>> I believe.\n\n447\n00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,520\nThat's what I always say.\n\n448\n00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,435\n>> Okay.\n>> I could be completely wrong but.\n\n449\n00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:09,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can get my little cursor to move this\n\n450\n00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,990\nguy over just a little bit.\n\n451\n00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,360\n>> It's tricky.\n>> There we go, it is on these virtuals.\n\n452\n00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,510\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nhead under the computer half of this\n\n453\n00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,640\nlocal policy.\n\n454\n00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,630\nGonna head into Windows settings and\nthen down to Security Settings and\n\n455\n00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,200\nthen into Local Policies and\nthen Security Options.\n\n456\n00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,820\nAnd way down towards the bottom\nof my Security Options here,\n\n457\n00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,710\nI have a bunch of settings for UAC.\n\n458\n00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:36,030\nSo you can see there's several\ndifferent settings that I can use\n\n459\n00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,140\nto control the behavior of the UAC.\n\n460\n00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,670\nAnd we won't go over all of them,\n\n461\n00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,470\nbut a couple that we should definitely\nbe familiar with is this first one,\n\n462\n00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,346\nAdmin approval mode for\nthe built in administrator account.\n\n463\n00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:50,850\nSo if I double-click on that one, I can\nsee that's it's currently turned off, but\n\n464\n00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,120\nif I look at the Explain tab,\nif this is turned on,\n\n465\n00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,400\nbuilt in administrator account uses\nadmin approval mode by default.\n\n466\n00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,040\nAny operation that requires elevation\nof privilege with will prompt the user\n\n467\n00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,770\nto approve the operation.\n\n468\n00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,710\nIn other words with a disabled,\nI don't get the UAC, if I'm logged in\n\n469\n00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,250\nas an administrator, somebody that's\nin the local administrators group.\n\n470\n00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,320\nAnd if I turn that on, then as an\nadministrator, I will still get prompted.\n\n471\n00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,020\nSo that's one, another one we should\nprobably look at is the behavior for\n\n472\n00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,330\nthe elevation prompt.\n\n473\n00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,280\nAnd there's where we get that\ndefault behavior of prompt for\n\n474\n00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,940\nconsent for non-Windows binaries.\n\n475\n00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,060\nSo if it's not a Windows program,\nit is gonna prompt me.\n\n476\n00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,450\nYou see my other choices there.\n\n477\n00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,180\nI can just say, hey you know what,\ngo ahead and elevate it anyway.\n\n478\n00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,960\nOr I can say prompt for\ncredentials on the secure desktop, so\n\n479\n00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,050\nit's gonna dim everything out.\n\n480\n00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,210\nPrompt for consent, the difference between\ncredentials and consent, credentials means\n\n481\n00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:52,110\ntype in your user name and password,\nconsent means click yes or no.\n\n482\n00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,460\nWhat's another good one to show everybody?\n\n483\n00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,980\n>> You know, one similar to that.\n\n484\n00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,800\nYeah just below that one you have\nhighlighted there, yeah so the same thing,\n\n485\n00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,730\nbut instead you know the first one was for\nadministrators.\n\n486\n00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,455\nBut this one would just be for\nour standard users so.\n\n487\n00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:12,905\nSo perhaps administrators you\ngive a little bit more trust.\n\n488\n00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:17,745\nSo maybe for administrators we'll\njust let everything run, and\n\n489\n00:23:17,745 --> 00:23:21,005\nhey, sure, just don't profit anything.\n\n490\n00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:24,496\nFor the standards users,\nSally in accounting,\n\n491\n00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:28,935\nwho knows what she's clicking\non these days and we just want.\n\n492\n00:23:28,935 --> 00:23:30,104\n>> You should watch Sally, I tell you,\n\n493\n00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:31,632\nI don't know where she\ngets some of that stuff.\n\n494\n00:23:31,632 --> 00:23:37,671\n[LAUGH] Let's see, run all\nadministrators in admin approval mode.\n\n495\n00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:41,805\nThat is enable by default, and\nthat's going to make sure that,\n\n496\n00:23:41,805 --> 00:23:46,784\nmust be enabled in related UAC policy\nsettings, also be set for the built-in\n\n497\n00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:52,090\nadministrator account, and then anybody\nthat's in the administrators group.\n\n498\n00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,250\nAnd that's most of the.\n\n499\n00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,460\n>> The one just below that.\n\n500\n00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,750\n>> Secure, yeah.\n\n501\n00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,000\nYep that guy right there.\n\n502\n00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,870\nSo user account control,\nswitch on the secure desktop.\n\n503\n00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,640\nSo that is where you know,\nof course on the virtual machine,\n\n504\n00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,100\nwhen we saw it turned the background blue,\nright?\n\n505\n00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,850\nBut you know,\n\n506\n00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,860\nif you launch it on your own Windows 7 PC,\nit was just kinda dimmed, right?\n\n507\n00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,820\n>> Yeah, kinda smoke screened or\nkinda greys everything out.\n\n508\n00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,820\nThat kinda thing.\n\n509\n00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,855\nAnd that is turned on by default,\nas we can see there.\n\n510\n00:24:18,855 --> 00:24:19,610\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n511\n00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,210\nTurned on yep, by default.\n\n512\n00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,890\nAnd you know, if you don't want it,\ndon't want that screen or\n\n513\n00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,620\nwhatnot, then yeah,\nright there, we can, so\n\n514\n00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,010\nwould that be disabling that would\nthen turn off the secure desktop?\n\n515\n00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,600\n>> Correct.\n>> Okay.\n\n516\n00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,160\n>> Yep.\n\n517\n00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,310\nSo if we go in here and choose Disabled,\n\n518\n00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:41,465\nall elevation requests of the interactive\nuser desktop promptly, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n519\n00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:44,040\nSo yeah,\nit goes to the interactive user desktop.\n\n520\n00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,410\nSo it's not greying it out.\n\n521\n00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,970\nIt's going to be right there on\nyour desktop with everything else.\n\n522\n00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,890\nSo you could just not click on it and\nkeep browsing Windows and\n\n523\n00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,570\ndoing whatever you were doing and\njust ignore it.\n\n524\n00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,840\n>> Pretty much, pretty much.\n\n525\n00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,720\nWell, now the one task,\nyou were trying to run\n\n526\n00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,270\n>> Oh yeah, yeah.\n\n527\n00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,040\n>> But anything else you want to do,\nallows me to just move that aside and\n\n528\n00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,700\nopen Internet Explorer or\nsomething, I don't know.\n\n529\n00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,680\nYeah, you definitely could.\n\n530\n00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,000\n>> So Mike, on your own PC, right?\n\n531\n00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,130\nSo how do you have UI configured.\n\n532\n00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,415\n>> You know, what?\nI leave the defaults.\n\n533\n00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:11,610\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n534\n00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,310\n>> I've left it pretty much\nat the default settings.\n\n535\n00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,420\nIt really doesn't annoy me\nenough to go in and change it.\n\n536\n00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,750\nI like the level of security\nthat I get from it.\n\n537\n00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,320\nAnd so it doesn't bother me.\n\n538\n00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,380\nWhen I do something that requires\nadministrative credentials,\n\n539\n00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,160\nI have to click Yes.\n\n540\n00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,150\n>> Oh, God.\n>> It kills me to click yes.\n\n541\n00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,640\nSo, yeah, I leave it on the defaults.\n\n542\n00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,600\nThat way I know, that I'm relatively\nsecure as far as UAC is doing its job\n\n543\n00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,888\nto keep me safe from malware.\n\n544\n00:25:36,888 --> 00:25:39,141\nI'm okay with that.\n\n545\n00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:41,570\n>> Now, let's see.\n\n546\n00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:45,360\nSo when we saw that example,\nwhen we opened up command prompt.\n\n547\n00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,590\nAnd so that right there,\nI didn't have to put in my credentials.\n\n548\n00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,200\nSo that was just prompting for consent\n>> Right.\n\n549\n00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,290\n>> Now, if we were logged in\nas a standard user, right?\n\n550\n00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:59,060\nThen instead of that yes or\nno it would prompt for a username and\n\n551\n00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,670\na password to continue on.\n\n552\n00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,130\n>> Absolutely.\n\n553\n00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,040\n>> To go that way.\nAll right.\n\n554\n00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,870\nMike, anything else with good old UAC?\n\n555\n00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,080\nWe've kind of burned through\nthis segment there on UAC.\n\n556\n00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,560\n>> Yeah.\nThat went a lot longer than I than\n\n557\n00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,260\nI thought it would.\n\n558\n00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,240\nBut there's a lot of good stuff about UAC.\n\n559\n00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,590\nNo, I think we covered it\npretty much top to bottom.\n\n560\n00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,540\n>> Good deal.\nWe do have a few minutes left, but\n\n561\n00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,400\nI think what we'll do is we'll go\nahead and take our break here.\n\n562\n00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,020\nCuz we are kinda switching gears.\n\n563\n00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,570\nWe'll be getting in to authentication and\n\n564\n00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,400\nauthorization and user accounts and\ncredentials and good stuff like that.\n\n565\n00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,110\n>> Sounds like a plan.\n\n566\n00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,632\n>> Sweet.\n\n567\n00:26:35,632 --> 00:26:39,555\nAll right well, we'll get into all that\ncool neat technology after the break.\n\n568\n00:26:39,555 --> 00:26:46,595\n[SOUND].\n\n569\n00:26:46,595 --> 00:26:48,520\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n570\n00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,710\nAll right, so where we left off, right?\n\n571\n00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,490\nWe wrapped up talking about good old UAC.\n\n572\n00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,170\n>> We did.\n\n573\n00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:58,570\n>> And so now we're gonna get into\nauthentication and authorization.\n\n574\n00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,290\n>> Good stuff.\n\n575\n00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,070\n>> From the client side.\n\n576\n00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,665\n>> From the client side.\n\n577\n00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:01,165\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n578\n00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,880\nYup.\n>> So up first, oops wrong button.\n\n579\n00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,970\nSorry.\n\n580\n00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,650\n>> Misclick.\n\n581\n00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,460\n>> Yeah, misclick.\n\n582\n00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,550\nLet me minimize and go back here.\n\n583\n00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:17,970\nAll right, so up first, we'll get\ninto resolving authentication issues.\n\n584\n00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,740\n>> Right.\n>> Now authentication issues, right?\n\n585\n00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,460\nSo Mike, real quick, let's tell us what's\nthe difference between authentication and\n\n586\n00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,410\nauthorization, boom.\n\n587\n00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,000\n>> I think authentication,\nit's like you're reading my mind.\n\n588\n00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,110\nI was like you really can't start\nany conversation about this without\n\n589\n00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,956\ndifferentiating between the two, right?\n\n590\n00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:37,670\nCuz it is, it's something where I\nsee people trying to use those terms\n\n591\n00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,200\ninterchangeably.\n\n592\n00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,640\nAnd it's important that we\nunderstand the difference,\n\n593\n00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,540\nbecause that's gonna help\nus in our troubleshooting.\n\n594\n00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,590\nIf we don't know,\nif it's an authentication issue\n\n595\n00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,790\nversus an authorization issue,\nit's going to be more difficult\n\n596\n00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:52,980\nto trace that problem down and where\ndo we start to try to find the problem?\n\n597\n00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,430\nSo, authentication is\nverifying your identity or,\n\n598\n00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:01,830\nverifying the if we want to be general,\nverifying the identity of someone or\n\n599\n00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,080\nsomething, because your\ncomputers have to authenticate.\n\n600\n00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,800\nThey're gonna log in with your domain,\nand things like that.\n\n601\n00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,950\nSo authentication is just proving\nyour identity, verifying who you are.\n\n602\n00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:18,030\nAuthorization is determining what rights\nyou have, if any over a particular object.\n\n603\n00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:23,480\nAnd we can't be authorized,\nif we don't know who you are, right?\n\n604\n00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,120\nSo authorization can't occur until\nauthentication has occurred.\n\n605\n00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,250\nUnless we're talking about anonymous\nauthentication, in which case,\n\n606\n00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,290\nthere is no authentication.\n\n607\n00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,630\nAnd then, authorization can't occur.\n\n608\n00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:38,760\nBut for the most part, authorization only\noccurs after successful authentication.\n\n609\n00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,660\nIn other words,\nI can't tell you what rights or\n\n610\n00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,260\npermissions you have over this object,\nif I don't know who you are, right?\n\n611\n00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,010\nHow can I determine if you\nhave read permission or\n\n612\n00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,770\nwrite permission,\nif I don't know who you are?\n\n613\n00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,710\nSo first authentication,\nthen authorization.\n\n614\n00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,560\nAll right.\n\n615\n00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,480\nAnd so authentication can be\ndone several different ways.\n\n616\n00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,090\nThe most common way is username and\npassword.\n\n617\n00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,220\nIt's easy to implement.\n\n618\n00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,360\nIt's not the most secure solution, but\nit is relatively easy to implement.\n\n619\n00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,430\nIt's built into our\nWindows operating systems.\n\n620\n00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:11,020\nThere's no extra infrastructure\nto provide or anything like that.\n\n621\n00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,270\nSo that's typically what we see.\n\n622\n00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,430\nBut others, I don't know if we\ntalk about it in this class or\n\n623\n00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:20,290\nanother episode, but\nbasically, there's three\n\n624\n00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:24,620\nthings we'll talk about it when we talk\nabout multi-factor identification.\n\n625\n00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,910\n>> We are covering multi-factor later\non in our little list of stuff.\n\n626\n00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,730\nLet's just touch on now.\n\n627\n00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,360\nWe're already in the mood of\ntalking about authentication.\n\n628\n00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,770\nSo, we have the idea of\nmultifactor authentication.\n\n629\n00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:42,490\nNow, there's three types\nof authentication, right?\n\n630\n00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,994\nWe have something that you know,\nsomething that you have and\n\n631\n00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,479\nsomething that you are, right?\n\n632\n00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:51,786\nSo something that you know, right?\n\n633\n00:29:51,786 --> 00:29:53,810\nThe username and password.\n\n634\n00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,580\n>> Like I know my password\nthat goes to that account.\n\n635\n00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:00,850\n>> Yup, and then we have something you\nhave ,like a token or a smartcard.\n\n636\n00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,850\nAs a matter of fact,\nas I keep something in my pocket.\n\n637\n00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,580\nSo, we have this right here.\n\n638\n00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,530\nLet me hold it in front of my shirt.\n\n639\n00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,760\nSo, there you can see it.\n\n640\n00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,870\nSo here is a little,\nwhat would you call it?\n\n641\n00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,540\n>> RFID.\n\n642\n00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,560\nIt's a token.\n\n643\n00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,530\n>> A token.\nRight.\n\n644\n00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,500\nAnd it's a little thing.\n\n645\n00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,400\nSo we use this for access in the building.\n\n646\n00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,140\nSo in the studio here right.\n\n647\n00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,280\nThis is like super secure, right?\n\n648\n00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,830\nSo, if we're gonna even\nget inside the door,\n\n649\n00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,700\n>> We're in the Batcave.\n\n650\n00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,300\n>> You have to have one of these\nwith the correct access onto it.\n\n651\n00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,070\nSo, this is something that you have.\n\n652\n00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,140\n>> We have several of these little\nsensors on different doors,\n\n653\n00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,040\nand we can control each one of those\nRFIDs puts out a particular code.\n\n654\n00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,300\nSo I can decide whether Nate's allowed\nto come through this door or not.\n\n655\n00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:47,150\nHe might be able to get into the studio,\nbut not into the server closet, or\n\n656\n00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:47,820\nsomething like that.\n\n657\n00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,880\nBecause if he get's in there,\nman it's It's just a mess.\n\n658\n00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,990\nSo yeah,\nthat's another form of authentication, or\n\n659\n00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,250\nusing some type of token.\n\n660\n00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,030\n>> Or in Tim's office.\n\n661\n00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,750\n>> Or in Tim's office.\n\n662\n00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,450\n>> Hey neighbor.\n\n663\n00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,910\n>> That's where the thermostat is for\nthe AC, so we got to get in there.\n\n664\n00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,879\n>> Oh yeah, that's right,\nit's all in Tim's office.\n\n665\n00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,740\nYeah, so that's something that you have.\n\n666\n00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,710\nThe last thing is something you are.\n\n667\n00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:15,730\nSomething you are gets into the idea\nof biometrics, something on your body.\n\n668\n00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,840\nWe have different kinds of biometrics,\nlike fingerprint readers,\n\n669\n00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,590\nwhich we do have a fingerprint reader\nhere in the building to log in people.\n\n670\n00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,600\n>> Log in and log out.\n\n671\n00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,820\n>> People coming and going.\n\n672\n00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,230\nWe have things like Retina Scanners.\n\n673\n00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,200\n>> Iris Scanners, voice brands,\nFace Recognition or\n\n674\n00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,730\nFacial Recognition,\nHand Geometry is a cool one.\n\n675\n00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,830\nVascular Recognition is one that I've\nbeen reading up on, that's up and coming,\n\n676\n00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,440\nwhich is pretty cool.\n\n677\n00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,090\nSo a lot of different things\nwe could do with biometrics.\n\n678\n00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,755\nAnd biometrics is one of those things,\nthat's been taking off recently and\n\n679\n00:31:47,755 --> 00:31:49,250\nis getting better and better.\n\n680\n00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,361\nWhen it first came out,\nsome of the initial fingerprint scanners,\n\n681\n00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:53,460\nthey're not that hot.\n\n682\n00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,590\nBut definitely,\nmade a lot of improvements.\n\n683\n00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:58,362\nSo when we talk about multi-factor\nauthentication as Nate just said,\n\n684\n00:31:58,362 --> 00:32:01,130\nthere's really three things we\ncan base authentication on.\n\n685\n00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,055\nSomething you know,\nsomething you have, something you are.\n\n686\n00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:06,710\nMulti-factor means I'm gonna\ncombine more than one of those.\n\n687\n00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,720\nLike a smart card is a real\ngood example of multi-factoring\n\n688\n00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,970\nauthentication typically.\n\n689\n00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,900\nBecause we're talking about, you have to\nhave the card itself, to be able to swipe,\n\n690\n00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,475\nbut then you also need the pin, that\ngoes along with that card, to punch in.\n\n691\n00:32:18,475 --> 00:32:19,450\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n692\n00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,350\n>> So two things, we're basing\nauthentication on, something you have, and\n\n693\n00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,720\nsomething you know.\n\n694\n00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,250\nAll right, so Mike, let me ask you this.\n\n695\n00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:34,090\nSo a user name and a password, right,\ntwo forms, multi-factor or not.\n\n696\n00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:34,970\n>> Just not.\n\n697\n00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,730\nIt's really, the account exists.\n\n698\n00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,920\nI mean I guess, some people try to\nsay you know that the account exists,\n\n699\n00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,190\nI don't know, or you have the account.\n\n700\n00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:42,930\nBut you don't really.\n\n701\n00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,970\nThe account is stored in\nthe active directory database.\n\n702\n00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,680\nOr depending on what kind\nof network you're running.\n\n703\n00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,110\nBut you need to know the password that\ngoes with that particular account.\n\n704\n00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,590\nIf I know your password,\nI can log in as you.\n\n705\n00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,650\nI only need one thing.\n\n706\n00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:59,020\nI need your password, or\nsomething you know, and now I know it.\n\n707\n00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,600\nAnd now I can authenticate as you.\n\n708\n00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,070\nSo it's not like I have the account,\nor you have the account.\n\n709\n00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,520\nSo yeah, be careful of that.\n\n710\n00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,460\nUsername password is not multifactor for\nauthentication.\n\n711\n00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,860\n>> That's right.\nSo, yeah.\n\n712\n00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,750\nAnd there we go.\n\n713\n00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:16,710\nNow, with Window's 7,\nwe can manage biometric stuff on there.\n\n714\n00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:22,760\nBut without having the tools there,\nthe options don't really\n\n715\n00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:28,090\nbecome available unless you have the\ntools, or the devices plugged into that.\n\n716\n00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,705\n>> We can't really show you guys anything,\n\n717\n00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:33,382\ncuz I don't have any type of IO\nmetrics set up on this machine.\n\n718\n00:33:33,382 --> 00:33:37,070\nNo fingerprint scanner is plugged in,\nor anything like that.\n\n719\n00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,680\nUnfortunately.\n\n720\n00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,610\n>> Yeah, but if you do,\nWindows 7 fully supports biometrics.\n\n721\n00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:44,560\nYou'll get an applet in your control\npanel, that will allow you to configure or\n\n722\n00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,930\nadjust your biometric settings,\ndepending on what you're using.\n\n723\n00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,193\nMy laptop does facial recognition.\n\n724\n00:33:51,193 --> 00:33:53,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not the best.\n\n725\n00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,220\nIt's not like FBI quality,\nor anything like that.\n\n726\n00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,300\nOr NSA or anything.\n\n727\n00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,800\nBut it's a basic facial recognition\nprogram, where if I sit in front of that\n\n728\n00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,570\ncomputer, that camera picks up my face,\nand it'll unlock the screen.\n\n729\n00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,510\nIf Nate comes over and\nsits in front of my computer,\n\n730\n00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:10,270\nit's gonna see that that's not my face,\nand it's gonna lock that screen.\n\n731\n00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,345\nBut I guarantee you,\nif you took an eight by ten of my face.\n\n732\n00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:13,920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n733\n00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,995\nheld it in front of that camera, it's\nprobably gonna authenticate just fine.\n\n734\n00:34:17,995 --> 00:34:19,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n735\n00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,440\n>> So it's not the high-end type stuff.\n\n736\n00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,850\nBut you're seeing it more and more.\n\n737\n00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,500\nThumbprint.\n\n738\n00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,620\nYou've got thumb drives.\n\n739\n00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,185\nI don't have one, but you've got\nthumb drives now that [CROSSTALK].\n\n740\n00:34:27,185 --> 00:34:28,590\n>> Isn't that a thumb drive, though?\n\n741\n00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,590\nIt is, but it doesn't have\na thumbprint scanner on it.\n\n742\n00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,305\n>> Oh, I see.\n\n743\n00:34:31,305 --> 00:34:32,920\n[LAUGH]\n>> So I've seen some thumb drives, and\n\n744\n00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,870\nsome portable hard drives, that have\nthumbprint scanners built into them.\n\n745\n00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,495\nLaptops that have them\nbuilt into them now.\n\n746\n00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:39,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n747\n00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:41,950\n>> You're seeing it more and more.\n\n748\n00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:42,710\n>> What about the.\n\n749\n00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,850\nSorry.\n\n750\n00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,805\nWhat about your phone?\n\n751\n00:34:44,805 --> 00:34:46,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So your phone has a.\n\n752\n00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,830\n>> It does.\n\n753\n00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,070\nLittle scanner on it.\n\n754\n00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,600\nNow, is that multi-factor?\n\n755\n00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,030\nCuz it's got biometrics on there.\n\n756\n00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,210\nYou have to put your finger on there.\n\n757\n00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,550\nSo, multi-factor?\n\n758\n00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,780\n>> No, cuz if I put my thumb on here,\nit just logs me in.\n\n759\n00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,110\nSo I didn't have to do anything else.\n\n760\n00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,230\nI didn't have to provide the PIN.\n\n761\n00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,810\n>> Here,\nhold it up a little bit higher [LAUGH].\n\n762\n00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,430\n>> Make sure that sky cam's.\n\n763\n00:35:06,430 -->

different ways of\nauthenticating ourselves.\n\n772\n00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:25,440\nAnd then based on what our user, what\npermissions he has, what rights he has.\n\n773\n00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,720\nThen, the next step is,\nwhat do we have access to?\n\n774\n00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,070\nWhether it's printing to\nthe fancy Bizhub printer, or\n\n775\n00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:35,370\nthe junky one that's over in the back.\n\n776\n00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,870\nLogging in at certain times of the day.\n\n777\n00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,120\nNo.\n\n778\n00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,770\n>> Once you've authenticated.\n\n779\n00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,170\nNow, I know who you are.\n\n780\n00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,760\nAnd I can use, and\nwe talked about this in another episode.\n\n781\n00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,120\nIn DFS and our access control list.\n\n782\n00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,610\nAnd now I can control access.\n\n783\n00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:51,850\nI can give you read or\nwrite permission over this file or folder.\n\n784\n00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,970\nOr I can allow you to log onto\nthat particular workstation, or\n\n785\n00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,050\none of the servers.\n\n786\n00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,300\nBecause I know who you are.\n\n787\n00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,840\nAnd now I can authorize you.\n\n788\n00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,950\nI can say yes, this account has\npermission to perform this action.\n\n789\n00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:10,555\nBut I can't do that until you've\nbeen successfully authenticated.\n\n790\n00:36:10,555 --> 00:36:13,305\n[CROSSTALK] So that's basically it again.\n\n791\n00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,590\nMulti-factor authentication.\n\n792\n00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,830\nSimple concept, we're just going to use\nmore than one authentication method.\n\n793\n00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,810\nAnd it's becoming more and\nmore common, because we have,\n\n794\n00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:26,230\nthe technology's becoming less and\nless expensive, easier to implement.\n\n795\n00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,330\nSo you're seeing a lot of it on your\nmilitary bases, they all the CAC,\n\n796\n00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:35,080\nthe common access card, which is just\na smart card with a certificate, and\n\n797\n00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,635\nyou have to have the pin.\n\n798\n00:36:35,635 --> 00:36:38,160\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> All right, so\n\n799\n00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,430\nI guess to come back full circle.\n\n800\n00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,730\nSo our first topic,\nPoint I, letter I, topic I.\n\n801\n00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,005\n>> Right, resolving authentication issues.\n\n802\n00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:50,820\n>> It results in authentication issues.\n\n803\n00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,125\nSo what kind of issues are we looking at?\n\n804\n00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:57,065\nWell, generally it's\ngonna be password issues.\n\n805\n00:36:57,065 --> 00:36:57,565\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n806\n00:36:57,565 --> 00:36:59,015\nIt depends on what we are using for\n\n807\n00:36:59,015 --> 00:36:59,605\nI authentication.\n\n808\n00:36:59,605 --> 00:37:00,335\nReally.\n\n809\n00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:00,875\n>> Yeah.\nYeah.\n\n810\n00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:01,570\nNo doubt.\n\n811\n00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:05,870\n>> So password issues, whether the,\nif you enter in your password, I\n\n812\n00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:10,160\nguess based off of your password policies,\nbut enter in that password too many times,\n\n813\n00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,610\nyou get your account locked out, or\nif you don't know that password.\n\n814\n00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:17,660\n>> You forgot your password, you change\nyour password on a Friday afternoon.\n\n815\n00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,280\nYou know you have a nice holiday weekend,\na three day weekend,\n\n816\n00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,680\nyou come back in on Tuesday and.\n\n817\n00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,470\n>> Or Wednesday.\n\n818\n00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,200\n>> And you're like what did\nI set that password to?\n\n819\n00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,550\nHave you ever done that?\n\n820\n00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,600\nYou know, you're like, all right I'm gonna\nuse a different password than I normally\n\n821\n00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,880\nuse, I'm gonna be smart.\n\n822\n00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,770\nOh yeah.\n>> And I'm not gonna use the same\n\n823\n00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,960\npassword for everything.\n\n824\n00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,070\nSo, on this one, I'm gonna set\nup a nice secure password on.\n\n825\n00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,220\nAnd then, you don't use it for\nthree or four days, and\n\n826\n00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,580\nyou're like,\nwhat the heck did I set that to?\n\n827\n00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,410\n>> Yeah, and then you have to try to\nthink, what was going on that day?\n\n828\n00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,870\nWhat was my train of thought?\n\n829\n00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,390\nWhat would I have picked?\n\n830\n00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,327\n>> What was on my desk\nthat I was looking at?\n\n831\n00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:51,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Particular song that was playing, and\n\n832\n00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,730\nI grabbed some lyric from that.\n\n833\n00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,270\nSo yes,\nwe have to reset passwords now and again.\n\n834\n00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,210\nWhich we can do easily.\n\n835\n00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,650\nWe can into computer management, and\n\n836\n00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,580\nwe can reset a password if somebody\nhas forgotten their password.\n\n837\n00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,210\nWe can show you really quick, if you want.\n\n838\n00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,350\nIt is pretty straight forward.\n\n839\n00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,010\nWell now I got some ideas on how\nI can try to break your password.\n\n840\n00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,097\n>> Right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n841\n00:38:11,097 --> 00:38:11,599\n>> Yeah.\n\n842\n00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,149\nSo okay, so\n\n843\n00:38:12,149 --> 00:38:14,438\nwhat was on the radio\nat 4:55 PM on Friday.\n\n844\n00:38:14,438 --> 00:38:15,270\n>> Exactly.\n\n845\n00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,600\n>> Get a good guess.\n\n846\n00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,410\n>> I'll just go in to computer.\n\n847\n00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,830\nI'm gonna right click on computer off\nthe start menu and choose manage.\n\n848\n00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,780\nSeveral different ways\nyou could get in here.\n\n849\n00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,060\nThen I'm going to go over to Local Users\nand Groups, and go down to Users, and\n\n850\n00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,050\nI'll grab Mr Ronnie Wong's account here.\n\n851\n00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,030\nIf he comes to me and says,\n\n852\n00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,760\nI forgot my password,\nall I have to do is right click on there.\n\n853\n00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,090\nI don't even know if he has,\na password set.\n\n854\n00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,930\nSet password, and it's going to tell me,\n\n855\n00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,830\nit's going to allow me to\nreset his password here.\n\n856\n00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:45,630\nI click Proceed, I can type in his new,\nsuper secret password,\n\n857\n00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:52,970\nand I click okay, and\nit'll reset that password.\n\n858\n00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:57,028\nNow we probably should pay attention\nto a couple of those warnings though.\n\n859\n00:38:57,028 --> 00:38:58,150\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n860\n00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,680\nYou know, it's telling me that\nsome of my encrypted files and\n\n861\n00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,180\nthings like that could be\nbased off of my password.\n\n862\n00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,920\nSo, he might lose access to some of those.\n\n863\n00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,710\nWe can also,\nif he's made a password reset disk,\n\n864\n00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,570\nwhich I think you're going to show\nus how to do in a little bit,\n\n865\n00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,750\nhe's going to need a new password\nreset disk for this new password.\n\n866\n00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,900\nAnd then when I proceed, you'll see the\nuser account will immediately lose access\n\n867\n00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,520\nto all of its encrypted files,\nstored passwords, and\n\n868\n00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,120\nperson security certificate.\n\n869\n00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,140\nSo it's really something we don't\nwant to do if we don't have to.\n\n870\n00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,490\nI'd much rather them try to\nremember what their password is.\n\n871\n00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,400\nOr, have one of those password reset\ndisks, where we can go through the process\n\n872\n00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,030\nthe correct way, instead of forcing it,\nlike I'm doing here.\n\n873\n00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:43,010\nSo let's talk about that,\nit's a much better way.\n\n874\n00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:46,610\nAnd it's something in your home systems,\nthat you really should make\n\n875\n00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,190\na password reset disk, and\nthen you've got to keep that safe.\n\n876\n00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,415\nSo, Mike, do you know where\nyour password reset disk is?\n\n877\n00:39:53,415 --> 00:39:55,921\n>> [LAUGH] No.\n\n878\n00:39:55,921 --> 00:39:56,881\nAll right.\n\n879\n00:39:56,881 --> 00:39:58,211\nDo as I say, not as I do.\n\n880\n00:39:58,211 --> 00:39:58,871\n>> Oh.\n\n881\n00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:00,621\nOh yeah.\nRight.\n\n882\n00:40:00,621 --> 00:40:05,088\nI thought you were at least gonna say, oh\nyeah, I stored in LastPass or something.\n\n883\n00:40:05,088 --> 00:40:07,918\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> My online password manager.\n\n884\n00:40:07,918 --> 00:40:12,052\n>> But LastPass doesn't work on your logon\nscreen on your Windows operating system.\n\n885\n00:40:12,052 --> 00:40:14,721\n>> No, it doesn't.\nBut you can add Secure Notes, so\n\n886\n00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:17,421\nyou can jot down your Wi-Fi password.\n\n887\n00:40:17,421 --> 00:40:18,150\nNot Wi-Fi.\n\n888\n00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,086\nIt can remember that stuff too.\n\n889\n00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,216\nKeep it, anyways.\n\n890\n00:40:21,216 --> 00:40:21,880\nAll right.\n\n891\n00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,410\nCSO, password.\n\n892\n00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,840\n>> Yeah, resetting password, right there,\ncomputer management, easy enough.\n\n893\n00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,600\nAgain, just be careful with that\nbecause if they've got encrypted files,\n\n894\n00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,520\nif they have certificates issued to them,\nthose are gonna become invalid.\n\n895\n00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,398\nSo we really don't wanna have to reset\nthat password like that if we can help it.\n\n896\n00:40:36,398 --> 00:40:42,870\nWhich is why that reset disk is really\nimportant for Soho's and things like that.\n\n897\n00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,660\nSo let's take a peek at how we can create\none of those password reset disks.\n\n898\n00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,450\n>> All right.\n\n899\n00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,590\nYeah.\n\n900\n00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,970\nFor sure.\nSo on this machine here,\n\n901\n00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:51,960\non this virtual machine.\n\n902\n00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,180\nSo we'll go and\ncreate that password reset disk.\n\n903\n00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,490\nNow to get there we'll click on Start.\n\n904\n00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,810\nWe'll go into our Control Panel.\n\n905\n00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:05,480\nAnd we'll go into our \"User Accounts\" and\n\"Family Safety.\" and,\n\n906\n00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,970\nwe'll go into \"User Accounts.\" So,\nwhen you click on \"User Accounts\",\n\n907\n00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,670\nit will automatically go into\nwhoever is currently logged in.\n\n908\n00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,710\nThere we go.\n\n909\n00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,900\nThere's me.\n\n910\n00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,100\nThen, over on this left hand side,\n\"Create a password reset.\" Disk.\n\n911\n00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,910\nSo we will click on it.\n\n912\n00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,110\nThis neat little wizard launches.\n\n913\n00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,680\nWelcome to the Forgotten Password Wizard.\n\n914\n00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,030\nYou can store it on an USB flash drive or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n915\n00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:37,340\nIn this machine, there is a floppy\ndisk that is connected in there.\n\n916\n00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,670\nAnd so we'll click on next and so-\n>> All right, there you go.\n\n917\n00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,610\n>> Either stick in your speed drive or\nsomething and for\n\n918\n00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:48,660\nthis that little funky drive,\nwe'll click on next and\n\n919\n00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,090\nnow I think click on the,\nenter in the current password.\n\n920\n00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,880\nSo if I've forgotten it, and\n\n921\n00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,210\nI'm still logged in like will I\ndon't remember what my password is,\n\n922\n00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:01,600\nI better not log out, in other words\nlog myself out well, you still need it.\n\n923\n00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,580\n>> Yeah.\n>> To create this password reset disk.\n\n924\n00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:07,290\n>> And that's a good thing otherwise I\ncould potentially if you had stayed logged\n\n925\n00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,920\ninto your machine and walked away,\nI could quickly walk over your machine,\n\n926\n00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,980\nthrow in a USB drive and\ncreate a password reset disk for you.\n\n927\n00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,380\nNot for you.\nFor me, right?\n\n928\n00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,730\nAnd then take it with me.\n\n929\n00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:22,570\nSo this is making sure that you are the\nauthorized person for this account and\n\n930\n00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:25,270\nthat gives you permission to\nmake that password reset disc.\n\n931\n00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:28,160\nSo this is something you do\nbefore you forget your password.\n\n932\n00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,760\nIn other words,\nonce you set your password,\n\n933\n00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,040\none of the first things you should do\nif you're following best practices,\n\n934\n00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,970\nis create this password reset disk.\n\n935\n00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:35,870\nAnd it's not gonna.\n\n936\n00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,020\nWhat it does.\nAnd you can go ahead and\n\n937\n00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,325\nwalk through it as we talk here.\n\n938\n00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:38,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n939\n00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,380\n>> So\nyou're gonna put in your current password.\n\n940\n00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,130\nAnd it stores information\nabout your current password.\n\n941\n00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,180\nAnd if you forget your password, it's\nnot gonna just unlock the computer for\n\n942\n00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:51,200\nyou, but it has your password\ninformation as a hash stored in there.\n\n943\n00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,750\nAnd so it can verify that and\nthen let you reset your password.\n\n944\n00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,700\nYou know how normally if you go\nto reset your password you have\n\n945\n00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,210\nto type in your old password.\n\n946\n00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,790\nThen type in your new password twice and\nit'll let you change your password.\n\n947\n00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,280\nWell if you don't know your password\nHow can you type in your old password?\n\n948\n00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,160\nIt's now stored on this floppy disk.\n\n949\n00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,150\nSo it's gonna let me reset my password,\nget the old password from the disk.\n\n950\n00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,030\nAllow me to type in my new password twice.\n\n951\n00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:12,910\nAnd we're good to go.\n\n952\n00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,850\n>> You know what,\nlet's take a gander at that.\n\n953\n00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:18,020\n>> Okay.\n>> So I'll just minimize that window,\n\n954\n00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,130\nwe'll jump into this one here.\n\n955\n00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,390\nAll right, so\nthis is that same virtual machine.\n\n956\n00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,020\nThis is accessing through\na different means.\n\n957\n00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:31,310\nI'll just click on my name here and I'll\njust enter in something and click on this.\n\n958\n00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,700\nOh wait, no, it is incorrect.\n\n959\n00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,200\nOh, dang, that's too bad.\n\n960\n00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,110\nSo here, password hid, I don't want,\nyou can't really see it.\n\n961\n00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:39,910\n>> Right.\n\n962\n00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:43,220\n>> Doesn't give a lot away, so\nwe can just click on the little link.\n\n963\n00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,115\nYeah, I apologize it's a little small.\n\n964\n00:43:46,115 --> 00:43:46,770\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n965\n00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,910\nChoose reset password.\n\n966\n00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:50,840\n>> Reset password, and\nthen welcome to the password reset wizard.\n\n967\n00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,430\nOkay?\nCool.\n\n968\n00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,170\nWe'll click on next, and\n\n969\n00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:58,190\nthen we have to insert that little USB\ndrive or you know, the floppy disk.\n\n970\n00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:01,600\nWhich will, floppy disk is in there,\nwe'll click on Next.\n\n971\n00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,260\nAnd so there we go.\n\n972\n00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,680\nIt used that password\nthat was saved on there.\n\n973\n00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,730\nAnd so we don't have to\nenter it in anymore and so\n\n974\n00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,400\nwe can just create a new password.\n\n975\n00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,010\nSo we'll just enter in\na brand new password.\n\n976\n00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:16,860\n>> So important to understand, it's not\nshowing what my password used to be.\n\n977\n00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,890\nIt's not gonna tell me\nwhat my old password.\n\n978\n00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,970\nIt's just gonna say, all right,\nI know you at one point knew it.\n\n979\n00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,970\nNow I'm going to let you change it.\n\n980\n00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,700\nAnd you've got to keep that disk safe.\n\n981\n00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,830\nYou know, if I get access to that disk,\nI could walk up to your computer,\n\n982\n00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:33,950\ntry to type in the password, get it wrong,\nclick on that reset password link,\n\n983\n00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:36,360\npop in that disk and\nit goes, oh well, sure.\n\n984\n00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,540\nI'll let you change it\nto something you know.\n\n985\n00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,290\nAnd I could get logged in as you.\n\n986\n00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,470\nAnd set your password to something you\ndon't know so you couldn't log back in.\n\n987\n00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,830\nSo yeah, gotta keep that disk\nsafe once you create one.\n\n988\n00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,650\nPerfect.\n\n989\n00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:49,470\nLook at that.\n\n990\n00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,240\n>> Yep.\nAnd there we go.\n\n991\n00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:50,770\n>> Like a charm.\n\n992\n00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:55,650\n>> Fancy.\nSo Mike, I'll share a story with you.\n\n993\n00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:59,910\nSo I have a server, I guess you'd\ncall it a server, at the house.\n\n994\n00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,230\nA media server.\n\n995\n00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:04,360\nI host all my media files and music and\nmovies and all that stuff on their so\n\n996\n00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,570\nI can access.\n\n997\n00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,080\n>> Legally obtained movies and music.\n\n998\n00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,530\n>> Of course.\n\n999\n00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:09,910\nRepresent the house.\n\n1000\n00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:13,643\nAnd so I can access it on smartphone and\ntablet.\n\n1001\n00:45:13,643 --> 00:45:18,370\nBrother in law, he can log into it\nremotely and all sorts of things.\n\n1002\n00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:19,070\nWell-\n>> Cool.\n\n1003\n00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:23,530\n>> On all my devices I used to access it,\nit automatically logs in.\n\n1004\n00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:27,030\nWell, I forgot the password for it.\n\n1005\n00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,510\nAnd I realized this and\n\n1006\n00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:32,860\nI was doing something and I needed it I\nwas still logged in, I was like oh, crap.\n\n1007\n00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,280\nI don't wanna log out.\n\n1008\n00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:34,780\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n1009\n00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,580\nBecause then I'll have to\n\n1010\n00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,170\nput that password in,\nand I don't remember it.\n\n1011\n00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,940\nOh, that's right,\nI was trying to remote desktop into it.\n\n1012\n00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,540\n>> Okay.\n\n1013\n00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:45,540\n>> And I couldn't, I was like oh man, you\nknow, my desktop, it automatically does it\n\n1014\n00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:51,670\nbut this other machine, I don't know\nthe password, and so I created a new user.\n\n1015\n00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,130\nI gave it administrative rights.\n\n1016\n00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:59,460\nSo, now the default admin account,\nI have no idea what that password is.\n\n1017\n00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,620\nSo, now I just log in\neverything under that new user.\n\n1018\n00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,930\nI quickly created.\n\n1019\n00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,900\nAnd so now, I can reset it and\n\n1020\n00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,990\nfinally accept all the the Windows\nupdates and everything and let it reboot.\n\n1021\n00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:12,170\nSo, yea-\n>> I can reset that default admin password\n\n1022\n00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:12,840\nif you want me to.\n\n1023\n00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:21,836\n>> You know, I don't [LAUGH]\n>> I have a special disk for that.\n\n1024\n00:46:21,836 --> 00:46:25,100\n>> Yeah.\nI don't think that's a good idea, Mike.\n\n1025\n00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,590\n>> All right, so yes.\n\n1026\n00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:29,210\nAgain just make sure you keep that disk\nsafe, because Windows gives us that\n\n1027\n00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:31,660\ncapability, because we know we're\ngoing to forget our password.\n\n1028\n00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,030\nIn a domain environment as a domain admin,\nwe can go in and\n\n1029\n00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:37,460\nreset passwords in active directory.\n\n1030\n00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,200\nBut for home users and for Sohos where\nwe're not running active directory,\n\n1031\n00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,390\nthere is no centralized\nmanagement of that password.\n\n1032\n00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:47,790\nSo we need to be able to somehow reset\nthat password if we forget it or\n\n1033\n00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,880\nget logged back in and\nchange it to something we know.\n\n1034\n00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,670\nSo great that we're able to\ncreate that password reset disk.\n\n1035\n00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,946\nJust make sure you keep that disk safe,\nmake sure you create one in the first\n\n1036\n00:46:56,946 --> 00:46:59,353\nplace while you still remember\nwhat your password is.\n\n1037\n00:46:59,353 --> 00:47:00,751\n>> Yep.\n\n1038\n00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:04,390\nWe did talk a little\nbit about smart cards.\n\n1039\n00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:09,170\nSmart cards, have a certificate\nthat is on that smart card.\n\n1040\n00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:14,500\nLet say you need to some how manage, or\ndo something with those certificates\n\n1041\n00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:20,080\nas it pertains to login, or\ntied to a user account now.\n\n1042\n00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:26,780\nIn a corporate environment, it might be a\ncertificate stored in a central location,\n\n1043\n00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,050\nit might, but in this case we'll\njust deal with locally stored stuff.\n\n1044\n00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:34,870\n>> You know, and I guess the big\nthing that we got to learn,\n\n1045\n00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:38,650\nat least at the client level, is how to\nmanage our certificates, which, I think,\n\n1046\n00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,510\nis one of our sub-objectives\nhere coming up.\n\n1047\n00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,500\nSo we're going to tie it together.\n\n1048\n00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,711\nBut, your certificates,\nwhen you get a certificate,\n\n1049\n00:47:45,711 --> 00:47:50,356\nthat's going to be stored by default on\nyour local hard drive in a secure location\n\n1050\n00:47:50,356 --> 00:47:54,960\nin your profile, so I could end up losing\nthat certificate if I lose my profile.\n\n1051\n00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,987\nAnd if somebody deletes my profile,\nif my hard drive becomes corrupt,\n\n1052\n00:47:57,987 --> 00:48:01,167\nmy profile becomes corrupt,\nsomebody reinstalls the operating system,\n\n1053\n00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:03,910\nseveral different ways I could\nend up losing that certificate.\n\n1054\n00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,640\nAnd so we need to make sure we've got\na good backup of that certificate so\n\n1055\n00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,270\nwe can replace it if\nsomething like that happens.\n\n1056\n00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,290\nAnd so it's just a matter,\nwe can come in here and\n\n1057\n00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,520\nwe can work with something called\na Microsoft Management Console.\n\n1058\n00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,140\nAnd we can work with certificates that\nhave been issued to our user accounts and\n\n1059\n00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,470\nwe can back those certificates up.\n\n1060\n00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,000\nWe can export them onto a removable media,\n\n1061\n00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,140\nand then store that removable media\nin a vault or somewhere safe.\n\n1062\n00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,064\nThat way, if something happens, we can\njust import that certificate back in.\n\n1063\n00:48:31,064 --> 00:48:32,291\nAnd in a vault?\n\n1064\n00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:37,563\nI'm sorry,\nI think a safe place like a desk drawer.\n\n1065\n00:48:37,563 --> 00:48:38,880\nA desk drawer.\n\n1066\n00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,628\nWell, why not right?\n\n1067\n00:48:39,628 --> 00:48:43,629\n>> Because if I sit down at your desk and\nstart looking through your drawers and\n\n1068\n00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,700\nsay oh look here's a disk\nthat says certificate backup.\n\n1069\n00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,030\n>> No,\nthe desk drawer with the false bottom.\n\n1070\n00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,420\n>> You got one of those, huh?\n\n1071\n00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,550\n>> Sticky tape underneath the drawer or\nsomething.\n\n1072\n00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:53,360\n>> That would work too.\n\n1073\n00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,000\nI think I like that.\n\n1074\n00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,470\n>> A vault?\n\n1075\n00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,485\n>> Yeah, I know,\nwho has a freaking vault, right?\n\n1076\n00:48:57,485 --> 00:49:00,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well I used to say, like in a,\n\n1077\n00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:01,585\nyeah no, that's good.\n\n1078\n00:49:01,585 --> 00:49:06,940\n[LAUGH] Just make sure it's kept away\nfrom where people can find it easily.\n\n1079\n00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,390\nSo if you have a false bottom\ndrawer then that's perfect.\n\n1080\n00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:11,070\n>> A hollowed out book.\n\n1081\n00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:16,770\nBy the way we should do that,\ninstead of digging through firewall,\n\n1082\n00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:21,880\nnot firewall logs but oh, we should\nhollow, find a book and hollow it out.\n\n1083\n00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,460\n>> Right.\n\n1084\n00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,000\n>> So you can just stick stuff in there.\n\n1085\n00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,760\n>> Okay, so yeah, not even related, but\nhaven't you always wanted to do that?\n\n1086\n00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,770\nYou know, you open up a book, and\n\n1087\n00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:30,290\nit's got a perfect cut out of a shape of\nwhatever you're trying to hide in there?\n\n1088\n00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,642\n>> Yes, all the time.\n\n1089\n00:49:31,642 --> 00:49:32,985\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna try that this weekend.\n\n1090\n00:49:32,985 --> 00:49:33,902\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1091\n00:49:33,902 --> 00:49:37,270\n>> All right, so let's take a peek at\nhow we can manage those certificates so\n\n1092\n00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:38,360\nin case something goes wrong and\n\n1093\n00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,582\nwe need to replace them\n>> So we flip over to my machine for\n\n1094\n00:49:41,582 --> 00:49:42,362\nan end user.\n\n1095\n00:49:42,362 --> 00:49:44,580\nAn end user can manage\ntheir own certificates.\n\n1096\n00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,510\nThey don't need to be an administrator\non the machine or anything like that.\n\n1097\n00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:49,690\nThey can manage their own certificates.\n\n1098\n00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,390\nWhat they'll do, is you go to your Start\nmenu, or something like this, or you can\n\n1099\n00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:57,900\ndo it from the command prompt and type\nin MMC for Microsoft Management Console.\n\n1100\n00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,160\nAnd I'll launch an MMC, and\n\n1101\n00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,990\nwe cover an MMC pretty heavily,\nthere's a good old UAC.\n\n1102\n00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:07,060\nWe cover the MMC pretty heavily in another\nepisode, so I won't go into too much\n\n1103\n00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:13,250\ndetail here, but I'm going to add,\nmaybe, we'll just leave that.\n\n1104\n00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,380\nI'm going to do File >\nAdd > Remove > Snap-in,\n\n1105\n00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,480\nand I'm going to add my\ncertificates snap-in.\n\n1106\n00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,520\nI'm going to click Add.\n\n1107\n00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,060\nBecause I'm an administrator,\nnot only can I work with my user account,\n\n1108\n00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:26,070\nI can work with service accounts and\nthe computer account certificates as well.\n\n1109\n00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,750\nBut I'm gonna stick with my user account.\n\n1110\n00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,320\nI'll click Finish.\n\n1111\n00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,520\nAnd then I'll click OK.\n\n1112\n00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,720\nAnd now I've got my MMC setup.\n\n1113\n00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,370\n>> Oh, you got it.\n\n1114\n00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:35,040\n>> That time we got it.\n\n1115\n00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,230\nAnd if I take a peek\nunderneath personal and\n\n1116\n00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:40,060\ncertificates, I can see\nthat I have a certificate.\n\n1117\n00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,680\nNow this certificate is not for\nauthentication.\n\n1118\n00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,930\nThis is a certificate for\nEFS or Encrypting File System.\n\n1119\n00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:50,770\nBut same principle as far as how we\nwould manage these certificates.\n\n1120\n00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:54,370\nSo if I wanna make sure that if I\nwant a backup of the certificate,\n\n1121\n00:50:54,370 --> 00:51:00,080\nI'm gonna right-click and\nthen All Tasks and Export.\n\n1122\n00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,770\nIt's gonna launch my Export Wizard\nwhere I can click Next on my Wizard.\n\n1123\n00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,300\nI'm gonna tell it Yes,\nI want to export the private key.\n\n1124\n00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,780\nBecause, I'm trying to back\nthat key up and keep it safe.\n\n1125\n00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,720\nSo, I'll click Next.\n\n1126\n00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:16,700\nBecause it's including the private key,\nI have to do the PKCS number 12,\n\n1127\n00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:21,090\nwhich just had that particular format\nthat includes the private key.\n\n1128\n00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,880\nI could delete the private key if\nthe export was successful, but\n\n1129\n00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,670\nthat's not what I want to do.\n\n1130\n00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:29,420\nIf I was leaving that machine and\nI might want to take my key with me.\n\n1131\n00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,490\nI want to export it and I don't want\nto leave a copy on the machine.\n\n1132\n00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:35,350\nIf it's my computer that I use every day,\nI just want a backup and\n\n1133\n00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:36,750\nI want the key to stay where it is.\n\n1134\n00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,510\nSo I don't want it to leave the key.\n\n1135\n00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:40,110\nI'll click Next.\n\n1136\n00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,210\nBecause it does include my private key,\n\n1137\n00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:49,117\nI will be required to\npassword protect that file.\n\n1138\n00:51:49,117 --> 00:51:51,435\nAnd I'll give it a name.\n\n1139\n00:51:51,435 --> 00:51:55,697\nEFS backup.\n\n1140\n00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:59,285\n>> Like a really descriptive name,\nthis is my private key export backup.\n\n1141\n00:51:59,285 --> 00:52:00,031\n>> Please steal me.\n\n1142\n00:52:00,031 --> 00:52:03,895\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then finish, and\n\n1143\n00:52:03,895 --> 00:52:05,745\nit tells me the export was successful.\n\n1144\n00:52:06,872 --> 00:52:10,950\nAll right, and\nnow if I go take a peek, and\n\n1145\n00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:12,810\nI didn't pay attention to\nwhere I actually sent that.\n\n1146\n00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,470\n>> Probably buried in Windows somewhere.\n\n1147\n00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:22,012\n>> Easy way to find out.\n\n1148\n00:52:26,493 --> 00:52:28,908\nI'll just go do this one\nmore time real quick.\n\n1149\n00:52:38,335 --> 00:52:40,930\n>> So I guess you don't have\ncomplexity requirements?\n\n1150\n00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:41,450\n>> No.\n\n1151\n00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,815\n>> In that password.\n\n1152\n00:52:42,815 --> 00:52:45,010\n[LAUGH]\n>> Went into System 32 of all\n\n1153\n00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:46,310\nplaces, nice.\n\n1154\n00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:50,840\nAll right, so now if we I can\ntake a peek over here at SQL and\n\n1155\n00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,012\nWindows System 32.\n\n1156\n00:52:55,012 --> 00:52:59,920\nWay on down there,\nI'm gonna call it, EFS backup?\n\n1157\n00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,420\n>> Yep.\n\n1158\n00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:03,940\n>> And there it is, nice.\n\n1159\n00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:11,980\nLet's just move that somewhere\na little bit better.\n\n1160\n00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,294\n>> Oh, that's right, in the D drive\nbecause that was the, the [CROSSTALK].\n\n1161\n00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:18,240\n>> So\nthere is my backup on my certificate.\n\n1162\n00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,310\nNow if I was to lose my certificate.\n\n1163\n00:53:23,748 --> 00:53:26,284\nOops.\n\n1164\n00:53:26,284 --> 00:53:27,560\n>> Oh.\n\n1165\n00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,000\nThen we can go back over\nto my backup that I had,\n\n1166\n00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,860\nget that disk out of the vault and\nput it back in here.\n\n1167\n00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,470\nI'm going to double-click on it.\n\n1168\n00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:38,080\nAnd it's gonna launch that import wizard.\n\n1169\n00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,470\nI click Next.\n\n1170\n00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:42,700\nAnd it finds the location there\ncuz I double-clicked on it.\n\n1171\n00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,290\nI wanna click Next.\n\n1172\n00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,500\nI did password protect it.\n\n1173\n00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,290\nNow I gotta remember what password I used.\n\n1174\n00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:53,060\nAnd here's a trick, you've gotta,\nwhen you import that key, if I ever\n\n1175\n00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,800\nwanna be able to export it again, I do\nhave to choose mark the key as exportable,\n\n1176\n00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,530\notherwise I won't be able to export it.\n\n1177\n00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,960\nSo I do want to mark it as exportable.\n\n1178\n00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,570\nClick Next.\n\n1179\n00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:06,020\nAnd I'll let it place it\nwhere it thinks the best is.\n\n1180\n00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,510\nIt should go into my user.\n\n1181\n00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,140\nFinish.\n\n1182\n00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,930\nImport was successful.\n\n1183\n00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:16,620\nI come back over here and\nI refresh and my certificate is back.\n\n1184\n00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:17,520\n>> Sure enough.\n\n1185\n00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,120\n>> Sure enough.\n\n1186\n00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,040\nSo, again,\n\n1187\n00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,460\nmaking sure you got a good backup of\nthe certificate is the important thing.\n\n1188\n00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,290\nThat way if you lose it In\na corporate environment,\n\n1189\n00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:29,440\nthey're probably gonna do some centralized\nmanagement of those certificates.\n\n1190\n00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,630\nSo it might not be up to the end user\nto make sure there's a good backup.\n\n1191\n00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:34,050\nBut in a home environment or\n\n1192\n00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:37,560\nin a SOHO where we don't have\nthat same centralized management.\n\n1193\n00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:41,710\nIt's up to the end user to be able to make\nsure to take care of those certificates.\n\n1194\n00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:45,520\nSo it's very important skill to know,\nto be able to do that.\n\n1195\n00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,120\n>> Nice, and that was an EFS certificate.\n\n1196\n00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:54,840\nThe same steps would be the same if\nit was a certificate to authenticate.\n\n1197\n00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,280\n>> Regardless of what type of certificate,\nsame console to manage it,\n\n1198\n00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,032\nsame steps you would go through to\nexport it, as well as import it.\n\n1199\n00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:01,662\n>> Yep.\n\n1200\n00:55:01,662 --> 00:55:02,500\n>> Nice.\n\n1201\n00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:06,110\nAll right Mike, so\nwe are up here on break time.\n\n1202\n00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:06,860\n>> Already?\n\n1203\n00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,395\n>> I know.\n>> We're just getting started,\n\n1204\n00:55:08,395 --> 00:55:09,200\nwe're having fun.\n\n1205\n00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,780\n>> Every time you get into a groove,\nthey go break time, put the brakes on it.\n\n1206\n00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,310\nGood deal.\n\n1207\n00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,260\nWe've got more exciting,\nfun stuff coming up, and\n\n1208\n00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:20,890\nwe'll save that stuff,\nfor after the break.\n\n1209\n00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:27,259\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n1210\n00:55:27,259 --> 00:55:28,580\nWelcome back.\n\n1211\n00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,780\nAll right, so where we left off,\n\n1212\n00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,460\nwe were talking about-\n>> Certificates.\n\n1213\n00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:32,960\n>> Certificates.\n\n1214\n00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:33,560\nThank you, Mike.\n\n1215\n00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:38,816\nAnd so to round out certificates, we're\ngonna talk about this thing called PIV.\n\n1216\n00:55:38,816 --> 00:55:45,490\n>> Smart cards and PIV being one of\nthe standards that we use for smart cards.\n\n1217\n00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:48,720\nAnd smart cards is just a common\nway to use certificates.\n\n1218\n00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,040\nA certificate is just an electronic\ndocument that proves your identity.\n\n1219\n00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,420\nSo it's another means of authentication.\n\n1220\n00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,310\nA little more secure, actually a lot more\nsecure, than say using it in password.\n\n1221\n00:55:58,310 --> 00:55:59,050\nBut how do I use that, right?\n\n1222\n00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:00,660\nIt's an electronic document.\n\n1223\n00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:04,920\nWell, l we have these cards that have\na little microchip embedded into them.\n\n1224\n00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,850\nAnd we can store information in there and\nso\n\n1225\n00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:10,350\nwe'll load your certificate\nup into this smart card.\n\n1226\n00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:11,750\nIf any of you out there are military,\n\n1227\n00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,360\nyou've dealt with your CAC,\nyour Common Access Card.\n\n1228\n00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:14,970\nSame thing.\n\n1229\n00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:15,910\nIt's a type of smart card.\n\n1230\n00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:20,690\nAnd so, now, if I've got that card, I can\nswipe that in the appropriate card reader.\n\n1231\n00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:24,200\nIt can pull that digital certificate\ninformation off of that card.\n\n1232\n00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,210\nAnd I can use that for authentication.\n\n1233\n00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:29,090\nTypically with multi factor\nusually I have to have a pin\n\n1234\n00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,290\nthat goes with that smart card.\n\n1235\n00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:33,580\nMuch like your ATM,\nwhere you swipe you debt card or\n\n1236\n00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,830\nwhat have you, you have to know\nthe pin that goes with it.\n\n1237\n00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:39,710\nIf someone has your smart card,\nthey don't know your pin.\n\n1238\n00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:43,140\nIf somebody has your PIN, hopefully,\nthey don't have your smart card and\n\n1239\n00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,000\nthey won't be able to get access as you.\n\n1240\n00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,810\nAnd PIV is just a federal standard.\n\n1241\n00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:53,600\nWhat is it, FIPS 201,\nFederal Information Processing Standard,\n\n1242\n00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:58,000\nthat specifies what has to\nbe in that certificate.\n\n1243\n00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,740\nAnd what that certificate will be used for\nand how it's developed.\n\n1244\n00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:07,060\nAnd so PIV, Personal Identity\nVerification, is just one of the formats.\n\n1245\n00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:07,840\nThere 's also PIV.\n\n1246\n00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,280\nIf you wanna pull up my screen there,\nJason,\n\n1247\n00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,910\nwe'll see there's a couple new standards\nthat have been implemented recently.\n\n1248\n00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:18,410\nPIV-1, or PIV-I is actually what it is,\nit stands for Inter-operable,\n\n1249\n00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:22,890\nand then CIV which is\nCommercial Identity Verification.\n\n1250\n00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:24,524\nAnd we can see from this little table,\n\n1251\n00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,784\nwe can throw this link in\nthe show notes if we want to.\n\n1252\n00:57:26,784 --> 00:57:28,768\nThis is coming from Smart Card Alliance.\n\n1253\n00:57:28,768 --> 00:57:32,888\nAnd these are just the standards of what\ninformation is in those certificates on\n\n1254\n00:57:32,888 --> 00:57:35,385\nthose smart cards and\nwhat they can be used for.\n\n1255\n00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,000\nMm-hm.\n\n1256\n00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,650\nYou know, Mike,\nI think it would be safe to say that\n\n1257\n00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:44,510\nlooking at this document I think\nthis is gonna be a strong contender\n\n1258\n00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:48,100\nto something that you can dig\nthrough on your next Friday night.\n\n1259\n00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,850\n>> You know,\nI was kinda thinking the same thing.\n\n1260\n00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:51,248\nLet me bookmark this real quick.\n\n1261\n00:57:51,248 --> 00:57:52,834\n[LAUGH]\n>> What are you saying I haven't\n\n1262\n00:57:52,834 --> 00:57:53,600\nalready read it?\n\n1263\n00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,465\n>> Oh, man.\n\n1264\n00:57:54,465 --> 00:57:56,306\n[CROSSTALK] Oops.\n\n1265\n00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,590\nYeah, yeah.\n\n1266\n00:57:58,590 --> 00:57:59,120\nSomething.\n\n1267\n00:57:59,120 --> 00:57:59,690\nAll right.\n\n1268\n00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:00,890\nRight.\n\n1269\n00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,440\nAll right.\nSo we got the smart cards, right?\n\n1270\n00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,270\nAnd so, our user has now authenticated.\n\n1271\n00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:05,920\n>> Right.\n>> And so, now,\n\n1272\n00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,230\nlet's talk about the idea\nof authorization.\n\n1273\n00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:11,800\nAnd so,\nwhat is he authorized to do, right?\n\n1274\n00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,790\nSo this user, once they get in.\n\n1275\n00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:17,960\nAnd so\nit kind of brings along with User rights.\n\n1276\n00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,460\n>> Correct.\n>> Right?\n\n1277\n00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,230\nSo, what can they do?\n\n1278\n00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:23,910\nNow before we get into rights-\n>> I think you're going to right\n\n1279\n00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:24,870\nthe same page.\n\n1280\n00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,170\nLet's see.\nLet's see.\n\n1281\n00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,000\nGo ahead.\n\n1282\n00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,530\n>> All right,\nwell as Mike said let's talk a minute.\n\n1283\n00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:35,260\nAre you going to explain to us the\ndifference between Rights and Permissions.\n\n1284\n00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:35,940\nOh, is that it?\n\n1285\n00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,130\n>> It's like we're just on\nthe same page here today.\n\n1286\n00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,150\nIt's a good day.\n\n1287\n00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:41,150\nAnd that's exactly what\nI was thinking too.\n\n1288\n00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:45,280\nBecause when you see configuring rights,\na lot of people will get confused and\n\n1289\n00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,340\nthink about permissions.\n\n1290\n00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:50,950\nLike the ability to read a file or\na folder, or write to a file or a folder,\n\n1291\n00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,130\nsomething like that.\n\n1292\n00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:55,820\nAnd just important we understand,\npermissions are over a single object.\n\n1293\n00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:01,490\nSo, I assign you permissions over\na folder, or I assign you permissions\n\n1294\n00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:05,340\nover a file, or I assign you permissions\nover an active directory object.\n\n1295\n00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,550\nAnd they're over a single\nparticular object.\n\n1296\n00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:10,320\nNow, those permissions might inherit\nto other objects, but again,\n\n1297\n00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,030\nthe permissions are over a single object.\n\n1298\n00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:15,690\nWhereas rights are typically\na system wide thing.\n\n1299\n00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:18,530\nLike I have the right to\nlog on to that server.\n\n1300\n00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:22,110\nI have the right to change\nthe time on that machine.\n\n1301\n00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:26,890\nI have the right to reboot that server or\nthe right to back up that server.\n\n1302\n00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:29,190\nSo, rights are system wide,\n\n1303\n00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:32,980\nwhereas permissions are more\nabout over an individual object.\n\n1304\n00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,915\nSo, just a clarification there,\nterminology wise.\n\n1305\n00:59:34,915 --> 00:59:36,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1306\n00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:36,830\nRight.\n\n1307\n00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:42,850\nSo then, permissions give you\nthe ability over something.\n\n1308\n00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,490\n>> Right.\n>> But then rights is like an action.\n\n1309\n00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:46,390\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n1310\n00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:47,160\nSort of.\n\n1311\n00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:47,750\n>> Exactly.\n\n1312\n00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,740\nAnd we cover permissions\nin our show the other day.\n\n1313\n00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:55,110\nWhen we got into our NTFS permissions and\nour share permissions.\n\n1314\n00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:56,470\nAnd so we cover those extensively.\n\n1315\n00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:59,360\nSo, if you missed that,\ngo check out that episode from yesterday.\n\n1316\n00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,290\nOr Part one of this episode actually\nis the one that that was in.\n\n1317\n01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:05,030\nSo, look back at the shows and\n\n1318\n01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:08,410\ntake a peek at that if you want\na refresher or haven't seen that one yet.\n\n1319\n01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:10,530\nGood episode.\n\n1320\n01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:12,930\nLet's take a peek at rights.\n\n1321\n01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:14,390\n>> So, configuring our rights.\n\n1322\n01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:18,230\nWe can do that in the local,\nlow group policy.\n\n1323\n01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:21,934\nMichael, do you have that-\n>> I happen to have a machine here that we\n\n1324\n01:00:21,934 --> 01:00:23,990\ncan use as demonstration.\n\n1325\n01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,050\nHandy Andy.\n\n1326\n01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:27,360\nI'm gonna close my little console\nthere that I made earlier.\n\n1327\n01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,020\nAnd actually I'm already in\nthe local group policy editor.\n\n1328\n01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:36,510\nSo, earlier in our first segment on this\nepisode I went down to the start menu,\n\n1329\n01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:39,590\ntyped in GPedit.msc.\n\n1330\n01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:42,490\nAnd that launches my local\ngroup policy editor.\n\n1331\n01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:45,040\nAnd then, within my local GPO, or\n\n1332\n01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:50,300\nmy local group policy, I can come into\nmy Window settings under My Computer.\n\n1333\n01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:50,880\nConfiguration.\n\n1334\n01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,470\nAnd then Security Settings,\nthen Local Policies, and\n\n1335\n01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:58,090\nthen there we go, User Rights Assignments.\n\n1336\n01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:02,700\nAnd so, these are all the different rights\nthat I can assign using my local GPO.\n\n1337\n01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:06,310\nAs I was saying,\nallow to logon locally for example.\n\n1338\n01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:08,940\nAllow to logon through\nremote desktop services.\n\n1339\n01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:11,560\nDeny logon locally.\n\n1340\n01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,930\nSeveral different rights I can assign\nthrough here, and just like any other GPO,\n\n1341\n01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:20,460\nif I want to change one of these,\nI just double click on it.\n\n1342\n01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:24,740\nI can see there, the administrators, back\nup writers, operators, guests, and users.\n\n1343\n01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:27,080\nAll have the ability to log on locally.\n\n1344\n01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,370\nIf I want to add somebody,\nI can click add.\n\n1345\n01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:32,968\nIf I can find, Nathan.\n\n1346\n01:01:32,968 --> 01:01:33,633\nNo.\n\n1347\n01:01:33,633 --> 01:01:35,585\nDo you not have an account on my machine?\n\n1348\n01:01:35,585 --> 01:01:36,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1349\n01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:36,710\nYeah.\nShould just.\n\n1350\n01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:37,850\nYeah.\n\n1351\n01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:40,700\nIt should be, Nathan, yeah.\n\n1352\n01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,250\n>> There we go.\n\n1353\n01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:45,870\nNow, Nathan has the ability to sit at\nthis machine and log on interactively.\n\n1354\n01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:46,960\nActually, touch the keyboard.\n\n1355\n01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,430\nSo, that's how we go about\nassigning user rights.\n\n1356\n01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:52,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1357\n01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:55,070\nSo, just as simple as that then.\n\n1358\n01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:56,120\n>> That's it.\n>> Now,\n\n1359\n01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,970\nare there any other rights that we\ncan assign that's not in this list?\n\n1360\n01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:02,750\nOr is that just the one\ngo-to place to configure?\n\n1361\n01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:05,760\n>> This is really it, as far as I know.\n\n1362\n01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,770\nThere might be some others\nin some other places but\n\n1363\n01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:11,880\nthese are the most common\nones that we use, for sure.\n\n1364\n01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,010\nIt's not the only way to assign rights,\nthough.\n\n1365\n01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:17,060\nYou can assign rights here,\nby adding a user account or\n\n1366\n01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,600\na group to one of these policies.\n\n1367\n01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,200\nThere's also some built in accounts\nthat already have certain rights\n\n1368\n01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,440\nassociated with them.\n\n1369\n01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,030\nLike the administrators group.\n\n1370\n01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:27,980\nWe know that the administrators can do\njust about anything on this system.\n\n1371\n01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:28,800\nWhy?\n\n1372\n01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,690\nWell, because I can see that\nthe administrators have been assigned all\n\n1373\n01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,580\nthese different rights in this local GPO.\n\n1374\n01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:38,085\nSo, this is why the administrators\ngroup has all those rights.\n\n1375\n01:02:38,085 --> 01:02:39,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1376\n01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:42,440\n>> So, in the permissions little bit.\n\n1377\n01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,800\nDid you guys get into user versus groups?\n\n1378\n01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,220\nOr users in groups that sort of thing?\n\n1379\n01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:46,780\n>> Yep.\nMm-hm.\n\n1380\n01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:52,385\n>> So then, if you wanna give a user\nthe right to allow log on locally.\n\n1381\n01:02:52,385 --> 01:02:54,450\n>> Mm-hm.\nLike I did here.\n\n1382\n01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:56,650\nYep.\n>> So, not only can you add in\n\n1383\n01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:58,130\nthat specific person.\n\n1384\n01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:01,720\nYou can also add that person\nto the administrator's group.\n\n1385\n01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,065\nIt accomplished the same kind of thing.\n\n1386\n01:03:04,065 --> 01:03:05,350\n>> Correct, correct.\nWe always want to be\n\n1387\n01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:06,210\ncareful with that though.\n\n1388\n01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:10,470\nWe want to make sure we understand what\nrights come along with those groups.\n\n1389\n01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:13,330\nBecause I want to give your\npermission to log on locally.\n\n1390\n01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:15,260\nSo, I add you to the administrative group.\n\n1391\n01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,090\nWell, yes, now you can log on locally but\n\n1392\n01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:19,459\nyou can also do a lot more\nthan log on locally right?\n\n1393\n01:03:19,459 --> 01:03:21,080\nYou have full control over my system.\n\n1394\n01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,580\nSo, we can use those groups, but\n\n1395\n01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:25,860\nwe do have to be aware of what\nrights come along with those groups.\n\n1396\n01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,980\nI can also add groups here.\n\n1397\n01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:31,649\nI think I created a group the other\nday called hosts on our other episode.\n\n1398\n01:03:31,649 --> 01:03:32,280\nMaybe not.\n\n1399\n01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:40,869\nYeah, maybe not, but if I had a group,\nI don't think I have any groups\n\n1400\n01:03:40,869 --> 01:03:45,260\non this machine to be honest with you.\n\n1401\n01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:49,290\nMaybe I want to give somebody like-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1402\n01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,920\n>> I don't know what that is actually.\n\n1403\n01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,360\nWe'll just take the,\nwhat's a good one to use?\n\n1404\n01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,890\n>> Batch.\nOh, authenticate user-\n\n1405\n01:03:56,890 --> 01:03:58,980\n>> Which I think is already in that list.\n\n1406\n01:03:58,980 --> 01:03:59,752\nThere we go.\nSo, now,\n\n1407\n01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,009\nI've added the authenticated users.\n\n1408\n01:04:01,009 --> 01:04:04,869\nAnd I've given them to\na right to log on locally.\n\n1409\n01:04:04,869 --> 01:04:07,450\nSo, you can assign, just like we\ntalked about in our other episode,\n\n1410\n01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:10,000\nyou can assign these rights to users,\nwe can assign them to groups.\n\n1411\n01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,662\nTypically a good idea to assign it to\na group rather than directly to a user\n\n1412\n01:04:13,662 --> 01:04:14,210\naccount.\n\n1413\n01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:16,870\n>> Mm-hm, all right, so good deal.\n\n1414\n01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:21,550\nAnything else on user rights, or\nconfiguring, or those sorts of things?\n\n1415\n01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:23,550\n>> I think we're good to go there,\nthat's pretty much all we need for\n\n1416\n01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:24,275\nthis particular exam.\n\n1417\n01:04:24,275 --> 01:04:25,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1418\n01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,060\n>> Knowing where we can\ngo to assign those guys.\n\n1419\n01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,030\n>> All right, good deal.\n\n1420\n01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:33,097\nNow, so the next thing that we can\ntouch on, elevating user privileges,\n\n1421\n01:04:33,097 --> 01:04:36,490\nwhich is something that we\nsorta touched on earlier.\n\n1422\n01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:42,220\nMike, you mentioned that\nwe Run As a standard user,\n\n1423\n01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:46,120\neven though we're an administrator here,\nwe Run As a standard user.\n\n1424\n01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,770\nAnd let's say there's a specific task that\n\n1425\n01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:54,630\nwe want to I guess elevate ourselves to,\nyeah so.\n\n1426\n01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:57,730\n>> There are some things where, and\nreally the UAC, as Nate's pointing out,\n\n1427\n01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:59,800\nthe UAC,\nthat's what the UAC is doing, right?\n\n1428\n01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,580\nIt is elevating your credentials so\nthat you can perform some task,\n\n1429\n01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,650\neven though you're logged\non as a standard user,\n\n1430\n01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:08,680\nit's giving you the opportunity\nto elevate your credentials.\n\n1431\n01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,650\nTo type in an administrative username and\npassword, and temporarily use those\n\n1432\n01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:16,730\ncredentials for that one task, and\nperform that administrative task.\n\n1433\n01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:18,980\nThere are some things though,\nthat might not trigger the UAC.\n\n1434\n01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:22,130\nLike I've gone to install\ncertain programs, and\n\n1435\n01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,980\nyou can double click on them,\nand they'll run.\n\n1436\n01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:28,650\nBut they're gonna fail the installation\nbecause it didn't trigger the UAC.\n\n1437\n01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:31,550\nAnd so in the end, the setup program\ndidn't have permission to write\n\n1438\n01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:34,950\nin certain locations, maybe in\nthe registry, or something like that.\n\n1439\n01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:37,820\nSo I might have to manually\nelevate my credentials now and\n\n1440\n01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:42,532\nagain to perform certain actions, or to\nrun certain programs, or things like that.\n\n1441\n01:05:42,532 --> 01:05:48,920\nAnd so we can, if the UAC doesn't kick in,\nI can do a Run As option.\n\n1442\n01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:53,660\nAnd we can do a Run As through the GUI, we\ncan do a Run As from the command prompt,\n\n1443\n01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:55,580\nseveral different ways we\ncan end up doing that.\n\n1444\n01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:58,340\nTypically, we just\nright-click on an object, and\n\n1445\n01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,820\nyou're gonna get the Run As option.\n\n1446\n01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,756\nAnd then that's gonna\ngive you a chance to,\n\n1447\n01:06:02,756 --> 01:06:06,620\nit's gonna open that dialog box where\nyou can type in a different username and\n\n1448\n01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:08,780\npassword than you're\ncurrently logged on with.\n\n1449\n01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:11,890\nAnd that different username and\npassword has a different set of rights and\n\n1450\n01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:13,678\npermissions associated with it, and\n\n1451\n01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:16,830\nthen can therefore execute\nthat particular task.\n\n1452\n01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:19,550\nLike using the administrator\naccount to install an application,\n\n1453\n01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:21,220\nor something like that.\n\n1454\n01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:21,840\nI have seen times,\n\n1455\n01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,310\nsometimes the Run As does not show up\nwhen you right-click on something.\n\n1456\n01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:28,540\nSo a trick for you guys out there,\nShift+right-click.\n\n1457\n01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:32,630\nIf you hold down Shift and right-click on\nsomething, you'll get a slightly different\n\n1458\n01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:35,720\ncontext menu, and\na lot of times that has the Run As option.\n\n1459\n01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,378\nAnd I'll see if I can find an example\nwhile you're, I don't know,\n\n1460\n01:06:38,378 --> 01:06:40,375\nare you getting ready to\ndo some fancy demo for us?\n\n1461\n01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:42,361\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, well, not fancy.\n\n1462\n01:06:42,361 --> 01:06:44,638\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, it is gonna be fancy, I'm sure.\n\n1463\n01:06:44,638 --> 01:06:46,389\n>> Yeah, or something.\n\n1464\n01:06:46,389 --> 01:06:49,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> So yeah, Run As, and again,\n\n1465\n01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,410\nyou can do it from the command prompt.\n\n1466\n01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:55,100\nWe could open up command prompt and do\na little forward slash question mark and\n\n1467\n01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:59,210\nshow you some of the syntax\nthat goes along with that.\n\n1468\n01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:02,450\nBut, yeah, just another way that I can\n\n1469\n01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:05,130\nescalate my credentials when I'm\nlogged on as a standard user.\n\n1470\n01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:08,990\nBecause remember, best practice according\nto Microsoft is not to log in with your\n\n1471\n01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:10,410\nadministrative account, right?\n\n1472\n01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:12,740\nYou have two accounts that you use.\n\n1473\n01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:16,180\nYou have your standard account that\nyou log on to do your everyday tasks.\n\n1474\n01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:20,440\nYou don't need to be an administrator to\nsurf the Internet, check your email, and\n\n1475\n01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,830\nwork with your spreadsheets,\nand things like that.\n\n1476\n01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:26,900\nBut if I'm surfing the Internet as an\nadministrator, or reading my emails logged\n\n1477\n01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:30,600\non as administrator, and I click on some\nmalicious code, there is the potential\n\n1478\n01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:34,230\nthat that malicious code runs with\nthe administrative access to my system.\n\n1479\n01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:36,970\nSo best practice says log\non as a standard user and\n\n1480\n01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:40,250\nonly escalate your\ncredentials when necessary.\n\n1481\n01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:42,320\nAnd that's really what the UAC does for\nme but\n\n1482\n01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:46,340\nsometimes I have to do that manually,\nif it doesn't know how to trigger the UAC.\n\n1483\n01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:52,170\nAnd that's where that Run As\ncomes into play, all right?\n\n1484\n01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:56,450\nSo while Nate's getting that set up,\nit's one of those things,\n\n1485\n01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:58,110\nit's a best practice, right?\n\n1486\n01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:01,350\nBut we all know sometimes\nwe get a little lazy.\n\n1487\n01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:05,470\nAnd as IT people,\nwe log on with that administrative account\n\n1488\n01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:07,830\neven though we know it's\nnot a best practice.\n\n1489\n01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:10,268\nAnd that's really the big\nadvantage of the UAC,\n\n1490\n01:08:10,268 --> 01:08:13,030\nis even though I've logged on\nwith the administrative account,\n\n1491\n01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:16,320\nI'm still really running everything\nunder a standard user context.\n\n1492\n01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,730\nAnd only when I try to do something\nthat requires administrative credentials\n\n1493\n01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:24,240\nis it going to kick in and escalate my\ncredentials temporarily for that one task.\n\n1494\n01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,770\nIf you guys want to do an experiment\nwith this sometime, or\n\n1495\n01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:29,520\nwe might even show you\nhere if we've got time.\n\n1496\n01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,160\nYou know, if you open up Task Manager and\nyou go into that Processes tab,\n\n1497\n01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:38,260\nyou can see what user context each\none of those processes is running as.\n\n1498\n01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:42,550\nAnd so, you'll see that if you\nlog on as a standard user,\n\n1499\n01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:47,130\nyou're explorer.exe, things like that,\nare all running under that user account.\n\n1500\n01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:51,600\nIf you do a Run As to launch say Computer\nManagement, you'll see that one process\n\n1501\n01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,780\nis running as administrator, everything\nelse is still running as a standard user.\n\n1502\n01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,830\nSo you're not escalating\nyour credentials for\n\n1503\n01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:01,080\neverything that's going on,\njust that one particular task.\n\n1504\n01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:04,630\nWhich again is, principle of\nleast privilege, keeping me and\n\n1505\n01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:10,594\nmy system safe from potential risk from\nmalware, and things like that, all right?\n\n1506\n01:09:10,594 --> 01:09:12,196\n>> Mm-hm, all right.\n\n1507\n01:09:12,196 --> 01:09:16,720\nOkay, so I was furiously clicking\naround to find some command, and\n\n1508\n01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,110\nI thought I had one.\n\n1509\n01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:22,610\nBut, so yeah, something that we\nmay encounter along the way.\n\n1510\n01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:23,150\n>> Okay.\n\n1511\n01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:26,350\n>> And that right there is not it.\n\n1512\n01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:31,400\n>> It's not it?\n\n1513\n01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,190\n>> No, my screen share.\n\n1514\n01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:35,590\nGive me just a minute.\n\n1515\n01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:37,320\n>> All right, well while he's doing that,\n\n1516\n01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:40,000\nI can show you an example of what\nI was talking about earlier.\n\n1517\n01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,320\nIf you can take a peek at my computer\nhere, this is just the install program for\n\n1518\n01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,170\na tied DNC.\n\n1519\n01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:51,990\nIf I right-click on this, you notice I\ndo not have an option to Run As, right?\n\n1520\n01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:54,937\nI can click install and in this case,\nI'm logged on as an administrator, so\n\n1521\n01:09:54,937 --> 01:09:57,160\nit should work just fine,\nbut let's pretend I wasn't.\n\n1522\n01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,550\nBut if I right-click,\nI don't see that option.\n\n1523\n01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:05,650\nIf I hold down shift on my keyboard and\nright-click, now you'll see I get\n\n1524\n01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:10,320\na different context menu, and\nthere is my Run As different user.\n\n1525\n01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,170\nSo, I can click on that and then I can\nprovide my administrative account again,\n\n1526\n01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,295\nassuming I was logged on\nas a standard account.\n\n1527\n01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:20,835\nI do my Run As, I do my administrative\naccount, and then just this\n\n1528\n01:10:20,835 --> 01:10:24,895\nparticular task will be running with\nthose administrative credentials.\n\n1529\n01:10:24,895 --> 01:10:29,717\nSo handy to know, like I said, I've never\nactually seen that written anywhere, but\n\n1530\n01:10:29,717 --> 01:10:30,587\nso a good one to know.\n\n1531\n01:10:30,587 --> 01:10:34,337\nShift right-click gives you a lightly\ndifferent context menu, and\n\n1532\n01:10:34,337 --> 01:10:37,567\nit typically will include\nthat Run As a different user.\n\n1533\n01:10:38,887 --> 01:10:44,433\nJust kind of, fumbled across that one,\nI was like hm, that's a good one to know.\n\n1534\n01:10:44,433 --> 01:10:46,958\nHold down shift and right-click on lots\nof things and just see what comes up.\n\n1535\n01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:49,713\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n1536\n01:10:49,713 --> 01:10:51,653\nmy screen share isn't kicking in.\n\n1537\n01:10:51,653 --> 01:10:53,423\n>> Okay.\n>> But I bet we could probably use\n\n1538\n01:10:53,423 --> 01:10:55,168\nyour virtual machine there.\n\n1539\n01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:56,030\n>> Okay.\n>> So if you,\n\n1540\n01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:57,690\nyeah, jump into your virtual machine.\n\n1541\n01:10:57,690 --> 01:10:58,850\n>> Just tell me what you want me to do.\n\n1542\n01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:02,220\n>> And then fire up yeah,\ngood old command prompt.\n\n1543\n01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,720\n>> All right,\njust a standard command prompt?\n\n1544\n01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:06,960\n>> Correct.\nAll right,\n\n1545\n01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,010\nso then type in dism and then hit enter.\n\n1546\n01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:10,770\n>> Good old, dism.\n\n1547\n01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:11,710\n>> All right, so there we go.\n\n1548\n01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:13,630\nSo let's say browsing around, right?\n\n1549\n01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:16,060\nSo you are an administrator, and\n\n1550\n01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,553\nyou're running as the standard\nuser permissions there.\n\n1551\n01:11:18,553 --> 01:11:19,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so you'll\n\n1552\n01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:22,910\nwanna mess around with good old DISM\nthere, and they're right there.\n\n1553\n01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:27,260\nElevated permissions are required\nto run DISM, so there we go.\n\n1554\n01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:30,150\nSo we can use the Run As to run.\n\n1555\n01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:35,370\n>> You can, we could do a Run As,\nif I could type.\n\n1556\n01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:36,695\n>> In the command line?\n\n1557\n01:11:36,695 --> 01:11:41,250\n>> Well, so let me see if I can\npull up the parameters for that.\n\n1558\n01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,529\n>> Hm.\n>> So you can do a Run As from the command\n\n1559\n01:11:43,529 --> 01:11:48,307\nprompt, and you'll see it's Run As and\nthen, if I can find the actual syntax for\n\n1560\n01:11:48,307 --> 01:11:48,950\nthis guy.\n\n1561\n01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:52,354\nWhatever it is you're trying to\ndo as a different user name,\n\n1562\n01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:56,380\nif you're doing a Run As,\nyou're providing alternate credentials.\n\n1563\n01:11:56,380 --> 01:12:00,420\nAnd then what program you're trying to\nrun with those escalated credentials.\n\n1564\n01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:04,667\nAnd you'll see again, all I did if you\nguys saw that out there I did runas/?, so\n\n1565\n01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:06,291\nthat I could get this syntax and\n\n1566\n01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:10,450\nyou'll see there's a bunch of\ndifferent switches that I can use.\n\n1567\n01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:11,080\nAnd then,\n\n1568\n01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:16,070\nhere's some examples of things that\nthey're doing with that runas command.\n\n1569\n01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,600\nBut, I typically do it before.\n\n1570\n01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,860\nI usually know ahead of time that I\nneed an administrative command prompt.\n\n1571\n01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:25,350\nSo what I'm gonna do is go down to my\nStart menu, if I can get my mouse to play.\n\n1572\n01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:29,500\nType in cmd but instead of hitting Enter,\nI'm gonna right-click and\n\n1573\n01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,470\nchoose Run as Administrator.\n\n1574\n01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:33,240\nUAC's gonna say, are you sure?\n\n1575\n01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,400\nAnd I'm gonna say Yes.\n\n1576\n01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,430\nAnd now I've got\nan administrative command prompt.\n\n1577\n01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:42,580\nYou'll see the difference is\ninstead of being at my C:/Users and\n\n1578\n01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:46,500\nthen my user account name,\nI'm at C:\\Windows\\system32.\n\n1579\n01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,645\nDead giveaway that I'm running this\ncommand prompt as an administrator.\n\n1580\n01:12:49,645 --> 01:12:52,660\nOoh, another trick for you guys at home.\n\n1581\n01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:59,060\nType in cmd, instead of right-clicking,\nI can do Ctrl+Shift+Enter,\n\n1582\n01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:04,970\nand whatever I have highlighted\nwill run as administrator.\n\n1583\n01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:06,960\nSo you can see the same thing there.\n\n1584\n01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,728\nSo, Ctrl+Shift+Enter is the keyboard\nshortcut for Run as Administrator.\n\n1585\n01:13:11,728 --> 01:13:15,400\nYou can do that with icons in Windows\nExplorer and things like that, as well.\n\n1586\n01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,771\nOh yeah?\n>> Yep, very handy.\n\n1587\n01:13:17,771 --> 01:13:18,399\n>> Nice.\n\n1588\n01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:19,260\n>> I like it.\n\n1589\n01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:19,840\n>> All right Mike.\n\n1590\n01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,751\nSo let's see.\nSo that's wrapped up, your last little bit\n\n1591\n01:13:22,751 --> 01:13:26,750\nthat we had under configure\nauthentication and authorization.\n\n1592\n01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:29,288\n>> Okay.\n>> The next topic that we have lined up is\n\n1593\n01:13:29,288 --> 01:13:30,186\nBranchCache.\n\n1594\n01:13:30,186 --> 01:13:30,895\n>> Hoo yeah.\n\n1595\n01:13:30,895 --> 01:13:34,746\n>> So BranchCache will definitely be\nswitching gears, moving away, and\n\n1596\n01:13:34,746 --> 01:13:37,300\ngetting into the BranchCache stuff.\n\n1597\n01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:41,835\nWhich, as far as authentication,\nauthorization, UAC,\n\n1598\n01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:48,760\nit's kind of a little bit different than\nI guess the trend that we were following.\n\n1599\n01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:53,560\n>> Yeah, I guess the major point in\nthe objective, if we go back up there,\n\n1600\n01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:56,770\nis actually configuring\naccess to resources.\n\n1601\n01:13:56,770 --> 01:14:00,597\nSo that's why we're kinda, it doesn't\nseem like it should be in this topic, but\n\n1602\n01:14:00,597 --> 01:14:03,426\nconfiguring access to resources\nis going to be things like we\n\n1603\n01:14:03,426 --> 01:14:07,260\ndid in yesterday's episode,\nNTFS permission, share permissions.\n\n1604\n01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:11,860\nLike we did today, UAC,\nrun as, and then BranchCache is\n\n1605\n01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:16,980\nsomething I can use to configure access\nto resources for my branch office users.\n\n1606\n01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,062\nSo probably a good one\nto put in a different,\n\n1607\n01:14:19,062 --> 01:14:22,686\nI don't think we want to try to squeeze\nit in the last five minutes here, no.\n\n1608\n01:14:22,686 --> 01:14:26,320\n>> Yeah, we do have a few\nminutes left on the segment, but\n\n1609\n01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:31,305\nsince we are switching gears,\nwe'll go ahead and take a break here.\n\n1610\n01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:37,686\nAnd then when we get back, we will wrap up\nthis set with some good old BranchCache.\n\n1611\n01:14:37,686 --> 01:14:41,445\nWe'll throw some commands at it and\nwe'll see what it does and how to look for\n\n1612\n01:14:41,445 --> 01:14:42,936\nit and those sorts of things.\n\n1613\n01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:44,479\n>> It's pretty sweet, so\nstick around for that.\n\n1614\n01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:46,729\n>> All right,\nwe'll get on to that after the break.\n\n1615\n01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:53,646\n[SOUND].\n\n1616\n01:14:53,646 --> 01:14:55,561\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n1617\n01:14:55,561 --> 01:15:02,520\nSo after an extended break, we are back to\nfinish up with some good old BranchCache.\n\n1618\n01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,811\nBetter than stick cache?\n\n1619\n01:15:05,811 --> 01:15:06,896\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1620\n01:15:06,896 --> 01:15:07,418\n>> You got the whole branch,\n\n1621\n01:15:07,418 --> 01:15:08,020\nis that what you're saying?\n\n1622\n01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:08,853\n>> Yeah the whole branch.\n\n1623\n01:15:08,853 --> 01:15:10,353\nYeah, I don't know, yeah.\n\n1624\n01:15:10,353 --> 01:15:11,436\n>> It was a good attempt.\n\n1625\n01:15:11,436 --> 01:15:12,812\n>> Thanks, Mike.\n\n1626\n01:15:12,812 --> 01:15:13,889\n>> I liked it, I liked it.\n>> I appreciate that, and\n\n1627\n01:15:13,889 --> 01:15:15,020\nthat's why I like doing shows with you.\n\n1628\n01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,838\n>> Right?\n>> Cuz even though it was a poor joke,\n\n1629\n01:15:17,838 --> 01:15:19,561\nyou still-\n>> I'm still gonna laugh.\n\n1630\n01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:21,228\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I won't leave you hanging like that.\n\n1631\n01:15:21,228 --> 01:15:22,880\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n1632\n01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,180\n>> Yeah, so BranchCache, exactly.\n\n1633\n01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:25,870\nI think that's where we\nleft off in our objectives.\n\n1634\n01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:26,470\nWhat was that?\n\n1635\n01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:27,853\nDo we wanna pull the objectives up?\n\n1636\n01:15:27,853 --> 01:15:29,895\nYeah, I don't have them pulled up right\nnow, I'll get them the end of the show.\n\n1637\n01:15:29,895 --> 01:15:30,686\n>> I got them here.\n\n1638\n01:15:30,686 --> 01:15:31,603\n>> Oh yeah?\nWow, Mike.\n\n1639\n01:15:31,603 --> 01:15:32,395\n>> I do, how about that?\n\n1640\n01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:34,730\n>> Nice.\n\n1641\n01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:37,833\n>> So yeah, we are down here cuz\nin our previous segment we did all\n\n1642\n01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:41,721\nthe credentials and authentication,\npassword resets, things like that.\n\n1643\n01:15:41,721 --> 01:15:44,603\nSo now we're getting ready to\ndo our configuring BranchCache.\n\n1644\n01:15:44,603 --> 01:15:46,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1645\n01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,335\nNow, so BranchCache.\n\n1646\n01:15:47,335 --> 01:15:52,850\nBranchCache is gonna be our I got\nour network optimization technology.\n\n1647\n01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:57,400\nAnd essentially what it does,\nis it caches stuff, right?\n\n1648\n01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,360\nFiles that,\nlet's say you've got a branch office.\n\n1649\n01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:04,500\nAnd the branch office is sitting\nsomewhere, some remote satellite location.\n\n1650\n01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:09,250\nAnd so they've got a, they're over\nthere WAN-linked to the main office.\n\n1651\n01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:13,840\nWell all those users in that\nbranch office are gonna\n\n1652\n01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:18,850\nbe accessing those files over\ntheir WAN link to the home office.\n\n1653\n01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:24,510\nWell, to optimize productivity and\nthe speed of access to those resources,\n\n1654\n01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:29,180\nwe can bring up a server at that\nbranch office, where all those files,\n\n1655\n01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:35,610\nas they're coming down transparent to the\nuser, they will be stored on that server.\n\n1656\n01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:38,740\nOr, the same sort of thing, or\n\n1657\n01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:43,230\nthe PC that accessed those files\nwill be stored on that PC,\n\n1658\n01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:48,395\nto where other users then can connect to\nthat PC to grab access to those documents.\n\n1659\n01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:49,075\n>> Exactly.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1660\n01:16:49,075 --> 01:16:50,055\nPretty fancy stuff.\n\n1661\n01:16:50,055 --> 01:16:50,900\n>> It really is.\nIt really is.\n\n1662\n01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:54,285\nCuz when you think about it, you've\nusually got a central office, right.\n\n1663\n01:16:54,285 --> 01:16:55,865\nAnd that's where most\nof your resources are,\n\n1664\n01:16:55,865 --> 01:16:58,325\nwhere your file servers are sitting and\nthings like that.\n\n1665\n01:16:58,325 --> 01:17:01,665\nAnd those people that are working at these\nsatellite offices, these branch offices,\n\n1666\n01:17:01,665 --> 01:17:05,155\nthey're reliant on that WAN link to\ngo back to the corporate office and\n\n1667\n01:17:05,155 --> 01:17:06,255\naccess those resources.\n\n1668\n01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:09,990\nAnd that WAN link can be slow or\nunreliable, and so\n\n1669\n01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:14,540\nwhen it is, they can't get access to\nthe resources they need to do their job,\n\n1670\n01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,110\nwhich is not a good thing, right?\n\n1671\n01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:18,310\nSo, as you were saying, BranchCache,\n\n1672\n01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:23,390\nit allows me to cache a copy of those\nresources out there at the branch office.\n\n1673\n01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:26,529\nThat way they don't have to go\nacross the WAN link to get to them,\n\n1674\n01:17:26,529 --> 01:17:28,724\nthey can retrieve it\nfrom that cached copy.\n\n1675\n01:17:28,724 --> 01:17:30,100\nAnd depending on the branch office,\n\n1676\n01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,868\nwe've got a couple different\nmodes we can run BranchCache in.\n\n1677\n01:17:32,868 --> 01:17:37,800\nWe've got the hosted cache mode, where if\nthe branch office is big enough to warrant\n\n1678\n01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,390\na server sitting out there, so if we had a\nserver sitting out there, I could use that\n\n1679\n01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:45,570\nserver as the location of where to\nstore the cached copies of the files.\n\n1680\n01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:48,460\nAnd then all the clients on that\nbranch office, they would retrieve\n\n1681\n01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:53,670\nthe files from that local cached copy\ninstead of going across that WAN link.\n\n1682\n01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:57,170\nNow if it's a small office where I\ndon't have a server sitting out there,\n\n1683\n01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:58,780\nwe can still use BranchCache.\n\n1684\n01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:03,090\nWe can just borrow a little piece of each\none of those computers' hard drive and\n\n1685\n01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:04,350\nuse that as the cache.\n\n1686\n01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:06,352\nAnd that's known as\ndistributed cache mode.\n\n1687\n01:18:06,352 --> 01:18:09,780\nWe're gonna distribute the cache\nacross the client machines\n\n1688\n01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:11,160\nfound at that branch office.\n\n1689\n01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,580\nSo if you've got a server out there,\nyou can do hosted cache mode.\n\n1690\n01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:17,360\nIf you don't have a server out there,\nwe can do BranchCache mode, or\n\n1691\n01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,420\nI'm sorry, distributed cache mode.\n\n1692\n01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:21,900\n>> All right, so\nlet's think about this though.\n\n1693\n01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:25,725\nLet's say that Sally in accounting,\nso she's accessing,\n\n1694\n01:18:25,725 --> 01:18:28,900\nlet's say some of these\nsensitive documents.\n\n1695\n01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:32,230\nAnd it's caching that stuff on her PC.\n\n1696\n01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:36,770\nWhat about all the other people\nthat we don't want access to that?\n\n1697\n01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:39,120\nAnd then is she gonna be able\nto get into her cache share?\n\n1698\n01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:39,690\n>> Very good question.\n\n1699\n01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:43,600\nSo when we set up this BranchCache\nit is going to be secure.\n\n1700\n01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,530\nNow we're not gonna eliminate\nall traffic across the WAN link.\n\n1701\n01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:49,600\nWe're gonna reduce the amount of\ntraffic that goes across the WAN link.\n\n1702\n01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,810\nBut, first and foremost,\nsecurity's maintained throughout.\n\n1703\n01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:55,960\nSo if you don't have access to\nthe resource back at the corporate office,\n\n1704\n01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,530\nyou're not gonna get access\nat the branch office.\n\n1705\n01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:00,890\nYou still have to go across and\nget your session ticket.\n\n1706\n01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:03,890\nSo you have to make sure you've got your\nticket granting ticket, retrieve your\n\n1707\n01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:07,810\nsession ticket, you've gotta be on\nthe access control list for that resource.\n\n1708\n01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:10,840\nThe cache is encrypted so\npeople can't browse to it and\n\n1709\n01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:13,520\njust try to open those files directly.\n\n1710\n01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,180\nAnd so it's still secure, and\n\n1711\n01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:18,115\nit guarantees you've got the latest\nversion of the file too.\n\n1712\n01:19:18,115 --> 01:19:21,730\nCuz another question might be well,\nif I'm stuck using this cached copy,\n\n1713\n01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:24,340\nwhat if they've made changes to\nthe file back at the corporate office?\n\n1714\n01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:26,280\nWhat if somebody's updated that file?\n\n1715\n01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,450\nHow do I know I've got\nthe latest version of the file?\n\n1716\n01:19:28,450 --> 01:19:31,508\nAnd that's why I say we're not eliminating\nall traffic across the WAN link.\n\n1717\n01:19:31,508 --> 01:19:35,580\nCuz what's gonna happen,\nwhen Sally goes to access that document,\n\n1718\n01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:39,680\nher computer's gonna send the request\nacross the WAN link to the file server.\n\n1719\n01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:42,853\nBut instead of retrieving the entire file,\nwell, let's say it this way.\n\n1720\n01:19:42,853 --> 01:19:47,501\nFirst it's gonna send a request across\nthat WAN link, and that file server is\n\n1721\n01:19:47,501 --> 01:19:52,380\ngonna send back not the actual file, but\nthe hash value for the file, all right?\n\n1722\n01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:57,050\nGonna retrieve that, then I can get a hash\nvalue of the cached copy of the file.\n\n1723\n01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:59,360\nIf those two values match,\nwe know how hashes work,\n\n1724\n01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,210\nwe've done that in some other episodes.\n\n1725\n01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:04,782\nIf those two values match,\nthen I know that the original document and\n\n1726\n01:20:04,782 --> 01:20:06,830\nthe cache document are the same.\n\n1727\n01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:08,840\nAnd I can just retrieve that cache copy.\n\n1728\n01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:12,400\nIf those two don't match, now I'm gonna\nhave to retrieve the entire document\n\n1729\n01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,625\nacross the WAN link because I\nknow that the cache copy is old.\n\n1730\n01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:19,205\nSo I'll go get the current copy,\nand then I'll cache that one.\n\n1731\n01:20:19,205 --> 01:20:22,465\nAnd the first person\nthat accesses the file,\n\n1732\n01:20:22,465 --> 01:20:24,595\nit's not on the cache server yet, right?\n\n1733\n01:20:24,595 --> 01:20:25,595\nIt hasn't been cached yet.\n\n1734\n01:20:25,595 --> 01:20:28,775\nSo the first person that opens\nthat file has to go across the WAN\n\n1735\n01:20:28,775 --> 01:20:30,610\nlink retrieve the entire file.\n\n1736\n01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:33,140\nBut when they do that,\nthey're gonna open the file,\n\n1737\n01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:35,780\ntheir computer's also gonna\ncache a copy of the file.\n\n1738\n01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:36,990\nSo the second, third,\n\n1739\n01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:40,230\nfourth person at the branch office that\ngoes to access that file, can then\n\n1740\n01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:44,370\nretrieve it from that cache copy instead\nof from going across that WAN link..\n\n1741\n01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:48,675\n>> So, Mike, let me ask you, is a branch\ncache better than branch checks?\n\n1742\n01:20:48,675 --> 01:20:54,035\n>> [LAUGH] You know,\ncash is always better than checks.\n\n1743\n01:20:54,035 --> 01:20:55,013\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now,\n\n1744\n01:20:55,013 --> 01:20:57,829\nas far as what content is\navailable to be cached,\n\n1745\n01:20:57,829 --> 01:21:02,174\nthere's going to be someone that's\nsitting on the server side of things.\n\n1746\n01:21:02,174 --> 01:21:05,369\n>> Right.\n>> That's going to designate certain file\n\n1747\n01:21:05,369 --> 01:21:09,590\nshares as being able to be cached,\nor branch cache enabled.\n\n1748\n01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:10,200\n>> Correct.\n>> So\n\n1749\n01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,960\nas far as the client goes,\nSally in accounting, she's not choosing\n\n1750\n01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:18,410\nwhat she wants to be cached on her\nmachine or on that caching server.\n\n1751\n01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:20,600\nIt will all be done server side.\n\n1752\n01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:23,720\n>> Exactly, the file administrator,\nwhoever is responsible for\n\n1753\n01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:24,360\nthat can decide.\n\n1754\n01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:28,160\nYou might have some sensitive documents\nthat you don't want cached out there on\n\n1755\n01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,700\nthat branch office.\n\n1756\n01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:32,950\nBecause at a branch office we\ntypically have less physical security.\n\n1757\n01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:35,340\nSomebody could walk out with that server,\nand even though it's encrypted,\n\n1758\n01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:38,690\nI mean there's that potential they could\ntry to gain access to that information.\n\n1759\n01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:42,340\nSo you might have some stuff or HIPAA or\nsome other governmental regulation\n\n1760\n01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:45,470\nmight specify that you can't\nstore that in a cache like that.\n\n1761\n01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:49,640\nSo there's difference between some so,\nyou have to go to each share and\n\n1762\n01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:55,450\ndecide on that share whether or not you're\ngonna allow those files to be cached.\n\n1763\n01:21:55,450 --> 01:22:00,130\nAnd we cover this when you guys get\ninto our, gosh I can't think of what\n\n1764\n01:22:00,130 --> 01:22:04,430\nplan it would be, in the four,\nI wanna say it's in the 7411.\n\n1765\n01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:05,590\n>> 10 or 11.\n\n1766\n01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:07,780\n>> One of those,\nwe'll cover the server side of things,\n\n1767\n01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:09,510\nwhere we'll show you how to set it up.\n\n1768\n01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:14,340\nWhat roles you have to install on the file\nservers back at the corporate office.\n\n1769\n01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:17,820\nWhat role I have to install on the server\nout there at the branch office or\n\n1770\n01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,540\nwhat feature, I should say.\n\n1771\n01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:23,132\nBut today, we're gonna probably focus\nprimarily on what it looks like from\n\n1772\n01:22:23,132 --> 01:22:24,376\nthe client perspective.\n\n1773\n01:22:24,376 --> 01:22:29,437\n>> Yep, so we do have an environment set\nup here so that we'll take a look at.\n\n1774\n01:22:29,437 --> 01:22:33,980\nSo on the service side,\nthe branch cache has been enabled and\n\n1775\n01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:36,630\nour shares have been set up.\n\n1776\n01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:41,210\nAt this point we will see, as far as\nthe client side, Mike will so us here,\n\n1777\n01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:45,560\nsome commands on how we can check on the\nstatus or the health of our branch cache.\n\n1778\n01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,420\nPerhaps, what is currently\nbeing cached and\n\n1779\n01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:53,815\nhow we can tell if our particular\nclient is set up as distributed cache,\n\n1780\n01:22:53,815 --> 01:22:57,860\nor as the posted cache.\n\n1781\n01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:01,650\n>> Exactly, as Nate pointed out, you have\nalready set up the server side of things.\n\n1782\n01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:02,990\nWe're not going to take\na peek at that over there.\n\n1783\n01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:04,910\nWe're just going to look at\nit from a client perspective.\n\n1784\n01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:09,720\nFirst of all let me just say\nIn a corporate environment\n\n1785\n01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,170\nwe're most likely using group\npolicy to configure this.\n\n1786\n01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:14,880\nBecause I don't wanna have to\ntouch every single client.\n\n1787\n01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,300\nI'm not gonna go run these\ncommands on each client.\n\n1788\n01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,360\nOne, they're probably out at a branch\noffice that I don't wanna have to\n\n1789\n01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,510\ndrive out to.\n\n1790\n01:23:20,510 --> 01:23:23,650\nIt might be in a different state,\nmight be in a different country.\n\n1791\n01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:27,460\nSo we're typically gonna be using\ngroup policy to do our centralized\n\n1792\n01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:29,450\nmanagement of the settings\non these machines.\n\n1793\n01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:31,280\nBut we can still take a look at it and\n\n1794\n01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,480\nwe can even configure it\nlocally if we need to.\n\n1795\n01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:38,780\nIf you have an office or maybe you\njust like to use the command prompt.\n\n1796\n01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:41,540\nWith group policy we get consistent\napplication of those settings\n\n1797\n01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:42,390\nacross all machines.\n\n1798\n01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:44,570\nSo a much better way to go.\n\n1799\n01:23:44,570 --> 01:23:46,950\nBut anyway, so what I'm gonna do here,\nis I'm gonna, like you said,\n\n1800\n01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:48,360\nthis client has already been set up.\n\n1801\n01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:52,930\nI don't have a server at this\nparticular branch office, so\n\n1802\n01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:57,130\nwe are going to be doing distributed\ncache mode in this case.\n\n1803\n01:23:57,130 --> 01:24:00,310\nSo we're gonna borrow a little piece\nof each computer's hard drive and\n\n1804\n01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:01,120\nuse that as a cache.\n\n1805\n01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,450\nNow you can specify how much, right?\n\n1806\n01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:06,120\nI don't want to take up\ntheir entire hard drive.\n\n1807\n01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:10,830\nSo by default, it's going to take\nup 5% of each client machine\n\n1808\n01:24:10,830 --> 01:24:15,760\nthat is set up to branch cache and\ndistributed cache mode, 5% of each one.\n\n1809\n01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,540\nBut I can change that,\nI can set it to whatever I want.\n\n1810\n01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:21,940\nYou also have to make sure your\nfirewall rules are enabled.\n\n1811\n01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:25,420\nNot only do we have to tell the client\nthat it's going to use branch cache,\n\n1812\n01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:28,270\nyou have to tell the client\nif it's a hosted cache.\n\n1813\n01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:31,960\nShould it be looking for a server that's\nhosting the cache content, or should it be\n\n1814\n01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:35,920\nlooking at the fellow client machines on\nits subnet to find that cache content.\n\n1815\n01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,490\nSo you have to tell it if it's in hosted\ncache mode or distributed cache mode.\n\n1816\n01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:41,700\nYou've got to set up your firewall rules.\n\n1817\n01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:44,020\nIf you are in distributed cache mode.\n\n1818\n01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:48,250\nThen other clients are going to have to\nbe able to browse to your hard drive, or\n\n1819\n01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:51,810\nyou have to be able to browse to their\nhard drive and find that cache content.\n\n1820\n01:24:51,810 --> 01:24:54,480\nSo, there's a couple of firewall\nrules we have to enable\n\n1821\n01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,910\nto make sure that's available.\n\n1822\n01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:57,090\nIf it's hosted cache mode,\n\n1823\n01:24:57,090 --> 01:25:01,000\nI have to tell the client computer\nwho the hosted cache server is.\n\n1824\n01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,370\nAll right, there are some group\npolicies I can use to do that.\n\n1825\n01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:07,270\nAnd it's actually in 2012 in Windows 8,\n\n1826\n01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:09,920\nyou can create SPN's or\nService Principle Names and\n\n1827\n01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,820\nthey can find the hosted cache server\non their own, which is pretty cool.\n\n1828\n01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:15,672\nBut here like you said, go ahead.\n\n1829\n01:25:15,672 --> 01:25:19,392\n>> As you say, quickly,\nyou mentioned those firewall rules.\n\n1830\n01:25:19,392 --> 01:25:25,200\nAnd quickly, on my PC here that you can.\n\n1831\n01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:29,920\nWe'll go in to go look at\nFirewall with Advance Security.\n\n1832\n01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:35,020\nNow, Windows,\nyou know they do have Preconfigured rules.\n\n1833\n01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:38,290\nIn here in our Inbound Rules,\n\n1834\n01:25:38,290 --> 01:25:43,580\nsay if we wanted to create a new rule,\nwe want to use a predefined rule.\n\n1835\n01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:45,020\n>> Isn't that great?\n\n1836\n01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:46,130\n>> That is pretty fantastic.\n\n1837\n01:25:46,130 --> 01:25:49,880\nSo we've got these ones up here.\n\n1838\n01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,180\nLet me go down a little bit.\nSo content retrieval and\n\n1839\n01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:55,000\nwe've got our hosted cache and\nour peer discovery.\n\n1840\n01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:58,900\nSo we can click on these rules and\nwe can fire those guys up.\n\n1841\n01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,530\nThe three configured rules\nto setup a branch cache.\n\n1842\n01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:04,760\n>> And that peer discovery is the one we'd\nbe using on that distributed cache mode.\n\n1843\n01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,273\nWhen I have to be able to find my\nneighbors that might have that cache\n\n1844\n01:26:08,273 --> 01:26:08,853\ncontent.\n\n1845\n01:26:08,853 --> 01:26:13,442\n>> So I suppose hosted cache server\nwould be if you were using a hosted\n\n1846\n01:26:13,442 --> 01:26:14,700\ncache solution.\n\n1847\n01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:17,270\n>> And there should be one for\nHTTP and one for HTTPS.\n\n1848\n01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:18,890\nI don't know if we can see them up there.\n\n1849\n01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:22,120\nBut it depends if you're do you want\nto secure that connection to that cache\n\n1850\n01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,840\nserver, because it's encrypted, right?\n\n1851\n01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:28,500\nBut we've learned about encryption and\nNTFS, that doesn't mean it's encrypted\n\n1852\n01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,430\nwhile it travels across a network,\nso it is exposed at that point.\n\n1853\n01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:36,677\nYou might want to secure the connection\nto that branch cache server,\n\n1854\n01:26:36,677 --> 01:26:40,028\nusing say IPSEC or\nHTTPS or SSL in this case.\n\n1855\n01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,257\nIt is kinda web driven, the protocol.\n\n1856\n01:26:42,257 --> 01:26:42,815\n>> Nice.\n\n1857\n01:26:42,815 --> 01:26:44,860\nAll right sweet.\n\n1858\n01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:47,200\nA little break there firewall stuff.\n\n1859\n01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,710\n>> Now the test is can I\nremember these commands.\n\n1860\n01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:51,005\nLet's see here.\n\n1861\n01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:54,580\n[LAUGH] So in order to set this guy up\nlike I said normally I'm going to be using\n\n1862\n01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:55,850\ngroup policy to do this.\n\n1863\n01:26:55,850 --> 01:26:58,680\nWe'll cover that part of\nit in our server show.\n\n1864\n01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,890\nBut from the client perspective if you\nwanted to configure an individual client\n\n1865\n01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:03,480\nto use branch cache.\n\n1866\n01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,130\nIt's a netsh command.\n\n1867\n01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:08,352\nNow, there are some power show commands\nas well that I believe they've added,\n\n1868\n01:27:08,352 --> 01:27:09,326\nsome within 2012.\n\n1869\n01:27:09,326 --> 01:27:11,680\nI still use my netsh for the most part.\n\n1870\n01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,480\nI need to switch at some point.\n\n1871\n01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:18,270\nBut, netsh branch cache.\n\n1872\n01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:20,010\nOops, and if I could spell cache.\n\n1873\n01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:22,870\nNow I'm just going to do a slash\nquestion mark to show you all some of\n\n1874\n01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:25,310\nthe different options that I can do.\n\n1875\n01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:28,410\nYou guys know, we've touched\non this in many many episodes.\n\n1876\n01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:31,770\nAny command from the command line,\nyou can do a forward slash question mark\n\n1877\n01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:35,357\ntypically, and you can get some additional\nhelp on some of these options here.\n\n1878\n01:27:35,357 --> 01:27:40,609\nAnd if I just do,\nI'm gonna be using this set in this case,\n\n1879\n01:27:40,609 --> 01:27:44,910\nwhich will set\nthe configuration parameters.\n\n1880\n01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:50,207\nNow, this machine's already set up,\n\n1881\n01:27:50,207 --> 01:27:56,304\nbut to show you the command\nI used to set it up,\n\n1882\n01:27:56,304 --> 01:28:01,281\nit was netsh branchcache set service\n\n1883\n01:28:01,281 --> 01:28:06,758\nmode equals and then I did distributed.\n\n1884\n01:28:06,758 --> 01:28:08,837\nI can't spell.\n\n1885\n01:28:08,837 --> 01:28:11,220\nDistributed, there we go.\n\n1886\n01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:12,520\nMode equals distributed.\n\n1887\n01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:16,230\nI'll try to run it again,\nit might really hose things up if I do.\n\n1888\n01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:17,980\nLet's see what it does.\n\n1889\n01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:20,950\nSo there I see that it\nstarted up those services.\n\n1890\n01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:26,650\nThere, again, the first time I did this,\nyou also saw that it created the firewall\n\n1891\n01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:29,920\nrules, and I'll show you here in a second\nthe firewall rules that it created.\n\n1892\n01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,920\nOr where I can check on\nthose firewall rules.\n\n1893\n01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:35,790\nIt also set that service type,\nstartup type to manual.\n\n1894\n01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:37,460\nNormally we are gonna want\nto change that to automatic.\n\n1895\n01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:40,050\nSo that it makes sure that if\nthey reboot that client machine,\n\n1896\n01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:41,850\nthat that service kicks\nback in automatically.\n\n1897\n01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:43,680\nAnd I can show you that service as well.\n\n1898\n01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:46,720\nSo once you run that command, and now it\nknows that it's in distributed cache mode.\n\n1899\n01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,439\nAnd then to verify it,\n\n1900\n01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:55,452\nyou would do a netsh\nbranchcache show status all,\n\n1901\n01:28:55,452 --> 01:28:59,902\nnetsh branchcache show status all.\n\n1902\n01:28:59,902 --> 01:29:04,160\nWhen I fire that command,\nI get to see a lot of things here.\n\n1903\n01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:07,900\nSo, there's the command that I initially\ntyped in, show status all, and\n\n1904\n01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:12,740\nwhat I'm looking at is the service\nmode is step two distributed caching.\n\n1905\n01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:16,230\nIf I were to in host a cache mode,\nthat would say hosted caching.\n\n1906\n01:29:17,290 --> 01:29:21,530\nServe peers on battery power is disabled,\nso if I'm on a laptop and\n\n1907\n01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:25,870\nI'm not plugged in, I'm not gonna respond\nto people trying to look for cache.\n\n1908\n01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:28,790\nYou could change that if you wanted to but\nthat's the default.\n\n1909\n01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:31,890\nCurrent status, it is running, all right.\n\n1910\n01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:34,530\nService starter type is manual and\nI'm not too pleased with that.\n\n1911\n01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:36,280\nI'll go change that here in a second.\n\n1912\n01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,487\nAnd it's not configured\nas a hosted cache client.\n\n1913\n01:29:39,487 --> 01:29:40,611\nAll right.\n\n1914\n01:29:40,611 --> 01:29:44,627\nThere's the 5% that it uses by\ndefault currently not using any and\n\n1915\n01:29:44,627 --> 01:29:47,530\nthere's the location of the cache.\n\n1916\n01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:50,480\nI see call it Windows servers profile,\nblah, blah, blah, it's just kind of\n\n1917\n01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:55,570\na buried default or hidden location there,\nwe don't browse that location directly.\n\n1918\n01:29:57,780 --> 01:29:58,990\nWhat else do we need?\n\n1919\n01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:01,840\nAnd then down here for my networking\nstatus, this is where I look at my\n\n1920\n01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,120\nfirewalls to make sure everything\ngot configured properly.\n\n1921\n01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:06,610\nWhat I'm looking at is\nwhich ones are required.\n\n1922\n01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:10,950\nFor a distributed cache, the content\nretrieval URL reservation is required and\n\n1923\n01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:13,260\nI can see that it is configured.\n\n1924\n01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:16,220\nI don't need to worry about\nthe hosted cache because we're in\n\n1925\n01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,500\ndistributive cache mode.\n\n1926\n01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:21,530\nEven though it does say it's configured,\nit's not required.\n\n1927\n01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:25,020\nI'm not using SSL to connect to the hosted\ncache, not configured, not required,\n\n1928\n01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:28,330\nbut where it says required here,\nthat is enabled.\n\n1929\n01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:30,710\nContent retrieval firewall rules.\n\n1930\n01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:34,130\nAs well as peer discovery firewall rules.\n\n1931\n01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,210\nAll right, so really the big\nthings you're looking for here\n\n1932\n01:30:38,210 --> 01:30:42,680\nare making sure that it knows what mode\nit's in and that that service is running.\n\n1933\n01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,970\nThose are the two things you're\nlooking for up at the top.\n\n1934\n01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:48,860\nDown at the bottom anything that\nsays required is configured.\n\n1935\n01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:52,025\nSo those are really the things we're\nlooking for with that command.\n\n1936\n01:30:52,025 --> 01:30:53,400\n>> Mm-hm, nice.\n\n1937\n01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:56,400\nAll right, so\nthat content retrieval one right there.\n\n1938\n01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,590\nSo Mike, correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n1939\n01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:02,240\nSo, in setting up branch cache,\nwhether you are in distributed or\n\n1940\n01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:06,830\nwhether you are in hosted,\nin both cases that content retrieval\n\n1941\n01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:10,770\nneeds to be configured and turned on\nthose firewall rules for that one.\n\n1942\n01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:11,930\n>> Correct.\n>> So there's two rules.\n\n1943\n01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:15,224\nSo you'll always have the content\nretrieval and then you'll either have\n\n1944\n01:31:15,224 --> 01:31:20,730\nrules setup for that peer discovery or\nfor that hosted cache.\n\n1945\n01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:21,252\n>> Exactly.\n\n1946\n01:31:21,252 --> 01:31:22,099\n>> Nice.\n>> Perfect.\n\n1947\n01:31:22,099 --> 01:31:23,810\nAll right.\n\n1948\n01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:26,543\nSo now that we have run that\ncommand to configure the client,\n\n1949\n01:31:26,543 --> 01:31:30,190\nit knows that you are going to be\nusing this distributed cache mode.\n\n1950\n01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:33,540\nSome other things that we might want to be\nable to do from our command prompt here.\n\n1951\n01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:36,300\nOne might be to see that cache.\n\n1952\n01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:40,303\nAnd you don't really see the files but\n\n1953\n01:31:40,303 --> 01:31:44,181\nif I wanna get a current status of it,\n\n1954\n01:31:44,181 --> 01:31:47,908\nnetsh branchcache-\n>> Show cache?\n\n1955\n01:31:47,908 --> 01:31:52,888\n>> Show local cache.\n\n1956\n01:31:52,888 --> 01:31:53,860\nAll right.\n\n1957\n01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:57,630\nAnd there I can see, so\nnetsh branchcache show local cache.\n\n1958\n01:31:57,630 --> 01:32:01,560\nThere I can see the size that's\nbeing dedicated to the cash, 5% and\n\n1959\n01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:05,160\ncurrently zero bytes being served,\nall right.\n\n1960\n01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:08,470\nThere's also a clear cash\ncache that you can do.\n\n1961\n01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:10,670\nI'd have to try to remember\nthe syntax on that one,\n\n1962\n01:32:10,670 --> 01:32:13,160\ncuz sometimes you might\nwanna flush the cache out.\n\n1963\n01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,290\nAnd you can do that as well.\n\n1964\n01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:21,105\n>> So let me ask this, Mike, so,\nall right, so will we get the most of\n\n1965\n01:32:21,105 --> 01:32:25,829\nthis branch cache by accessing\nthese really large documents,\n\n1966\n01:32:25,829 --> 01:32:28,878\nlike large spreadsheets or something?\n\n1967\n01:32:28,878 --> 01:32:35,670\nI mean, does it determine what files\nto cache, like just really big ones?\n\n1968\n01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:39,620\nOr what there's like users are accessing\na bunch of really tiny files-\n\n1969\n01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:40,970\n>> You can still cache them.\n\n1970\n01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:43,390\nIt is really based on\nthe speed of the network.\n\n1971\n01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:46,440\nLike by default,\nwhen you enable branch cache, again,\n\n1972\n01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,100\nthis gets on to the server side of things.\n\n1973\n01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,230\nBut, by default,\nit's set to 80 milliseconds.\n\n1974\n01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:55,630\nSo if the latency between that client at\nthe branch office and the home office, or\n\n1975\n01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:58,070\nthe corporate office where\nthat share is located at.\n\n1976\n01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:01,800\nIf that round trip time is\nlonger than 80 milliseconds,\n\n1977\n01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,520\nthen it's gonna cache content.\n\n1978\n01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,700\nIf it goes to get that file and\nit's slower than 80 milliseconds, or\n\n1979\n01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:10,330\nif it's less than 80 millisecond latency,\nthen it'll just retrieve it like normal.\n\n1980\n01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:13,480\nAll right?\nAnother good point is how do we access it?\n\n1981\n01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,960\nCuz do I have to do things\ndifferently because it's cached?\n\n1982\n01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:18,020\nHow do I connect to that file?\n\n1983\n01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:18,550\nAnd you don't.\n\n1984\n01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:23,320\nYou type it in, even though when\nyou type in that UNC path, which is\n\n1985\n01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:27,710\npointing that server back at the corporate\noffice, it's smart enough to know that,\n\n1986\n01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:30,790\nhey let me check first and see if\nthere's a copy of that cache locally.\n\n1987\n01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:33,670\nSo you don't access the file\nany differently, all right?\n\n1988\n01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:34,890\nIt's only shared files.\n\n1989\n01:33:34,890 --> 01:33:37,550\nSo you can enable it on shares\nback on that file server.\n\n1990\n01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:39,270\nYou can also cache web content.\n\n1991\n01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:42,530\nLike if I'm running a corporate website,\nan intranet site back at my\n\n1992\n01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:45,980\ncorporate office that has our company\ncalendar with all the meetings and\n\n1993\n01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:47,800\nschedules and things like that.\n\n1994\n01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:51,160\nWell if the WAN link is down\nthose users at the branch office\n\n1995\n01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,780\ncan't get access to that website.\n\n1996\n01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:56,840\nSo I can cache web content out\nthere at the branch office as well.\n\n1997\n01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:57,960\nJust like I can share files.\n\n1998\n01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:00,610\nSo we can cache files and\nwe can cache web content.\n\n1999\n01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:01,970\n>> All right.\n\n2000\n01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:04,150\nAll right, so Mike,\nI'm gonna throw you a curve ball.\n\n2001\n01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:04,960\n>> Oh.\nHere it comes.\n\n2002\n01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,000\n>> And let's see if you know it,\njust off the top of my head.\n\n2003\n01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,930\nAll right, so can you integrate branch\ncache in with your, in with like DFS, and\n\n2004\n01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:13,944\nreplicate that cache?\n\n2005\n01:34:13,944 --> 01:34:15,910\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's more of a,\n\n2006\n01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:17,428\nwhich one do I wanna use.\n\n2007\n01:34:17,428 --> 01:34:18,412\n>> Right?\n>> Honestly.\n\n2008\n01:34:18,412 --> 01:34:21,160\n>> Yeah, with branch cache or\nDFS you've got advantages and\n\n2009\n01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:24,990\ndisadvantages to both and so\nit's what do I want to do.\n\n2010\n01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:28,690\nWould I rather use DFS and put a copy,\n\n2011\n01:34:28,690 --> 01:34:31,910\nan actual copy of those shares\nout there at the branch office.\n\n2012\n01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:36,370\nWith DFS, we're talking about maintaining\nmultiple copies of that same file.\n\n2013\n01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:39,590\nBut that means a lot more replication\nbecause anytime somebody makes a to change\n\n2014\n01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:43,400\nto a file, that's going to have\nreplicate over to that branch office.\n\n2015\n01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,330\nAnd if we're talking\nabout a slow WAN link,\n\n2016\n01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:47,010\nthat might not be the route I wanna go.\n\n2017\n01:34:47,010 --> 01:34:48,850\nAnd that's when branch cache steps in,\n\n2018\n01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:51,130\nbecause it's eliminating\na lot of that traffic.\n\n2019\n01:34:51,130 --> 01:34:53,030\nIf I can retrieve it locally, fantastic,\n\n2020\n01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:56,960\nif I can't I'll still go across the WAN,\nbut I'd rather try to get it locally.\n\n2021\n01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,876\nWhere as DFS will create, a little more\nWAN traffic, because of the replication\n\n2022\n01:35:00,876 --> 01:35:04,977\nthat's gonna have to occur to maintain\nthat synchronization between those files.\n\n2023\n01:35:04,977 --> 01:35:06,320\nIt's one or the other typically.\n\n2024\n01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,910\nYou could use both for different things,\n\n2025\n01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:10,820\nbut usually you're deciding on one or\nthe other.\n\n2026\n01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:12,469\nSo not really integrate together,\ndoes that make sense?\n\n2027\n01:35:12,469 --> 01:35:14,455\n>> Yeah, it does.\n\n2028\n01:35:14,455 --> 01:35:16,876\nIt's just kind of popped\ninto my head just then.\n\n2029\n01:35:16,876 --> 01:35:20,502\n[CROSSTALK] All right, so\nreal quick, one last thing, Mike,\n\n2030\n01:35:20,502 --> 01:35:23,872\nlet's jump into your firewall\nwith advanced security.\n\n2031\n01:35:23,872 --> 01:35:24,655\n>> All right.\n\n2032\n01:35:24,655 --> 01:35:27,535\n>> And we'll just take a quick\npeek at those firewall rules.\n\n2033\n01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:33,910\nSo based off of our discussions, because\nthis is distributed cache, I think we can\n\n2034\n01:35:33,910 --> 01:35:39,982\nmake a pretty good guess on what we should\nsee in here on those two firewall rules.\n\n2035\n01:35:39,982 --> 01:35:41,742\n>> I don't have any rules.\n\n2036\n01:35:41,742 --> 01:35:42,910\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, sure enough, so\n\n2037\n01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:44,250\nwe've got content retrieval.\n\n2038\n01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:46,614\nThat rule is turned on and enabled.\n\n2039\n01:35:46,614 --> 01:35:50,421\n>> Right.\nAnd for the profile, so it's active across\n\n2040\n01:35:50,421 --> 01:35:55,630\nour home, our work, or our private,\nour domain, and our public.\n\n2041\n01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:56,130\n>> Yeah.\n\n2042\n01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:58,000\n>> Right?\nYeah.\n\n2043\n01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:58,670\nThat's right, yeah three.\n\n2044\n01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:01,550\nI said-\n>> Domain, work or public.\n\n2045\n01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:02,670\n>> Well domain and work.\n\n2046\n01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:05,965\n>> Domain or work private, work/private.\n\n2047\n01:36:05,965 --> 01:36:06,569\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n2048\n01:36:06,569 --> 01:36:07,208\n>> Exactly.\n\n2049\n01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:08,264\n>> Correct.\n\n2050\n01:36:08,264 --> 01:36:09,065\n>> Yeah, so it is.\n\n2051\n01:36:09,065 --> 01:36:10,469\nNow, and that was the default.\n\n2052\n01:36:10,469 --> 01:36:12,129\nAnd I might wanna change that.\n\n2053\n01:36:12,129 --> 01:36:13,830\nI might wanna come in here and say look,\n\n2054\n01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:17,750\nonly when I'm on my domain profile do I\nwanna enable those firewall exceptions.\n\n2055\n01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:19,740\nWhen I'm on a public network,\nI might not want those.\n\n2056\n01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:23,729\nSo I could definitely come back\nin here and make changes to that.\n\n2057\n01:36:23,729 --> 01:36:27,177\nAnd I could decide, oops,\nwhere are we at here?\n\n2058\n01:36:27,177 --> 01:36:30,172\n[SOUND] Where is it?\n\n2059\n01:36:30,172 --> 01:36:31,055\n>> Scope maybe?\n\n2060\n01:36:31,055 --> 01:36:34,184\n>> Nope.\n\n2061\n01:36:34,184 --> 01:36:35,345\nGosh, Mike.\n\n2062\n01:36:35,345 --> 01:36:35,940\nThere we go.\n\n2063\n01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:38,500\nI could disable public, or\nsomething like that, so\n\n2064\n01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:43,690\nI didn't have those exceptions enabled\nwhen I was connected to a public network.\n\n2065\n01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:45,300\nYeah that's a confusing\none with Windows 7,\n\n2066\n01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:48,715\nright, because when you\nfirst connect to a network.\n\n2067\n01:36:48,715 --> 01:36:52,815\nIt asks you, do you want to call this\nnetwork a work network or do you want to\n\n2068\n01:36:52,815 --> 01:36:57,085\ncall it a private network, or\ndo you want to call it a public network?\n\n2069\n01:36:57,085 --> 01:37:00,205\nBut really, in the end, there is no\ndifference between work and private.\n\n2070\n01:37:00,205 --> 01:37:02,095\nIt applies the private profile.\n\n2071\n01:37:02,095 --> 01:37:04,155\nThere is only one private profile.\n\n2072\n01:37:04,155 --> 01:37:05,815\nDomain is detected automatically.\n\n2073\n01:37:05,815 --> 01:37:06,885\nYou don't apply that one.\n\n2074\n01:37:06,885 --> 01:37:08,925\nIf it detects active\ndirectory on the network,\n\n2075\n01:37:08,925 --> 01:37:10,665\nthen it should apply the domain profile.\n\n2076\n01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:14,400\nSo, Windows 8 does that a little\nbit differently though.\n\n2077\n01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,860\nThey change up the names on us.\n\n2078\n01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:17,660\nWhat else are we gonna look at?\n\n2079\n01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:18,280\nOh, the services.\n\n2080\n01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:19,786\nLet me show you that\nservice that's required.\n\n2081\n01:37:23,385 --> 01:37:26,215\nAnd it's easy,\nit's just a branch cache service.\n\n2082\n01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:28,570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right there I can see it's started, but\n\n2083\n01:37:28,570 --> 01:37:34,470\nit is set to manual, so when I did that in\nNHS branch cache, set mode distributed.\n\n2084\n01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:38,320\nIt turned it on, it is started,\nbut it did set it to manual.\n\n2085\n01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,530\nIf I'm using group policy or\nif I'm doing it manually,\n\n2086\n01:37:40,530 --> 01:37:43,170\nI would want to come in here and\nchange that to automatic.\n\n2087\n01:37:43,170 --> 01:37:44,850\nSo that way if they reboot that machine,\n\n2088\n01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:47,830\nI'm guaranteed that that\nservice is gonna kick back in.\n\n2089\n01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:50,760\nSo I would want to change that.\n\n2090\n01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:51,722\n>> Nice.\n\n2091\n01:37:51,722 --> 01:37:55,220\nAll right Mike, yeah,\nyou know branch cache, pretty sweet.\n\n2092\n01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:57,378\nIt's awesome technology.\n\n2093\n01:37:57,378 --> 01:38:02,340\nWe can easier optimize our traffic\nacross those slow WAN links and\n\n2094\n01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:04,370\nit seems to be popular.\n\n2095\n01:38:04,370 --> 01:38:06,237\n>> It is.\nWell, you know, when you're out there,\n\n2096\n01:38:06,237 --> 01:38:09,061\nat that branch office, I don't know if\nyou've ever worked in a branch office,\n\n2097\n01:38:09,061 --> 01:38:10,648\nsometimes you feel like that step-child.\n\n2098\n01:38:10,648 --> 01:38:11,811\n>>

thinks about us.\n\n2101\n01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:17,990\nYou know?\nThey've got this nice gigabit LAN\n\n2102\n01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:19,841\nback there at the corporate office.\n\n2103\n01:38:19,841 --> 01:38:22,590\nAnd they can just access these\nresources with no problem.\n\n2104\n01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:25,087\nWe're out here at the branch\noffice going click, wait.\n\n2105\n01:38:25,087 -->

alleviate that kind of thing, so\n\n2108\n01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:36,320\nwe're not felt like we're step-children\nout there at the branch office.\n\n2109\n01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,490\nI'm trying to

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,820\nHi I'm Nathan Copeland\nhere with Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,910\n>> How's it going Nate?\n\n6\n00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,710\n>> Pretty good Ronnir.\n\n7\n00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,580\nPretty good today.\n\n8\n00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,070\n>> Ready for another exciting\nday in the world of Windows 7?\n\n9\n00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,260\n>> You know I am, I am.\n\n10\n00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,690\nAnd today we've got a fantastic\nset of objectives lined up.\n\n11\n00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:59,990\nAnd good old 7680 set of objectives, and\nspecifically we have mobile computing.\n\n12\n00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,870\nAll right, so we'll be covering things\nlike BitLocker, BitLocker to go.\n\n13\n00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:10,440\nWe've got direct access which is\nan amazingly cool and complex technology.\n\n14\n00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,230\nLike a VPN without knowing\nthat it's really on.\n\n15\n00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,190\nPretty neat stuff.\n\n16\n00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,625\nWe got some mobility options down there,\n\n17\n00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:26,330\nand below the fold, then we have\nsome remote connections, right?\n\n18\n00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:31,100\nSome fantastic stuff, VPNS, and\nNAP quarantine remediation,\n\n19\n00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,100\nneat stuff to keep those\nunhealthy computers, let's see.\n\n20\n00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,660\nIt's not unhealthy anymore.\n\n21\n00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,001\nWhat's it called?\nNon-compliance.\n\n22\n00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:38,910\n>> Non-compliance.\n\n23\n00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,800\n>> To keep those non-compliant\nmachines off of our network.\n\n24\n00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,780\nSo yeah, some great stuff today.\n\n25\n00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,860\n>> Yeah, now in this bigger area,\n\n26\n00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,800\nagain terminology has changed\na little bit over time, right?\n\n27\n00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,740\nWe would normally talk about\nthe idea of mobile computers\n\n28\n00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,150\nin terms of devices like smart phones and\ntablets and different things.\n\n29\n00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,150\nIn the Windows 7 day,\nwe just called mobility because\n\n30\n00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,090\nthey were essentially items that\nwere outside of our network.\n\n31\n00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,920\nBut they still needed access, well\nresources inside of out networks here.\n\n32\n00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,060\nThings like file shares of course, and\nprinters, a whole bunch of other things,\n\n33\n00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,560\neven applications.\n\n34\n00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,030\nSo when you actually see the terminology,\ndon't get thrown by it.\n\n35\n00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,600\nWe're not really covering\nanything in terms of\n\n36\n00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,020\nreal mobility in terms of those devices.\n\n37\n00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,940\nBut we are covering the idea of you\nbeing a mobile user such as on a laptop\n\n38\n00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,190\ntravelling somewhere or just outside the\noffice but still needing connections in.\n\n39\n00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,220\nAnd so we wanna make sure that\nyou're familiar with the technology.\n\n40\n00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,310\nAnd how to get Windows 7 to work with\nthe idea of those inside resources here.\n\n41\n00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,610\nOkay, so let's go ahead and take a look\nat our particular first technology here\n\n42\n00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,660\nabout the idea of well what\nhappens to our devices, right?\n\n43\n00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,110\nWhen we're outside of the network here,\nwe're essentially outside of a security\n\n44\n00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:57,850\nboundary and now I take my laptop,\nNate and I go over to Starbucks.\n\n45\n00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,910\nAnd here it is.\n\n46\n00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,050\nWe're sitting down,\nwe're having a $7 cup of coffee and\n\n47\n00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,630\nI'm crying because it's\na $7 cup of coffee.\n\n48\n00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,160\nAnd I happen to leave my laptop there.\n\n49\n00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,900\nWell, if I actually have work\ninformation on this particular device,\n\n50\n00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,990\nI'm a little bit in trouble at this point.\n\n51\n00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,520\nBecause if I leave that there, somebody\ncould take off with it, and now they have\n\n52\n00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,630\naccess to all of the actual information,\non my particular hard drive here.\n\n53\n00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,150\nSo I've got a problem, and\nWindows 7 has a solution to help us out.\n\n54\n00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,149\nRight, Nate?\n\n55\n00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:30,240\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, they do.\n\n56\n00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,920\nSo what we can do is use this\ntechnology called BitLocker.\n\n57\n00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,400\nBitLocker, what it is, is it is\nentire disk, full disk encryption.\n\n58\n00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,670\nAnd it encrypts everything\non the hard drive.\n\n59\n00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,940\nNow when the PC boots up to have\n\n60\n00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,260\nfull BitLocker support you need something\ncalled a TPM, a trusted platform module.\n\n61\n00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,500\nAnd these BitLocker encryption keys\nessentially are stored inside that TPM,\n\n62\n00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:06,418\nwhich is just a little chip that\nis soldered onto the motherboard.\n\n63\n00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:10,070\nNow some motherboards do have a,\nTPM header,\n\n64\n00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,790\nto where you can get these little\nTPM modules and slip them on.\n\n65\n00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,310\nThey look like an internal USB header on\nthe motherboard, so you can go that route.\n\n66\n00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,720\nBut essentially these chips,\nyou can't remove them, and so\n\n67\n00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,080\nthose encryption keys are stored on there.\n\n68\n00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,290\nYou boot up this computer And that,\nyou know, TPM checks the hard drive,\n\n69\n00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,480\nchecks the rest of the system to make sure\nthat it hasn't been tampered with, and\n\n70\n00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,090\nif everything checks out,\nit unencrypts it.\n\n71\n00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,890\nI mean, it's really fast,\nit's pretty amazing.\n\n72\n00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,500\n>> Right.\n>> I mean,\n\n73\n00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,290\njust the time it takes to boot up that\nPC and then, you're into Windows and\n\n74\n00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,790\neverything is good to go.\n\n75\n00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,340\nNow, in Ronnie's scenario,\n\n76\n00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,800\nhe leaves his laptop, kind of careless-\n>> Yeah, I know,\n\n77\n00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,640\nit's just who I am [LAUGH]\n>> But, so, somebody could swipe that\n\n78\n00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,850\nlaptop, pull out that hard drive,\nslave it in to another PC or boot\n\n79\n00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,650\noff a Linux live CD, and browse into that\nhard drive and pilfer off all your files.\n\n80\n00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,680\nHowever, if it's BitLocker encrypted,\nthey can try, but\n\n81\n00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,410\nthere's no way they're gonna\nget any data off of it.\n\n82\n00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,367\n>> Yeah, now in this particular process\nhere, for us the idea of BitLocker for\n\n83\n00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:19,256\nus is not only encrypting individual\nfiles with something like EFS right.\n\n84\n00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:22,958\nBut it actually is taking\nthe hard drive itself and\n\n85\n00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:27,380\nactually encrypting the actual\ndrive itself for us.\n\n86\n00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,450\nThis includes not only the idea\nof data files here, but\n\n87\n00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,640\nthe actual operating system drive itself.\n\n88\n00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,742\nSo, when we actually do end up\nusing the idea of BitLocker,\n\n89\n00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:41,838\nit really does lock the entire volume down\nto where if they were to try something\n\n90\n00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:43,656\nlike what Nate was talking about.\n\n91\n00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:47,320\nJust removing the hard drive and trying\nto install it as a second hard drive,\n\n92\n00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,927\nnot directly accessing it by booting\nit up, but using their own machine and\n\n93\n00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:55,020\ntrying to gain access to the data by\njust simply having it as a second drive.\n\n94\n00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,070\nWell, they won't be able to and\n\n95\n00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,280\nthe reason why is the idea of the way\nthat BitLocker ends up working for us.\n\n96\n00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,510\nBecause it encrypts the entire drive\nitself and there's multiple methods.\n\n97\n00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,190\nNate mentioned one,\n\n98\n00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,280\nthere's a couple of other things that\nwe're gonna also talk about as well.\n\n99\n00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,950\nBut what it does is when it actually tries\nto boot up, somebody tries to access it.\n\n100\n00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:21,060\nBitLocker says all right, now let's check\nand see where my encryption keys are.\n\n101\n00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,430\nNow, normally when we take a look at\nthat right, in terms of BitLocker,\n\n102\n00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,160\nit goes ahead and says, look one of\nthe things I need is that TPM module.\n\n103\n00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,200\nSo when it checks and it now sees,\nlet's say, your computer and\n\n104\n00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,130\nits TPM and\nthe way that it actually registers it.\n\n105\n00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,490\nIt compares it against what BitLocker\nknows on that encrypted drive.\n\n106\n00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,590\nThe BitLocker volume essentially says,\nnope,\n\n107\n00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,870\nthat's not my computer and\nI will not launch up.\n\n108\n00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,445\nSo, we can actually lock it down that way.\n\n109\n00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:53,190\nAnd so BitLocker is very effective\n\n110\n00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,260\nin that particular scenario that Nate just\ntalked about by being able to do that.\n\n111\n00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,160\nNow let me go ahead and\nshow you essentially what ends up\n\n112\n00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,650\nhappening on the installation\nof Windows 7 first.\n\n113\n00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,320\nTo show you that Windows 7 is\nalready prepared for BitLocker.\n\n114\n00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,020\nSo on my picker computer here I brought\nup the disk management tool for us.\n\n115\n00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,850\nNow when we actually have this, if\n\n116\n00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,120\nyou take a look at disk one which is the\none that I have Windows 7 installed on.\n\n117\n00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,520\nNotice that there is the system reserve\npartition, that is actually done, for\n\n118\n00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,340\nthe idea of booting up the computer, but\nrecognizing that you may want to actually\n\n119\n00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,120\ngo ahead and use BitLocker on the actual\ndrive you that you installed Windows 7 on.\n\n120\n00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,433\nWell you can't boot up an encrypted drive.\n\n121\n00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:43,768\nSo what it does is it creates the actual\n100 megabit partition here so\n\n122\n00:07:43,768 --> 00:07:45,429\nthat you can boot up to it and\n\n123\n00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:50,508\nthen that's actually what can help you\nget into that BitLocker encrypted volume.\n\n124\n00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:54,557\nSo, unlike Vista where you\nhad to manually create these,\n\n125\n00:07:54,557 --> 00:08:00,720\nWindows 7 automatically is prepared to do\nthis when we go ahead and choose this.\n\n126\n00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,180\nNow, that first method of just\nusing the TPM module itself,\n\n127\n00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,990\nokay is by far kinda the least secure.\n\n128\n00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,600\nNow, that doesn't mean it's not secured,\nit just means by itself if you leave\n\n129\n00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,040\nthe hard drive in that computer and\nyou boot it up, it's gonna actually work.\n\n130\n00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,200\nBut the very fact is, we can actually add\nin, not only the use of BitLocker, but\n\n131\n00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,030\nalso add in the idea of adding\nin a PIN number or even using\n\n132\n00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,700\nanother external device in combination\nwith that to secure our particular drive.\n\n133\n00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:37,680\n>> All right so,\nshould we BitLocker some stuff?\n\n134\n00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,525\n>> Sure.\n\n135\n00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:41,279\nYeah, let's go ahead and\nshow them how it works.\n\n136\n00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,316\n>> All right.\nOn my PC, so what we can do is so\n\n137\n00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,871\nwe have two parts.\n\n138\n00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:52,001\nWe haven't really talked much\nabout BitLocker To Go, but\n\n139\n00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:57,980\nBitLocker To Go is to encrypt the same\nsort of thing, to encrypt thumb drives.\n\n140\n00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,105\nRight, or our, you know,\nour removable drives.\n\n141\n00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:05,000\nSo yeah, we can use both tools and\nit locks some stuff down.\n\n142\n00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,740\nSo on here,\nwe could open up good old file explorer.\n\n143\n00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:15,510\nWe can browse into here and let's see,\nlet's take the long way around.\n\n144\n00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,590\nWe can go into control panel,\nand system and\n\n145\n00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,600\nsecurity, and then we can go down\ninto BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n146\n00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:31,480\nAnd here so we have there's two partitions\non this drive right on this pc here.\n\n147\n00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,350\nSo we got a C drive and\nwe have a D drive and then we've got\n\n148\n00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,160\na f drive down there which is a little\nUSB drive that I've slipped in here.\n\n149\n00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,270\nNow, to turn on BitLocker, right?\n\n150\n00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,510\nSo we've gotta have administrative access.\n\n151\n00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,550\nAnd so now what BitLocker is gonna\ndo is it's going to test my system.\n\n152\n00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,360\nIt's gonna test it to make sure it can\nsuccessfully encrypt it and decrypt it,\n\n153\n00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,990\nmake sure that everything is fine.\n\n154\n00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,020\nSo that way you don't turn it on, encrypt\nyour whole hard drive, reboot your PC,\n\n155\n00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,140\nand then have something go wrong and\n\n156\n00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,530\nessentially you just locked\nyourself out of your files.\n\n157\n00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,400\n>> Alright.\n\n158\n00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,640\n>> So it's, oh yeah.\n\n159\n00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,780\n>> No go ahead.\n\n160\n00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,750\n>> Yeah so essentially it's gonna encrypt\na small part of it and then decrypt it and\n\n161\n00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,780\nmake sure that everything\nis working right.\n\n162\n00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,840\nSo everything looks good.\n\n163\n00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,080\nAll right, we click on next.\n\n164\n00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,530\nNow it says we recommend that you back\nup critical files before continuing.\n\n165\n00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,790\nYou know, if something does go wrong,\nwhich it shouldn't,\n\n166\n00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,230\neverything should be fine,\nbut still if it is a critical\n\n167\n00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,140\nfiles we want to make sure that we\nhave a backup of that just in case.\n\n168\n00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,390\nAll right, so everything looks good.\n\n169\n00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,285\nClick on next.\n\n170\n00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:47,685\nAnd then there we go.\n\n171\n00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:50,142\nSo now the process is starting so\nyou can go and\n\n172\n00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:53,646\nset up those pieces that it needs and\nstart encrypting this guy.\n\n173\n00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:54,344\n>> Yeah.\n\n174\n00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:58,752\nNow there are other drive volume\nencryptions that are out there, but\n\n175\n00:10:58,752 --> 00:11:01,617\nBitLocker itself is native to Windows.\n\n176\n00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:04,587\nIt was really introduced in the days\nof Vista, but it actually has been\n\n177\n00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:08,887\nenhanced in terms of Windows 7 today\nbecause they've made it easier to use and\n\n178\n00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:12,157\nthey've made it a little bit more\nefficient in terms of what we can do.\n\n179\n00:11:12,157 --> 00:11:16,217\nWith the multiple ways that we can\nalso add in additional security,\n\n180\n00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,917\nit really does help to, again,\n\n181\n00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:22,920\nensure that your volume is not gonna be\nable to very easily be decrypted here.\n\n182\n00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,790\nOkay, so as it's preparing the drive.\n\n183\n00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,660\n>> There we go, all right so\nthe drive has been prepared and so\n\n184\n00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,930\nnow the next step is to encrypt,\nthis is tricky.\n\n185\n00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:38,500\nAll right, so now we have these recovery\nkeys so just in case something goes wrong.\n\n186\n00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,537\nIf BitLocker detects something happened,\n\n187\n00:11:41,537 --> 00:11:46,877\nthat we have a recovery key that you can\nuse to essentially recover our drive.\n\n188\n00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:50,405\nNow BitLocker, so\nthe keys are stored in our TPM but\n\n189\n00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:55,083\nif it senses something has been done\nto tamper this boot process, or\n\n190\n00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,694\nlet's say that this laptop\nhere completely dies and\n\n191\n00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:03,558\nI have to pull this hard drive and\ntry to save the information off of it.\n\n192\n00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:08,170\nWell you know TPM's not there you know\nit's essentially going to be locked out.\n\n193\n00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,874\nSo we have these recovery keys that we can\nput in in case something like that happens\n\n194\n00:12:12,874 --> 00:12:15,710\nwhich, you know I'll\ntell you a story Ronnie.\n\n195\n00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,870\nYou know last summer I went out of\nthe country for a little while.\n\n196\n00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,390\nAnd so, I took my PC and I took some\nthumb drives I used for storage and\n\n197\n00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,150\nthat sort of thing with me and\nso I encrypted everything.\n\n198\n00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,320\nWhile I was out there,\nI was playing around with some things and\n\n199\n00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,800\nI essentially locked myself\nout of the computer.\n\n200\n00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,680\nAnd so fortunately,\nI was able to go in and\n\n201\n00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,520\ngive grab my recovery keys, but\neven though I still had my laptop and\n\n202\n00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,640\neverything it was still more or\nless secure under my own control.\n\n203\n00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,985\nI messed with it and logged it out enough\nto where Bitlocker sensed some tampering.\n\n204\n00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:59,755\nIt locked me out so, you know of\ncourse I had to use my recovery keys,\n\n205\n00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:05,597\nthese 48 digit recovery keys,\nthey're long, 48 digits.\n\n206\n00:13:05,597 --> 00:13:09,357\nSo you slowly key this thing in I mean\nthey're all numbers and letter and stuff.\n\n207\n00:13:09,357 --> 00:13:11,847\nAnd yeah,\nI was able to get back into it thankfully.\n\n208\n00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:12,547\n>> Yeah.\n\n209\n00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:15,067\nYou know, the nice thing about\nthe way that BitLocker works is\n\n210\n00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:18,568\nit's really designed to work in\nconjunction with that TP output.\n\n211\n00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:24,468\nThe advantage of using the TPM for us is\nthat it does a system integrity check.\n\n212\n00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:29,058\nSo when your computer process boots\nup here the TPM checks to see if\n\n213\n00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:33,348\nanything's been modified in\nterms of the way that happens.\n\n214\n00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:36,688\nBy a virus, a root hit, or\nwhatever that might be.\n\n215\n00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:39,338\nSo that they do go ahead and\nboot the system,\n\n216\n00:13:39,338 --> 00:13:43,280\nif they've tried to modify\nit the TPM system goes nope.\n\n217\n00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,180\nSomething has changed her and\nwe don't actually know what's changed, but\n\n218\n00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,630\nwe're not gonna allow the rest\nof the process to go through.\n\n219\n00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,610\nAnd then if that happens,\nthen that means BitLocker will again\n\n220\n00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,160\nbe told by the TPM that something has\nchanged in the hard drive here, so\n\n221\n00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,050\ndon't allow this device to go ahead and\nbe decrypted at this point, as well.\n\n222\n00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:06,670\nOkay, now even though that by itself\nis actually again a good check for\n\n223\n00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,460\nus there are other ways.\n\n224\n00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,270\nWhat if I don't have\na computer with a TPM module?\n\n225\n00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,420\nWell more than likely that means that your\nparticular computer's a little bit older,\n\n226\n00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,950\nbut you can still use the same\nprocess that we did here and\n\n227\n00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:24,530\ninstead just save that particular recovery\nkey again either to a USB drive here or\n\n228\n00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,610\nyou actually saw the option\nto print it out.\n\n229\n00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,270\nAnd so that way when you actually do boot\nthe computer up it's gonna ask you either\n\n230\n00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,840\nfor the idea of actually typing it in or\n\n231\n00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,250\nyou're gonna actually present\nthat key each time as well.\n\n232\n00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,150\n>> Alright so what we're going to\ndo is back here on this wizard,\n\n233\n00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,370\nwe'll definitely save this\nthing to a flash drive.\n\n234\n00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,260\nI do have one plugged in.\n\n235\n00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,060\nAnd so it's the F drive, so\nwe'll just click on save.\n\n236\n00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,770\nAll right?\n\n237\n00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,320\nPretty good, right?\n\n238\n00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,700\nSo it didn't ask me for any files or\nanything, any file names.\n\n239\n00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,810\nSo we can click over here,\n\n240\n00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,430\nwe can jump into our F drive,\nand we can take a look at it.\n\n241\n00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,370\nThere it is.\n\n242\n00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,180\nThat is our key.\n\n243\n00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,680\nSo we'll click on it,\nit's just a text document.\n\n244\n00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,760\nThere is that big, long key.\n\n245\n00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,940\nThat's what we have to key in\nto unlock our drive in the event\n\n246\n00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,320\nthat BitLocker locks us out of it.\n\n247\n00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,760\nNow let's say that we have\nmultiple hard drives.\n\n248\n00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,811\nOr let's say that we're in and\nwe have a tower PC,\n\n249\n00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:29,520\ndo we have a bunch drives into it?\n\n250\n00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,210\nOr are we in an organization where\nwe're managing a lot of these TPM keys?\n\n251\n00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,950\nWhen we have the recovery key\nidentification up here, and\n\n252\n00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:44,270\nwe will use that To key in the search for\nthe recovery keys.\n\n253\n00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,918\nSo there we go.\n\n254\n00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:45,428\nBut yeah,\n\n255\n00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:48,667\nthat one down there on the bottom is\nthe key we would actually key in.\n\n256\n00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:53,481\nAll right, I'll close this guy out,\nand we'll close this out.\n\n257\n00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:56,569\nAll right so we'll click on next.\n\n258\n00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:01,720\nSo once again we have that system check.\n\n259\n00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,880\nTo make sure that everything looks good.\n\n260\n00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,910\nYou know what.\n\n261\n00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,140\nI'm pretty confident.\n\n262\n00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,190\nWe have a recovery team.\n\n263\n00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,160\nSo we're not going to do a system check.\n\n264\n00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,480\n[LAUGH] What do you think Ronnie?\n\n265\n00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,350\nGo for it.\n\n266\n00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,875\n>> All right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n267\n00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:12,660\n>> So what we're going to do,\n\n268\n00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,910\nwe will start encrypting.\n\n269\n00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,350\nYeah.\n\n270\n00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,140\n>> There we go.\n\n271\n00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,670\nYeah.\nSo now Nate's particular\n\n272\n00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,920\noperating system drive is going to be\nencrypted now, and so that again is\n\n273\n00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,427\nactually incredibly nice because once\nagain that means the operating system's\n\n274\n00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:32,930\nnot going to run until we actually\neither enter in this encryption key.\n\n275\n00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,240\nUsually we have to.\n\n276\n00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,110\nOr we provide the USB key and\nthe TPM to make this happen.\n\n277\n00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,910\nSo remember, it's natively\ndesigned to work with it, but\n\n278\n00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,490\nit can also work without it.\n\n279\n00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,615\nThe other advantage of BitLocker today,\n\n280\n00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:47,360\ncause back in the days of a previous\noperating system, such as Vista,\n\n281\n00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,370\nit really at the beginning only worked\non that volume that you actually had.\n\n282\n00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,732\nThe operating system on.\n\n283\n00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:58,330\nBut BitLocker in Windows 7 can\nalso work on the data drive.\n\n284\n00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,090\nRight?\nMm-hm.\n\n285\n00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,280\nSo this is a drive without\nany operating system on it.\n\n286\n00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,950\nAnd so we can encrypt those\ndrives in the same manner.\n\n287\n00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,940\nNow Nate showed us the way to go\nthrough the Control Panel to do this.\n\n288\n00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,210\nBut you don't always have to go\nthrough the Control Panel to do this\n\n289\n00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,280\nas well, okay?\n\n290\n00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,010\nSo on my machine here, if I go to the file\n\n291\n00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,780\nexplorer to computer, so I just clicked\non Start and then clicked on Computer.\n\n292\n00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,890\nThey've made it a lot easier for us in the\nvery fact that I can right click on it and\n\n293\n00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,820\nnotice they made a link easier.\n\n294\n00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,620\nThe reason why is that in the days of\nWindows Vista, it was kind of buried into\n\n295\n00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,670\nthe Control Panel so much,\nthat people weren't exactly sure.\n\n296\n00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,910\nAnd then when you clicked on it, you had\nto again make that 100 megabyte partition,\n\n297\n00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,680\nand so,\nit could become a little bit unusual,\n\n298\n00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,360\nin terms of all the steps\nthat you had to do.\n\n299\n00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,728\nBut Windows 7 made it very easy.\n\n300\n00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:54,530\nSo I right-click and\nI can select turn on BitLocker here.\n\n301\n00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:59,560\nAnd notice that my particular machine\nhere, as I say, virtual machine,\n\n302\n00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,960\nit says a compatible TPM security device\nmust be present if you want to do this.\n\n303\n00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,120\nIt wasn't found.\n\n304\n00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720\nPlease check and enable it.\n\n305\n00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,330\nSo, it doesn't like it because it's a\nvirtual machine trying to do this as well.\n\n306\n00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,040\nSo a lot of times you can actually\neven run it without that TPM.\n\n307\n00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,630\nBut here in this particular instance,\nI can't, on this one.\n\n308\n00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,420\nSo there are some methods that\nyou'll actually see, in doing this.\n\n309\n00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,330\nMost of the computers today\nwont have TPM on them,\n\n310\n00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,660\nyou do need to make sure\nit's version 1.2 or higher.\n\n311\n00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,025\nThat's about the only TPM\nmodule requirement that I know.\n\n312\n00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n313\n00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,650\n>> Yep.\n\n314\n00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,590\n>> Yep, now okay.\n\n315\n00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,860\n>> So since you've mentioned that, right?\n\n316\n00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,130\n>> TPM 1.2 or higher, how do we check?\n\n317\n00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,330\n>> Yeah.\n>> Where do we go?\n\n318\n00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,635\n>> Well there is a little tool\nthat that we can go down to.\n\n319\n00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:45,085\n>> So, on the BitLocker, so\n\n320\n00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:48,585\nwe'll just click and\nput that there into the background.\n\n321\n00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,645\n>> So,\non our Control Panel Bitlocker drive, so\n\n322\n00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:54,285\ndown in here we have TPM administration.\n\n323\n00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,410\nWe can click on that,\nopens up this window.\n\n324\n00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,380\nIt's kind of a busy window.\n\n325\n00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,370\n>> Yeah.\n>> There's a lot going on.\n\n326\n00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:06,030\n>> Over here in the actions bar, right,\nif for some reason our TPM wasn't\n\n327\n00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,250\nturned on right,\nwe had it turned off for some reason.\n\n328\n00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:09,990\n>> We can do that here.\n\n329\n00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,840\n>> We can turn it off if we want to.\n\n330\n00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,080\n>> Let's say that we want to\nclear out all of the keys.\n\n331\n00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,310\n>> Cause the TPM can only store a certain\nnumber of encryption keys in there.\n\n332\n00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,800\n>> I'm not sure of that number off hand.\n\n333\n00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,060\n>> It's quite a few.\n\n334\n00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:30,400\n>> But if for one reason we wanted\nto clear that out we can right here.\n\n335\n00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,149\n>> But then down here under TPM\nmanufacturer information, yeah,\n\n336\n00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:37,140\nright there.\n\n337\n00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,364\nSpecific version 1.2.\n\n338\n00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:43,370\n>> So right there is that we can\ncheck our TPM chip and make sure and\n\n339\n00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,390\ndepending on what it\nis that you are after.\n\n340\n00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,930\n>> There are other things\nyou can do in here and\n\n341\n00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:52,340\nyou look at some of these logs and\nwhat not with the TPM.\n\n342\n00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,220\n>> So there is the place to do that.\n\n343\n00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,610\n>> All right, so Ronnie.\n\n344\n00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,150\nYes.\n>> So\n\n345\n00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,510\nyou did mention that with that virtual\nmachine you don't have a TPM in there.\n\n346\n00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,690\nThat is correct.\n\n347\n00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,790\n>> But we can, there is policies.\n\n348\n00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,610\n>> We'll get to policies in a minute,\nbut we can BitLocker that VM.\n\n349\n00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:19,100\n>> I'm confident there's policies in there\nwhere we can turn off the requirement for\n\n350\n00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,940\na TPM and\nonly allow a pin to boot that guy up.\n\n351\n00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,440\nSounds good.\n\n352\n00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,470\n>> But, let's see, but before we get into\nthat, let's talk about Bitlocker To Go.\n\n353\n00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,000\nAll right.\n\n354\n00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,910\nSounds good.\n\n355\n00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,779\n>> So similar to BitLocker,\nBitLocker To Go as we mentioned before,\n\n356\n00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:38,490\nit encrypts thumbdrives, all right?\n\n357\n00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,070\n>> So when I went out of the country,\n\n358\n00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:45,590\nall my thumbdrives, even though I\ndidn't really store anything on them.\n\n359\n00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,540\n>> If I lose them, if I drop them,\nno matter what's on there.\n\n360\n00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,280\n>> I don't really want anybody digging\nthrough it and not only that but\n\n361\n00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,000\nit's like well if I can't have it,\nI don't want anybody else to have it.\n\n362\n00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,710\n>> So you know, I have to say is,\njust encrypt everything.\n\n363\n00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,340\nYeah the idea of BitLocker to go for\n\n364\n00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,970\nus is really about the idea\nof those small devices\n\n365\n00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,920\nthat really do need encryption especially\nif they come out of your business.\n\n366\n00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,480\nOkay?\n\n367\n00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,930\nSo if you and I think about it,\nI can BitLocker my hard drive.\n\n368\n00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:19,960\nThe chances of me actually leaving\nit at Starbucks, is probably nil,\n\n369\n00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,860\nbecause I don't go to Starbucks.\n\n370\n00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,310\nSecondly though,\nif I tend to leave anything,\n\n371\n00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,300\nit's not just going to be just my Laptop.\n\n372\n00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,170\nUsually if I'm carrying anything, it's my\nentire backpack, it has not only the idea\n\n373\n00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,870\nof my computer on it, but also those\nportable drives, like thumbdrives.\n\n374\n00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,330\nI even have a little portable, terabyte\nhard drive that I carry around with me.\n\n375\n00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,030\nAgain, it's everything\nthat's going to be left.\n\n376\n00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,310\nIf I BitLocker just my computer, it works.\n\n377\n00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,470\nBut what about all the other\ninformation that may be on those other\n\n378\n00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,660\nportable drives?\n\n379\n00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,620\nI think in my bag right now,\nI have three or four of these thumbdrives.\n\n380\n00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,460\nI know I have at least that\nterabyte drive in there,\n\n381\n00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,610\nif I don't have another\none In there as well.\n\n382\n00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,380\nWell, the information on those,\n\n383\n00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,400\neven though they may not be valuable\nto you, they're valuable to me.\n\n384\n00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,170\nIf they're actually a part of where I\nwork and have business information on it,\n\n385\n00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,930\nthey're valuable to my business.\n\n386\n00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,140\nSo Windows went ahead and\n\n387\n00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,281\nmade the decision to actually\nimplement the idea of BitLocker To Go.\n\n388\n00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,090\nReally, that's a Windows\n7 specific thing for us.\n\n389\n00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,820\nThat we can now encrypt\nthese portable drives here.\n\n390\n00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,260\nNow, when we do so, the nice thing\nabout the idea of doing the BitLocker\n\n391\n00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,300\nis that it doesn't actually have\nto be all NTFS partitions, right?\n\n392\n00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:39,040\nSo, if you do have portable drives and\nthey are, again, formatted with exFAT or\n\n393\n00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,590\nFAT here, BitLocker to go will\nstill work on those drives as well.\n\n394\n00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,580\nSo that way you actually have another\nencryption that you can also run\n\n395\n00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,790\non those, too.\n\n396\n00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,540\nNow the other thing about this that's\nactually quite neat here in terms of bit\n\n397\n00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,770\nlocker to go, is that,\nwhat if I have that bit locker to go, and\n\n398\n00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:00,150\nnow I bring it from a Windows\n7 machine back into Vista?\n\n399\n00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,820\nOr maybe even back in the on supported\noperating system day, the world and\n\n400\n00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,200\nWindows XP.\n\n401\n00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,610\nWell you can actually go ahead and\ninsert that in, and\n\n402\n00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,700\nthough you can actually go ahead and\ntype in the key to unlock it,\n\n403\n00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,590\nit doesn't give you the ability\nto write to that drive.\n\n404\n00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,810\nSo you can't overwrite files here,\nbut you do have the idea of read only\n\n405\n00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:25,190\ncompatibility, all the way back to\nthe days of XP, if you needed to.\n\n406\n00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,450\nSo be assured that your data can\nactually move between those operating\n\n407\n00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,730\nsystems as well.\n\n408\n00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,890\nSo there is a lot of functionality,\na lot of protection offered for\n\n409\n00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,280\nus when we actually choose to do this.\n\n410\n00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,220\nOkay.\n\n411\n00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,750\n>> All right.\nAnd sweet.\n\n412\n00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,395\n>> So, I got that thumbdrive in there that\nwe stored the BitLocker key on there with.\n\n413\n00:23:42,395 --> 00:23:43,950\n>> Let's go in and\nturn on bit locker for it.\n\n414\n00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,869\nAll right.\n>> All right.\n\n415\n00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:46,663\n>> So, down below here, right.\n\n416\n00:23:46,663 --> 00:23:48,805\n>> So we got, you know,\nlet's check on the status.\n\n417\n00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:51,168\n22.8%, right?\n\n418\n00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:52,729\nAnd let's see, and how large?\n\n419\n00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:53,547\nIt is not too big.\n\n420\n00:23:53,547 --> 00:23:56,021\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n421\n00:23:56,021 --> 00:23:58,300\nIt's getting full.\n\n422\n00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,390\n>> Yeah.\n\n423\n00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,868\n>> So we've got,\nI need to delete some stuff out of there.\n\n424\n00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:05,681\n[LAUGH] Oh man that's, that's.\n\n425\n00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:06,830\nAnyway there, okay.\n\n426\n00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,480\nSo 75 gigs, all right.\n\n427\n00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,330\nIt's not terribly big.\n\n428\n00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,150\nIt is a SSD.\n\n429\n00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,772\nSo it is taking a little bit.\n\n430\n00:24:13,772 --> 00:24:18,570\nAll right, so we'll go and\nclick on bit locker for that.\n\n431\n00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,120\nAnd it will, you know,\ntest the thumb drive and\n\n432\n00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,450\nmake sure that everything\nwill be looking good.\n\n433\n00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:29,670\nNow with the BitLocker To Go, we don't\nreally need a TPM for these little guys.\n\n434\n00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,570\nAll right, so\nwe'll just use a password for it.\n\n435\n00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,879\nSo type password, we'll.\n\n436\n00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,980\nAll right, and\nif we had a smart card handy, right?\n\n437\n00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,080\nThe option down below it we can\nuse a smart card to unlock it.\n\n438\n00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,512\nWhich I don't, currently.\n\n439\n00:24:46,512 --> 00:24:48,510\nAll right?\n\n440\n00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,060\nNow, what we will do is\nsave the recovery key.\n\n441\n00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,000\nSure, we'll save it.\n\n442\n00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,142\nAnd for that, let's see,\n\n443\n00:24:57,142 --> 00:25:03,230\nwe'll put it on D Drive and click on save.\n\n444\n00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,320\nDa da dum.\n\n445\n00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,370\nI'll stick it in Games folder.\n\n446\n00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,890\nThere's some more recovery keys in there.\n\n447\n00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,450\nSweet.\nI don't remember which one it was, but\n\n448\n00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,160\nwe'll just try them in\ncase something happens.\n\n449\n00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,850\nThen, we'll click on Next.\n\n450\n00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,710\nAnd that's it.\n\n451\n00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,980\nSo we'll start encrypting that drive.\n\n452\n00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,880\n>> There we go.\n\n453\n00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,020\n>> So we can minimize that, right?\n\n454\n00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,580\nSo we'll scoot the one for\nour C drive out of the way.\n\n455\n00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,310\nWe'll slide the one under there.\n\n456\n00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,410\nAll right, now that thumb drive.\n\n457\n00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,470\nSo, it's a 16 gig thumb drive.\n\n458\n00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,840\nYeah, it'll slow turn on.\n\n459\n00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,130\nAnd yeah, lock that guy down.\n\n460\n00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:48,750\n>> Hey Nate, go ahead and bring that file\nexplorer back up for us for a moment.\n\n461\n00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,270\nAnd let's take a look at\nthe icon differences as well.\n\n462\n00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,710\nCan you make that icon bigger?\n\n463\n00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,260\nShow large.\n\n464\n00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,090\nYou know what I'm talking about?\n\n465\n00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,030\nThe little link up there\non the right hand corner?\n\n466\n00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,490\n>> All right, let me.\n\n467\n00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:06,990\n>> Right.\n\n468\n00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,120\nThe third one, the third icon\nin from the right-hand side.\n\n469\n00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,960\n>> What?\nWhere?\n\n470\n00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,790\n>> Yeah,\non that bar going toward the right.\n\n471\n00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,520\nKeep going.\n\n472\n00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,280\nKeep going, there.\n\n473\n00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,810\nGo to Large Icons.\n\n474\n00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,230\nIf we can even do extra large,\nit probably wouldn't hurt.\n\n475\n00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,250\nNow, when you take a look at this,\nhere, right?\n\n476\n00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,960\nYou know that your drives are actually\ngoing to be using Bit Locker\n\n477\n00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,600\nwhen you insert them in,\nbecause you're gonna see this lock.\n\n478\n00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,050\nRight now, it shows you that\nthe drives are actually unlocked.\n\n479\n00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,340\nYou can see where the lock\nis actually not put in.\n\n480\n00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,290\nThe key is already inserted in there.\n\n481\n00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,610\nBut when you do lock a hard drive, one of\nthe icons that ends up showing up here,\n\n482\n00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:48,220\nand we'll see it in the BitLocker to go,\nis you'll see that,\n\n483\n00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,100\nthat particular padlock will turn gold.\n\n484\n00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,520\nAnd then, for you to access it,\n\n485\n00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,210\nyou'll have to provide that\npasskey to be able to do that.\n\n486\n00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,830\nOkay, so\nagain just another visual reminder for\n\n487\n00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:02,240\nus that we are actually, that we do\nhave encrypted drives on our computer.\n\n488\n00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,290\n>> All right Ronnie, let's see.\n\n489\n00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,280\nYou know, we've got some more\nthings to get with BitLocker.\n\n490\n00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,900\nBut we are coming up on our break here.\n\n491\n00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,840\n>> Okay.\n>> We've some policies and\n\n492\n00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,380\nthose sorts of things to get into.\n\n493\n00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,530\nAnd we'll let this stuff\ncontinue on encrypting.\n\n494\n00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:23,725\nAnd so we'll get to that stuff and some\nmore BitLocker policies after the break.\n\n495\n00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:28,872\n>> [NOISE] All right,\n\n496\n00:27:28,872 --> 00:27:33,336\nwelcome back.\n\n497\n00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:36,550\nAll right, so where we left off,\nright, we had some drives encrypting.\n\n498\n00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,773\nWe're talking about good ol' bitlocker.\n\n499\n00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:39,185\nBit locker to go.\n\n500\n00:27:39,185 --> 00:27:46,435\nAnd we have some policies to get into on\nthings that we can control for bit locker.\n\n501\n00:27:46,435 --> 00:27:47,065\nAll right.\n\n502\n00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:51,330\nSo, taking a look at my PC,\nwe can see that the C drive is finished.\n\n503\n00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,166\n>> Nice.\n>> All right, so, 80 gigs, right?\n\n504\n00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:58,330\n75 gigs, and encrypted,\nnot bad, pretty quick.\n\n505\n00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:58,830\n>> Right.\n\n506\n00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,971\n>> So we just close that.\n\n507\n00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:02,994\nNow, that thumb drive.\n\n508\n00:28:02,994 --> 00:28:04,840\nIt\n>> [LAUGH] It's low.\n\n509\n00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,510\n>> It is taking it's time.\n\n510\n00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,380\nThe thumb drive.\n\n511\n00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,840\nI bought these thumb drives.\n\n512\n00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,400\nThey're pretty cheap.\n\n513\n00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,390\nRight.\nThey weren't very expensive.\n\n514\n00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,740\nAnd they're very tiny.\n\n515\n00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,430\nThey fit on a keychain.\n\n516\n00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,480\nI thought they were fantastic.\n\n517\n00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,370\nThey're the slowest drives,\nI've ever had to use, ever.\n\n518\n00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,420\n>> Right.\n>> And so\n\n519\n00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,350\nis their USB 2.0 drives but,\nthey write, at 750k.\n\n520\n00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,230\n>> Yeah.\n\n521\n00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,750\n>> It's unbelievable.\n\n522\n00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,000\nI mean, they're near worthless.\n\n523\n00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,950\nSo I'm not surprised that it is\ntaking this long to encrypt.\n\n524\n00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,040\n>> Now, there is something that I do want\nto mention, cuz I I think it surprised me,\n\n525\n00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,090\nand then I remembered\nwhat was going on here.\n\n526\n00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,720\nWhen Nate was encrypting the actual\nC drive, the operating system drive,\n\n527\n00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,260\nnotice that we were still working and\nstill actually able to do this.\n\n528\n00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,847\nWe didn't have to pause and\n\n529\n00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:54,851\ndo all of our work that we were in\nthe midst of actually doing, right?\n\n530\n00:28:54,851 --> 00:28:57,076\nSo we were able to do some other demos.\n\n531\n00:28:57,076 --> 00:29:01,339\nAs we continued to go through, we were\nable to actually use the actual computer\n\n532\n00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:05,290\nat the same time to actually also do\nthis BitLocker To Go encryption too.\n\n533\n00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:05,795\nOkay?\nNow,\n\n534\n00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:08,834\nin terms of the protection of BItLocker,\nthere's something, I always,\n\n535\n00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:11,209\nwhen somebody asks me well,\nhow does this actually work?\n\n536\n00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,970\nAnd how does it protect us here?\n\n537\n00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,790\nYou have got to remember that,\n\n538\n00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:18,210\nit really protects us when we\nactually turn the computer off.\n\n539\n00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,880\nSo while we using the actual computer,\n\n540\n00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,685\nthere is no encryption\nthat is really going on.\n\n541\n00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:27,195\nOkay?\nWhat happens is that it is decrypted.\n\n542\n00:29:27,195 --> 00:29:30,580\nBut then, when we turn it off,\nit encrypts the drive then, right?\n\n543\n00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,500\nIt's when you actually try to reboot,\nthat it actually offers the protection.\n\n544\n00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,790\nSo there's really no protection.\n\n545\n00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,120\nLike right now,\nif somebody is connecting and\n\n546\n00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,390\nthen doing an attack,\nthere's no real protection at that point.\n\n547\n00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,750\nIt's when the machine is turned off and\n\n548\n00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:47,690\nwe try and turn it back on, that we do see\nwhere BitLocker actually is protecting us.\n\n549\n00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,230\nSo again, it actually still worked.\n\n550\n00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,160\nAnd we're ready to go at this point here,\nin our next demo,\n\n551\n00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,229\nas we wait on Nate's slow\nthumb drive from wherever.\n\n552\n00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:59,693\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yep,\n\n553\n00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:02,542\nso let's take a look at\nsome BitLocker policies,\n\n554\n00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:07,500\nsome things that we can do to control\nthe behavior of good old Bit Locker.\n\n555\n00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,710\n>> Yep, sounds good.\n\n556\n00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,960\n>> So for our demonstration here, so\n\n557\n00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,810\nwe're going to be using our local\ngroup policy and on this PC here.\n\n558\n00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:22,360\nSo to get into our local group policy,\n\n559\n00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,836\ngood old gpedit.msc.\n\n560\n00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,410\nLet me expand.\n\n561\n00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:29,910\nOops.\n\n562\n00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,170\nOh my heavens, there we go.\n\n563\n00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,040\n>> That was a challenge.\n\n564\n00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,000\n>> Yeah, for heaven's sake, yeah.\n\n565\n00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,490\nNormally, I have a little\nmouse plugged in.\n\n566\n00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,040\nBut there's only two USB ports.\n\n567\n00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,800\nSo the thumb drive, I had to unplug\nthe mouse and use the touchpad.\n\n568\n00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,960\nAnyhow, all right.\n\n569\n00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,700\nSo to get into some bitlocker policies,\n\n570\n00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,790\nwe're going to drill down administrative\ntemplates and Windows components.\n\n571\n00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,260\nThen, there's the guy right there.\n\n572\n00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,460\nBitlocker drive encryption.\n\n573\n00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:02,640\nWe've got some policies\nout here lingering around.\n\n574\n00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,620\nSo some good things.\n\n575\n00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,620\nAll right.\nSo Ronnie let me give you a little quiz.\n\n576\n00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,350\nSo do you know the default\nencryption level of Bitlocker?\n\n577\n00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,430\n>> I do not know the default\nlevel of Bitlocker encryption.\n\n578\n00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,130\nDo you know the default level\nof Bitlocker encryption?\n\n579\n00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,500\n>> It's AES 128 I believe.\n\n580\n00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,212\n>> AES 128.\n\n581\n00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:26,560\nAll right, so we can change it,\nright, if we wanted it stronger.\n\n582\n00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,290\nSo click on enabled,\nsure enough there we go.\n\n583\n00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,500\nAS 128.\n>> With the diffuser.\n\n584\n00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,050\n>> With diffuser, all right,\nso you know we can change it.\n\n585\n00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,175\nSo here we go,\nif wanted to change BitLocker,\n\n586\n00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:39,302\nmake it a bit more stronger\nwe can do that here.\n\n587\n00:31:39,302 --> 00:31:43,575\nAll right, let's jump up here\ninto removable data drives.\n\n588\n00:31:43,575 --> 00:31:48,747\nSo we've got three folders up here for\nhow we keep control of bit locker.\n\n589\n00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:54,650\nWe have fixed data drives, which are just\nsecondary drives inside of our RPC.\n\n590\n00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:59,660\nOur operating system drives,\none has an operating system on it.\n\n591\n00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,600\nAnd then removable data drive, so\nour thumb drives and those sorts.\n\n592\n00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,341\nAll right, so into our thumb drives,\n\n593\n00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,490\nthere are a couple of policies\nthat we can call out.\n\n594\n00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,380\nControl the use of removal drives.\n\n595\n00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,610\nSo if we enable this, we could allow\nusers to encrypt their thumb drives.\n\n596\n00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:19,850\nWe can allow users to suspend and\ndecrypt those things.\n\n597\n00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,460\nSo Ronnie, let me ask you this,\nwhy would we want to?\n\n598\n00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,959\nLet's say if we disable this.\n\n599\n00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:32,220\nSo if we disable it, we will not allow\nusers to encrypt their removable drive.\n\n600\n00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:38,730\nWhat scenarios would we want\nto do something like this?\n\n601\n00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,000\n>> To not allow users to\nencrypt their drives?\n\n602\n00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,220\nYeah, what would you think?\n\n603\n00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,760\n>> So that they don't actually\ntake data and encrypt it for\n\n604\n00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,250\nthemselves, and it's my data?\n\n605\n00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:48,830\nRight.\n>> Yeah?\n\n606\n00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:50,910\n>> Yeah.\n\n607\n00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,730\nWith BitLocker, AS128, if someone\n\n608\n00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:59,020\nwas able to bit lock this thumb drive,\njust throw the key away and\n\n609\n00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,460\njust delete it, and not even have it,\nor use it for some kind of ransom.\n\n610\n00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,460\nIt sounds awful, but it is possible,\nand in some organizations you may not\n\n611\n00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,760\nwant employees to be\nable to encrypt things.\n\n612\n00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,090\nUnless you have some kind\nof central management,\n\n613\n00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,480\nwhere you can grab those\nencryption keys like EFS.\n\n614\n00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,320\nYou, issue out certificates, right?\n\n615\n00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,800\nFor EFS, then, you can control,\nnot control, but you can recover data\n\n616\n00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:33,150\nin the event that an employee tries to,\nI guess either delete their profile,\n\n617\n00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:37,900\nor throw their keys away, or just encrypt\nstuff, with not quite realizing it.\n\n618\n00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,290\nLet me click Cancel on that.\n\n619\n00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:45,610\nNow this is kind of the other\nside of the fence here,\n\n620\n00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:50,510\nso we can enable this, so\nwe can require, right?\n\n621\n00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:55,310\nAnd employees, if they want to be able\nto write to these removal drives,\n\n622\n00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,332\nyou must encrypt it.\n\n623\n00:33:57,332 --> 00:34:00,430\nAll right, so let's say, you know,\nthumb drive heavens sakes.\n\n624\n00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:04,730\nYou know, I mean there are large\nthumb drives out there.\n\n625\n00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,040\nI mean 200, 256 gigs,\nhave they made it that big yet?\n\n626\n00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,720\n>> Probably.\n[LAUGH] There's 64 gigs.\n\n627\n00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,770\nI think I've seen 128 gigs.\n\n628\n00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,750\nI mean those are really, really big.\n\n629\n00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,350\n>> They are.\n\n630\n00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,210\nFor employees to build,\nto just bring these removable drives,\n\n631\n00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,550\nthey are awfully small, they could use it,\n\n632\n00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:24,340\nto store a number of files on,\nit could be real sensitive data.\n\n633\n00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:24,990\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n634\n00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:29,470\nSo for these employees, to take these work\ndocuments in and out, you may require,\n\n635\n00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,025\nthat those drives be protected.\n\n636\n00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:32,030\nMm-hm.\n\n637\n00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:36,220\nNow if they want to be\nable to write to them,\n\n638\n00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,540\nof course, if you don't do anything then\nthey would still be able to read it but\n\n639\n00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,970\nyou won't be able to write anything to it.\n\n640\n00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,280\n>> Yeah, and actually this is one of the\nbig security things that really is a good\n\n641\n00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,490\nthing for us, right?\n\n642\n00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:51,970\n>> In our Organization, we allow people\nto, again, remove documents, again,\n\n643\n00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,246\ndata from our network, right?\n\n644\n00:34:54,246 --> 00:34:57,642\n>> We want to make sure that, if there\nactually using it, that's perfectly fine.\n\n645\n00:34:57,642 --> 00:35:00,880\n>> But we want to make sure that if\nsomebody else grabs a hold of that,\n\n646\n00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,930\nthey really don't have access to it.\n\n647\n00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:07,370\n>> So instead by requiring people\nto actually be able to use this,\n\n648\n00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:10,070\nwe say it's got to be\nencrypted with BitLocker here.\n\n649\n00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,510\n>> It at least gives us that protection,\nif they happen to lose it or\n\n650\n00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,970\nthe whole thing gets stolen here, this\nis something that's really important for\n\n651\n00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,560\nus in terms of actually\nimplementing BitLocker.\n\n652\n00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,980\nAll right,\nlet's just click cancel on that.\n\n653\n00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,900\nRight now let's take a look at some\nof the operating system drives.\n\n654\n00:35:27,142 --> 00:35:32,430\nAll right, so Ronnie, on your VM,\nwe can try these policies out on\n\n655\n00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:38,010\nyours to see if not it's a VirtualBox VM,\nI've done this in Hyper-V and it works.\n\n656\n00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,510\nSo I was able to use BitLocker\nto encrypt some of the VMs and\n\n657\n00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:47,480\nit surprisingly it didn't really\nhave a big performance hit.\n\n658\n00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,130\nIt took a little bit longer to startup,\nnot that much,\n\n659\n00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:54,530\nbut just navigating the VM line,\neverything was fine.\n\n660\n00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:59,130\nAll right, so these two policies,\nlet's say you do not have a TPM, but\n\n661\n00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:05,390\nyou still want to leverage BitLocker\nto encrypt your stuff, all right?\n\n662\n00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,260\nWe've got this one here at the top,\n\n663\n00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,110\nrequire additional\nauthentication at start up.\n\n664\n00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,470\nAll right let me drag this box up.\n\n665\n00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,290\nWe can enable.\n\n666\n00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,830\nAll right so that very first.\n\n667\n00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,220\nLet me slide that over right there.\n\n668\n00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,260\nThere we go.\n\n669\n00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,720\nThat very first checkbox,\nallow BitLocker without a compatible TPM.\n\n670\n00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,580\nYou can check that and then there are some\noptions, get the mouse down there.\n\n671\n00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,660\nThere we got some options here right?\n\n672\n00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,820\nSo, we can allow a start up pin.\n\n673\n00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,300\nStart up keys.\n\n674\n00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,750\nRight start up key and a pin and a TPM.\n\n675\n00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,420\nA start up key it's a file.\n\n676\n00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,630\nA little file that you\nstick onto a USB drive.\n\n677\n00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:54,020\nAnd as you built that PC, if that\nthumbdrive is inserted into your PC,\n\n678\n00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:58,350\nthen BitLocker will look at that\nthumbdrive, look for that special file,\n\n679\n00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:02,360\nand be able to use that unlock your PC and\njust keep tracking along, all right?\n\n680\n00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,120\nSo not bad.\n\n681\n00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,770\n>> Yeah.\n\n682\n00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:10,280\nHowever, you'd always need to have that\nUSB drive handy to pop into that PC.\n\n683\n00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,250\nNow, if you just leave\nthe thumb drive in your PC,\n\n684\n00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:18,170\nthat almost kind of defeats the purpose\nof it, but if someone was able to\n\n685\n00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:22,270\nget to that thumb drive,\nthey would be able to unlock your PC.\n\n686\n00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:22,870\n>> Yeah.\n\n687\n00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,350\n>> This particular setting\nhere is a great setting for\n\n688\n00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,340\nus in terms of what we see here.\n\n689\n00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,110\n>> Because if you take a look at it,\nit actually shows us\n\n690\n00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:34,650\nthe different levels of protection that\nwe can use along with BitLocker as well.\n\n691\n00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,130\n>> And the top there,\n\n692\n00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:41,650\nin configuring the TPM to startup by far,\nthat is more secure than not having one.\n\n693\n00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:45,300\n>> But at the same time,\nevery single computer that starts up,\n\n694\n00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,440\nif it has one, it has one.\n\n695\n00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,340\n>> And that means it's going to check it,\nit's going to be there, it's going\n\n696\n00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,890\ncontinue to boot up, BitLocker's\nnot going to have any problems.\n\n697\n00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:52,680\nAnd we just choose that one.\n\n698\n00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,450\n>> That is our weakest\nparticular level of encryption\n\n699\n00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,290\nthat we can do to protect BitLocker.\n\n700\n00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:03,040\n>> Okay, if you do the TPM and the startup\nPIN, again, more secure, right?\n\n701\n00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,170\n>> Because it requires not only\nthe TPM to be there but for\n\n702\n00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,840\nyou to be there to type in whatever PIN\nnumber that you actually have to type in,\n\n703\n00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,090\nso that they again can actually go\nahead and use that combination.\n\n704\n00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,370\n>> So it becomes multi-factor, okay?\n\n705\n00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:20,380\n>> Being able to provide an extra\nkey is again another type of\n\n706\n00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,360\na multi-factor as well, right?\n\n707\n00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,090\n>> For us here, it requires you to\nhave a physical device and a TPM, but\n\n708\n00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:29,630\nby far the most secure\nthat we have of course\n\n709\n00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,560\nis the last one where we're actually doing\nthree factor authentication here instead.\n\n710\n00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,080\n>> So not only a removable drive but\nthe TPN as well as the pin number here.\n\n711\n00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,260\n>> So a lot of times in terms\nof different scenarios, right?\n\n712\n00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,350\n>> If your business requires you to\nuse TPN but they tell you that you\n\n713\n00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:49,360\nneed to use the strongest way to protect,\nyou're just going to let that last option.\n\n714\n00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,810\n>> If they tell you that you need to use\na combination of maybe a pin number and\n\n715\n00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,580\nthe actual hardware base.\n\n716\n00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,510\n>> You can actually choose\none of the other two.\n\n717\n00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,710\n>> So, just pick and choose here,\n\n718\n00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,684\ndepending on the scenario\nthat you're actually in.\n\n719\n00:39:02,684 --> 00:39:04,640\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at another policy.\n\n720\n00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,870\nSo here's this one here,\nI'll click on cancel.\n\n721\n00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:11,610\nAll right, we've got, let's see.\n\n722\n00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,810\nSo we've got one here,\nallow for enhanced PINs.\n\n723\n00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,710\nI'll start up now by default, right?\n\n724\n00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:22,490\nJust get letters and numbers.\n\n725\n00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:27,230\nNow if we enable this policy, here we\nget upper case, lower case letters,\n\n726\n00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:31,410\nsymbols, numbers and\nspaces that we can use for our pins.\n\n727\n00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:36,630\nNow it does have a little note down here\nat the bottom that some PC's may not,\n\n728\n00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,157\nnot all of them,\nmay support these enhanced pins.\n\n729\n00:39:40,157 --> 00:39:42,247\nSo we've got that one here.\n\n730\n00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:45,269\n>> Yeah, this is a little bit more unusual\nin the very fact that what they're\n\n731\n00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:48,730\nexpecting an I don't know why they would\nexpect this, but let's say that they are,\n\n732\n00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,249\nall right?\n\n733\n00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:52,390\nThere are minimum hardware\nrequirements for Windows 7.\n\n734\n00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:57,260\nAnd the requirements today,\nthey are not exactly the most powerfully,\n\n735\n00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,770\nhigh performance PC\nrequirements that we have.\n\n736\n00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:03,570\nBut there used to be a point in time, and\nI'm talking about way back even before\n\n737\n00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:07,850\nthe minimum requirements of Windows 7,\nthat at boot up,\n\n738\n00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:13,695\nyour particular computer's keyboard,\nall of the keys could not be accessible.\n\n739\n00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:14,700\nOkay?\n\n740\n00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,450\nSo, at boot up, the only keys that were\nreally accessible a lot of the times\n\n741\n00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,630\nwere essentially your function keys,\nF1 through the F12 or\n\n742\n00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,480\nF10, whatever your keyboard actually was.\n\n743\n00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,220\nWell, at that point, when you did have to\nenter in a particular passcode to unlock\n\n744\n00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,830\nBitLocker, I don't know when\nthis would have happened, but\n\n745\n00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,050\nyou would actually have had to use\nyour F1 through your F12 keys.\n\n746\n00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,880\nBut, because most of the keyboards today,\n\n747\n00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,330\nthey'll automatically recognize\nwhen you do boot the computer up.\n\n748\n00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,890\nThe entire key set.\n\n749\n00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,400\nYou can use a combination here.\n\n750\n00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,560\nThey're just saying look, if you're not\nsure if it can go ahead and do this and\n\n751\n00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,110\nthat way, you'll be sure that you can now\nenter enhanced pins along with it and\n\n752\n00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,740\nnot just have them use F1 through F12.\n\n753\n00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,180\nYep.\n>> All right.\n\n754\n00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,870\nSo we've got minimum pin length.\n\n755\n00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,190\nWe can specify a pin length.\n\n756\n00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:06,070\nNow, I did briefly say,\n\n757\n00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:10,320\nthat if you're in a company environment,\nright?\n\n758\n00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,650\nThat's for\nthese BitLocker encryption keys.\n\n759\n00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:17,060\nYou can store them inside your\nactive directory profile.\n\n760\n00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,610\n>> Right.\n\n761\n00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,440\n>> So that way,\nif you are on your business network,\n\n762\n00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,570\nthere's a feature called Network Unlock.\n\n763\n00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:26,530\nTo where if your PC is just\nconnected to that domain network,\n\n764\n00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,470\nit can call on that key,\nand unlock itself.\n\n765\n00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,780\nPretty fancy.\n\n766\n00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,420\n>> Nice, fast.\n\n767\n00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,055\n>> It works well, for servers.\n\n768\n00:41:36,055 --> 00:41:39,702\nLet's say, if you have a server, and\nif you're concerned about the physical\n\n769\n00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:43,510\nsecurity, of somebody getting in there and\nswiping out those hard drives.\n\n770\n00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,820\nYou can have the network,\nunlocked, on your servers.\n\n771\n00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,610\nAnd that way, if your servers\nhave to reboot for one reason or\n\n772\n00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,720\nanother, not everybody works\ninside the server closet.\n\n773\n00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,960\nThey work remotely.\n\n774\n00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,820\nWhen those servers reboot, then as\nlong as they connect to the network,\n\n775\n00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,330\nthey'll fire back up.\n\n776\n00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:04,920\nNow, to have those keys\nstored in Active Directory,\n\n777\n00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,900\nthis guy right here is what we we'll use.\n\n778\n00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,760\nAll right.\nSo\n\n779\n00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,350\nenabling this policy\ngives these options here.\n\n780\n00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,700\nWe can allow for a data recovery agent.\n\n781\n00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:22,200\nWhich we'll take a look at that on\nhow to add a data recovery agent.\n\n782\n00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,150\nA data recovery agent is somebody that\nis able to unlock your Bit Locker,\n\n783\n00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,870\nencrypted drives.\n\n784\n00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:34,170\nIn the event that you're unable to\nunlock them, you a data recovery agent.\n\n785\n00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,365\nWe'll go on down here [NOISE].\n\n786\n00:42:39,365 --> 00:42:43,979\nThis guy right there,\nsave Bit Locker recovery information to\n\n787\n00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:49,400\nactive directory domain services for\noperating system drives.\n\n788\n00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,530\nIn this check box here,\nit will save that information out there.\n\n789\n00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,780\nThere is a little bit\nmore on the back end.\n\n790\n00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,590\nBut from the client side,\nit is that option right there.\n\n791\n00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,410\nAnd what do we want to save in there?\n\n792\n00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:07,990\nWell, we got just the recovery passwords\nor these key packages which both.\n\n793\n00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,930\n>> Yeah.\n>> Might as well.\n\n794\n00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:17,860\nAll right, so we've got those guys there.\n\n795\n00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,903\nLet's see,\nin browsing into the fixed data drives.\n\n796\n00:43:20,903 --> 00:43:25,090\nThere's not terribly a whole\nlot different in here.\n\n797\n00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,420\nPasswords and how they can be recovered.\n\n798\n00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,350\nSo we can also store those keys\nin active directory as well.\n\n799\n00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:38,380\nFor that data recovery agent, let's go and\n\n800\n00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,870\ntake a look at that one\non how we can add one.\n\n801\n00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:47,550\nSo, computer configuration,\nand Windows settings.\n\n802\n00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:50,018\nAnd into security settings.\n\n803\n00:43:50,018 --> 00:43:54,395\nPublic key policies, and span that down.\n\n804\n00:43:56,295 --> 00:44:00,125\nAnd pull that menu over, all right.\n\n805\n00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:04,955\nBit Locker drive encryption,\nno data recovery agents have been defined.\n\n806\n00:44:04,955 --> 00:44:06,865\nWell, let's define one.\n\n807\n00:44:06,865 --> 00:44:12,880\nSo you're going to right click on that and\nselect add data recovery agent.\n\n808\n00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,350\nSo I get this neat little wizard here.\n\n809\n00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,920\nAll right, let's define somebody.\n\n810\n00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,420\nAll right.\n\n811\n00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,070\nNow, we need to browse for a certificate.\n\n812\n00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:20,700\nA certificate for\n\n813\n00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,560\nthat person who we're gonna designate\nas our data recovery agent.\n\n814\n00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,110\nI click on folders.\n\n815\n00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:31,190\nAll right, now, before the show I saved\none here in this Labstuff folder.\n\n816\n00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:33,000\nWe got this certificate right here.\n\n817\n00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,860\nSo we just select it.\n\n818\n00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,170\nAnd click on open.\n\n819\n00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,240\nNow, because I don't have\nany of the back end set up,\n\n820\n00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,150\nit does give us this little warning.\n\n821\n00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,660\n>> Self sign certificate.\n\n822\n00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,630\n>> Self sign certificate,\nthank you, Ronnie.\n\n823\n00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:47,710\nClick on yes.\n\n824\n00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,340\nSo it's issued.\n\n825\n00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,065\nNathan, user unknown.\n\n826\n00:44:51,065 --> 00:44:52,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Eh.\n\n827\n00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,730\nFor our purposes, that's fine.\n\n828\n00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:54,300\n>> That'll work.\n\n829\n00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,120\nYep.\n\n830\n00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,620\n>> So click on next and finish.\n\n831\n00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,370\nAnd then there we go.\n\n832\n00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:04,460\nNow for\nthis is just the process on setting up.\n\n833\n00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:10,090\nYou're going to see for this certificate,\nit's intended purpose is for EFS.\n\n834\n00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:14,640\nSo if we were having the certificate\nissued from a certification authority.\n\n835\n00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,300\nThat are the intended purpose\nwe'd have a recovery agent or\n\n836\n00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,800\nsomething that of that nature to manage\nthe certificate, if it's still good.\n\n837\n00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,260\nBut for demonstration purposes,\n\n838\n00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,150\nright here is where we go to\nset that data recovery agent.\n\n839\n00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:29,120\n>> Yeah.\n\n840\n00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,770\nSo, both of these locations are fairly\nimportant as we are preparing for\n\n841\n00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,980\nthe exam, right?\n\n842\n00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:38,450\nKnowing where to put the data recovery\nagent certificate is also key for us.\n\n843\n00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:41,800\nSo, go ahead and explore this\ninside of your local group policy.\n\n844\n00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,380\nAnd then, being able to also\nconfigure those policies as well\n\n845\n00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,360\nunderneath the ideal administrative\ntemplates there too.\n\n846\n00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,090\nSo make sure you take\na look at those locations.\n\n847\n00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,490\nAnd go through some of those settings\nas you prepare for your exam.\n\n848\n00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,680\n>> All right.\n\n849\n00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:03,570\nSo we've got a command that we can run\nthrough on how to manage our keys.\n\n850\n00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,780\nNow, it does require a thumb drive.\n\n851\n00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:10,060\nWhich this guy here is\nstill cracking away.\n\n852\n00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:14,000\nSo I think what we'll do\nis that we'll move on.\n\n853\n00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,500\n>> Okay.\n\n854\n00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,430\n>> And so we'll run that command\nafter this guy is done so\n\n855\n00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,660\nthat we can see those files on there.\n\n856\n00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,490\n>> Sure.\nSounds great.\n\n857\n00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:22,540\n>> Mm hm.\n\n858\n00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,400\nAll right Ronnie, so\nwhat do we have lined up next then?\n\n859\n00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,120\nAnything else on Bitlocker?\n\n860\n00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,920\n>> I don't think so.\n\n861\n00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,560\nI think, once we actually get that\nlast little bit down, we'll be good.\n\n862\n00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,850\nSo, we'll take a look at\nthat a little later on.\n\n863\n00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,000\n>> Mm hm.\n\n864\n00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,850\nAll right.\n\n865\n00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:39,830\nSo up on our objectives,\nour official objective list.\n\n866\n00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,010\nAll right, we've got direct access.\n\n867\n00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,880\nNow, we're gonna save that direct access.\n\n868\n00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,800\nWe're gonna come back to that guy.\n\n869\n00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,560\nSo let's get into these mobility options.\n\n870\n00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,510\nRanked them offline files.\n\n871\n00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:52,550\nRight, so the very first part.\n\n872\n00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,715\n>> Ronnie,offline files, what are they?\n\n873\n00:46:54,715 --> 00:46:55,840\n>> Yep.\n>> What are they?\n\n874\n00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,030\n>> For us here, remember that there's a\nlot of times where people are going to be\n\n875\n00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:03,410\ntelecommuting, or they're gonna actually\nbe moving and using the idea of laptops,\n\n876\n00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:07,520\nmobility devices here, mobile computers\nfor us, the idea of laptops, right.\n\n877\n00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,450\nWe want to be able to\ninsure that those laptops\n\n878\n00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:14,040\ncan have access to files that may\nbe on our network share somewhere.\n\n879\n00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,550\nBut even if they're actually away, okay?\n\n880\n00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:18,290\nSo, a lot of times,\n\n881\n00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:22,530\nwhen we can use instead is a technology\nthat we call setting up offline files.\n\n882\n00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:26,754\nAnd what that will actually allow us to do\nis to allow the user, I hate to say it,\n\n883\n00:47:26,754 --> 00:47:31,106\ntrick the user, into thinking that he is\nactually still connected to the network\n\n884\n00:47:31,106 --> 00:47:34,185\nshare, even if he doesn't\nhave network connectivity.\n\n885\n00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,469\nSo the use of offline files, what it does,\n\n886\n00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:41,102\nis it takes the locations that we already\nmapped drives to, and essentially, again,\n\n887\n00:47:41,102 --> 00:47:44,798\nmakes a cache of them inside of our\nown computer in a hidden location.\n\n888\n00:47:44,798 --> 00:47:48,734\nBut when we go and try to access them\nin the same way that we normally would,\n\n889\n00:47:48,734 --> 00:47:52,140\nit looks like that we're\nconnected just like normal.\n\n890\n00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,630\nSo it really is a neat technology for\nus as well.\n\n891\n00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,290\n>> All right, so let's take a look\nat setting up these offline files.\n\n892\n00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:06,832\nSo let's see, on this PC here,\nI'll open this guy up go into Computer.\n\n893\n00:48:06,832 --> 00:48:11,080\nAll right so,\nlet's say that we have a network\n\n894\n00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,838\nshare that we want to connect to and\nwe have stuff in there.\n\n895\n00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,442\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nmap a network drive.\n\n896\n00:48:19,442 --> 00:48:22,305\nAll right, and we will choose the Z.\n\n897\n00:48:22,305 --> 00:48:26,540\nNow Ronnie, it's kind of interesting,\nbut I'm not sure if you're aware.\n\n898\n00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:31,520\nBut, so let's say if,\nwhen you add a hard drive to your PC,\n\n899\n00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,370\nWindows by default will pick letters, or\n\n900\n00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:39,380\nthe next available letter on\nthe south end of the alphabet.\n\n901\n00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,680\nSo A, B, C, D, it'll start there and\nthen work its way up.\n\n902\n00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,890\nWhen you map a network share,\nby default Windows will pick stuff\n\n903\n00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,480\non the other end of the alphabet and\nit'll start working its way up.\n\n904\n00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,290\nYeah, so there you go.\n\n905\n00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:53,852\nSo if Z was taken, what do you think\nthe next letter it would pick?\n\n906\n00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:55,617\n>> X.\n\n907\n00:48:55,617 --> 00:48:57,645\n>> A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J-\n>> No, it'd be Y.\n\n908\n00:48:57,645 --> 00:48:59,862\n>> Y.\n[LAUGH] I was like, wait, X?\n\n909\n00:48:59,862 --> 00:49:02,290\nX, Z, X, Z?\n\n910\n00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:04,070\nThat doesn't sound right.\n\n911\n00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,560\nAll right.\n\n912\n00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:12,500\nSo we do have a network share,\nso 10.1.23.200 and\n\n913\n00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:16,050\nI think it's called LabFiles.\n\n914\n00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:20,042\nDifferent credentials, Finish, Yes.\n\n915\n00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:27,279\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we'll remember those.\n\n916\n00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:29,960\nAll right.\n\n917\n00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,220\nWe're in business.\n\n918\n00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,510\nAll right, there we go.\n\n919\n00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,960\nSo we got some game save files,\n\n920\n00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,580\nthose are very important to\nstick on a network share.\n\n921\n00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,360\n>> Right.\n\n922\n00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,030\n>> We got some migration stuff and\nsome policies.\n\n923\n00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,390\nAll right, we'll click on here.\n\n924\n00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,880\nAll right so there we go.\n\n925\n00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,210\nNow, to make this offline, so\nlet's say that these files in here,\n\n926\n00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:51,400\nthat we want to access this stuff offline\nwhen we're away from the network.\n\n927\n00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,918\nWe can click on this guy to highlight it.\n\n928\n00:49:55,918 --> 00:50:00,230\nRight-click, and-\n>> Hey, look at that.\n\n929\n00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,290\n>> Always available offline.\n\n930\n00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:01,790\n>> There you go.\n\n931\n00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,050\n>> Click on this guy, and there we go.\n\n932\n00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:11,740\nSo it'll go ahead and start saving\na copy of these files locally,\n\n933\n00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:16,880\non our hard drive, so that we are still\nable to work with the files in here,\n\n934\n00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,300\nin the shared folder,\nwhile we are away from the network.\n\n935\n00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,090\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, pretty straightforward.\n\n936\n00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:30,870\nSo once we have enable that,\nwe can jump into good old Sync Center.\n\n937\n00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:33,470\nNow of course,\nthere's a little icon you can see.\n\n938\n00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:36,380\nIt's right there next to the box there.\n\n939\n00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,780\nThis little icon there,\nlittle arrows popping up there now.\n\n940\n00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:46,134\nTo get to this guy without that,\nwe go into Control Panel,\n\n941\n00:50:46,134 --> 00:50:51,986\nand then from Category I\nwould just go to Large Icons.\n\n942\n00:50:51,986 --> 00:50:55,780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] We'll just cut to the chase.\n\n943\n00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,990\nAnd then we got this guy right there,\nSync Center.\n\n944\n00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,610\nAnd from here, with Sync Center,\n\n945\n00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:05,780\nwe can check on the health of our syncing,\nif we have any conflicts.\n\n946\n00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,400\nLet's say that we're away\nfrom the network, and\n\n947\n00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,630\nI'm working on a particular document.\n\n948\n00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:13,380\nAnd while I'm away from the network\nworking on that document,\n\n949\n00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:17,700\nRonnie is currently on the network, and\nhe's also working on that same document.\n\n950\n00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,326\n>> Right.\n>> Well when I get back onto the network,\n\n951\n00:51:20,326 --> 00:51:23,600\nsync center is gonna sync that stuff up.\n\n952\n00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,110\nNow if we have any conflicts,\nnow we are coming up on break time, so\n\n953\n00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:31,978\nmaybe we'll during the break,\nwe'll quickly try to make some conflicts.\n\n954\n00:51:31,978 --> 00:51:32,920\n>> Okay.\n>> All right, so\n\n955\n00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:38,230\nwe can get conflicts in there,\nthen our results and all that good stuff.\n\n956\n00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:42,850\nNow I guess we don't really have much\ngoing on in here since we just barely\n\n957\n00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,130\nmapped it, some neat stuff.\n\n958\n00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,600\nWe're going to view our sync results.\n\n959\n00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,850\nNot a whole lot in there, but sure enough,\n\n960\n00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:53,070\nright, it started, it completed,\neverything is fine.\n\n961\n00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:55,030\nIf we do have any of those conflicts,\n\n962\n00:51:55,030 --> 00:52:00,088\nwhich we'll see if we can force some,\nthen everything is good in there.\n\n963\n00:52:00,088 --> 00:52:01,591\nAnd, yeah.\n\n964\n00:52:04,436 --> 00:52:08,410\nAll right, let's see, well,\nwe are coming up on our break.\n\n965\n00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:09,248\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Let's go ahead and\n\n966\n00:52:09,248 --> 00:52:10,290\ntake that break right there.\n\n967\n00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:13,496\nWe've got some more offline files,\nand just like BitLocker,\n\n968\n00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:16,530\nwe have some policies that we\ncan use to control this stuff.\n\n969\n00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,090\nSo, we'll get into that after the break.\n\n970\n00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:26,645\n[MUSIC]\n\n971\n00:52:26,645 --> 00:52:28,306\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n972\n00:52:28,306 --> 00:52:32,837\nAll right, so where we left off, we were\ntalking about those offline files, and\n\n973\n00:52:32,837 --> 00:52:34,400\nstuff like that.\n\n974\n00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,242\nNow during the break,\nI fired up a virtual machine and\n\n975\n00:52:37,242 --> 00:52:39,148\nI connected to that network share.\n\n976\n00:52:39,148 --> 00:52:41,556\nAnd then I yanked its network connection,\nand\n\n977\n00:52:41,556 --> 00:52:44,400\nchanged some files on that network share.\n\n978\n00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,040\nJoined it back, well, joined it back,\nI connected it back virtually\n\n979\n00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,540\nto its little virtual network, and\nsure enough, it threw out a conflict.\n\n980\n00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:55,963\nAll right, so we can take a look.\n\n981\n00:52:55,963 --> 00:53:00,329\nLet me jump back over to\nthat virtual machine.\n\n982\n00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:01,862\nHere we go.\n\n983\n00:53:01,862 --> 00:53:05,737\nAll right, so in here, all right, so\n\n984\n00:53:05,737 --> 00:53:10,719\nwhen I joined it back,\nthe process, what I did.\n\n985\n00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:17,165\nI joined it to the offline files, so\nthat network share made the files offline.\n\n986\n00:53:17,165 --> 00:53:17,702\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n987\n00:53:17,702 --> 00:53:20,750\n>> Put up the document,\none of our documents in there.\n\n988\n00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,290\nAnd, so this game codes document.\n\n989\n00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,580\nSo here we go, so here's the code.\n\n990\n00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,590\nGo left through the woods.\n\n991\n00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,880\nAfter left, go over the river.\n\n992\n00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,380\n>> Wow.\n\n993\n00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:38,130\n>> So what I did is then,\nI disconnected it from the network.\n\n994\n00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,940\nAnd while it was connected,\nI changed it, so\n\n995\n00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,930\nnow it's go left through the woods,\ndon't go left, go right.\n\n996\n00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,490\nSo now we've got a conflict.\n\n997\n00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,220\nWell, so what do we do about the conflict?\n\n998\n00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,630\nWell, we'll come back over here, so\n\n999\n00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:59,260\nI'll close that out, and\nwe will go, close that out.\n\n1000\n00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:03,748\nAll right, so when I join it back,\nso on our little offline files,\n\n1001\n00:54:03,748 --> 00:54:08,237\non a little green circle down there\nwe've got a little yield sign,\n\n1002\n00:54:08,237 --> 00:54:11,240\nI guess, a little yellow triangle-\n>> Warning, yup.\n\n1003\n00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,860\n>> Down there at the bottom.\n\n1004\n00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,580\nAnd sure enough, we have a conflict.\n\n1005\n00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:19,240\nAll right, so here is that conflict.\n\n1006\n00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,050\nAnd so we get a couple of options, right?\n\n1007\n00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,006\nWe can keep our version, or\n\n1008\n00:54:24,006 --> 00:54:29,720\nyou can keep the version that's on the\nnetwork share, or we can just keep both.\n\n1009\n00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,971\nNow, so from here, where I'm at right now,\n\n1010\n00:54:32,971 --> 00:54:38,330\nI don't know what has been changed\non that other document, right.\n\n1011\n00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:41,180\nI mean my PC, I just joined it back,\nand sure enough there's a conflict.\n\n1012\n00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,480\nSo somebody else I guess, is advancing\nthrough our game and found, hey whoa,\n\n1013\n00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,360\nwhoa don't go left,\nyou have to actually go right.\n\n1014\n00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,038\nAll right, so but\nwe don't know that at this point.\n\n1015\n00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:54,523\nIf we choose to keep ours,\nit'll overwrite that existing one.\n\n1016\n00:54:54,523 --> 00:55:00,600\nIf we chose to keep the one that's on\nthe network share, it will overwrite ours.\n\n1017\n00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:06,357\nBut in most cases, I think we would\njust choose to keep both versions.\n\n1018\n00:55:06,357 --> 00:55:07,124\n>> Right.\n\n1019\n00:55:07,124 --> 00:55:11,059\n>> So now if we go back,\nso no more conflicts now.\n\n1020\n00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:17,038\nAnd back in here so\nwe [SOUND] go back and do our game saves.\n\n1021\n00:55:17,038 --> 00:55:22,483\nAnd so now we've got that sync\nshare that's on the network share.\n\n1022\n00:55:22,483 --> 00:55:25,190\nAnd then we've got mine, right?\n\n1023\n00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,060\nSo go over the river.\n\n1024\n00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:30,950\nSo this way somebody after the fact,\nthey can go and compare the two documents.\n\n1025\n00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:34,812\nAnd we can see what's changed, what's\ndifferent, either collaborate the two,\n\n1026\n00:55:34,812 --> 00:55:36,585\nreplace one with the other.\n\n1027\n00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:39,125\nI guess whatever it is\nthat has been worked on.\n\n1028\n00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:41,839\n>> Yeah, it's very important that\nwe do keep both files normally.\n\n1029\n00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,386\nBecause, again, if you have multiple\npeople working on the same file,\n\n1030\n00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:46,098\nyou don't know what changes\nwere made here, and\n\n1031\n00:55:46,098 --> 00:55:48,765\nyou don't actually want to delete\nsomeones changes, or overwrite them.\n\n1032\n00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:50,298\nIf they're really essential.\n\n1033\n00:55:50,298 --> 00:55:53,227\nSo keeping all the copies and\nthen later on coming together and\n\n1034\n00:55:53,227 --> 00:55:54,749\ncollaborating about them, and\n\n1035\n00:55:54,749 --> 00:55:59,060\ninsuring that you actually keep all\nthe relevant information is gonna be key.\n\n1036\n00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,380\nSo again a good idea to do.\n\n1037\n00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,080\n>> All right.\nNow so,\n\n1038\n00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,460\nas far as managing these offline files.\n\n1039\n00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:09,590\nAll right, let's go ahead, and\nwe'll just minimize all this stuff.\n\n1040\n00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:13,945\nSo there are some policies that we have.\n\n1041\n00:56:13,945 --> 00:56:17,090\n[LAUGH]\n>> Some policies.\n\n1042\n00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:18,400\n>> Yeah, some policies.\n\n1043\n00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,598\nNow that thumb drive, it is still-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1044\n00:56:20,598 --> 00:56:21,480\n>> Still cracking away.\n\n1045\n00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:25,750\nNow this little thumb drive,\nit sits in this little metal case.\n\n1046\n00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:30,530\nAnd so if I put my finger on it,\nit is warm.\n\n1047\n00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,681\nThis poor little drive\nis absolutely cooking.\n\n1048\n00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:33,681\n>> Toasty.\n\n1049\n00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,720\n>> All right, so\nwe'll just close this out.\n\n1050\n00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:41,146\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\npull this up.\n\n1051\n00:56:41,146 --> 00:56:46,056\n[SOUND] Man, this mouse.\n\n1052\n00:56:46,056 --> 00:56:49,520\nAll right, so back into our gpedit.mse,\n\n1053\n00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:54,630\nunder Computer Configuration\n> Administrative Templates.\n\n1054\n00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,020\nAnd we'll go on down into Network.\n\n1055\n00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:02,320\nAnd under Network,\nwe have a folder here, Offline Files.\n\n1056\n00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:07,234\nClicking on Offline Files, there are a\nnumber of different policies that we can\n\n1057\n00:57:07,234 --> 00:57:08,720\nuse to-\n>> Just a few.\n\n1058\n00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,720\n>> To configure stuff that we\ndo with these offline files.\n\n1059\n00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,600\n>> Right\n>> Now a couple that we can call out,\n\n1060\n00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,345\nlet me just sort it by name here.\n\n1061\n00:57:20,345 --> 00:57:23,510\nAll right, is this one right here.\n\n1062\n00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:26,015\nRemove, make available offline.\n\n1063\n00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,556\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1064\n00:57:26,556 --> 00:57:29,621\n>> Now that make available offline,\nremember,\n\n1065\n00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:33,650\nafter we have mapped this network share,\nwe right-click.\n\n1066\n00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,360\nAnd instead of always available offline,\n\n1067\n00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,350\nthat right there was\nmake available offline.\n\n1068\n00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:43,860\nAll right, so that's where we found that.\n\n1069\n00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,980\nAnd this policy here,\n\n1070\n00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:50,700\nif we choose to enable it,\nit removes that make available offline.\n\n1071\n00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:56,120\nSo essentially, it removes that option\nright there to make these files offline.\n\n1072\n00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,840\nNow, so Ronnie, so let me ask you this.\n\n1073\n00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,502\nSo what kind of scenarios would we not,\nI mean,\n\n1074\n00:58:00,502 --> 00:58:03,110\noffline files seems like\na really cool thing.\n\n1075\n00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:06,180\nYou connect to the network share,\nyou're off the network,\n\n1076\n00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:10,340\nlet's say you're on a train,\nor in the car driving, and\n\n1077\n00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,890\nyou need to work on your spreadsheet or\nsomething.\n\n1078\n00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:15,890\nThen it seems like a good\nproductivity tool.\n\n1079\n00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:18,180\n>> Yeah.\n>> Why would you want to remove it?\n\n1080\n00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:21,840\n>> Well, there's a lot of times where\ncertain files don't need to be made\n\n1081\n00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,010\noffline.\n\n1082\n00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:26,248\nSo what ends up happening when\nyou start sharing files here,\n\n1083\n00:58:26,248 --> 00:58:30,640\nis that sometimes you may have a folder in\nwhich there's a ton of different files.\n\n1084\n00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,206\nWell, again,\n\n1085\n00:58:31,206 --> 00:58:34,690\nyou don't want everybody to actually\nbe able to access every one of them.\n\n1086\n00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:38,142\nWhat you can do instead, is actually put\nthose files into a location in which,\n\n1087\n00:58:38,142 --> 00:58:41,120\neven if they want to gain access,\nyou don't give them that access,\n\n1088\n00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,765\nin case they make changes to\nthings you don't want in that.\n\n1089\n00:58:43,765 --> 00:58:46,700\nIt's really kinda the big\nissue behind here.\n\n1090\n00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,011\nIs that if you do have stuff\nstored on that network share but\n\n1091\n00:58:49,011 --> 00:58:50,803\nyou don't want them to\nbe changed by anyone,\n\n1092\n00:58:50,803 --> 00:58:53,557\nyou wanna make sure that nobody gets\nthat chance to be able to do that.\n\n1093\n00:58:53,557 --> 00:58:54,099\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1094\n00:58:54,099 --> 00:58:56,410\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so let's say this.\n\n1095\n00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:56,960\n>> Okay.\n\n1096\n00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,556\n>> Let's say that we've\ngot Sally in accounting.\n\n1097\n00:58:59,556 --> 00:59:01,378\nThis Sally in accounting,\n\n1098\n00:59:01,378 --> 00:59:06,140\nlet's say she's planning that she's\ngonna call in sick the next day.\n\n1099\n00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,348\n>> Okay, planning to call in sick.\n\n1100\n00:59:07,348 --> 00:59:11,848\n>> Yeah she's like, yeah, I don't want\nto come in, I'm gonna be sick that day.\n\n1101\n00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:15,544\nSo what she does, she's like okay well,\nI'm gonna go and make all\n\n1102\n00:59:15,544 --> 00:59:20,305\nof these accounting spreadsheets with\neverybody's information, all this stuff.\n\n1103\n00:59:20,305 --> 00:59:24,877\nI'm gonna make this offline, so\nwhen I happen to be, sick tomorrow,\n\n1104\n00:59:24,877 --> 00:59:29,757\nlike the air quotes, so when she's sick\ntomorrow then she can still work on\n\n1105\n00:59:29,757 --> 00:59:32,640\nher files, her documents, or something.\n\n1106\n00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,365\nWell, so, it's sensitive information.\n\n1107\n00:59:35,365 --> 00:59:35,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1108\n00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:38,160\n>> Say well hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n1109\n00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,470\nThat is really sensitive stuff.\n\n1110\n00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:43,610\nWe don't want Sally to be taking\nthis stuff off the network.\n\n1111\n00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,640\nWhat if her laptop gets compromised?\n\n1112\n00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1113\n00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:52,850\n>> Well, if Sally is smart, and she's\nturned on BitLocker, well, no big deal.\n\n1114\n00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:54,348\nAs long as the computer isn't powered on.\n\n1115\n00:59:54,348 --> 00:59:55,098\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1116\n00:59:55,098 --> 00:59:56,151\n>> If it's powered on and\n\n1117\n00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:59,765\nsomebody swipes it, BitLocker's not\ngonna really do any good whatsoever.\n\n1118\n00:59:59,765 --> 01:00:04,583\nAll right, well, what we can do,\nif she doesn't have BitLocker on,\n\n1119\n01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:06,880\nthere is another option in here.\n\n1120\n01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,348\nThis guy right there.\n\n1121\n01:00:09,348 --> 01:00:10,847\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1122\n01:00:10,847 --> 01:00:15,500\n>> We can choose to encrypt\nthat offline file's cache.\n\n1123\n01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,500\nSo let's say, Sally,\nshe does encrypt this stuff.\n\n1124\n01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,210\nYeah, she does encrypt it, and\nshe's out and away from the network.\n\n1125\n01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:28,462\nThen maybe, you know, maybe we'll be\na little bit more easy going, right?\n\n1126\n01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:33,020\nMaybe we'll be like, okay Sally, you\ncan take these sensitive files offline,\n\n1127\n01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:35,550\nas long as they are encrypted.\n\n1128\n01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:39,470\nWell, we don't have to leave\nit to Sally to do that.\n\n1129\n01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:44,345\nWe can force it with this policy here, and\nsay hey, we can enable it no matter what,\n\n1130\n01:00:44,345 --> 01:00:46,515\nthose files are gonna be encrypted.\n\n1131\n01:00:46,515 --> 01:00:49,098\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1132\n01:00:49,098 --> 01:00:56,760\n>> All right, so we've got, let's see and\nthose are some big ones on there.\n\n1133\n01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:03,520\nWe got some balloons, cool balloon stuff,\nand let's see, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1134\n01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,920\nHere we go.\n\n1135\n01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,990\nHere's one right here,\nslow link speed, all right.\n\n1136\n01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:13,910\nLet's say that we are on a slow link,\nall right.\n\n1137\n01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:16,390\nOr maybe let's say it's\na metered connection even.\n\n1138\n01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:18,120\nAll right, really slow.\n\n1139\n01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:21,440\nWell, we can set the speed\nof that connection so\n\n1140\n01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,520\nthat, let's say we'll just enable it.\n\n1141\n01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:29,990\nLet's say that the value,\nlet's see, let's say it's one.\n\n1142\n01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:36,035\nSo it's one bit per second,\nthis is a really, really slow network.\n\n1143\n01:01:36,035 --> 01:01:40,411\nWell, if it ever falls\nbelow this threshold,\n\n1144\n01:01:40,411 --> 01:01:44,348\nthen the offline files, it won't sync.\n\n1145\n01:01:44,348 --> 01:01:48,660\nSo as soon as we get back onto that\nnetwork share, it's not gonna sync back\n\n1146\n01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:53,060\nup, unless the network speed is gonna\nbe faster than what we have set here.\n\n1147\n01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:58,364\nSo a little bit of optimization, perhaps\nif it is a large number of documents\n\n1148\n01:01:58,364 --> 01:02:02,390\nthat we don't want to sit there and\ntap out our small little connection.\n\n1149\n01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:06,723\nWe could use that for refreshing policy or\nother things of that sort instead.\n\n1150\n01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:10,658\nOr, I don't know, maybe for Steam games.\n\n1151\n01:02:10,658 --> 01:02:13,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Something we gotta connect up to,\n\n1152\n01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:16,330\nI don't know, Counter-Strike or something.\n\n1153\n01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:18,390\nSo yeah, so we can set that stuff there.\n\n1154\n01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:24,190\nNow, so Ronnie,\nthere's another option right there.\n\n1155\n01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:24,740\n>> Yup.\n\n1156\n01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,920\n>> About transparent caching.\n\n1157\n01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,360\nSo you wanna tell us\nthe story about this one?\n\n1158\n01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,080\n>> Yeah.\n\n1159\n01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,680\nAnd when you take a look at this\noption here on transparent caching,\n\n1160\n01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:37,460\nit's fairly similar to that configurative\nslow link speed idea for us, right.\n\n1161\n01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:41,130\nWhen we are actually enabling offline\nfiles, you're still gonna have some\n\n1162\n01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:46,360\nsynchronization that can happen if\nyou configure that slow link speed.\n\n1163\n01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,690\nSo you can tell it, hey look, even though\nI'm actually outside, I'm not really\n\n1164\n01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:53,526\ndisconnected here, you can tell it that\nyou want some synchronization to happen.\n\n1165\n01:02:53,526 --> 01:02:57,110\nWell, when we want to do that, we actually\nhave a couple of different options for us.\n\n1166\n01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:01,330\nAnd one is this idea of\nthe transparent caching here, okay.\n\n1167\n01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:03,990\nOver on the right hand side,\nthey actually described it fairly well.\n\n1168\n01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:07,837\nEnabling this policy optimizes subsequent\nreads to network files by users in\n\n1169\n01:03:07,837 --> 01:03:08,870\nthe application.\n\n1170\n01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:12,432\nThis is done by caching reads to\nremote files over a slow network.\n\n1171\n01:03:12,432 --> 01:03:16,484\nJust say, hey,\nI will actually allow this to happen, but\n\n1172\n01:03:16,484 --> 01:03:19,473\nthis again is an optimization tool for us.\n\n1173\n01:03:19,473 --> 01:03:23,766\nWhat it can do instead is if it detects\nthe idea that the link is too slow,\n\n1174\n01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:28,419\nit automatically will read it from the\ncache itself instead of from the actual\n\n1175\n01:03:28,419 --> 01:03:32,450\nfile that's actually out there\non the network share for us.\n\n1176\n01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:36,640\nSo this way, regardless of where you are,\neven if it's a slow connection,\n\n1177\n01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,820\nyou still update it with the latest\npossible synchronization that's possible.\n\n1178\n01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:43,810\nUnless it's just so\nslow that it can't actually work,\n\n1179\n01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:47,930\nthen it will actually go ahead and just\nread from the actual local cache itself.\n\n1180\n01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:50,292\nSo that way you're actually\ngiving it a default, okay?\n\n1181\n01:03:50,292 --> 01:03:53,496\nIf everything is good, and\nwe actually need to synchronize, we will.\n\n1182\n01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:57,739\nAnd usually when that happens is when we\nbring our laptops back into the network.\n\n1183\n01:03:57,739 --> 01:04:01,439\nBut if you want to actually still go\nahead and do this kind of live time,\n\n1184\n01:04:01,439 --> 01:04:03,590\nyou can configure that slow link speed.\n\n1185\n01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:08,190\nYou can also do this transparent\ncaching here to allow you to again,\n\n1186\n01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:11,920\nsync as long as you have a particular\nminimum link connection.\n\n1187\n01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,220\nAnd, if you don't, it just says,\nall right, I'll default here.\n\n1188\n01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:16,130\nBut if I can,\n\n1189\n01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:20,300\nif I can stay connected over this slow\nlink, I'll stay connected as well.\n\n1190\n01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,340\nSo that's what this gives you.\n\n1191\n01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:24,740\n>> Yep.\nNow, it's not enabled by default.\n\n1192\n01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:25,510\n>> Nope.\n>> All right.\n\n1193\n01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:29,010\nSo if you want to enable this guy,\nhere it is.\n\n1194\n01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,190\nWe can enable it and save this policy.\n\n1195\n01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,040\nAll right.\nSo let's see.\n\n1196\n01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,700\nOne more thing.\n\n1197\n01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,199\nSo let's get back.\n\n1198\n01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,850\nSo there is that connection.\n\n1199\n01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,320\nLet me just minimize that again.\n\n1200\n01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,470\nControl Panel > BitLocker.\n\n1201\n01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:51,614\nLet's get back in to the Sync Center.\n\n1202\n01:04:55,274 --> 01:04:55,780\nAll right.\n\n1203\n01:04:55,780 --> 01:05:02,060\nSo down here below over here on this\nleft hand side, manage offline files.\n\n1204\n01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,890\nSo here we go.\nIn this will give our users a place\n\n1205\n01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:07,930\nhere that we can manage some\naspects of offline files.\n\n1206\n01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:10,360\nWe can disable it altogether,\nopen up sync center,\n\n1207\n01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,480\nwhich is what we have behind us here.\n\n1208\n01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,449\nWe can view those offline files.\n\n1209\n01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:19,168\nWe can view the disk usage that we\nhave there, that we have set up for\n\n1210\n01:05:19,168 --> 01:05:20,439\nthese offline files.\n\n1211\n01:05:20,439 --> 01:05:25,342\nPerhaps if it is a folder with some\nvery large documents in there with\n\n1212\n01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:28,879\na lot of stuff in there,\nwe can see how much data.\n\n1213\n01:05:28,879 --> 01:05:34,000\nSo here we have 7.2k,\nnot bad, not bad, right?\n\n1214\n01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,329\nWell, we can change this, right?\n\n1215\n01:05:35,329 --> 01:05:39,708\nSo let's say, well, this hard drive here,\n\n1216\n01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:43,640\nwe're at, what, six gigs free space?\n\n1217\n01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,430\n>> Yep.\n>> Is that right?\n\n1218\n01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:46,650\nNo.\nAfter BitLocker's done we're good,\n\n1219\n01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:48,050\nit went back down.\n\n1220\n01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,620\nOkay, so never mind.\n\n1221\n01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:50,340\nWe are good.\n\n1222\n01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,559\nPlenty of space so\nwe don't really have to adjust this any.\n\n1223\n01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:57,400\nWe can delete those files,\ntemporary files.\n\n1224\n01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,540\nEncryption right, so\nhere we can give our options.\n\n1225\n01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:04,390\nSo we could say, hey Sally,\nyou need to encrypt those offline files.\n\n1226\n01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:07,050\nWell she can go into it here and\nencrypt those.\n\n1227\n01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:11,890\nBut if we don't wanna give her\nthat choice, if we want to\n\n1228\n01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:15,570\nsuggest without their,\nI can't think of the right word to use.\n\n1229\n01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:20,082\nBut we can use that group policy\nsetting to not even give them a choice.\n\n1230\n01:06:20,082 --> 01:06:23,220\nAnd then there we go,\nthere's that slow stuff right here.\n\n1231\n01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:28,590\nAll right Ronnie,\nanything else in offline files?\n\n1232\n01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:31,240\n>> No, just kinda remember the last\nthing that Nate showed us, right?\n\n1233\n01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,880\nWe can easily point and\nclick to set those things.\n\n1234\n01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,750\nBut if we don't want to try and\ntalk someone through that,\n\n1235\n01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:40,480\nthe use of the actual local group\npolicy may be the way to go instead.\n\n1236\n01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,350\nAnd that will automatically set\nsome of those things up for us.\n\n1237\n01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:46,170\nSo make sure you do take a look\nat those local group policies\n\n1238\n01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,150\nunder the offline files as well.\n\n1239\n01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:49,910\nAnd be familiar with that concept.\n\n1240\n01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:54,762\n>> All right, so that thumb drive,\n\n1241\n01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:56,509\nit is still-\n>> Still going.\n\n1242\n01:06:56,509 --> 01:06:57,340\n>> Encrypting.\n\n1243\n01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:01,561\n>> This is by far the slowest thumb drive-\n>> There you go.\n\n1244\n01:07:01,561 --> 01:07:02,480\n>> Ever.\n\n1245\n01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,129\nSo let's take a look at\nour objectives here.\n\n1246\n01:07:06,129 --> 01:07:08,400\n>> Okay.\n\n1247\n01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,020\n>> All right, so on our our mobility,\ncuz we'll come back to that Direct Access.\n\n1248\n01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:13,870\nWe've got offline files.\n\n1249\n01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:15,840\nWe've got transparent caching.\n\n1250\n01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,639\nAll right, power policies.\n\n1251\n01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:18,899\n>> Power policies.\n\n1252\n01:07:18,899 --> 01:07:19,999\n>> All right, power policies.\n\n1253\n01:07:19,999 --> 01:07:23,730\nSo, Ronnie, what are power policies?\n\n1254\n01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:26,790\n>> Power policies for\nus a lot of times, enable us to again,\n\n1255\n01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:30,500\ncontrol the consumption of\npower from our machines, right?\n\n1256\n01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,337\nThere's a lot of times when your\ncomputer's actually idle, and\n\n1257\n01:07:33,337 --> 01:07:37,190\nthe actual monitor is continuing to be on,\nthe hard drive is continuing to spin.\n\n1258\n01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:40,740\nThere's a lot of things we can\ncontrol in terms of power consumption.\n\n1259\n01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:42,280\nPower plans again, in Windows 7,\n\n1260\n01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,330\ngive us the ability to have very\ngranular control over that.\n\n1261\n01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:48,970\nA lot of times the most control that we\nnormally need is to turn off the hard\n\n1262\n01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:53,990\ndrive after 30 minutes, or to power\ndown the monitor after 15 minutes or so.\n\n1263\n01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:57,550\nWe have the ability to do that for\neach and every individual computer.\n\n1264\n01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:58,970\nOkay?\n\n1265\n01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:03,590\n>> All right, so let's go and\ntake a look at some of our power options.\n\n1266\n01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:05,690\n>> Yep, sounds great.\n>> Things that we can set here.\n\n1267\n01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:11,893\nAll right so in good old Control Panel.\n\n1268\n01:08:11,893 --> 01:08:14,330\nMan, this mouse.\n\n1269\n01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:18,440\nAll right, so we've got this guy\ndown here, these Power Options.\n\n1270\n01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:23,140\nNow we did cover our power\noptions a bit in another,\n\n1271\n01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:28,780\na different one here but we'll just\nkinda briefly go through some of these.\n\n1272\n01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:31,829\nNow as far as setting up\nsome of these power options,\n\n1273\n01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:34,770\nthat we can build a policy out of this.\n\n1274\n01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:39,680\nIs they're pretty much, it's three levels\ndeep as far as our power plans go.\n\n1275\n01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,420\nSo here on the surface we've got our\nfirst policy, or our first level.\n\n1276\n01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:47,000\nWe have balance.\n\n1277\n01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,090\nWe have our power saver,\nour higher performance.\n\n1278\n01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:52,140\nAnd there's just these preset settings,\nI guess,\n\n1279\n01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:55,770\nwhich we'll find out those settings\nhere that just, here in a minute.\n\n1280\n01:08:55,770 --> 01:09:00,140\nWe're gonna quickly jump through these,\ndepending on what we're after.\n\n1281\n01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:03,530\nBalance, kind of a good middle ground.\n\n1282\n01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:07,480\nPower saver throttles a lot,\ntunes things back.\n\n1283\n01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:11,230\nAnd high performance just opens up\nthe gates, it doesn't hold back anything.\n\n1284\n01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:19,400\nSo let's see, so on our balanced one,\nwe can click on our change plan settings.\n\n1285\n01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,290\nThis is kind of like the second level,\n\n1286\n01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:24,460\nthe second level of control\nthat we have over here.\n\n1287\n01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,440\nNow on this one right here,\non this laptop,\n\n1288\n01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:32,900\nwe can change it between whether it's on\na battery, or whether it is plugged in.\n\n1289\n01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:38,110\nSo, on a battery, I mean battery life,\nit burns down pretty quick,\n\n1290\n01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:40,930\nafter two minutes,\ngo ahead and dim the display.\n\n1291\n01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:44,710\nIf I don't wake up the display or jiggle\nthe mouse or anything, five more minutes,\n\n1292\n01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:46,300\njust go ahead and turn off the display.\n\n1293\n01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:47,030\n>> Right.\n\n1294\n01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:51,280\n>> If haven't done anything then after\n15 minutes, let's just go ahead and\n\n1295\n01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,420\nturn off everything altogether.\n\n1296\n01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:58,100\nIt's plugged in, a bit different, and\nwe can adjust our brightness here.\n\n1297\n01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,819\nNow as I'm changing it,\nit's getting dim for me.\n\n1298\n01:10:00,819 --> 01:10:05,170\nOf course on the screen share\nit just stays the same.\n\n1299\n01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:13,040\nNow for that third level, right down here,\nchange advanced power settings.\n\n1300\n01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:17,559\nAnd over here, some of these options\nhere we can see on this one,\n\n1301\n01:10:17,559 --> 01:10:19,860\nthis Yes here is grayed out.\n\n1302\n01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:22,910\nWe can click up here for our good old UAC.\n\n1303\n01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:25,880\nAnd so\nnow we can change some of these settings.\n\n1304\n01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:30,970\nAnd in through here,\nwe can really define what's\n\n1305\n01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:36,010\ngoing on in our systems to either conserve\npower or get the most out of our hardware.\n\n1306\n01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:41,990\nNow some options in here that\nI like to change or check on,\n\n1307\n01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:45,370\nall right, wireless adapter settings.\n\n1308\n01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:46,130\nAll right.\n\n1309\n01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:51,150\nSo on battery, I mean in power settings,\nif it's plugged in, maximum performance.\n\n1310\n01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:51,790\n>> Right.\n\n1311\n01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:52,610\n>> All right.\n\n1312\n01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:57,308\nLet's just say that well, we'll just\ndo maximum performance cuz a slow\n\n1313\n01:10:57,308 --> 01:11:00,400\nnetwork connection-\n>> Is bad.\n\n1314\n01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,200\n>> Yeah, let's see.\n\n1315\n01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:06,020\nAnother one down here under Display.\n\n1316\n01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:11,130\nAll right, we've got this option here,\nEnable Adaptive Brightness.\n\n1317\n01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:19,070\nIf your PC has a light sensor,\nif it detects that you're in a very bright\n\n1318\n01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:23,890\nenvironment, it will make your display\nbrighter so you can see over those lights.\n\n1319\n01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:26,380\nIf it detects that you're in\na very dim environment, or\n\n1320\n01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:31,080\na dark, let's say in a classroom setting,\nmaybe the projector's going,\n\n1321\n01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,840\nwatching a movie,\nthat was always nice in school.\n\n1322\n01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:39,440\nThen when it gets dim,\nthe brightness then will dim itself so\n\n1323\n01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,920\nit just conserves a little bit of power.\n\n1324\n01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:49,230\nHere in processor power management,\nwe can set for these cooling policy.\n\n1325\n01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:50,016\nNow, Ronnie?\n\n1326\n01:11:50,016 --> 01:11:51,508\n>> Yes.\n>> What's the difference between passive\n\n1327\n01:11:51,508 --> 01:11:52,954\ncooling and active cooling real quick?\n\n1328\n01:11:52,954 --> 01:11:53,982\nKind of a-\n>> No fan.\n\n1329\n01:11:53,982 --> 01:11:54,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1330\n01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:58,033\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n1331\n01:11:58,033 --> 01:11:59,409\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n1332\n01:11:59,409 --> 01:12:02,910\n>> That's what I would believe.\n\n1333\n01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:04,370\n>> Yeah.\nFans are active cooling.\n\n1334\n01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:08,130\nPassive cooling you see as the heat\nsinks and that sort of thing.\n\n1335\n01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:11,725\nSo, we can turn now,\nwe can turn off our fan there.\n\n1336\n01:12:11,725 --> 01:12:15,655\nAnd then what we can do\nis our processor states.\n\n1337\n01:12:15,655 --> 01:12:17,425\nAll right, we have minimum and maximum.\n\n1338\n01:12:18,565 --> 01:12:21,435\nSo our processor, right,\nit can step down, right.\n\n1339\n01:12:21,435 --> 01:12:23,445\nIt can kind of throttle itself.\n\n1340\n01:12:23,445 --> 01:12:26,475\nWe can use a down minimum of 5% processor.\n\n1341\n01:12:27,485 --> 01:12:32,105\nLet's say on our battery, we don't\nwant our processor to ramp up at all.\n\n1342\n01:12:32,105 --> 01:12:36,739\nLet's say we only want to use let's\n\n1343\n01:12:36,739 --> 01:12:41,230\njust say 75% of our processor.\n\n1344\n01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:42,740\nNow if you're on battery,\n\n1345\n01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:47,240\nif you really need to get that every\nlittle bit of battery power out,\n\n1346\n01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:51,910\nsure you can throttle it down but\nif you're going to pay the money, for\n\n1347\n01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:56,970\na Coreite 7 CPU, then for\nheaven's sake give me all of it.\n\n1348\n01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:58,940\n>> That's right.\n\n1349\n01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:01,820\nJust remember that for a lot of these,\nride under the power plant settings for\n\n1350\n01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:06,550\nus, it really is the idea of\nbalancing the idea of battery life,\n\n1351\n01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:09,200\nversus the idea of performance here.\n\n1352\n01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,670\nSo the higher the performance,\n\n1353\n01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:14,350\nmore than likely the fewer hours you're\ngoing to get out of your battery or\n\n1354\n01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:17,320\nthe fewer number of minutes you're\ngoing to get out of your battery.\n\n1355\n01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,400\nIf you again lower the performance here,\n\n1356\n01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,240\nyou're actually going to\nhave extended battery life.\n\n1357\n01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:26,260\nA lot of times we try and find that\nparticular balance especially on laptops.\n\n1358\n01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:28,140\nOn desktops not so much.\n\n1359\n01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:32,340\nBut the nice thing about these power\nsettings is that we can actually go in,\n\n1360\n01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:36,620\neven through group policy a lot of times,\ninside of our Active Directory Domain and\n\n1361\n01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:39,350\ncontrol the way that these settings go.\n\n1362\n01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:43,470\nSo that way we can actually control it for\nmultiple users instead of just one.\n\n1363\n01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:46,080\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n1364\n01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:51,638\nWe do have a few minutes more left but\nwe are kind of switching gears from this.\n\n1365\n01:13:51,638 --> 01:13:56,760\nWe've got some our remote connections, we\nhave that Direct Access to touch on too,\n\n1366\n01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:02,530\nand some VPNs, good old VPN reconnect,\nsome pretty sweet stuff.\n\n1367\n01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:05,870\nSo what we'll do is we'll get\nto that stuff after the break.\n\n1368\n01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:06,780\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1369\n01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,283\n>> And we'll get to that after the break.\n\n1370\n01:14:09,283 --> 01:14:13,868\n[MUSIC]\n\n1371\n01:14:16,504 --> 01:14:18,510\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n1372\n01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:20,380\nAll right, so where we left off, right?\n\n1373\n01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:23,080\nWe were talking about\nthose offline files and\n\n1374\n01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:27,770\ngetting into a bit of those power plans\nand those policies that we have, and\n\n1375\n01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:33,960\nyou know, as we have our power plans,\nright, we can create our own custom plans.\n\n1376\n01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:39,360\nLet's say if the business or\ncompanies to have some kind of green\n\n1377\n01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:44,700\npolicy going out,\nwhich I am a fan of green IT stuff.\n\n1378\n01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:48,840\nIt's popular these days,\nwhich I'm fine with it, it's cool.\n\n1379\n01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:53,660\nBut, we can push those power\nplains out through group policy.\n\n1380\n01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:58,910\nNow, with the local group policy, we can\ndo it there, but through preferences,\n\n1381\n01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:03,170\nour domain controllers are at as not\nquite a serveresque type show, but\n\n1382\n01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:08,090\nwe can use our group policy\npreferences to push out those power\n\n1383\n01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:12,450\npolicies company wide so\nwe all have the same thing.\n\n1384\n01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:15,080\n>> Yeah, and that's really\nimportant because in this day and\n\n1385\n01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:19,296\nage we don't need all these computers\njust powering up 100% of the time.\n\n1386\n01:15:19,296 --> 01:15:21,440\nSetting group policy again\nreally does help and\n\n1387\n01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,310\nallows us again to\nconserve a lot more power.\n\n1388\n01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:27,470\nSo, again, very good for\nus to actually make sure we understand.\n\n1389\n01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:29,260\nThat we may choose to\ndo something like that.\n\n1390\n01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:32,180\nAnd remember that we're not going to see\nthat setting inside of our local group\n\n1391\n01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:35,640\npolicy, but for\nus you might see it somewhere else.\n\n1392\n01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:38,822\nUsually inside of our\nserver shows if anything.\n\n1393\n01:15:38,822 --> 01:15:43,313\n>> All right, Ronnie so\nwe do have all of our\n\n1394\n01:15:43,313 --> 01:15:48,080\nremote stuff lined up but\nI have good news.\n\n1395\n01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,130\n>> Okay.\n\n1396\n01:15:49,130 --> 01:15:52,820\nHere on my PC, that thumb drive,\nhas finally finished.\n\n1397\n01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:53,460\n>> It's finally done.\n\n1398\n01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:57,660\n>> It's finally finished encrypting, and\nso now, lets just revisit it real quick.\n\n1399\n01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:58,600\n>> Sure.\n\n1400\n01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:04,110\n>> As far as backing up those keys, we can\ndo that, and so it's finally finished.\n\n1401\n01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:11,219\nAll right and then let's get back in to,\nlet's see, all right.\n\n1402\n01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:16,420\nSo there it is.\n\n1403\n01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:20,730\nIf we browse over to our\nremovable drive there.\n\n1404\n01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:25,280\nSo we've got that recovery key that\nwe backed up when we saved it for\n\n1405\n01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,430\nthe C drive there.\n\n1406\n01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,194\nAll right, so\nthere is a command that we can issue out.\n\n1407\n01:16:31,194 --> 01:16:36,197\nAnd it is manage-bde.\n\n1408\n01:16:36,197 --> 01:16:39,247\nWhich manage-bde has a lot of switches and\n\n1409\n01:16:39,247 --> 01:16:44,428\nmodifiers that we can use to manage\nall the bit locker stuff that we have.\n\n1410\n01:16:44,428 --> 01:16:51,570\nBut the one that we are going\nto use is to backup those keys.\n\n1411\n01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:58,890\nAll right, so bde-protectors-add, right?\n\n1412\n01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:05,040\nAnd yeah, protectors, add, and\nthen what drive it is encrypted, right?\n\n1413\n01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,470\nSo C All right.\n\n1414\n01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:14,442\nAnd then the recovery key and\nthen the drive letter of our USB drive.\n\n1415\n01:17:14,442 --> 01:17:16,740\nAll right, so\nwe'll go ahead and put it to F.\n\n1416\n01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,080\nSo there we go.\n\n1417\n01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:23,530\nKey protectors added to our F drive\nIf we browse back over there,\n\n1418\n01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:25,740\nsure enough,\nwe've got a new number right there.\n\n1419\n01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:31,790\nThis BE key and\nwe can use to recover our files.\n\n1420\n01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:37,510\n>> All right.\n>> All right, and then, let's see.\n\n1421\n01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:38,620\nSo we head back over here.\n\n1422\n01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:42,250\nLet's manage BitLocker.\n\n1423\n01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:42,830\nOn that guy.\n\n1424\n01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:45,830\nThere is an option down here.\n\n1425\n01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:48,000\nLet me just eject this guy.\n\n1426\n01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,870\nI'm going to pull that key out.\n\n1427\n01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,340\nIt's awful warm.\n\n1428\n01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:58,110\nThis is that USB key.\n\n1429\n01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,277\nIt's just a little tiny guy,\n\n1430\n01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,242\nsee there it is\n>> Yep.\n\n1431\n01:18:04,242 --> 01:18:10,580\n>> All right, now that it is encrypted,\nwe stick it back in the computer.\n\n1432\n01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:15,490\nWindows will recognize it and\nthe first thing that's gonna pop up is for\n\n1433\n01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:21,632\nthat decryption key that we put in.\n\n1434\n01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:24,110\nIf everything is good,\n\n1435\n01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:27,260\nif I typed it in correctly,\nsure enough, it's going to decrypt it.\n\n1436\n01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:33,430\nTyping in that key, not really that big\nof a deal, but we can get around it.\n\n1437\n01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:38,190\nSo we right click,\nlet's go back to our Manage BitLocker.\n\n1438\n01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:43,150\nThis option down here automatically\nunlocked this drive on this computer.\n\n1439\n01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:48,330\nWe can go and select there and\nso now every time\n\n1440\n01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:53,580\nI insert this USB drive into this PC we\nwon't have to enter in that BitLocker key.\n\n1441\n01:18:56,610 --> 01:18:58,815\nSo there we go that is BitLocker.\n\n1442\n01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:05,300\nSo if we go back to our objectives.\n\n1443\n01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,340\nSo we've got DirectAccess to touch on.\n\n1444\n01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:14,440\nAnd then on the last section here\nwe've got a number of different\n\n1445\n01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:18,930\ntechnologies to touch on as\nfar as remote connections go.\n\n1446\n01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:20,920\nThe very first one we have.\n\n1447\n01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,840\nEstablishing VPN connections and\nauthentication for it.\n\n1448\n01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:29,020\nSo Ronnie do you want to give\nus a run down on our VPN's?\n\n1449\n01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:30,210\n>> Sure, ok.\n\n1450\n01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:33,310\nRemember that in the beginning if you\nactually have multiple different sites and\n\n1451\n01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:36,790\nlocations here, we would have actually\nhad to pay an expensive technology to get\n\n1452\n01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:38,370\nthose sites connected.\n\n1453\n01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:43,330\nToday, you and I instead can use software\nand go across the Internet instead.\n\n1454\n01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,553\nSo instead when we do this, we set up\nthe idea of a VPN end point at one side.\n\n1455\n01:19:48,553 --> 01:19:52,349\nAnd then on our Windows\n7 client machines here,\n\n1456\n01:19:52,349 --> 01:19:56,887\nwe can set up the software to\nactually make that connection\n\n1457\n01:19:56,887 --> 01:20:01,880\nacross An unprotected network\nis really what the idea is.\n\n1458\n01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,670\nSo for us, the good thing is\nusually one side is already set up.\n\n1459\n01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:09,160\nSo, we're just take and look it up from\nthe client side here on Windows 7.\n\n1460\n01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:12,310\n>> All right, so yeah, we just set it up.\n\n1461\n01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:15,530\n>> Let's do it.\n>> All right, so\n\n1462\n01:20:15,530 --> 01:20:20,320\non this PC here,\nlet's jump over to this guy here.\n\n1463\n01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:25,760\nAll right, so we have this Windows 7\nmachine and we're going to set up a VPN\n\n1464\n01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,690\nconnection back to our work computer,\nall right.\n\n1465\n01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:36,000\nSo, go down into our Network and\nsharing center and\n\n1466\n01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,120\nwe will choose this option here Set\nup a new connection or a network.\n\n1467\n01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:44,570\nClick on this, and what do we wanna do?\n\n1468\n01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:48,530\nWell, we want to connect to our\nworkplace either through dial up or\n\n1469\n01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:52,370\na VPN just like that, we'll click on Next.\n\n1470\n01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:53,070\nWhat do we wanna do?\n\n1471\n01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:58,120\nWell, dial directly would be\nthrough a dial-up connection and\n\n1472\n01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:01,100\nmodem, we'll touch on\nthat here in a second.\n\n1473\n01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:04,480\nWhat we're gonna do is to use\nmy existing internet connection.\n\n1474\n01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,840\nRight, so our broadband.\n\n1475\n01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:06,630\n>> Right.\n\n1476\n01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:08,340\n>> Now, the Internet address.\n\n1477\n01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:13,670\nNow, this has to be a public\nresolvable name or an IP address.\n\n1478\n01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:16,540\nNow, some of these VPN servers like for\n\n1479\n01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:20,170\nour workplace,\nit will either get an IP address or\n\n1480\n01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:26,670\nwill get some name like vpn.lab.itpro.tv\nor something of that sort.\n\n1481\n01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:33,220\nBut for this demonstration, since it's all\nin-house, this will be an internal IP but\n\n1482\n01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:37,400\nif we were at home wanting to connect, we\nwould not be able to use an internal IP.\n\n1483\n01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,290\nAll right, and for our name,\n\n1484\n01:21:41,290 --> 01:21:45,640\nwe'll just call this My workplace.\n\n1485\n01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,040\n>> Okay.\n\n1486\n01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:52,730\n>> All right, so here a smart card,\ngives smart card for authentication.\n\n1487\n01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:57,430\nWe could allow other people to use it\nwhich may or may not, I guess depending\n\n1488\n01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:00,500\non what this VPN connection is for,\nmay or may not be a good idea.\n\n1489\n01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:06,550\nAnd we're just going to say don't connect\nright now, we're just gonna set it up.\n\n1490\n01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:11,110\nAll right, so our username for the VPN,\n\n1491\n01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:15,990\nnow it may or it may not be the same\ncredentials that you use to log in as\n\n1492\n01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:18,780\nif you were on the network,\nit could be set up differently.\n\n1493\n01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:25,658\nSo I'll just put in what I have set up for\nthat, oops,\n\n1494\n01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:34,685\nAll right, and then domain for this one,\nI don't have any domain set up,\n\n1495\n01:22:34,685 --> 01:22:38,992\nbut if you did like Lab, Nathan,\nor something of that sort.\n\n1496\n01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:43,430\nAnd, we will create, right?\n\n1497\n01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:44,730\nWe will close.\n\n1498\n01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:49,410\nNow, let's go take a look and\nwe're in Adapter settings.\n\n1499\n01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:50,650\nRight there, there we go.\n\n1500\n01:22:50,650 --> 01:22:52,700\nSo, here's what I'm currently\nconnected to, right,\n\n1501\n01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:55,210\nlittle computer screens are lit up.\n\n1502\n01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:56,840\nWe've got our VPN connection here.\n\n1503\n01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:00,780\nWe can go and\nbrowse some of the properties there so\n\n1504\n01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:04,760\nwe can change that IP address or\nthat name if we wanted to.\n\n1505\n01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,490\nSo the options that we have in here,\ndialing attempts,\n\n1506\n01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:14,590\nright, we don't want any\nof that stuff of course.\n\n1507\n01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:16,550\nType of VPN, so\nwe do have different types of VPN.\n\n1508\n01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:19,029\nRonnie, do you wanna run\nthrough the different types?\n\n1509\n01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:22,080\n>> We can talk about them\na little bit here, right.\n\n1510\n01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,600\nSo, the automatic is probably the one\nthat we normally would just set up here,\n\n1511\n01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,180\nallowing the other side to tell us\n\n1512\n01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:31,130\nwhat it is that we're actually\ngonna choose to set this up.\n\n1513\n01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:35,390\nWe do have the point to point or\nthe PPTP as you see here.\n\n1514\n01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:38,480\nThis is the one that Microsoft\nintroduced at the very beginning and\n\n1515\n01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:42,410\nit does provide for us the least\nlevel of security that we have.\n\n1516\n01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:44,700\nBut we also have the industry standard or\n\n1517\n01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:48,480\nthe Internet standard here that\nwe call L2TP over IP sect.\n\n1518\n01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,490\nThis one provides\nthe layer two connectivity.\n\n1519\n01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:54,920\nAgain, it actually is a point\nto point connection for us but\n\n1520\n01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:58,270\nalso adding in additional\nsecurity in terms of IP sect.\n\n1521\n01:23:58,270 --> 01:24:03,470\nAnd then the newest one is actually using\nSSTP, Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol.\n\n1522\n01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:07,810\nAnd this one gives us the ability\ninstead to use existing protocols so\n\n1523\n01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:10,610\nthat we don't have to open up\nother holes in our firewall.\n\n1524\n01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:15,160\nSo we can use SSL over port 443\nto make this type of connection.\n\n1525\n01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:19,510\nAnd then, the last one is the one that I\nthink Windows 7 actually natively wants\n\n1526\n01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:21,820\nwhich is the IKE 2, version two here.\n\n1527\n01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:26,740\nThe Internet Key Exchange version 2, and\nthis is just another process that they've\n\n1528\n01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:29,640\nadded in that's specifically for\nWindows 7 right now.\n\n1529\n01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:33,580\nSo usually, I set this up and\nleave it at automatic.\n\n1530\n01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:35,350\n>> Yep.\nNow choosing automatic,\n\n1531\n01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:38,298\nWindows is going to try,\nthey're gonna negotiate.\n\n1532\n01:24:38,298 --> 01:24:42,960\nAnd it's gonna try the most\nsecure connection first and\n\n1533\n01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:48,900\nit'll start working its way down until\nit finds a match and it connects.\n\n1534\n01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:52,670\nAll right, so data encryption, right.\n\n1535\n01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:59,030\nSo, we can require encryption or we can\nconnect without encryption if we want to.\n\n1536\n01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:01,140\nThen our different authentication methods.\n\n1537\n01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:02,930\nNow for these types right here,\n\n1538\n01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:06,490\nbasically this is just gonna match\nwhatever is on the other side.\n\n1539\n01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:11,380\nSo, we just can't quite choose\nany of these and have it connect.\n\n1540\n01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:15,350\nSo they will have to match whatever the\nend on the other side is listening for.\n\n1541\n01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:20,610\nIn our networking tab,\nwe don't mess with anything in here but\n\n1542\n01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:24,610\nif we needed to we can change\nsome of the stuff in there.\n\n1543\n01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:28,000\nAnd sharing, we can allow other\npeople to share this connection\n\n1544\n01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:32,970\ndepending on what type of VPN it is,\nmay not be a good idea.\n\n1545\n01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:39,152\nAll right, but everything looks good so\nwe will choose to connect to it.\n\n1546\n01:25:39,152 --> 01:25:42,450\nAll right, you see this little window and\nI'll put in my password.\n\n1547\n01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:50,700\nThen domain name if we had a domain,\nand Connect.\n\n1548\n01:25:56,366 --> 01:25:57,710\nAll right, pretty fast.\n\n1549\n01:25:57,710 --> 01:25:58,800\nThere we go.\n\n1550\n01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:03,010\nYeah, so okay, where's all the fireworks.\n\n1551\n01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:07,300\n>> Yeah, now the fireworks are not\nagain anything flash, very flashy or\n\n1552\n01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:11,590\nanything for us but it does do something\nimportant for us which is establishes\n\n1553\n01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:15,960\na secured connection across\nan unsecured network, okay?\n\n1554\n01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,940\nAnd so when we setup a VPN,\na virtual private network,\n\n1555\n01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:23,650\nthe understanding here or the thing\nthat we have to keep in mind, right,\n\n1556\n01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:25,640\nis that it is actually a private network.\n\n1557\n01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,570\nBut it's going over\na public network here and\n\n1558\n01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:31,870\nbecause we're using encryption to do that,\nit's perfectly fine.\n\n1559\n01:26:31,870 --> 01:26:35,690\nThe virtual part comes in the very fact\nthat I don't need a physical cable to run\n\n1560\n01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:40,410\nfrom one site to the other one here,\nI can use that public network to do so.\n\n1561\n01:26:40,410 --> 01:26:44,520\nSo, by using the technology that's\nbuilt-in these and using things like\n\n1562\n01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:49,870\nthe L2TP or PPTP and all of these\ndifferent connections that we have,\n\n1563\n01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:53,400\nwe again can set that up and\nnotice it makes it very easy to connect.\n\n1564\n01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:57,800\nAnd all the traffic now flowing between\nthis computer and that particular\n\n1565\n01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:03,230\ndestination computer should be encrypted\nacross even a public network here.\n\n1566\n01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:08,370\nWe see this used incredibly a lot,\nwe actually use it here quite often.\n\n1567\n01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:11,260\nHeck, I do it just about daily\nwhen I actually connect in.\n\n1568\n01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:16,130\nSo for us here, it's actually an important\npart because it makes our traffic again\n\n1569\n01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:18,690\nlook transparent essentially\nto the Internet.\n\n1570\n01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:23,370\n>> All right, so what we'll do\nthen is to take a look at our VPN.\n\n1571\n01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:30,310\nWe'll just jump into our command prompt\nhere and we'll push out a IPconfig.\n\n1572\n01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:36,620\nSo right here, this is the existing\n\n1573\n01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:39,660\nInternet connection that we have before,\nit's 10.23..223.\n\n1574\n01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:42,917\nAnd now that we're connected to that VPN,\n\n1575\n01:27:42,917 --> 01:27:46,913\nscroll up a little bit,\nwe have another IP address.\n\n1576\n01:27:46,913 --> 01:27:52,868\n192.168.10.13, this is an IP address\nthat was issued from our VPN server.\n\n1577\n01:27:52,868 --> 01:27:58,350\nAnd that we will then use to communicate\nthose resources on the other side.\n\n1578\n01:27:58,350 --> 01:28:02,900\nNow, we will have certain routes\nthat Windows will then route\n\n1579\n01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,875\nto those resources through our tunnel.\n\n1580\n01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:05,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1581\n01:28:05,470 --> 01:28:06,210\nYep.\n\n1582\n01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:09,430\nSo the way that this works\nis from Nate's machine then.\n\n1583\n01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:13,900\nIf he is sending traffic directly to the\nother side of that connection then it's\n\n1584\n01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:16,990\ngonna only go over that particular\nadapter that we saw up there saying PPP.\n\n1585\n01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:22,564\nBut if he's connecting anywhere else it's\nprobably gonna use the regular standard\n\n1586\n01:28:22,564 --> 01:28:26,748\nadapter instead and that way traffic can\neither be outside of that connection or\n\n1587\n01:28:26,748 --> 01:28:28,950\nit goes through that connection as well.\n\n1588\n01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:34,718\n>> Yeah, all right so that other\n\n1589\n01:28:34,718 --> 01:28:39,490\noption there, that IKEv2.\n\n1590\n01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:40,600\nYeah, so we had this technology.\n\n1591\n01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,660\nVPN Reconnect.\n\n1592\n01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:43,680\nAll right.\n\n1593\n01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,650\nSo, with VPN Reconnect,\n\n1594\n01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:50,790\nwhat this technology does is\nthat we connect up to a VPN.\n\n1595\n01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:55,680\nNow, if this connection gets interrupted,\nwe'll have to back through the process.\n\n1596\n01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:56,339\nLet me disconnect.\n\n1597\n01:28:57,555 --> 01:29:00,270\n[INAUDIBLE] go back through the process,\nwe'll have to click on Connect enter in\n\n1598\n01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:03,390\nour name and our password and\nconnect to that VPN again.\n\n1599\n01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:07,680\nWell with VPN reconnect,\nit has a little timer,\n\n1600\n01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:13,500\nnow we can set how long it's gonna wait\nbut I think generally 30 seconds or\n\n1601\n01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:17,430\nso, so that if that connection\ngets interrupted, it'll wait, and\n\n1602\n01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:22,440\nas soon as it gets a connection back to\nthe Internet it'll rejoin that connection,\n\n1603\n01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:26,210\nso the end user doesn't have\nto enter in anything again.\n\n1604\n01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:31,060\nNow it also works for roaming between\ndifferent internet connections.\n\n1605\n01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:33,580\nLet's say, traveling somewhere and there's\n\n1606\n01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:37,351\nmultiple hotspots along the way that\nyou're walking down some street somewhere,\n\n1607\n01:29:37,351 --> 01:29:42,270\nwell as you, I don't know how many people\nwould be holding up their laptop and\n\n1608\n01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:47,720\ntyping on the way, but as they move\nout of range of one wireless network,\n\n1609\n01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:52,930\nand move in range of another, then it\nwill just seamlessly transfer back and\n\n1610\n01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:55,960\nforth, so you don't have to drop your\nconnection and enter it back in.\n\n1611\n01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:56,540\n>> Yeah.\n\n1612\n01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:59,962\nOne of the weakness behind VPN is that\nanything that drops the connection,\n\n1613\n01:29:59,962 --> 01:30:02,760\nmeans you have to reestablish\nthat connection, again.\n\n1614\n01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,210\nSo, it can be a little bit annoying.\n\n1615\n01:30:04,210 --> 01:30:07,900\nLet's say that you're on a mobile wireless\ncard, and you're moving again down\n\n1616\n01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:11,910\nthe highway with your laptop, hopefully\nyou're not driving at the same time.\n\n1617\n01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:14,980\nBut, as you move between cell towers,\nit's gonna drop a VPN connection, and\n\n1618\n01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:17,600\nthen you're have to reestablish it, again.\n\n1619\n01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,767\nUse the VPN reconnect allows us\nnot to actually see that and\n\n1620\n01:30:20,767 --> 01:30:22,670\nconnects it right away.\n\n1621\n01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:24,650\nA lot of times you can even go ahead and\n\n1622\n01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:29,270\nmove from one network to the other one,\nsuch as I'm here and I go home.\n\n1623\n01:30:29,270 --> 01:30:31,690\nI can actually pick\nthat VPN back up again.\n\n1624\n01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:36,350\nSo it actually does makes sense\nin terms of how we do this.\n\n1625\n01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:37,240\nSo, Nate, what are we doing now?\n\n1626\n01:30:38,522 --> 01:30:46,000\n>> All right, let me click so\nwere gonna make a new connection and\n\n1627\n01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,916\nfor this one we'll set\nup as our VPN reconnect.\n\n1628\n01:30:50,916 --> 01:30:55,030\nAll right, so\nwe will just create a new connection,\n\n1629\n01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:59,704\nall right, we will connect this one,\nand for our address,\n\n1630\n01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:05,621\nwe'll choose a different one,\nwe'll just call this one, [LAUGH] Cancel.\n\n1631\n01:31:10,695 --> 01:31:15,238\nAll right so for this one,\nwe'll call vpn.itpro.tv.\n\n1632\n01:31:15,238 --> 01:31:21,220\nAnd for this one,\nwe'll call VPN Reconnect.\n\n1633\n01:31:31,633 --> 01:31:34,218\nAll right, now to set this up,\n\n1634\n01:31:34,218 --> 01:31:40,090\ngo back into our adapter settings,\nthere's our VPN Reconnect.\n\n1635\n01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:44,062\nWe will adjust our properties.\n\n1636\n01:31:44,062 --> 01:31:49,586\nAll right, and then in our adapter\nsettings on the security tab,\n\n1637\n01:31:49,586 --> 01:31:54,313\nthe type of VPN we'll choose and\nwe'll make it IKEv2.\n\n1638\n01:31:54,313 --> 01:31:54,813\n>> All right.\n\n1639\n01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:56,860\n>> There we go.\n\n1640\n01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:57,385\n>> That's it?\n\n1641\n01:31:57,385 --> 01:31:58,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> There you go.\n\n1642\n01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:02,808\n>> Now as far as firewall rules,\nwe will need to have certain ports open.\n\n1643\n01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:06,389\nWe will need UDP port 500 and\n\n1644\n01:32:06,389 --> 01:32:10,665\nwe will also need UDP port 4500.\n\n1645\n01:32:10,665 --> 01:32:12,520\nSo four five zero zero.\n\n1646\n01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:16,220\nThose ports will need to be\nopened up to use VPN reconnect.\n\n1647\n01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:16,720\n>> All right.\n\n1648\n01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:20,040\n>> All right, Ronnie,\nanything else on VPN reconnect?\n\n1649\n01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,140\n>> I don't think so.\n\n1650\n01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:24,290\nI think in terms of VPN,\nthat's pretty good for the client's side.\n\n1651\n01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:27,900\nA lot of times this is gonna be set up for\nthe actual end user, and\n\n1652\n01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,240\nit may be you that actually\nhas to do that, so\n\n1653\n01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:33,360\nmake sure you understand how to make\nthat connection to the workplace,\n\n1654\n01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:37,550\nget all the information beforehand when\nyou do set it up, and know whether or\n\n1655\n01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:41,132\nnot you're actually going to need to\nuse the VPN reconnect or not as well.\n\n1656\n01:32:41,132 --> 01:32:45,500\n>> All right, Ronnie, so\nwhat do we got lined up next?\n\n1657\n01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,850\nWe got,\ndo you want to do direct access now?\n\n1658\n01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:48,930\nOr do you want to do it afterwards?\n\n1659\n01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:54,909\n>> Either way is fine, so\nlet's go ahead and do it.\n\n1660\n01:32:54,909 --> 01:32:56,692\n>> All right.\n\n1661\n01:32:56,692 --> 01:33:00,980\nSo with direct access,\na really fancy thing.\n\n1662\n01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:05,752\nSo we saw this process that we use to\nconnect up through this VPN to our\n\n1663\n01:33:05,752 --> 01:33:07,190\nworkplace.\n\n1664\n01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:10,601\nWell with direct access,\na little bit different.\n\n1665\n01:33:10,601 --> 01:33:15,842\nAs soon as a PC starts up,\nso before the user logs in,\n\n1666\n01:33:15,842 --> 01:33:20,847\nthe PC just starts up,\nit will then automatically\n\n1667\n01:33:20,847 --> 01:33:24,676\nmake a VPN connection to a work place.\n\n1668\n01:33:24,676 --> 01:33:29,902\nNow with this tunnel, administrators\nnow can push out policy to this PC,\n\n1669\n01:33:29,902 --> 01:33:31,689\nthey can manage this PC.\n\n1670\n01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:35,910\nAnd it's completely\nseamless to the end user.\n\n1671\n01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:40,960\nBehind the scenes, server side, there's a\nconsiderable amount of set up on the back\n\n1672\n01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:46,650\nend, now we didn't set up a direct access\nbeforehand on here but we will show you\n\n1673\n01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:52,050\nclient side, the steps and the things that\nare necessary to make that connection.\n\n1674\n01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:57,720\n>> All right, so let me see here.\n\n1675\n01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:01,300\nSo, before we go on any further,\n\n1676\n01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:04,600\nNathan mentioned the very fact\nthat there are some requirements.\n\n1677\n01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:08,510\nAnd what I did is in Google, I went ahead\nand typed in direct access Windows 7\n\n1678\n01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:14,070\nrequirements and that brought up this Te\nchnet article for us, and for us here\n\n1679\n01:34:14,070 --> 01:34:17,530\nwhat we want to do is want to take a look\nat some of these particular requirements.\n\n1680\n01:34:17,530 --> 01:34:24,259\nSee if I can zoom in a little here,\nsee if itl'll let me move the page over.\n\n1681\n01:34:24,259 --> 01:34:25,821\nActually we can see that okay.\n\n1682\n01:34:25,821 --> 01:34:29,065\nSo one of the ones that you see over here\non the right hand side, if you're going to\n\n1683\n01:34:29,065 --> 01:34:32,980\nbe using direct access you've gotta know\nsome of these basic requirements, right.\n\n1684\n01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:38,750\nOne or more direct access servers running\nserver 2008 R2, with or without UAG.\n\n1685\n01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:41,320\nNow, don't worry about what\nthat actually means for us.\n\n1686\n01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:44,910\nThe idea of using direct access is fine\nwhen you're actually using, again,\n\n1687\n01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:46,450\nWindows 7 and later.\n\n1688\n01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:47,660\nBut if you're also supporting,\n\n1689\n01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:52,370\nagain, Windows XP, Windows Vista,\nyou can run direct access but you'd\n\n1690\n01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:57,220\nactually need a server doing this Unified\nsomething gateway is what you'd have here.\n\n1691\n01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:59,430\nAuthenticating gateway is what you'd have.\n\n1692\n01:34:59,430 --> 01:35:05,190\nYou of course need two network adapters as\nwell, and with Server 2008 you also needed\n\n1693\n01:35:05,190 --> 01:35:12,080\ntwo consecutive IP addresses to ensure\nthat this could actually work as well.\n\n1694\n01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:13,705\nAnd then notice that\nthe two network adapters,\n\n1695\n01:35:13,705 --> 01:35:15,710\none connecting to\nthe inside of your network.\n\n1696\n01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:18,160\nThe other one connecting to\nthe outside of your network as well.\n\n1697\n01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,030\nOkay?\n\n1698\n01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:23,040\nThe other thing that I talked about\nhere is these two consecutive public IP\n\n1699\n01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:26,690\naddresses that are gonna be used\nto connect to the Internet.\n\n1700\n01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:29,660\nAnd notice this one,\nof course, is at for us.\n\n1701\n01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:31,210\nAnd this is the important one, right?\n\n1702\n01:35:31,210 --> 01:35:34,515\nIs that if we're going to be\nusing Windows 7 as our client,\n\n1703\n01:35:34,515 --> 01:35:38,547\nwe can't use Windows 7 Professional\nEdition, nor the Home Premiums or\n\n1704\n01:35:38,547 --> 01:35:40,613\nanything again in the earlier ones.\n\n1705\n01:35:40,613 --> 01:35:44,712\nIt has to be at least Enterprise or\nUltimate to be able to do so, and\n\n1706\n01:35:44,712 --> 01:35:49,718\nwe also have to be in the active directory\ndomain okay, so remember that, too.\n\n1707\n01:35:49,718 --> 01:35:54,789\nAll right, now a couple of other things\nthat are normally standard as well, okay.\n\n1708\n01:35:54,789 --> 01:35:59,890\nThe idea of the computers being joined\nto the network, is pretty much key.\n\n1709\n01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:04,100\nDNS that can be reached by those that\nare actually using DirectAccess,\n\n1710\n01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,780\noutside the network.\n\n1711\n01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:07,960\nAnd a lot of times if you're doing this,\n\n1712\n01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:12,390\nyou're also gonna need to have\ncertificates running, okay?\n\n1713\n01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:14,360\nSo you need certificate services, too.\n\n1714\n01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:20,340\nBecause it does require IPv6 running, it\n\n1715\n01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:25,640\nmeans you also have to make sure that your\nclients can use a tunneling technology.\n\n1716\n01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:29,290\nThe good thing is we are not\nsetting up the entirety here, but\n\n1717\n01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:32,160\nwe do want to show you\nwhere in Windows 7 you\n\n1718\n01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:36,755\ndo have to be configured to make your\ncomputers ready to use DirectAccess.\n\n1719\n01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:41,380\nSo if I go to my picker computer here,\n\n1720\n01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:43,620\nwe're gonna go back into\nour local group policy.\n\n1721\n01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:52,280\nSo I'm gonna do gpedit.msc.\n\n1722\n01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:56,190\nAnd inside of our Settings here.\n\n1723\n01:36:56,190 --> 01:36:56,770\nOkay.\n\n1724\n01:36:56,770 --> 01:36:58,990\nSo under Computer Configurations.\n\n1725\n01:36:58,990 --> 01:37:01,490\nAnd it's remembering where everything is.\n\n1726\n01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:02,760\nI think it's under Window's Settings here.\n\n1727\n01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:05,950\nAnd then Name Resolution Policy.\n\n1728\n01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:07,850\nGive it a moment.\n\n1729\n01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:09,220\nThat's what we want right here.\n\n1730\n01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:10,500\nOkay.\n\n1731\n01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,620\nSo under the Name Resolution Policies,\n\n1732\n01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:16,780\nunder Window's Settings, notice that we\nhave this Name Resolution Policy table.\n\n1733\n01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:20,269\nAnd it says configuring this for\nDNSsec and for\n\n1734\n01:37:20,269 --> 01:37:24,310\nDirectAccess on DNS client computers.\n\n1735\n01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:28,120\nSo what we want to set up is actually\non the second tab right here.\n\n1736\n01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:32,240\nDNS Settings for DirectAccess and\n\n1737\n01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:35,670\nwe would enable DNS settings for\nDirectAccess in this rule.\n\n1738\n01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:37,900\nWe would point to the DNS servers.\n\n1739\n01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:42,500\nThe DNS server has to be\naccessible from the outside here.\n\n1740\n01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:45,760\nNow if you say, hey, I don't want to\nput my DNS servers on the outside.\n\n1741\n01:37:47,010 --> 01:37:49,910\nInstead you can set up\na proxy server that then can\n\n1742\n01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:51,540\npoint to your DNS servers as well.\n\n1743\n01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:55,230\nIf you want to actually use\na little bit more encryption\n\n1744\n01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:57,101\nyou can also use the IPsec as well.\n\n1745\n01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:02,770\nSo those are usually the settings that you\nhave to ensure that are actually connected\n\n1746\n01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:06,080\nto make sure that this ends up working for\nus, okay?\n\n1747\n01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:09,620\nSo that really is kind of the big\nconfiguration that we have to ensure,\n\n1748\n01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:11,770\nof anything on the client side.\n\n1749\n01:38:11,770 --> 01:38:15,580\nOnce this is done, and again, yes,\nyou need to make sure that you have\n\n1750\n01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:19,530\nthe connectivity that you need,\nwith your internal network.\n\n1751\n01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:20,690\nYou're just about ready to go.\n\n1752\n01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:22,540\nAll right.\n\n1753\n01:38:23,590 --> 01:38:25,290\n>> All right, sweet.\n\n1754\n01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:26,860\nAll right Ronnie, you know what?\n\n1755\n01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:32,910\nWe do have a bit more stuff to get to,\nwe got some remote desktop published apps.\n\n1756\n01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:36,830\n>> Right.\n>> Get into some NAP quarantine stuff.\n\n1757\n01:38:36,830 --> 01:38:39,225\nWhat we're gonna do is we'll go ahead and\ntake a break here.\n\n1758\n01:38:39,225 --> 01:38:39,772\n>> Good.\nAnd\n\n1759\n01:38:39,772 --> 01:38:44,024\nwhen we get back we'll touch on a few more\nof our remote connection technologies and\n\n1760\n01:38:44,024 --> 01:38:45,190\nfinish this topic up.\n\n1761\n01:38:45,190 --> 01:38:45,690\nHow's that sound?\n\n1762\n01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:46,690\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1763\n01:38:46,690 --> 01:38:49,103\n>> All right, sweet, so\nwe'll get to that stuff after the break.\n\n1764\n01:38:49,103 --> 01:38:55,728\n[MUSIC]\n\n1765\n01:38:55,728 --> 01:38:57,710\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n1766\n01:38:57,710 --> 01:39:01,730\nAll right, so where we left off\nwe're talking about DirectAccess.\n\n1767\n01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:04,070\nAnd we've got a little bit\nmore to touch on with that.\n\n1768\n01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:10,090\nAnd we've got a bit more remote technology\nstuff to get to next after that.\n\n1769\n01:39:10,090 --> 01:39:10,840\n>> Yeah.\n\n1770\n01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,740\nWell, we had actually gone away\nfrom the idea of DirectAccess but\n\n1771\n01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:17,730\nwe're coming back to it because it was\na little bit noisy here in the studio and\n\n1772\n01:39:17,730 --> 01:39:19,440\nI couldn't actually hear and\nI couldn't think.\n\n1773\n01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:22,020\nBut I'd showed you one particular setting,\nthere's another setting that I need to\n\n1774\n01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:25,350\nshow you here on my particular\ncomputer screen as well.\n\n1775\n01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:25,950\nOkay.\n\n1776\n01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:28,450\nSo, the last thing that we're\ntaking a look at with DirectAccess\n\n1777\n01:39:28,450 --> 01:39:31,190\nwas here under\nthe Name Resolution Policies.\n\n1778\n01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:35,460\n>> And once I select that there were two\ntabs here, one for DNSsec and one for\n\n1779\n01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:38,580\nDNS Settings for DirectAccess.\n\n1780\n01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:42,520\nThis has to be enabled and you have to\nhave your DNS servers pointed here,\n\n1781\n01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:45,270\nthat you're gonna be able to\naccess through DirectAccess.\n\n1782\n01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:49,770\nNow remember that because\nDirectAccess requires IP version 6.\n\n1783\n01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:51,290\nWell if you're outside the network,\n\n1784\n01:39:51,290 --> 01:39:53,790\nsomewhere again across the Internet,\nright?\n\n1785\n01:39:53,790 --> 01:39:57,830\nMore than likely you're gonna probably see\nthat you're not gonna have a complete IPV6\n\n1786\n01:39:57,830 --> 01:40:01,410\nnetwork from where you\nare all the way back to\n\n1787\n01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:04,210\nwhere you're actually going\nto enter into your network.\n\n1788\n01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:07,910\nSo that means we have to\nestablish the idea of my machine\n\n1789\n01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:11,380\nbeing able to use what we call\na transitional technology.\n\n1790\n01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:15,210\nThe way that we do that is on\nside of our local group policy.\n\n1791\n01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:15,970\nOkay.\n\n1792\n01:40:15,970 --> 01:40:20,580\nI can go ahead underneath\nthe Windows Settings here,\n\n1793\n01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:23,020\nI can go to Administrative Templates.\n\n1794\n01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:26,160\nAnd then select Network here.\n\n1795\n01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:30,956\nAnd inside of network I need\nto select the TCP/IP settings.\n\n1796\n01:40:30,956 --> 01:40:37,440\nOkay, inside of there, this is where we\nenable the IPv6 Transition Technologies.\n\n1797\n01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:41,520\nAnd notice that there are a ton of\nthem for us to actually select here.\n\n1798\n01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:44,030\nNow you might be going,\nman I'm never gonna do this,\n\n1799\n01:40:44,030 --> 01:40:45,610\nmore than likely you're right.\n\n1800\n01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:50,276\nIf anything, it's gonna be done for\nus at the domain group policy level.\n\n1801\n01:40:50,276 --> 01:40:53,700\nIn other words, this is gonna be\npushed out through a group policy and\n\n1802\n01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:55,620\nnot necessarily set up here.\n\n1803\n01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:58,890\nBut, if you do have to set it up, you do\nwanna make sure that you pay attention to\n\n1804\n01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:01,330\nboth of those locations for DirectAccess.\n\n1805\n01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:03,010\nI wanna make sure we got that in.\n\n1806\n01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:04,100\nAll right?\n\n1807\n01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:06,020\n>> All right.\nNow, so there we go.\n\n1808\n01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:07,540\nSo there's DirectAccess.\n\n1809\n01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:12,710\nNow, we did talk a bit about these VPN\nconnections, how DirectAccess, right.\n\n1810\n01:41:12,710 --> 01:41:18,560\nIt's just an automatic VPN really that\nthe user doesn't really have to turn on or\n\n1811\n01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,090\noff or anything.\n\n1812\n01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:24,545\nBut as far as VPNs go,\nwe do have another technology,\n\n1813\n01:41:24,545 --> 01:41:29,600\nanother way that we can kind of\ndial into our business place.\n\n1814\n01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,719\nAll right, so Ronnie,\ndo you remember the days,\n\n1815\n01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:36,010\nback in the day,\nthe days of the dial-up modem.\n\n1816\n01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:38,410\n>> Yes I do and I\n\n1817\n01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:42,810\nremember actually having to use a modem to\nconnect to my internet service provider.\n\n1818\n01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:43,340\n>> Oh, yeah?\n\n1819\n01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:43,900\n>> Yes.\n\n1820\n01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:46,260\n>> Who was your provider?\n\n1821\n01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:49,240\n>> My particular provider was\none of the local providers\n\n1822\n01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,420\nin the area that I lived in.\n\n1823\n01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:51,160\n>> Right.\n\n1824\n01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:53,550\n>> Yeah, just a small, little company.\n\n1825\n01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:56,130\n>> So, have you heard of EarthLink?\n\n1826\n01:41:56,130 --> 01:41:57,110\n>> I know Earthlink.\n\n1827\n01:41:57,110 --> 01:41:59,590\n>> That's who we use for ours, EarthLink.\n\n1828\n01:41:59,590 --> 01:42:01,950\n>> Mine was an original\nCompuserve account.\n\n1829\n01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:02,510\n>> Oh yeah?\n\n1830\n01:42:02,510 --> 01:42:04,290\nAnd do you still have your email account?\n\n1831\n01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:04,880\n>> I do not.\n\n1832\n01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:09,990\n>> Oh man, that would be something,\nI'd send you email to it.\n\n1833\n01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:10,720\n>> Nice.\n\n1834\n01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:13,330\n>> Yeah.\n>> Too bad I don't have it.\n\n1835\n01:42:13,330 --> 01:42:14,360\n>> Right?\nSo are so modems, right?\n\n1836\n01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:18,520\nSo, modems are still around,\nand they still are in use.\n\n1837\n01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,640\nAnd one scenario that our other host here,\n\n1838\n01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:25,685\nDon Pizzett, that he brings up is in\nthe idea of emergency situations.\n\n1839\n01:42:25,685 --> 01:42:26,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1840\n01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,310\n>> So if you're in a disaster area,\n\n1841\n01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:33,530\nas they're starting to bring on\nutilities and that sort of thing,\n\n1842\n01:42:33,530 --> 01:42:37,910\nchances are they're not going to\nbring up cable, broadband internet.\n\n1843\n01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:44,320\nIf that particular service is damaged,\nbut what they will bring up is dial-up.\n\n1844\n01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:47,910\nThey will bring up those phone lines for\nthose critical situations.\n\n1845\n01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:52,080\nAnd so we can still leverage\nthose dial-up connections.\n\n1846\n01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:54,850\nNow Ron, let's go ahead and\nset up one of these.\n\n1847\n01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:56,040\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1848\n01:42:56,040 --> 01:43:00,820\n>> So then what we will do is we'll get\nback into our Network and Sharing Center.\n\n1849\n01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:04,840\nAnd in here we will set\nup a new connection.\n\n1850\n01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:10,210\nAnd we will connect to\nSetup a Dial-Up Connection.\n\n1851\n01:43:10,210 --> 01:43:10,853\n>> There you go.\n\n1852\n01:43:13,145 --> 01:43:13,995\n>> All right.\n\n1853\n01:43:13,995 --> 01:43:18,603\nNow, so we won't really be\nable to connect anything.\n\n1854\n01:43:18,603 --> 01:43:22,186\nOn this particular computer\nthere is no modem.\n\n1855\n01:43:22,186 --> 01:43:27,550\nSo what we can do is we can go ahead and\ncontinue through this wizard anyway.\n\n1856\n01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:30,120\nSo, we got our dial-up phone number.\n\n1857\n01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:33,680\nSo, 352, it's a local number, 555, just so\n\n1858\n01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:37,622\nnobody can send any prank phone calls,\nand 9876.\n\n1859\n01:43:37,622 --> 01:43:41,230\nAll right, a username,\nto dial into our ISP.\n\n1860\n01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:47,450\nWe'll just call this localuser.\n\n1861\n01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:49,592\nAnd for a password.\n\n1862\n01:43:49,592 --> 01:43:53,188\nWe'll enter that in, and we'll give this\na connection, a dial-up connection works.\n\n1863\n01:43:53,188 --> 01:43:57,744\nAnd once again we can allow other people\nto be able to have access to this\n\n1864\n01:43:57,744 --> 01:44:00,071\nconnection which, might as well.\n\n1865\n01:44:00,071 --> 01:44:00,848\nAll right.\n\n1866\n01:44:00,848 --> 01:44:03,990\nAnd then if we don't have an ISP we can\nclick on this link to bring us to a page\n\n1867\n01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:05,790\nto where we can select one.\n\n1868\n01:44:05,790 --> 01:44:08,020\nWe got this other button\nup here Dialing Rules.\n\n1869\n01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:12,540\nWe click on this if whatever area code,\nI guess we can enter that in.\n\n1870\n01:44:14,170 --> 01:44:15,210\nAny carrier codes or\n\n1871\n01:44:15,210 --> 01:44:18,850\nif we needed something to dial\nout we can put in nine, sure.\n\n1872\n01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:20,300\nPut that in there.\n\n1873\n01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:21,550\nYeah, that works.\n\n1874\n01:44:21,550 --> 01:44:24,650\nAll right.\nAnd click on Create, and there we go.\n\n1875\n01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:25,670\nThat's it.\n\n1876\n01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:30,272\nSo we'll click on Close and\nwe'll get into our\n\n1877\n01:44:30,272 --> 01:44:35,122\nadapter settings and\nthere's our connection.\n\n1878\n01:44:35,122 --> 01:44:39,451\nNow we can't connect anything since\nwe don't have that dial-up modem.\n\n1879\n01:44:39,451 --> 01:44:41,772\nBut if we do need to modify\nany of those properties,\n\n1880\n01:44:41,772 --> 01:44:44,610\nof course we can jump\ninto our Properties here.\n\n1881\n01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:48,905\nIf we had multiple modems for\none reason or another,\n\n1882\n01:44:48,905 --> 01:44:51,838\nactually not on that button there.\n\n1883\n01:44:51,838 --> 01:44:56,302\nBut we can select aspects of it,\nthere's good old 96576.\n\n1884\n01:44:56,302 --> 01:45:00,280\nAnd Ronnie this list goes up a lot higher-\n>> It does.\n\n1885\n01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:01,440\n>> Than I remember.\n\n1886\n01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,430\n>> They usually stop like down here or\ndown here.\n\n1887\n01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:06,030\nYou got a bit more in there.\n\n1888\n01:45:06,030 --> 01:45:10,320\nAnd then we need to flow control our\nerror correction, those sorts of things.\n\n1889\n01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,960\nError control, sorry.\n\n1890\n01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:12,940\nWe can enable our stuff there.\n\n1891\n01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:15,090\nAnd then the good old modem speaker.\n\n1892\n01:45:15,090 --> 01:45:17,840\nYou know,\ndefinitely leave that guy checked.\n\n1893\n01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,200\nAll right, there we go.\n\n1894\n01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:22,490\nAnd then, some of these options\nthat we saw in the other,\n\n1895\n01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:24,630\nthe VPN one, we can select.\n\n1896\n01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:27,000\nSo the security stuff and\nthe networking things,\n\n1897\n01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,200\nwe've got other protocols\nin the sort to connect to.\n\n1898\n01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:34,120\nAnd then we can turn on our\ninternet connection sharing there.\n\n1899\n01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:34,920\nThen there we go.\n\n1900\n01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,950\nThen we can connect out to\nour dial-up services and\n\n1901\n01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:40,300\neither connect to our company.\n\n1902\n01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:42,940\nHopefully we're not doing\nmuch over it other than\n\n1903\n01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:45,366\nmaybe checking the You've Got Mail,\nthat stuff.\n\n1904\n01:45:45,366 --> 01:45:47,360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah that's about it.\n\n1905\n01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:49,050\n>> That's pretty cool.\n\n1906\n01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:55,780\n>> All right,\nwe can jump back over to our objectives.\n\n1907\n01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:58,280\nNow, we've got VP and reconnect wire.\n\n1908\n01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:01,620\nWhat about this advanced\nsecurity auditing?\n\n1909\n01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:03,180\nIt sounds pretty heavy duty.\n\n1910\n01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:07,100\nIt's gotta be advanced, more advanced\nthan regular security auditing.\n\n1911\n01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:08,170\n>> That's true.\n\n1912\n01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:12,100\nRemember that Windows has always been\ngood at actually doing auditing for us.\n\n1913\n01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:15,380\nBut with Windows 7s, and the very fact\nthat we're doing more and more of\n\n1914\n01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:20,450\nthese remote connections, they've included\nin some extra auditing features for us.\n\n1915\n01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:23,100\nAnd of course we can access\nthem through our group policy.\n\n1916\n01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:24,405\nNow if you wanna learn more about this,\n\n1917\n01:46:24,405 --> 01:46:27,236\nthey go a little bit more in depth with\nmy computer screen, I went ahead and\n\n1918\n01:46:27,236 --> 01:46:31,550\ndid a Google search for this, Advanced\nSecurity Audit Policy Settings here.\n\n1919\n01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:36,120\nAnd I will do my best to include these\nin notes that we'll actually include in\n\n1920\n01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:39,650\nwith the show here, in terms of the link\nand where to actually go to this here.\n\n1921\n01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:42,650\nBut you actually see that this applies\nto Windows 7 as well as to Windows 8.\n\n1922\n01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:46,270\nAnd so this actually does apply for\nus in what we can do.\n\n1923\n01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:47,830\nSo it used to be able, of course,\n\n1924\n01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:51,790\nthat we could audit things that only go\non inside of our particular computers.\n\n1925\n01:46:51,790 --> 01:46:57,200\nNow with Windows 7, we can actually\naudit these advanced policies as well,\n\n1926\n01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:59,650\nfor getting these connections going too,\nall right?\n\n1927\n01:46:59,650 --> 01:47:02,894\nSo I'm just gonna bring up the local\ngroup policy editor again.\n\n1928\n01:47:06,574 --> 01:47:09,272\nAnd inside of that,\nif I can select that, and\n\n1929\n01:47:09,272 --> 01:47:13,674\nover underneath Computer Policies and\nif I expand out Windows settings,\n\n1930\n01:47:13,674 --> 01:47:18,080\nit's either under Windows Settings or\nAdministrative Templates here.\n\n1931\n01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:23,290\nIt's under Administrative Templates,\nof course.\n\n1932\n01:47:23,290 --> 01:47:24,157\nLet's see.\n\n1933\n01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:28,280\nNo.\n\n1934\n01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:30,810\nThere it is.\n\n1935\n01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:31,940\nUnder the Security Settings.\n\n1936\n01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:32,690\nI can't remember which one.\n\n1937\n01:47:32,690 --> 01:47:35,170\nIt's under Security Settings,\nand then there it is.\n\n1938\n01:47:35,170 --> 01:47:40,328\nIt's the Advanced Audit\nPolicy Configuration.\n\n1939\n01:47:42,614 --> 01:47:44,280\nAnd I just select that.\n\n1940\n01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:48,990\nIt says expand the advanced\naudit policy configuration node\n\n1941\n01:47:48,990 --> 01:47:51,440\nto configure some granular policies here.\n\n1942\n01:47:53,650 --> 01:47:59,330\nSo if I select that, advanced audit\npolicy configuration settings\n\n1943\n01:47:59,330 --> 01:48:05,230\ncan be used to provide a detailed control\nover audit policies, identify attempted or\n\n1944\n01:48:05,230 --> 01:48:08,680\nsuccessful attacks on your network and\nresources, verify compliance and\n\n1945\n01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:13,100\nrules governing the management of\ncritical organizational assets.\n\n1946\n01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:16,910\nNow, this is one of those unusual\npolicy settings that we have here\n\n1947\n01:48:16,910 --> 01:48:19,720\nthat requires not only for this, and for\n\n1948\n01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:22,960\nyou to be able to come in here and\nactually do some of these configurations.\n\n1949\n01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:28,166\nBut notice it says when this\nis actually used, audit:force\n\n1950\n01:48:28,166 --> 01:48:35,040\naudit policy subcategory settings to\nover-ride the audit policy setting.\n\n1951\n01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:36,480\nWell, what the heck is that?\n\n1952\n01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:40,539\nWell, this one you have to\nactually go back up into the,\n\n1953\n01:48:40,539 --> 01:48:43,920\nmake sure I find it here,\n\n1954\n01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:53,610\nthe local policies and under Audit Policy\nhere, actually that's not the right one.\n\n1955\n01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:57,560\nSecurity Set options I always,\nagain, forget.\n\n1956\n01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:03,950\nAnd under Audit,\nif I can expand that out, there it is.\n\n1957\n01:49:03,950 --> 01:49:07,890\nIt is the Force Policy\nSubcategory Settings, here.\n\n1958\n01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:12,280\nThat's not defined, and\nI would enable this.\n\n1959\n01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:14,624\nAnd then those policies\nwould actually be allowed.\n\n1960\n01:49:19,222 --> 01:49:21,170\nUnder here.\n\n1961\n01:49:21,170 --> 01:49:23,880\nAnd right now,\nthey're just showing a summary,\n\n1962\n01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:26,960\nif we actually had any of this\nauditing stuff turned on.\n\n1963\n01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:34,280\nSo there's the one for our direct access\nservices, or our domain services access.\n\n1964\n01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:36,280\nAccount log ons again.\n\n1965\n01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:39,713\nAll these are actually auditing features\nthat we would have available inside\n\n1966\n01:49:39,713 --> 01:49:42,402\nof the regular group policy, but\nthis gives us one place to go\n\n1967\n01:49:42,402 --> 01:49:45,490\nto be able to actually see\nthe configurations as well.\n\n1968\n01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:50,910\nSo, we actually have all those\naudit policies set up right there.\n\n1969\n01:49:50,910 --> 01:49:52,840\nLike I said,\non Technet you can actually go in and\n\n1970\n01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:57,200\nsee this, in terms of the advanced\nsecurity audit policies for us.\n\n1971\n01:49:57,200 --> 01:50:01,040\nAnd I'll include these in the link\nin terms of our class notes.\n\n1972\n01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:04,050\n>> All right.\nSo as far as connecting to stuff and\n\n1973\n01:50:04,050 --> 01:50:08,880\nconnecting to things go,\nwe have this great fabulous technology\n\n1974\n01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:13,520\nthat most of us here in the studio,\nwe use every day pretty extensively.\n\n1975\n01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:16,412\nIt is the ability, a built-in utility,\n\n1976\n01:50:16,412 --> 01:50:20,990\nthat we can remotely\nconnect to another PC and\n\n1977\n01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:25,510\nwork with that PC as if we were sitting\ndirectly in front of that console.\n\n1978\n01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:28,990\nRonnie, do you know what technology\nit is that I am referring to?\n\n1979\n01:50:28,990 --> 01:50:29,890\n>> I am going to guess that\n\n1980\n01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:32,310\nyou are talking about the idea of\nthe remote desktop connection.\n\n1981\n01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:34,020\n>> Yes.\nRemote desktop.\n\n1982\n01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:35,940\nA pretty fantastic technology.\n\n1983\n01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:37,870\nRonnie, how often do you use this?\n\n1984\n01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:40,660\n>> Daily, if not hourly.\n\n1985\n01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:44,690\nYeah, I use it quite often.\n\n1986\n01:50:44,690 --> 01:50:48,740\n>> Quite a bit, now with good old\nremote desktop, it's just that.\n\n1987\n01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:50,709\nSo we can remotely connect to a PC and\n\n1988\n01:50:50,709 --> 01:50:53,284\nwork with it as if we're\nsitting right there.\n\n1989\n01:50:53,284 --> 01:50:59,290\nSo let's take a look at what it\ntakes to set up this remote desktop.\n\n1990\n01:50:59,290 --> 01:50:59,940\nAll right.\n\n1991\n01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:02,410\nA couple of things that we do need.\n\n1992\n01:51:02,410 --> 01:51:06,150\nNow, we need to make sure that\nour firewall is up and running.\n\n1993\n01:51:06,150 --> 01:51:10,375\nWhat is the default remote\ndesktop port number?\n\n1994\n01:51:10,375 --> 01:51:12,314\n>> 3389.\n\n1995\n01:51:12,314 --> 01:51:14,390\n>> 3389.\n\n1996\n01:51:14,390 --> 01:51:15,140\n>> Am I right?\n\n1997\n01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:16,587\n>> What? Yes. >> That was a good guess.\n\n1998\n01:51:16,587 --> 01:51:17,540\nWeird.\n\n1999\n01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:18,590\n>> Guess.\n\n2000\n01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:19,890\nThat wasn't a guess.\n\n2001\n01:51:19,890 --> 01:51:20,460\nGreat job Ronnie.\n\n2002\n01:51:21,570 --> 01:51:25,070\nSo what we're going to do, we're going to\njump in here into our Windows firewall.\n\n2003\n01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:30,726\nAnd what we will do is allow a program or\nfeature through Windows firewall.\n\n2004\n01:51:30,726 --> 01:51:36,120\nNow, by default, the port for\na remote desktop is closed off.\n\n2005\n01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:39,861\nIf you're not using it,\nit can be a risk to leave that stuff open,\n\n2006\n01:51:39,861 --> 01:51:43,345\nbecause it's that default\nport everybody knows, 338.\n\n2007\n01:51:43,345 --> 01:51:48,760\nAll right, so we'll click onto allow\na program through the firewall and\n\n2008\n01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:51,260\nthen we will browse down in here.\n\n2009\n01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:53,710\nTo remote,\nlet me click on change settings.\n\n2010\n01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:58,830\nAnd down in here to Remote Desktop,\nall right?\n\n2011\n01:51:58,830 --> 01:52:01,300\nSo we can check off, and mark Desktop.\n\n2012\n01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:04,300\nAnd we will allow this guy on the home and\n\n2013\n01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:09,070\nprivate, and public network so,\nyou know network location profiles right?\n\n2014\n01:52:09,070 --> 01:52:11,600\nSo depending on the network\nthat you're connected to,\n\n2015\n01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,260\nyou connect to a brand new network.\n\n2016\n01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:18,150\nYou can designate it whether it's\na home network, a work network, or\n\n2017\n01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:19,660\nin a public place.\n\n2018\n01:52:19,660 --> 01:52:22,500\nDepending on which network\nlocation you're at,\n\n2019\n01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:26,230\ncertain firewall rules\nare going to kick in.\n\n2020\n01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:28,200\nWe can set that.\n\n2021\n01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:32,180\nWhen I'm on a public network,\ndon't open it up.\n\n2022\n01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:33,420\nLeave that thing shut down.\n\n2023\n01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:36,410\nBut when I'm on the home or\n\n2024\n01:52:36,410 --> 01:52:39,502\nthe work network, yeah,\nsure we'll go ahead and open it up.\n\n2025\n01:52:39,502 --> 01:52:43,989\nAll right, so I've got that selected and\nwe will click OK.\n\n2026\n01:52:43,989 --> 01:52:48,650\nAll right now the second\npart to use this guy,\n\n2027\n01:52:48,650 --> 01:52:51,540\nis we'll get into our system Properties.\n\n2028\n01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:55,560\nAnd more that one way to get there,\nI usually just click on computer and\n\n2029\n01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:58,330\nthen you click on to Properties.\n\n2030\n01:52:58,330 --> 01:53:01,700\nAnd we will click on Remote settings\nover here on the left hand side.\n\n2031\n01:53:02,970 --> 01:53:06,350\nAnd we will go down to Remote Desktop.\n\n2032\n01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:11,200\nAnd so right now it says don't\nallow any connections to this PC.\n\n2033\n01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:15,390\nSo we want anybody be able\nto remote in to our PC.\n\n2034\n01:53:15,390 --> 01:53:15,910\nAll right.\n\n2035\n01:53:15,910 --> 01:53:17,360\nWe have this option here.\n\n2036\n01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:23,780\nNow it does say it is less secure for\nolder remote desktop programs.\n\n2037\n01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:29,650\nIt does have this warning here about\nwhether it is sleeping or in hibernation.\n\n2038\n01:53:29,650 --> 01:53:34,700\nIf the computer is asleep or\nit is hibernating, get user mode desktop.\n\n2039\n01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:38,470\nIt is just in a suspended state,\nand it won't work.\n\n2040\n01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:43,280\nNow to wake that computer up you have\nto send out like a magic packet.\n\n2041\n01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:46,900\nRight, either through a firewall or\nsome other sort to wake that machine up.\n\n2042\n01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:53,380\nBut then down here is the requiring\nnetwork level authentication.\n\n2043\n01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:56,860\nNow, Ronnie tell me,\nwhat is this network level authentication.\n\n2044\n01:53:56,860 --> 01:53:59,700\n>> This is just a higher level\nauthentication is what it\n\n2045\n01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:00,910\ncomes down to, right?\n\n2046\n01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:02,140\n>> The older versions,\n\n2047\n01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:05,680\nagain, had a little bit less security\nwhereas this one has a bit more and\n\n2048\n01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:08,195\nthere may be some other things in it\nthat Nate wants to tell us about.\n\n2049\n01:54:08,195 --> 01:54:08,990\nMm-hm.\n\n2050\n01:54:08,990 --> 01:54:09,760\n>> Yeah?\n>> Right.\n\n2051\n01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:10,720\n>> Yeah.\nYeah, so\n\n2052\n01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:13,350\nbasically the latest\nbit of remote desktop.\n\n2053\n01:54:13,350 --> 01:54:15,990\n>> Yeah.\nIt is Windows closeout is the more secure\n\n2054\n01:54:15,990 --> 01:54:18,180\noptions so, you know,\nsure, we'll go with it.\n\n2055\n01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:19,930\nNow we've this button here,\n\n2056\n01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:25,030\nwhere you select the users that, that\nwill allow access into remote desktop.\n\n2057\n01:54:25,030 --> 01:54:30,840\nAnd I don't believe that I have any other,\nany other users on this PC.\n\n2058\n01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:34,090\nAnd we don't.\n\n2059\n01:54:34,090 --> 01:54:35,640\nLet's just make a user.\n\n2060\n01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:38,249\nWe'll call this one Ronnie.\n\n2061\n01:54:41,967 --> 01:54:49,620\n[INAUDIBLE] All right, we want to do that,\nnever expire, because that is great.\n\n2062\n01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:51,488\n>> I want you to know\nthat's not my password.\n\n2063\n01:54:51,488 --> 01:54:53,971\n>> All right.\n\n2064\n01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:56,140\nNumbers.\n\n2065\n01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:56,860\nLet's see.\n\n2066\n01:54:56,860 --> 01:54:59,700\nWe will add you to the remote.\n\n2067\n01:55:02,990 --> 01:55:05,140\nRemote desktop users.\n\n2068\n01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:05,840\n>> Click on it fine now.\n\n2069\n01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:08,330\nWe'll see where it is.\n\n2070\n01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:10,430\n>> Remote desktop users.\n\n2071\n01:55:10,430 --> 01:55:11,420\nThere we go.\n\n2072\n01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:12,690\nClick okay.\n\n2073\n01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:14,940\nSo, right now, click on Cancel and OK.\n\n2074\n01:55:16,450 --> 01:55:19,810\n>> You've got a little\nremote at the beginning.\n\n2075\n01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,900\nAll right.\nSo now, on Ronnie's user account,\n\n2076\n01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:27,830\nI have added him to this group so\n\n2077\n01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:30,680\nhe can connect and\nthe this remote desktop users group.\n\n2078\n01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:37,220\nSo he has this, now Ronnie would this be\na right or a permission at this point?\n\n2079\n01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:39,400\n>> This would be a right.\n\n2080\n01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:43,910\nYep so you have the right to remote\ndesktop into this PC so that works.\n\n2081\n01:55:43,910 --> 01:55:45,764\nWe'll click on OK and apply.\n\n2082\n01:55:45,764 --> 01:55:48,282\n[LAUGH] Apply then okay.\n\n2083\n01:55:48,282 --> 01:55:51,120\nAll right so\nnow we have this Ronnie guy on here.\n\n2084\n01:55:52,150 --> 01:55:57,010\nSo what we can do is I can just\nadd Ronnie in here as well.\n\n2085\n01:55:57,010 --> 01:55:59,050\nCheck names, there we go.\n\n2086\n01:55:59,050 --> 01:56:00,980\nSo now Ronnie can remote desktop in here.\n\n2087\n01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:04,580\nI believe even if we didn't add you to\nthis group it would do it at this point.\n\n2088\n01:56:05,630 --> 01:56:07,770\nAll right, so, Apply and OK.\n\n2089\n01:56:07,770 --> 01:56:11,610\nAnything else Ronnie, or that's it?\n\n2090\n01:56:11,610 --> 01:56:13,510\n>> That should be it.\n\n2091\n01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:15,810\nShould we give this a shot?\n\n2092\n01:56:15,810 --> 01:56:17,130\nInserting a remote into my PC?\n\n2093\n01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:19,520\n>> We should give it a shot and\nsee if it can happen.\n\n2094\n01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:24,010\nAll right, so even though Ronnie's\nright next to me let's say that he's in\n\n2095\n01:56:24,010 --> 01:56:28,310\nthe other room, or\nhe's on his VPN connection.\n\n2096\n01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:31,660\nAnd he's working from his beach house.\n\n2097\n01:56:31,660 --> 01:56:33,820\n>> Right.\nAnd he's out on the beach, and\n\n2098\n01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:37,810\nI call up Ronnie, I say hey,\nRonnie, there's, I don't know,\n\n2099\n01:56:37,810 --> 01:56:39,070\nthere's something wrong with my PC.\n\n2100\n01:56:39,070 --> 01:56:40,670\nCan you fix it?\n\n2101\n01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:42,000\nSo, I said, okay, well yeah.\n\n2102\n01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,040\nLet me just remote into that PC and\nwe'll take a look at it and see.\n\n2103\n01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:47,990\nWell my Bookmarks.\n\n2104\n01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:51,270\nSo say Ronnie I don't have my Bookmarks,\nthey're missing.\n\n2105\n01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:52,090\nWill you help me?\n\n2106\n01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:57,490\nSo we've already enabled everything for\nremote desktop.\n\n2107\n01:56:57,490 --> 01:57:01,580\nNow for Ronnie to remote into this\nPC he needs a couple of things.\n\n2108\n01:57:01,580 --> 01:57:02,330\nRight?\n\n2109\n01:57:02,330 --> 01:57:04,430\nHe needs a username and a password.\n\n2110\n01:57:04,430 --> 01:57:07,980\nSo he needs to authenticate onto this PC.\n\n2111\n01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:10,940\nAnd he also needs the IP\naddress of this PC.\n\n2112\n01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:14,745\nAll right.\nSo let's go ahead and,\n\n2113\n01:57:14,745 --> 01:57:18,810\nwe'll go in to good old command prompt.\n\n2114\n01:57:20,970 --> 01:57:21,970\nIP Config.\n\n2115\n01:57:21,970 --> 01:57:24,780\nThen we'll go up.\n\n2116\n01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:25,468\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n2117\n01:57:25,468 --> 01:57:27,535\n10.1.230.65.\n\n2118\n01:57:27,535 --> 01:57:30,560\nAll right, so, you want to try it?\n\n2119\n01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:33,790\n>> You want me to do it?\n\n2120\n01:57:33,790 --> 01:57:34,974\nRight.\nLet's try it.\n\n2121\n01:57:34,974 --> 01:57:38,862\nAll right, so on Ronnie's PC,\nall right, so\n\n2122\n01:57:38,862 --> 01:57:43,668\ngee, here let's back up so\nyou can get into that window.\n\n2123\n01:57:43,668 --> 01:57:45,883\n>> No, I'm in Windows 8.\n\n2124\n01:57:45,883 --> 01:57:47,620\n>> I don't think I can do it from mine,\nI don't think mine actually is connected.\n\n2125\n01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:49,520\nWell, it is kind of spur of the moment.\n\n2126\n01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:50,770\nSo yeah, go and use your Windows 8 pc.\n\n2127\n01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:53,680\n>> All right.\nSo that you make sure that it connects up.\n\n2128\n01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:55,090\nAll right, so for Windows 8 PC,\n\n2129\n01:57:55,090 --> 01:58:00,170\nRonnie types in NSTSC to bring\nup this little window here.\n\n2130\n01:58:00,170 --> 01:58:06,972\nAnd now he needs to enter in the IP\naddress of my PC, which was 10.1.230.65.\n\n2131\n01:58:06,972 --> 01:58:09,580\n>> Don't forget to put a dot in there.\n\n2132\n01:58:09,580 --> 01:58:13,050\n>> Now remember in Windows 7, for\nyou to be able to gain access here,\n\n2133\n01:58:13,050 --> 01:58:17,090\nwhat you would do is you'd go to Start,\nAll programs, and\n\n2134\n01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:20,545\nthen Accessories, and you would also have\nthat Remote Desktop Connection here.\n\n2135\n01:58:20,545 --> 01:58:22,060\n>> Okay?\n\n2136\n01:58:22,060 --> 01:58:24,820\n>> So just remember that when you do that.\n\n2137\n01:58:24,820 --> 01:58:27,480\n>> So here I'm gonna make the connection.\n\n2138\n01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:28,630\nAnd then we're going to click connect.\n\n2139\n01:58:28,630 --> 01:58:32,010\n>> It's going to ask me\nif I want to do this.\n\n2140\n01:58:32,010 --> 01:58:36,070\nRonnie and then for the password\nit's just password all lowercase.\n\n2141\n01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:39,030\n>> Do I need the.\n\n2142\n01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:40,440\nNah.\n\n2143\n01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:40,940\n>> Nah.\n\n2144\n01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:43,470\n>> It's just all lower case?\n\n2145\n01:58:43,470 --> 01:58:44,380\nCorrect.\n\n2146\n01:58:44,380 --> 01:58:44,880\n>> All right.\n\n2147\n01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:50,270\nThis is a good sign, so that was a,\nthis security certificate, saying hey,\n\n2148\n01:58:50,270 --> 01:58:55,150\nI don't really trust this PC,\nwould you like to connect anyways.\n\n2149\n01:58:55,150 --> 01:58:55,780\n>> Right.\n\n2150\n01:58:55,780 --> 01:59:00,560\nAnd so then you can click on Yes.\n\n2151\n01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,209\nAnd so that is 08.\n\n2152\n01:59:02,209 --> 01:59:06,220\nAll right, Jason so\nif you can jump back to my PC.\n\n2153\n01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:09,650\nI'm greeted with this little pop\nup right here that says Ronnie\n\n2154\n01:59:09,650 --> 01:59:12,270\nwants to connect to this machine.\n\n2155\n01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:14,360\nClick OK to disconnect\nyour session immediately.\n\n2156\n01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:16,470\nAll right so I'll click on OK.\n\n2157\n01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:20,630\nAll right and it logged me out so\n\n2158\n01:59:20,630 --> 01:59:25,880\nyou can jump on over to Ronnie's PC and\nsure enough there it goes.\n\n2159\n01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:31,030\nSo now he is logging in and just like\na brand new user, he's now in my PC and\n\n2160\n01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:36,446\nyou know jump on over to, open up like\nfile explore when it finally opens up.\n\n2161\n01:59:36,446 --> 01:59:40,500\nWe'll click on computer and there we go!\n\n2162\n01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:44,308\nWe've got my C drive as bit lockered,\nit's unlocked though.\n\n2163\n01:59:44,308 --> 01:59:46,775\nIt wouldn't do me any good.\n\n2164\n01:59:46,775 --> 01:59:50,781\nI would have that thing bitlockered\nwith you remoting into it.\n\n2165\n01:59:50,781 --> 01:59:51,595\nBut there we go.\n\n2166\n01:59:51,595 --> 01:59:53,020\nSo, now, Ronnie is at my PC.\n\n2167\n01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:59,045\nHe can navigate and click around and\nremotely administer my PC.\n\n2168\n01:59:59,045 --> 02:00:01,400\n>> Yeah.\n>> Pretty fancy stuff.\n\n2169\n02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:05,312\n>> That is pretty fancy.\n\n2170\n02:00:05,312 --> 02:00:06,437\nNow, so with Remote Desktop.\n\n2171\n02:00:06,437 --> 02:00:09,890\nRight?\nThere are certain aspect that we can do\n\n2172\n02:00:09,890 --> 02:00:11,632\nwhen we remote into another machine.\n\n2173\n02:00:11,632 --> 02:00:12,290\nAll right.\n\n2174\n02:00:12,290 --> 02:00:16,510\nWe can share our hard drive,\nwe can have have a printer redirection,\n\n2175\n02:00:16,510 --> 02:00:21,485\nwhich I think was covered with, Don and\nMike covered printer redirection.\n\n2176\n02:00:21,485 --> 02:00:24,612\n>> Right.\n>> We can share our clipboards, and\n\n2177\n02:00:24,612 --> 02:00:28,758\nthere is a fancy thing called\na Remote Desktop Gateway.\n\n2178\n02:00:28,758 --> 02:00:29,628\nAll right.\n\n2179\n02:00:29,628 --> 02:00:34,610\nSo, like, a server that kinda sits\non the edge of our business network,\n\n2180\n02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:39,980\nthat instead of entering our\nPC's IP address, we can connect to\n\n2181\n02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:46,310\nthis remote desktop gateway server and it\nwill redirect us to our correct receipt.\n\n2182\n02:00:46,310 --> 02:00:47,268\nRight, Ronnie?\n\n2183\n02:00:47,268 --> 02:00:48,091\n>> Correct.\n\n2184\n02:00:48,091 --> 02:00:50,645\nYeah, a lot of times on\nthe outside of your network.\n\n2185\n02:00:50,645 --> 02:00:52,760\nRight?\nYou may actually have set up a single\n\n2186\n02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:56,020\nmachine that essentially acts\nas that main connection point,\n\n2187\n02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:58,990\ninstead of everybody actually\nconnecting into every single machine.\n\n2188\n02:00:58,990 --> 02:01:02,965\nSo this allows everybody to connect to\none and then, once you actually make that\n\n2189\n02:01:02,965 --> 02:01:07,150\nconnection, it automatically redirects\nyou to where you want to go.\n\n2190\n02:01:07,150 --> 02:01:07,970\n>> Nice.\n\n2191\n02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:11,330\nNow let me get logged back into my PC.\n\n2192\n02:01:11,330 --> 02:01:15,128\nAll right, so\nlet's say that we have all these PCs.\n\n2193\n02:01:15,128 --> 02:01:17,946\nRight?\nThat are connecting into our network.\n\n2194\n02:01:17,946 --> 02:01:19,000\nRight?\n\n2195\n02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:23,062\nSo it can be a bit, I guess not safe,\n\n2196\n02:01:23,062 --> 02:01:29,540\na bit unsafe [LAUGH] to let all\nthese PCs into our network.\n\n2197\n02:01:29,540 --> 02:01:31,625\n>> Right.\n>> There is a bit of technology.\n\n2198\n02:01:31,625 --> 02:01:35,480\nRight?\nCalled Network Access Protection.\n\n2199\n02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:38,960\nNetwork Access Protection,\nwhat it does is it\n\n2200\n02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:44,450\nregulates which computers are compliant or\nnon compliant.\n\n2201\n02:01:44,450 --> 02:01:50,340\nAnd based off of their compliant status\nthe computer that determining this stuff,\n\n2202\n02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:52,795\ndepending on how it's set up\non the server side of things.\n\n2203\n02:01:52,795 --> 02:01:58,250\nIt will determine whether or not this\ncomputer has full access to our network or\n\n2204\n02:01:58,250 --> 02:02:00,920\nit needs to go into a remediation network.\n\n2205\n02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:05,050\nNow in this remediation network,\ntypically, it will be a separate subnet.\n\n2206\n02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:10,040\nAnd in there, there will be\nlike a Windows update server.\n\n2207\n02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:13,270\nAnd there will be perhaps\na way out of the Internet so\n\n2208\n02:02:13,270 --> 02:02:18,580\nyou can grab any other kind of rules or\nupdates and\n\n2209\n02:02:18,580 --> 02:02:21,912\nthings that will help bring\nthis PC into compliance.\n\n2210\n02:02:21,912 --> 02:02:22,710\n>> Right.\n\n2211\n02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:26,600\nI remember that a lot of times when\nyou are making a remote connection in.\n\n2212\n02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:28,820\nThey'll just say that\nwhat I've been doing for\n\n2213\n02:02:28,820 --> 02:02:31,880\nthe last six weeks is I've been\ntravelling from my company and\n\n2214\n02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:35,770\nI've taken this laptop to every\nnetwork during those times of travels.\n\n2215\n02:02:35,770 --> 02:02:39,610\nOnce again, yeah, you have the possibility\nthen that my computer has been connecting\n\n2216\n02:02:39,610 --> 02:02:43,108\nto networks that may not meet the security\nrequirements of my computer network.\n\n2217\n02:02:43,108 --> 02:02:47,400\nOr it maybe that I haven't actually had\na chance to update my computer during that\n\n2218\n02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:48,800\ntime in the travels.\n\n2219\n02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:53,880\nSo what I can do is now when I connect\nback in to my picker network, what\n\n2220\n02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:58,580\ncan happen is that my computer will then\nhave to meet certain health requirements.\n\n2221\n02:02:58,580 --> 02:03:01,095\nThe idea of the network access protection.\n\n2222\n02:03:01,095 --> 02:03:02,060\nOkay?\n\n2223\n02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:05,030\nGives us that ability to be able to do so.\n\n2224\n02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:09,160\nSo, it can take my machine and look at\nit as it's connecting that server and\n\n2225\n02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:12,470\nit can say whether or not it meets all\nthe requirements that we put in there,\n\n2226\n02:03:12,470 --> 02:03:13,970\nin terms of policy.\n\n2227\n02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:17,340\nIf it does, it allows me to come right in,\nand I can connect.\n\n2228\n02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:21,670\nIf it doesn't, it can put me into what\nwe call the idea of a remediation\n\n2229\n02:03:21,670 --> 02:03:25,030\nquarantine or a remediation zone,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n2230\n02:03:25,030 --> 02:03:25,720\nOkay?\n\n2231\n02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:28,860\nWhen we actually are doing that,\nit allows him,\n\n2232\n02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:31,645\nthe actual machine,\nto do exactly what Nate said here.\n\n2233\n02:03:31,645 --> 02:03:35,900\nIt's that it will then be\nessentially separated off.\n\n2234\n02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:39,440\nAnd it will actually be redirected\neither to an update server or\n\n2235\n02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:42,760\nactually have to sit there and\nwhat we'll do in the policy is say hey,\n\n2236\n02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:45,750\nyour machine doesn't actually meet this\nrequirement, you need to do this, this and\n\n2237\n02:03:45,750 --> 02:03:47,980\nthis before you can get connected in.\n\n2238\n02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:49,460\nAnd once all those requirements are met,\n\n2239\n02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:52,090\nit puts my machine back\non that same network.\n\n2240\n02:03:52,090 --> 02:03:53,690\nNow in terms of setting this up.\n\n2241\n02:03:53,690 --> 02:03:54,470\nRight?\n\n2242\n02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:58,080\nAll that, in terms of the infrastructure\nis done on the server shows.\n\n2243\n02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:01,420\nIf you wanna know more about that,\nhead on over to those server shows and\n\n2244\n02:04:01,420 --> 02:04:04,070\ntake advantage of seeing\nhow we actually do this.\n\n2245\n02:04:04,070 --> 02:04:07,970\nBut on the client's side, though,\nthere are just a couple of things that\n\n2246\n02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:10,310\nyou actually need to really want and\nneed to make sure of.\n\n2247\n02:04:10,310 --> 02:04:13,640\nAnd we need to make sure that our\nmachine is ready to work with NAP.\n\n2248\n02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:16,690\nSo the way we do that is\nthrough out services console.\n\n2249\n02:04:16,690 --> 02:04:17,860\nOkay?\n\n2250\n02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:20,230\nSo inside of Windows 7, if I go ahead and\n\n2251\n02:04:20,230 --> 02:04:24,990\nclick on Start, and I need to be able to\nbring up the services console itself.\n\n2252\n02:04:24,990 --> 02:04:26,920\nThere's many ways to do it here.\n\n2253\n02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:28,170\nI'm gonna do it the long way.\n\n2254\n02:04:28,170 --> 02:04:32,960\nI normally just type in services.msc, but\nif I go ahead and click on Control Panel,\n\n2255\n02:04:33,980 --> 02:04:38,458\nand go back to my category view,\ncuz I'm used to finding stuff now.\n\n2256\n02:04:38,458 --> 02:04:40,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna click on Systems and\n\n2257\n02:04:40,790 --> 02:04:42,300\nSecurity.\n\n2258\n02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:46,475\nAnd at the bottom of System and Security\nhere is where we see Administrative Tools.\n\n2259\n02:04:46,475 --> 02:04:49,685\nAnd from there,\nI have the Services Linked.\n\n2260\n02:04:49,685 --> 02:04:50,220\nOkay?\n\n2261\n02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:52,720\nIt doesn't really matter how you get here,\nbut\n\n2262\n02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:56,251\nyou should be familiar with some of\nthe different ways you can get here.\n\n2263\n02:04:56,251 --> 02:04:58,870\nOkay?\nFrom this point, the service that I'm\n\n2264\n02:04:58,870 --> 02:05:03,810\nlooking for is actually down\nhere in the Ns, for Networking.\n\n2265\n02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:06,750\nAnd the one that we're looking for\nis right here,\n\n2266\n02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:08,995\nwhere it's\nNetwork Access Protection Service.\n\n2267\n02:05:08,995 --> 02:05:10,540\nOkay?\n\n2268\n02:05:10,540 --> 02:05:13,290\nSo, in this\nNetwork Access Protection Service,\n\n2269\n02:05:13,290 --> 02:05:19,220\nit tells us if our computers are using\nthat, I was trying to expand this out but\n\n2270\n02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:22,220\nit doesn't look like it's gonna\ngive me that ability to do so.\n\n2271\n02:05:22,220 --> 02:05:24,690\nI was hoping we could see\nthe entire description.\n\n2272\n02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:27,840\nIt says network access protection\nagent service collects and\n\n2273\n02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:31,400\nmanages health information for\nclient computers on a network.\n\n2274\n02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:34,170\nThis information's connected,\ncollected by a NAP agent,\n\n2275\n02:05:34,170 --> 02:05:39,040\nis used to make sure the client computer\nhas a required software settings.\n\n2276\n02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:41,890\nIf a client computer is not\ncompliant with the policy\n\n2277\n02:05:41,890 --> 02:05:43,920\nit can be provided with restricted access.\n\n2278\n02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:45,244\nJust like what we're talking about.\n\n2279\n02:05:45,244 --> 02:05:47,465\nSo, depending on what we\nhave here is what we need.\n\n2280\n02:05:47,465 --> 02:05:48,550\nOkay?\n\n2281\n02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:51,025\nNow, if you set up the infrastructure\nin the background.\n\n2282\n02:05:51,025 --> 02:05:53,590\nOkay?\nNotice that this service is not disabled,\n\n2283\n02:05:53,590 --> 02:05:54,620\nit's manual.\n\n2284\n02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:59,015\nThat means that the actual server that you\nconnect, you can say let's run this thing.\n\n2285\n02:05:59,015 --> 02:06:00,140\nOkay?\nSo a lot of times,\n\n2286\n02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:02,927\nwhat you're doing is\nthat NAP is not applying,\n\n2287\n02:06:02,927 --> 02:06:07,950\nis that you may need to come in here and\ncheck it is actually not started.\n\n2288\n02:06:07,950 --> 02:06:10,080\nOkay?o Notice that this one is stopped.\n\n2289\n02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:13,780\nIf you know that you're gonna be\nconstantly connecting to your network and\n\n2290\n02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:18,180\nyou know that have NAP, what you may want\nto do is change it from the idea manual to\n\n2291\n02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:20,780\nthe idea of automatic and started.\n\n2292\n02:06:22,310 --> 02:06:26,660\nAnd once it starts,\nthen that way when you connect back in,\n\n2293\n02:06:26,660 --> 02:06:30,420\nthis service says, hey, I can keep that\ninformation and then send it on to that\n\n2294\n02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:34,010\nparticular policy server to make\nsure that everything is handled.\n\n2295\n02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:36,570\nSo, if it doesn't, then that's when\nit will actually be put in that\n\n2296\n02:06:36,570 --> 02:06:38,780\nquarantine zone that Nate was mentioning.\n\n2297\n02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:39,660\nYeah.\n\n2298\n02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:43,770\n>> Yeah.\nAnd to get the rest of this NAP stuff to\n\n2299\n02:06:43,770 --> 02:06:48,710\nwork, as Ronnie said,\nin our server episodes,\n\n2300\n02:06:48,710 --> 02:06:54,975\nwe set up the NAP from the ground up,\nfrom the server side of things.\n\n2301\n02:06:54,975 --> 02:06:57,100\n>> Right.\n>> And as far as client goes,\n\n2302\n02:06:57,100 --> 02:06:58,425\nthat's really about it.\n\n2303\n02:06:58,425 --> 02:06:59,890\n>> Yeah.\n>> That agent,\n\n2304\n02:06:59,890 --> 02:07:01,960\nthat agent service that starts.\n\n2305\n02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:06,780\nThat agent is what talks to the NAP\nservice on the NAP servers.\n\n2306\n02:07:06,780 --> 02:07:12,010\nAnd so the NAP servers call out to\nthe little NAP agent on our PC and\n\n2307\n02:07:12,010 --> 02:07:16,860\nsay, hey, I need to get an update\non what is going on with this PC.\n\n2308\n02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:21,294\nSo that agent gathers all the information\non this client PC and hollers back and\n\n2309\n02:07:21,294 --> 02:07:24,786\nsays, all right, well,\nwe've got our antivirus updates,\n\n2310\n02:07:24,786 --> 02:07:26,751\nwe got all of our Windows updates.\n\n2311\n02:07:26,751 --> 02:07:28,010\n>> Right.\n\n2312\n02:07:28,010 --> 02:07:29,880\n>> But\nwe don't have our firewall turned on.\n\n2313\n02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:33,330\nAnd according to Health Policies\nthat are set up, it's like okay,\n\n2314\n02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:36,830\nwell, we require that firewall turned on.\n\n2315\n02:07:36,830 --> 02:07:37,895\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n2316\n02:07:37,895 --> 02:07:41,568\nstick you in this remediation network with\nall the other unhealthy, not unhealthy.\n\n2317\n02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:44,192\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The non compliant PCs.\n\n2318\n02:07:44,192 --> 02:07:45,725\n>> Right.\n>> Until you can get that firewall\n\n2319\n02:07:45,725 --> 02:07:46,333\nturned back on.\n\n2320\n02:07:46,333 --> 02:07:49,658\nAnd then once it's turned on,\nthen that agent will then\n\n2321\n02:07:49,658 --> 02:07:54,930\ncall back out to the net service and say,\nhey, we've met all the requirements.\n\n2322\n02:07:54,930 --> 02:07:57,250\nI'm now in compliance.\n\n2323\n02:07:57,250 --> 02:08:01,890\nSo, then he gets moved back over, and\nwith the full number of network access.\n\n2324\n02:08:01,890 --> 02:08:03,390\n>> Right.\n>> Pretty sweet stuff.\n\n2325\n02:08:03,390 --> 02:08:04,000\n>> It is.\n\n2326\n02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,330\n>> It's pretty awesome.\n\n2327\n02:08:05,330 --> 02:08:12,300\nIt, a lot of little setup, a lot of little\npieces, I mean it's just really awesome.\n\n2328\n02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:15,540\nYou set it up for I mean, yeah.\n\n2329\n02:08:15,540 --> 02:08:16,420\nAnyhow.\n\n2330\n02:08:16,420 --> 02:08:17,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n2331\n02:08:17,170 --> 02:08:18,710\nVPNs.\n>> Pretty sweet stuff.\n\n2332\n02:08:18,710 --> 02:08:19,710\n>> Yeah.\n\n2333\n02:08:19,710 --> 02:08:20,670\n>> All right.\n\n2334\n02:08:20,670 --> 02:08:26,130\nWell, we've got one last little bit to\ngo over on our remote networking stuff.\n\n2335\n02:08:26,130 --> 02:08:29,260\nThat is the idea of published apps.\n\n2336\n02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:30,490\nPublished apps, right?\n\n2337\n02:08:30,490 --> 02:08:33,270\nSo we do have a type of publish app,\nright?\n\n2338\n02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:35,210\nCalled remote app.\n\n2339\n02:08:35,210 --> 02:08:39,250\nThis remote app, once again we set it\nup on the server side of things in our\n\n2340\n02:08:39,250 --> 02:08:43,760\nother show, so get an idea of\nhow to set it up in a test lab.\n\n2341\n02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:48,310\nOn the client side,\nnot really a whole lot of setup.\n\n2342\n02:08:48,310 --> 02:08:53,750\nOn that part there is a setting where\nwe can go and configure that stuff.\n\n2343\n02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:55,540\n>> Now, a lot of times,\n\n2344\n02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:57,840\nthere's two particular technologies\nthat we're mentioning right now.\n\n2345\n02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:01,530\nWe've already talked about one of\nthem in a previous episode here.\n\n2346\n02:09:01,530 --> 02:09:04,630\nWe've talked about the idea\nof using WIndows XP mode,\n\n2347\n02:09:04,630 --> 02:09:09,560\nwhich is essentially is a virtual machine\nthat's running inside of Windows 7 for us.\n\n2348\n02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:13,190\nThat if I have an older application that\ndoesn't meet the ideal compatibility.\n\n2349\n02:09:13,190 --> 02:09:15,190\nIn other words,\nit doesn't run on Windows 7,\n\n2350\n02:09:15,190 --> 02:09:19,130\nI can then install it\nin this XP mode here.\n\n2351\n02:09:19,130 --> 02:09:24,290\nAnd that allows that particular program to\nrun inside the context of Windows XP, but\n\n2352\n02:09:24,290 --> 02:09:27,720\nreally just look like another\napplication inside of windows 7, okay.\n\n2353\n02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:29,810\nSo, that's one way where we can do it.\n\n2354\n02:09:29,810 --> 02:09:31,150\nBut there are times though,\n\n2355\n02:09:31,150 --> 02:09:33,550\nespecially since we're talking\nabout the idea of mobility,\n\n2356\n02:09:33,550 --> 02:09:37,830\nthat what we might have is an application\nthat is running inside of our network.\n\n2357\n02:09:37,830 --> 02:09:40,750\nAnd here I am, I'm again travelling for\nmy company and\n\n2358\n02:09:40,750 --> 02:09:43,480\nI need access to that picker application.\n\n2359\n02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:45,970\nSo that means the infrastructure\nhas already been set up for\n\n2360\n02:09:45,970 --> 02:09:48,030\nus internally in our network here.\n\n2361\n02:09:48,030 --> 02:09:51,170\nAnd it may be that all I need to do is\nmake sure that I can connect to that\n\n2362\n02:09:51,170 --> 02:09:52,680\npicker application.\n\n2363\n02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:56,590\nWell if you go to my machine, inside of\nthe control panel here, I went ahead and\n\n2364\n02:09:56,590 --> 02:09:58,080\nchanged our view.\n\n2365\n02:09:58,080 --> 02:10:01,420\nInstead of the standard\ncategory view by default,\n\n2366\n02:10:01,420 --> 02:10:04,140\nI've changed it to the large icon view.\n\n2367\n02:10:04,140 --> 02:10:08,879\nAnd you'll see a link right here that\nsays RemoteApp and Desktop Connections,\n\n2368\n02:10:10,210 --> 02:10:14,620\nand when I click on that, you'll see there\nno current connections actually on and\n\n2369\n02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:18,270\nall I have to do on the left hand side\nis set up a new connection with a remote\n\n2370\n02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:20,130\napp in desktop connections.\n\n2371\n02:10:20,130 --> 02:10:24,310\nAnd most of these servers are actually\ngoing to be connected again,\n\n2372\n02:10:24,310 --> 02:10:26,750\nthrough a particular web server.\n\n2373\n02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:29,550\nThat's then going to allow them\nto bring up that particular app.\n\n2374\n02:10:29,550 --> 02:10:30,100\nOkay?\n\n2375\n02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:32,730\nSo that application is how\nwe would normally do that.\n\n2376\n02:10:32,730 --> 02:10:36,650\nSo if you hear the term remote app or\npublished app, that's more than likely\n\n2377\n02:10:36,650 --> 02:10:39,225\nwhat they're talking about here\nin the context of Windows 7.\n\n2378\n02:10:39,225 --> 02:10:39,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2379\n02:10:39,930 --> 02:10:40,540\n>> Yep.\n\n2380\n02:10:40,540 --> 02:10:44,820\n>> Yep, now and\nonce this connection URL is typed in and\n\n2381\n02:10:45,970 --> 02:10:50,904\nthat connection is made,\nyou will be greeted with a pop up that\n\n2382\n02:10:50,904 --> 02:10:56,200\nhas these different published\napps that are in there.\n\n2383\n02:10:56,200 --> 02:11:03,050\nThese are apps that you can download or\nrun locally on your machine,\n\n2384\n02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:07,800\nor it can stream out from that\nremote app server out there.\n\n2385\n02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:08,790\nPretty sweet stuff.\n\n2386\n02:11:08,790 --> 02:11:11,490\n>> It is.\nPretty awesome way, now Ronnie what\n\n2387\n02:11:12,510 --> 02:11:16,720\nkind of situations or\nscenarios would we want to publish and\n\n2388\n02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:20,670\nthat rather than let's say\ninstall it on everybody's PC's?\n\n2389\n02:11:20,670 --> 02:11:24,120\n>> There's a couple of different scenarios\nhere, but the main one is simple, right?.\n\n2390\n02:11:24,120 --> 02:11:29,092\nIs that a lot of times if we go install\nthat application directly on that pic or\n\n2391\n02:11:29,092 --> 02:11:32,120\nlaptop, and laptop gets broken or\nstolen or taken away, right?\n\n2392\n02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:35,650\nThat particular application\nis now out there and\n\n2393\n02:11:35,650 --> 02:11:39,380\nthen somebody again is now\nusing this app unlicensed.\n\n2394\n02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:45,140\nSo if we do have softlinks incredibly lets\nsay costly more than anything else, right?\n\n2395\n02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:48,230\nSomething that should not be\nduplicated over and over again,\n\n2396\n02:11:48,230 --> 02:11:53,260\nwhat we may instead do is we again publish\nit so it's actually controlled inside.\n\n2397\n02:11:53,260 --> 02:11:56,700\nWhen I do that, that means it's not out\nthere even if this computer gets lost or\n\n2398\n02:11:56,700 --> 02:11:59,340\nstolen it is now controlled\nfrom the inside.\n\n2399\n02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:02,500\nI can see how many people are connecting,\nI can monitor the licensing,\n\n2400\n02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:04,180\nI can actually do all\nthe updates from there.\n\n2401\n02:12:04,180 --> 02:12:05,980\nI don't have to worry\nabout troubleshooting this\n\n2402\n02:12:05,980 --> 02:12:08,440\nparticular computer with\nthat application as well.\n\n2403\n02:12:08,440 --> 02:12:11,750\nTheres a lot of different little scenarios\nthat you might choose to use with this.\n\n2404\n02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:17,600\n>> You know licensing, tracking licensing\nI didn't think about that bit there.\n\n2405\n02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:18,320\nThat's a good one.\n\n2406\n02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:20,840\nI was thinking more along\nthe lines of updating.\n\n2407\n02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:21,600\n>> Yeah updating.\n\n2408\n02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:23,740\n>> Updating the application.\n\n2409\n02:12:23,740 --> 02:12:28,700\nInstead of going out to everybody's PC\nthere's some software you can push out\n\n2410\n02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:32,985\nthrough group policy and\nassign out that way.\n\n2411\n02:12:32,985 --> 02:12:33,690\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2412\n02:12:33,690 --> 02:12:38,430\n>> But to go around to everybody's PC and\ninstall it can be a bit of a challenge.\n\n2413\n02:12:38,430 --> 02:12:42,731\nTo keep versioning control,\ncompatibility issues,\n\n2414\n02:12:42,731 --> 02:12:47,497\nthose sorts of things,\njust host it on one central server and\n\n2415\n02:12:47,497 --> 02:12:52,838\nallow others to connect to it and\nmanage to use that software there.\n\n2416\n02:12:52,838 --> 02:12:53,889\n>> Alright.\n\n2417\n02:12:53,889 --> 02:12:58,586\n>> Alright, Ronnie,\nwe've covered quite a few\n\n2418\n02:12:58,586 --> 02:13:01,630\nbits of technology today\n>> Yep\n\n2419\n02:13:01,630 --> 02:13:03,860\n>> We've got good old direct access,\n\n2420\n02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:05,380\nVPN connections there.\n\n2421\n02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:10,410\nThe first part that we touched on.\n\n2422\n02:13:10,410 --> 02:13:12,850\nI scrolled back up.\n\n2423\n02:13:12,850 --> 02:13:16,010\nWe were in here.\n\n2424\n02:13:16,010 --> 02:13:18,440\n>> There you go.\n\n2425\n02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:19,070\n>> Yep.\n\n2426\n02:13:19,070 --> 02:13:22,970\nGood old BitLocker and BitLocker To Go so\nwe can secure our machines and\n\n2427\n02:13:22,970 --> 02:13:23,820\nlock that stuff down.\n\n2428\n02:13:23,820 --> 02:13:24,850\nData recovery agent.\n\n2429\n02:13:24,850 --> 02:13:28,950\nWe can add a person in there that can\nthen go and unlock our drives for\n\n2430\n02:13:28,950 --> 02:13:31,260\nus just in case.\n\n2431\n02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:33,770\nAnd a good old offline files,\n\n2432\n02:13:33,770 --> 02:13:36,830\nthat way we can work with those documents\nwhile we're away from the network.\n\n2433\n02:13:36,830 --> 02:13:40,570\nAnd even if somebody else works with those\ndocuments while we're away, we do have\n\n2434\n02:13:40,570 --> 02:13:45,500\nthat conflict to control so that we know\nwe can make sure that nobody's papers or\n\n2435\n02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:51,320\nanything get's overwritten and\nthen with all of our great VPN stuff.\n\n2436\n02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:52,840\nPretty rocking.\n\n2437\n02:13:52,840 --> 02:13:53,390\n>> Yeah.\n\n2438\n02:13:53,390 --> 02:13:54,730\nIt's a lot of technology.\n\n2439\n02:13:54,730 --> 02:13:55,400\n>> Yep.\n\n2440\n02:13:55,400 --> 02:13:58,770\nAlright, Ronnie anything else\nto add as we wrap this up?\n\n2441\n02:13:58,770 --> 02:13:59,560\n>> I don't think so.\n\n2442\n02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:01,565\nI don't think we should\nadd anymore probably.\n\n2443\n02:14:01,565 --> 02:14:02,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We've done enough\n\n2444\n02:14:02,470 --> 02:14:03,940\ntoday\n>> Yeah.\n\n2445\n02:14:03,940 --> 02:14:05,980\n>> In that show\n>> Yeah so\n\n2446\n02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:08,740\nif any of these technologies look good.\n\n2447\n02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:10,270\nOnce again jump on over\nto our server show.\n\n2448\n02:14:10,270 --> 02:14:12,900\n>> Right\n>> Set everything up on the server side,\n\n2449\n02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:17,520\ndefinitely a great way to get these\ntechnologies ingrained into your mind,\n\n2450\n02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:20,390\nto set these things up and\nthere's a lot of steps,\n\n2451\n02:14:20,390 --> 02:14:23,260\na lot of components a lot of\nthings that can go wrong.\n\n2452\n02:14:23,260 --> 02:14:26,180\nSo it gives you the opportunity\nto do a lot of trouble shooting.\n\n2453\n02:14:26,180 --> 02:14:31,970\nOnce you get into the troubleshooting we\nreally get into the meat of things and\n\n2454\n02:14:31,970 --> 02:14:33,780\nfind stuff out.\n\n2455\n02:14:33,780 --> 02:14:36,590\nAlright, if you ever have any\nquestions during the show,\n\n2456\n02:14:36,590 --> 02:14:40,910\nbe sure to jump in on our live page,\nwe have a chat box

morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening.\n\n5\n00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:37,340\nWelcome to another\nITProTV Windows 7 episode for us.\n\n6\n00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,130\nWe are actually in the world of\nmonitoring and maintaining and\n\n7\n00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,430\nI am here with the Windows\n7 Update Master, Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,151\nHow's it going Wes?\n\n9\n00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:48,546\n>> It's going okay.\nThanks for having me back again.\n\n10\n00:00:48,546 --> 00:00:50,221\n>> Yeah?\n>> Yes sir.\n\n11\n00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:53,620\n>> How was that last Lewis Ferret\nconcert which I can't say\n\n12\n00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,234\n>> Oh that's okay, but\n\n13\n00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:55,504\nit's better than the Miley Cyrus concert.\n\n14\n00:00:55,504 --> 00:00:57,003\n>> Oh yeah?\n>> Much better, much better.\n\n15\n00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:57,879\n>> Well at least that's what I hear.\n\n16\n00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:58,461\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n17\n00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:02,950\n>> So, in terms of since those particular\nconcerts are probably a little bit out of\n\n18\n00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,740\nour particular dates here.\n\n19\n00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,150\nWe want to go into the world\nof the idea of monitoring and\n\n20\n00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,130\nmaintaining Windows 7 is\nwhat we want to actually do.\n\n21\n00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,240\nAnd so we'll be covering several topics\nin this particular series of episodes for\n\n22\n00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,790\nus as we go through.\n\n23\n00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,470\nSo, what we wanna do is make sure that we\nunderstand, that the very fact is after we\n\n24\n00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,960\ninstall Windows 7, after we begin some of\nthe initial configuration of Windows 7,\n\n25\n00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,600\nand understanding\nthe networking concepts here.\n\n26\n00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,830\nWe still have to ensure that the operating\nsystem will continue to function,\n\n27\n00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,180\nwill continue to run, not only in a single\nenvironment in terms of a home user, but\n\n28\n00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,110\nalso in an enterprise environment as well.\n\n29\n00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,290\nAnd so, one of the key aspects that\nyou and I have to do in today's world,\n\n30\n00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,370\nof course, is to insure that we\ncan update the actual computers.\n\n31\n00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,320\nNot only again as a regular home user but\n\n32\n00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,940\nthis time as a network\nsupport technician too.\n\n33\n00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,620\nSo we're gonna get a bit in depth into the\nidea of the Windows update for Windows 7.\n\n34\n00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,280\nAnd then we're gonna talk about\nthe idea of maintaining and\n\n35\n00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,550\nmanaging our hard drives as well.\n\n36\n00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,170\nOkay.\n\n37\n00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,760\nSo let's go ahead and talk about\nthe idea of Windows Updates, Wes, for\n\n38\n00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,560\na moment here okay?\n\n39\n00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,830\n>> Sure.\n>> Now in terms of updates, Wes,\n\n40\n00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,560\nat one time we used to actually\nthink the idea of actually updating\n\n41\n00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,230\nwas just to actually update the actual\nWindows, or the operating system.\n\n42\n00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,040\nIf there was nothing wrong with it,\n\n43\n00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,570\nin other words if everything was\nfunctioning fine, we didn't update.\n\n44\n00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,390\n>> Right.\n\n45\n00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,070\n>> So, you had this idea,\nthe school of thought that,\n\n46\n00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,470\nhey if it works don't break it.\n\n47\n00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,711\n>> Right.\n>> But, what about today?\n\n48\n00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:32,629\nAre updates still that important or are\nthey actually even more important today.\n\n49\n00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:33,648\n>> Yeah.\nI don't think we\n\n50\n00:02:33,648 --> 00:02:35,990\ncan have reactive updates\nlike you're describing.\n\n51\n00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,570\nWe have to have proactive updates.\n\n52\n00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,870\nAnd when you really look at it, right now\nin the news, you think of Heartbleed.\n\n53\n00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,840\nYou think of what is the Internet Explorer\nbugs that are out there, vulnerabilities.\n\n54\n00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,894\nSo, we're really seeing right now in\ntoday's day and age, in the media it's in\n\n55\n00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:54,709\nour face that hey, you need to close\noff these potential vulnerabilities,\n\n56\n00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,762\nthese functionality flaws that can lead\nto someone taking over your computer and\n\n57\n00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,753\nthen doing whatever they want with it.\n\n58\n00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:04,694\nSo, I would say even more so\ntoday you see like a focus,\n\n59\n00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:07,360\na generalized focus and a scramble.\n\n60\n00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,280\nWe know XP's life cycle\njust came to an end, and\n\n61\n00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,480\nnow we realize exactly how\nimportant updates are when\n\n62\n00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,550\nthey're no longer supported,\nso, yeah, it's very important.\n\n63\n00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,950\n>> Yeah, so for\nus here the idea of updates say,\n\n64\n00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,740\nare more really security focused than they\nare to again fix a lot of broken problems.\n\n65\n00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,305\nDon't get me wrong, they do fix problems,\nbut because we actually do have a lot more\n\n66\n00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:31,835\nsecurity updates, it's more important in\nthis day and age especially since we're so\n\n67\n00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:35,265\nconnected that you and\nI have a great understanding of this.\n\n68\n00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:38,105\nEspecially if we're gonna\nbe supporting Windows 7 in\n\n69\n00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:40,265\nan actual business environment.\n\n70\n00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:44,145\nSo we wanna make sure that we understand\nhow to do this on an individual machine by\n\n71\n00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:45,215\nmachine basis.\n\n72\n00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:46,775\nAnd then we'll talk also talk\nabout it a little bit in\n\n73\n00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,610\nthe context of actually supporting it.\n\n74\n00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,450\nAs a desktop support technician or\n\n75\n00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,200\nsomeone supporting Windows 7 in\na business environment as well, okay.\n\n76\n00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,820\nSo, Wes, let's go ahead and\n\n77\n00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,750\njump right in to this idea of some\nof the things we actually have to do\n\n78\n00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,270\nwhich is the idea of configuring the way\nWindows 7 actually does updates for us.\n\n79\n00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,790\n>> Sure.\n\n80\n00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,160\nNow, as we've talked\nabout in other episodes,\n\n81\n00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,740\nthere's multiple ways to get\nto just about any utility.\n\n82\n00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,010\nAnd you're gonna need\nto know multiple ways.\n\n83\n00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,570\nOne of the ways that I usually go through\nWindows update, I use the Control Panel.\n\n84\n00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,370\nYou go into the Control Panel, and\nyou have your basic interface.\n\n85\n00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,890\nSo if we go to the Control Panel\nby pushing Start here,\n\n86\n00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,970\nwe go to Control Panel, and\nif you're in the category view here,\n\n87\n00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,740\nit's System and Aecurity.\n\n88\n00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,620\nAnd you'll see right here, Windows Update.\n\n89\n00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,890\nNow, on this computer,\nI don't think I'm being proactive.\n\n90\n00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,680\nI think I'm waiting for it to be attacked.\n\n91\n00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,720\nI think I'm asking for trouble here.\n\n92\n00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,690\nSo this machine here doesn't\nhave any updates on it.\n\n93\n00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,300\nAnd you can see, even checking for\nupdates isn't enabled, so\n\n94\n00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,430\nthe very first thing I need to do,\nis probably enable that.\n\n95\n00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,480\nVery easy, we can click the button here,\nor you have the jump links over here, so\n\n96\n00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,380\neither or would work.\n\n97\n00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,040\nWe go on about checking the updates, now\nit's going to take a little bit for it to\n\n98\n00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,820\nreach out, to its location here, that\nwe're going to talk about here, coming up.\n\n99\n00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,500\nBut it's gonna check Microsoft right now.\n\n100\n00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,260\nAnd we were talking about this\none kind of before the break.\n\n101\n00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,200\nThis is redundancy at its best.\n\n102\n00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,390\nSo Windows Update needs\nan update before you can update.\n\n103\n00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,156\n>> That's it, yeah.\n\n104\n00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:21,000\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n>> I guess we're gonna go ahead and\n\n105\n00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,250\nupdate the updater.\n\n106\n00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,870\n>> Yep.\n>> [LAUGH] And what that's gonna do for\n\n107\n00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,830\nis it's gonna require us to close the\nWindows update down and then restart it.\n\n108\n00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,970\nThe good old reboot.\n\n109\n00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,640\n>> Yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,030\nIn terms of actually making sure\nthat we start setting this up right.\n\n111\n00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,760\nFor a regular home user, normally when\nWindows 7 comes on the actual machine,\n\n112\n00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,520\nthe automatic updates are turned on.\n\n113\n00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,130\nIn other words,\n\n114\n00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,120\nas soon as you install it, actually even\nduring the installation, your machine\n\n115\n00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,470\ncan be receiving updates if that option\nis actually already picked out for us.\n\n116\n00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,730\nSo that way, during the install you\nare getting the latest updates, and\n\n117\n00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,250\nthen when it starts here,\nyou're not actually now having to wait for\n\n118\n00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,910\nlike 170 updates if it's been awhile since\nyou reinstalled that particular machine.\n\n119\n00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,680\nSo, you can actually have some of the\ndifferent settings that we actually have\n\n120\n00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,405\nand we're going to take a look at\nthose settings in just a moment.\n\n121\n00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:14,005\n>> Okay, so, we'll go ahead and\nlet's do a check for updates and\n\n122\n00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:19,860\noops it's going to require a restart so\nyou gotta love the legendary reboot.\n\n123\n00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,380\nSo a lot of times, some of these updates,\n\n124\n00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,690\nespecially if they are actually\ngonna require restart they tell you.\n\n125\n00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,040\nThe good thing is in Windows 7 though what\nthey try to do from previous versions of\n\n126\n00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,480\noperating systems is again reduce\nthe number of times you have to restart.\n\n127\n00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,690\nIt used to be in older operating systems\nwhen you actually installed an update\n\n128\n00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,810\nyou actually ended up kind of\nrestarting multiple time in a row.\n\n129\n00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,800\nAnd so for certain businesses here what\nthat actually led of course is the idea of\n\n130\n00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,790\nbusinesses having to again or\nindividuals in businesses working, and\n\n131\n00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,060\nthen right in the middle of doing\nsomething it may have actually updated and\n\n132\n00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,920\nthen it will require a restart.\n\n133\n00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,210\nAnd it could actually if they\naccidentally clicked on restart now and\n\n134\n00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,840\nthey're in the middle of something\nthey could have lost all their work.\n\n135\n00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,630\nSo Windows has actually been\nfairly proactive in saying look,\n\n136\n00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,720\nwe're gonna only really require\nthe idea of restarting the computer\n\n137\n00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,710\nif it absolutely needs a restart for\nthat particular update.\n\n138\n00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,450\nBut for us here,\n\n139\n00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,880\nthat one actually needed a restart,\nand are back up and ready to go?\n\n140\n00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,720\n>> I think we're ready to go.\n\n141\n00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720\nWe're gonna try one more time.\n\n142\n00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,940\nWe're gonna try to check for updates, and\nif you want, while we are checking for\n\n143\n00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,120\nupdates we can start talking about\nthe settings and the background.\n\n144\n00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,840\n>> Yep, let's do it.\n\n145\n00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,380\n>> All right, well, we have a series\nof settings that you can configure, and\n\n146\n00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,660\nyou can see a few categories here.\n\n147\n00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,370\nOne of the biggest categories,\nimportant updates,\n\n148\n00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,540\nthis is gonna define what's gonna\nhappen to the update, if anything.\n\n149\n00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,610\nAre you gonna reach out to Microsoft?\n\n150\n00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,570\nAre you gonna pull those updates down?\n\n151\n00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,200\nAnd if so, when you do download them,\n\n152\n00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,150\nwhat are you going to do with them\nafter they're already downloaded.\n\n153\n00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,470\nNow the recommended, based on that choice\nwhen you install the operating system that\n\n154\n00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,970\nturns on Windows updates,\nsays, go ahead and\n\n155\n00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,920\ninstall them automatically and\ndon't wait for me to approve them.\n\n156\n00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,500\nJust go ahead and if you think it\nneeds taking care of, take care of it.\n\n157\n00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,510\nAnd that's always a good setting,\nset up forget it.\n\n158\n00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,900\n>> Yeah, and for\nus this is the default update.\n\n159\n00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,570\nRight?\n\n160\n00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,088\nWhen you see this and it first comes on,\n\n161\n00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:06,740\nyou normally see where it tells you it's\ngonna install the updates automatically.\n\n162\n00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,750\nAnd it normally sets it at 3 AM,\nevery day.\n\n163\n00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,120\nSo most users at home, they're gonna be\nperfectly fine with this bigger setting.\n\n164\n00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,900\nAnd you're not gonna actually ever worry\nabout somebody needing to change it,\n\n165\n00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,560\nunless there are some other situations.\n\n166\n00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,850\nAnd so\nMicrosoft has left different scenarios for\n\n167\n00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,100\nus that we might choose from.\n\n168\n00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,480\n>> Yes, definitely.\n\n169\n00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,790\nSo in the first one like Ronnie says,\nthat's gonna be the default.\n\n170\n00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,240\nWe got the second one here though.\n\n171\n00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,660\nIt says download the updates, but\n\n172\n00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,480\nnow I'm gonna choose whether\nI want to install them.\n\n173\n00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,680\nIn the past,\nI've had problems with video drivers.\n\n174\n00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,620\nAnd I have chose to opt out of\nWindows update video drivers and\n\n175\n00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,820\ngone right to the manufacturer.\n\n176\n00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,370\nNow, you don't have to do that.\n\n177\n00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,810\nBut if you're like me, I like to go to\nthe manufacturers cuz drivers for video,\n\n178\n00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,810\nthey update so quick.\n\n179\n00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,470\nSo I might do a setting like this.\n\n180\n00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,200\nI might say, go ahead and download them.\n\n181\n00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,810\nAnd then, give me a list and let me pick\nand choose which ones I gonna download or\n\n182\n00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,862\ninstall, excuse me.\n\n183\n00:08:57,862 --> 00:08:58,400\n>> Yeah.\n\n184\n00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,815\nA lot of times, as long as you\nhave hard drive space for this.\n\n185\n00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:05,475\nYou may not want it interrupting you while\nyou're in the middle of doing something.\n\n186\n00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:08,245\nSo it could be that the machine does\nneed to restart and just sits there and\n\n187\n00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:11,785\ntells you, I'm gonna restart in five\nminutes or ten minutes or postpone it, or\n\n188\n00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,172\nwhatever it might be.\n\n189\n00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:15,822\nBut for us to be able to do this,\nwe might actually just go ahead and\n\n190\n00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:19,682\ndownload it, and then we go in and\nchoose which ones we want.\n\n191\n00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:23,642\nSo the only limitation that we have here,\nof course, is actually the size,\n\n192\n00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:26,150\nmost of us today, have hard drives\nthat are big enough to handle it.\n\n193\n00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,680\nWe don't worry about it, but I remember in\nthe days of 10 gigabyte hard drives with\n\n194\n00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,020\nolder operating system like Windows XP,\nwhere you might actually see that you only\n\n195\n00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,050\nhad like 2 gigs free, and you actually\ndownload like 256 megs of updates.\n\n196\n00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,320\nWell if you did that, well again\nyou're starting to eat away at that.\n\n197\n00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,250\nSo this one for us here, if hard drive\nspace is not at a premium at this point,\n\n198\n00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,500\nyou can do this and then pick and\nchoose which ones you wanna install.\n\n199\n00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,402\n>> Definitely, definitely.\n\n200\n00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:55,210\nNow, maybe you wanna be a little\nbit more selective in that.\n\n201\n00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:59,340\nMaybe if you are for instance,\nworried about accruing hard drive space,\n\n202\n00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,450\nbecause maybe it's limited,\nmaybe the capacity happens to be,\n\n203\n00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,980\nand it's kinda rare today,\nbut maybe it happens there.\n\n204\n00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,525\nWell then, I might want just a listing.\n\n205\n00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:09,270\nAnd I get a listing that I connect to and\nI don't actually download them, but\n\n206\n00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,790\nI pick and choose what I want before\nthey come across the wire and\n\n207\n00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,760\ncome back to my computer.\n\n208\n00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,300\nAnd then from there I can choose\nwhich ones I want to install.\n\n209\n00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,640\nA little bit more flexibility and\ncontrol in that.\n\n210\n00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,590\n>> Yeah, this one normally just\nprovides for us a list, right?\n\n211\n00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,450\nIt's like a shopping list, we can\nscan through the list of updates, and\n\n212\n00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,160\nthen individually choose which\nones we really do want to update.\n\n213\n00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,220\nNow, once again, if your hard drive\nis already full at this point or\n\n214\n00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,440\npretty close, you may not to download\nthe entirety of every update that you can.\n\n215\n00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,700\nSo again, you can say, hey, let me try and\njust download these two and\n\n216\n00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,910\nthen install them and then continue to\nmove forward at that particular point.\n\n217\n00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,500\nSo that's another great option for\nus as well.\n\n218\n00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,560\n>> Sure.\n\n219\n00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,900\nWe got a few other categories in here\nwhere we configure the settings.\n\n220\n00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,760\nWe've got this one that's\nkinda hidden here.\n\n221\n00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,460\nAnd that's when, the timing, the timeframe\nwhen you want to install your updates.\n\n222\n00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:02,090\nAnd keep in mind,\noff hours by default it's 3 AM, every day.\n\n223\n00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,960\nAnd they typically do that because\nthey don't figure anybody's gonna be\n\n224\n00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,630\nworking on a computer or working with\na computer with a lot of business software\n\n225\n00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,260\nwhere they have to worry\nabout an interruption.\n\n226\n00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,750\nBut that might not be\nsomething that you can afford.\n\n227\n00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,580\n>> Yeah, and depending on\nthe situation that you're in write.\n\n228\n00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,960\nEven tough it's set to 3 AM, everyday.\n\n229\n00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,430\nWhat if you're backing p\nyour computer at 3 AM?\n\n230\n00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,800\n>> Yeah, good point.\n>> You get the option now,\n\n231\n00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,030\nto be able to change\nthe actual time there.\n\n232\n00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,992\nGo ahead and\nclick on that drop down for me Dave-\n\n233\n00:11:25,992 --> 00:11:27,425\n>> Okay, sure.\n\n234\n00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:28,845\n>> So that we can see some\nof the options that we have.\n\n235\n00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:29,425\n>> We should do that, sure.\n\n236\n00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:33,877\n>> So if we're actually faced with a\nscenario that we know that we're gonna be\n\n237\n00:11:33,877 --> 00:11:38,751\nrunning again, a backup on Sunday, or\nFriday, we may actually choose, instead\n\n238\n00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:43,950\nto actually install a baits about once\na week here, instead of every single day.\n\n239\n00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,840\nOr we can change the timing of it,\ndepending on what we want here.\n\n240\n00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,930\nSo do take a look at\nsome of those options.\n\n241\n00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,350\nThe scenarios are actually fairly normal.\n\n242\n00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,900\nIn which yes,\n\n243\n00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,040\nyou find out that your update is running\nat the same time that backup is.\n\n244\n00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,850\nYou may want to change that, so\nyou have other options here.\n\n245\n00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,770\nNow Wes, we actually had one\nmore option in that drop down.\n\n246\n00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,307\nThat Ron makes sure that-\n>> That's true we do.\n\n247\n00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:04,999\n>> Yeah.\n\n248\n00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:06,668\n>> That's the one that-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n249\n00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:08,084\n>> We avoid at all costs.\n\n250\n00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:09,730\n>> Right.\n>> Right, yes.\n\n251\n00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,360\n>> Microsoft says, never recommended here.\n\n252\n00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,855\nNow, as long as your computer is never\ngoing to connect to another computer.\n\n253\n00:12:16,855 --> 00:12:18,345\n[LAUGH] I know this sounds strange.\n\n254\n00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:19,905\nNever connect to another computer.\n\n255\n00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,705\nNever connecting to the Internet.\n\n256\n00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:25,061\nWes is not gonna bring his possibly\nquestionable thumb drive and plug-\n\n257\n00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:25,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n258\n00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,875\n>> It into my computer.\n\n259\n00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:32,185\nI don't ever really have to worry about or\nknow or actually obtain these updates.\n\n260\n00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,795\nMost of the time though,\nthis is actually a bad idea.\n\n261\n00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,755\nSo even though you can do it, Microsoft\ngives you that option because you\n\n262\n00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:40,290\nbought the actual operating system,\nwell here you go.\n\n263\n00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,070\nYou can actually never check for\nupdates as well, okay?\n\n264\n00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,380\nSo it's possible,\nnot ever recommended here.\n\n265\n00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,690\nNow, notice the category that\nthis is located in though.\n\n266\n00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,160\nMicrosoft recognizes there are actually\ndifferent categories of updates for\n\n267\n00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,390\nus, and\nthis is under the important updates.\n\n268\n00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,070\nNow, generally we actually\nsay important means what?\n\n269\n00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,300\nReally necessary,\nit's not the idea of well,\n\n270\n00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,580\nmaybe if I feel like it,\nnormally is something that's important.\n\n271\n00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,227\nAnd usually that means their\nprice security related or\n\n272\n00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:11,881\na big functionality has\nsomehow actually gone wrong.\n\n273\n00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:14,540\n>> Yeah, definitely and\nI can just, think of right now.\n\n274\n00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,560\nThey talk about the exploit\nthat's been in the IE browsers.\n\n275\n00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,630\nThat would probably fall\nunder an important one,\n\n276\n00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,469\nit might be one that we don't wanna miss.\n\n277\n00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,239\n>> Yup.\n\n278\n00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:26,530\n>> Now, the one thing that I\nwas also thinking about this,\n\n279\n00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,210\nyou notice this is everyday at 3 AM.\n\n280\n00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,010\nWhat if, I'm on a metered bandwidth?\n\n281\n00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:30,514\n>> There you go.\n\n282\n00:13:30,514 --> 00:13:32,920\n>> What if I have a limited bandwidth\nover the course of a month?\n\n283\n00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,401\nMaybe I don't want it checking every\n\n284\n00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:35,187\nsingle day-\n>> Right.\n\n285\n00:13:35,187 --> 00:13:36,110\n>> Outbound to Microsoft.\n\n286\n00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:42,150\nAgain, maybe cuz I would rather be, I\ndon't know, watching a Miley Cyrus video.\n\n287\n00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,990\n>> That's right.\n\n288\n00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,710\nYeah.\n>> And that download might hinder that.\n\n289\n00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,220\n>> Yeah.\nAnd again,\n\n290\n00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,590\nchoosing that other option that\nwe were talking about here.\n\n291\n00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,522\nThe idea that you're only downloading\nwhat you necessarily need.\n\n292\n00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:53,220\n>> That's right.\n\n293\n00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,930\n>> And be ready to go on, a particular day\ninstead, so just make sure you take a look\n\n294\n00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,200\nat those options depending on\nthe situation that you're in.\n\n295\n00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,360\nA lot of times businesses will actually\ncontrol this, so that they can update\n\n296\n00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,650\neverybody at one time or\nmay again be scheduled at different times.\n\n297\n00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,500\nSo they don't overwhelm the actual\nnetwork at some points in time as well.\n\n298\n00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,810\nSo remember, important updates really\ndo mean important and they do mean for\n\n299\n00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,558\nyou to actually run them.\n\n300\n00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:18,175\n>> Yes, yeah-\n>> Yeah.\n\n301\n00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:19,910\n>> Most definitely.\n\n302\n00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,380\nAll right, so the next section we\nhave in here is recommended updates.\n\n303\n00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,890\nNow, again with recommended updates,\nit could be important.\n\n304\n00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,390\nIt could be a functionality fix.\n\n305\n00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,690\nBut it does give you the option to say\nwell, you might be able to forget these.\n\n306\n00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,550\nBut you really have to pay\nattention to the details,\n\n307\n00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,230\nwhich we're gonna show you how to do.\n\n308\n00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,450\nAnd really do your research to make sure,\nyou don't wanna just blindly say, well,\n\n309\n00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,460\nif it's recommended and I don't really\nneed it, I'm not gonna install it.\n\n310\n00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,100\nBecause there might be some kind\nof update that comes out within\n\n311\n00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,370\nthe recommended updates that you look at.\n\n312\n00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,170\nYou say well, maybe it fixes\nthe functionality on the Touchpad.\n\n313\n00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,075\nBut it's again, not something\nthat's crucial to your system.\n\n314\n00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:53,599\n>> Right.\n\n315\n00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,300\n>> May be hardware specific.\n\n316\n00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,950\n>> Yeah, a lot of times, remember that\nWindows also works with hardware vendors\n\n317\n00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,620\nto also supply updates for you.\n\n318\n00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,460\nSo instead of you having to go out\nto the individual hardware vendor,\n\n319\n00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,890\na lot of times they might work with\na manufacturer such as Dell to actually,\n\n320\n00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,760\npush out updates for\nindividual components instead.\n\n321\n00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,590\nAnd that way your machine can get them\nthrough one source instead of you having\n\n322\n00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,170\nto go through multiple sources.\n\n323\n00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,480\nWhen you do take a look at\nthese important updates.\n\n324\n00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,190\nMake sure you do take a look at them\nin terms of what you actually need, and\n\n325\n00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,070\nthen choose whether or\nnot you're gonna install it.\n\n326\n00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,230\nThese are definitely not as\ncritical as the important ones.\n\n327\n00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,422\nBut you may actually see some\nfunctionality that you actually were\n\n328\n00:15:31,422 --> 00:15:33,417\nrunning, and it's not working as well.\n\n329\n00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,844\nSome of these updates\nmay actually help you.\n\n330\n00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:37,210\nYep.\n>> Definitely.\n\n331\n00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,550\nThe next category that we have here is,\nwho can install?\n\n332\n00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,580\nWho can install updates?\n\n333\n00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,190\nRemember that most updates,\n\n334\n00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,570\nespecially with drivers,\nthey need writable access to the registry.\n\n335\n00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,908\nSo they need to make modifications to the\ncore functionality of the operating system\n\n336\n00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,958\nand they also need to make some changes\nto potentially key security settings.\n\n337\n00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,830\nSo it's going to require some\nadministrative level of functionality and\n\n338\n00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,085\nwhat you're saying here is if they've\ndownloaded, can anybody install them?\n\n339\n00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:04,860\nCan an administrator install them?\n\n340\n00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,900\nCan Ronnie install them if\nhe's the standard user there?\n\n341\n00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,558\nSo, we're just basically saying\nadministrators versus standard users I\n\n342\n00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:12,820\nbelieve here.\n\n343\n00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,550\n>> Yep.\n\n344\n00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,240\nSo a lot of times these pick\nour options for us, right?\n\n345\n00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,350\nWe don't really have to worry about\nthem as an individual home user.\n\n346\n00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,000\nBut when it comes down to us working\nas a port technician though,\n\n347\n00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,530\nit may be asked of us\nto configure them for\n\n348\n00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,270\nthe need of the network that we're\nsupporting or for the individual user.\n\n349\n00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,890\nSo, we've got to know how to get here,\n\n350\n00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,930\nwe've got to know how to change\nthese settings when we need to.\n\n351\n00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,430\nAnd we've got to know the difference\nbetween the recommended and\n\n352\n00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,770\nthe actual important updates as well.\n\n353\n00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:46,150\nSo those particular configurations\nare down there, when we take a look.\n\n354\n00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,730\nNow notice if that if we actually selected\nwhat we wanted to, down in the lower right\n\n355\n00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,810\nhand corner of this particular window,\nis actually that OK button.\n\n356\n00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,970\nAnd when you take a look at that,\nnotice there's that shield there.\n\n357\n00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:03,380\nWhich tells you they really want the idea\nof that administrative process here.\n\n358\n00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,780\nIn other words, you're making a change to\nthe computer's operating system in terms\n\n359\n00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,820\nof the updates.\n\n360\n00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,520\nAnd they wanna make sure that you are\nsupposed to be making these changes here.\n\n361\n00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,790\nSo, it gives you that option right there,\ntoo.\n\n362\n00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,490\nYep.\n\n363\n00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,010\n>> The last category falls under boring.\n\n364\n00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:17,790\n>> It does.\n\n365\n00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,282\n>> This is about as fun as\nreading an end-user agreement.\n\n366\n00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:21,170\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n367\n00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,590\n>> Which we all read, but\n\n368\n00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:27,530\nif you do have to worry about privacy,\nyou can read their privacy statement.\n\n369\n00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,350\nAnd again, not so fun there.\n\n370\n00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,100\n>> Yeah.\n\n371\n00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:36,580\nSo, a lot of times, remember that the way\nthat the updates are actually designed.\n\n372\n00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,380\nIs to remember that they don't want\nto actually just reboot the computer.\n\n373\n00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,620\nJust because an update started.\n\n374\n00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,010\nThat used to be the standard procedure.\n\n375\n00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,120\nYou update your computer.\n\n376\n00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,670\nReboot it and\nmake sure that everything comes back in.\n\n377\n00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:51,720\nSo to make it much more productivity\nfriendly, they only actually\n\n378\n00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,620\nrestart if that particular update has\na need to actually do the restart here.\n\n379\n00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,370\nSecondly, we have tons of different\nchoices that we can actually do in\n\n380\n00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,780\nterms of the scheduling.\n\n381\n00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,830\nAnd how much we want to actually\ndownload at one time and install.\n\n382\n00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,310\nOr do we want the system\nto take care of it for us.\n\n383\n00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:07,940\nOkay?\n\n384\n00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,490\nAnd of course it gives us those options\nagain where Microsoft may work with\n\n385\n00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,430\nother vendors or may even bring\nin more additional functionality.\n\n386\n00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,680\nAgain, maybe not as critical\nas an important update.\n\n387\n00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,050\nI do the recommended updates as well.\n\n388\n00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,660\nNow Wes,\nwe've talked about the idea of how we can\n\n389\n00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,580\nbasically configure the individual\ncomputer here, okay?\n\n390\n00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,290\n>> Sure.\n\n391\n00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,560\n>> But when I think about this,\n\n392\n00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,760\nwhere are we actually connecting\nto to get these updates?\n\n393\n00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,590\n>> That's a good question here.\n\n394\n00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,070\nNow we've got a couple of options here and\n\n395\n00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:42,620\nby default the first option is you're\ngonna go out to Windows update servers.\n\n396\n00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,800\nAnd every update that you download from\na Windows update server is gonna be\n\n397\n00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,710\ndigitally signed so you can insure\nthat it'll be coming from Microsoft.\n\n398\n00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,600\nAnd when you install the file, it's not\ngoing to cause some kinda corruption,\n\n399\n00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,880\nit's not going to be a virus,\nand it's not going to mix and\n\n400\n00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,900\nmingle if you will with the kernel and\ncause problems for the operating system.\n\n401\n00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,030\nSo that's the first place by\ndefault I believe that we would\n\n402\n00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,660\nsee in here that we would connect to.\n\n403\n00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,180\n>> Okay.\n\n404\n00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,620\nSo everybody on the planet then\nconnects essentially to Microsoft's\n\n405\n00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,300\nupdate servers, right.\n\n406\n00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,490\nSo when we have this everybody's\nconnecting to Microsoft's update servers,\n\n407\n00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,180\nit sound like that's gotta be a huge\ninfrastructure to ensure that it can\n\n408\n00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,420\nhandle everything.\n\n409\n00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,700\nNow, when we do this as home users,\n\n410\n00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,900\nit's not really a big deal until you\nactually think that everybody's computer,\n\n411\n00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,970\nlet's say,\nin the United States is set at default.\n\n412\n00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,560\nThey're connecting all at 3 AM, but\nremember in different time zones.\n\n413\n00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,660\nSo again, it's kinda staggered, but\n\n414\n00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,110\nit's still a big type of connection\nthat they're actually having to handle.\n\n415\n00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,260\nBut what if in my environment though Wes,\n\n416\n00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,310\nwhat I actually need is even though I need\nthose updates I've known in the past from\n\n417\n00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,070\nmy experience that on certain operating\nsystems even though they're identically\n\n418\n00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,670\nconfigured here, certain updates ran\nfairly well, other updates failed.\n\n419\n00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,760\nIs there another place that I\ncan get these updates from?\n\n420\n00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,900\n>> Yeah, if you look down here\nat the bottom of the base or\n\n421\n00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,630\nthe default page of Windows Update.\n\n422\n00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,040\nYou can actually go out and\ndownload pretty much updates for\n\n423\n00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,720\nevery single Microsoft product\nthere is installed on your system.\n\n424\n00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,530\nNow when you do this, we talk about\nmaybe considering metered bandwidth,\n\n425\n00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,700\nyou're gonna increase\nthe amount of updates.\n\n426\n00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,380\nWhich should make sense\nif you've downloaded for\n\n427\n00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,240\nevery single Microsoft Product,\nunder the planet.\n\n428\n00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,250\nSo you will increase,\nthe amount of updates that are here.\n\n429\n00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,300\nBut at the same time,\nit's kinda like that one stop shop,\n\n430\n00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,870\nthat says well why should we\ngo into Microsoft Office, and\n\n431\n00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,360\nchoose a setting in there,\nwhich says check for updates.\n\n432\n00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,960\nWe're already here,\nwe're already checking for\n\n433\n00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,700\nWindows updates, this gives you\nthe option to go ahead, and check for\n\n434\n00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,800\nevery product under the sun,\nthat Microsoft.\n\n435\n00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,980\n>> Yeah.\n\n436\n00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,870\nSo we essentially have\nMicrosoft's updates,\n\n437\n00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,260\nyou may also have Windows updates just for\nthe operating system itself.\n\n438\n00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,810\nBut in a business environment,\n\n439\n00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,330\na lot of times we also want\nto control these updates too.\n\n440\n00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,890\nSo when we do that we might\nalso set up and infrastructure,\n\n441\n00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,780\nwhich we'll talk about\nin a little bit here.\n\n442\n00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,190\nBut at this point here just realize that\nthere are actually some different sources\n\n443\n00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,210\nfor updates.\n\n444\n00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,970\nMost of the time when we connect\nusing the idea of the Windows update.\n\n445\n00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,080\nAnd you see that right on top of that\nyellow bar there where it says Windows\n\n446\n00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,960\nupdates, we're really talking about again\nupdating the operating system itself.\n\n447\n00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,840\nNow, Wes did mention that I might\nhave other Microsoft products.\n\n448\n00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,810\nLet's say that I have an installed\nan Office product like Word,\n\n449\n00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,510\na word processing program.\n\n450\n00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,650\nBy going to those other Microsoft\nproducts, they may have a specific update\n\n451\n00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,820\njust for Word that may actually\ncome out through that or\n\n452\n00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,610\na lot of times I can actually see it\nthrough those optional updates here.\n\n453\n00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,310\nNow, Wes,\nit looks like that you've actually\n\n454\n00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,980\ngot just a few updates that haven't\nactually been installed yet here.\n\n455\n00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,665\n>> Yeah, quite a few.\n\n456\n00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:41,980\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, in terms of actually us doing this,\n\n457\n00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,180\nduring the time that we've been talking,\nWes's computer has done what?\n\n458\n00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,080\nWell, it again,\n\n459\n00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,590\nonce we turned on the automatic updates,\nit's reached out to Microsoft.\n\n460\n00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,610\nAnd when we reached out to Microsoft,\nMicrosoft was able to evaluate this\n\n461\n00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,980\npick of computer and see what updates were\nmissing from the operating system here.\n\n462\n00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,970\nAnd Wes, it looked like you\nmissed 152 important updates.\n\n463\n00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,919\n>> We're just a bit outside by one.\n\n464\n00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,570\n>> About half a gig of updates,\nto tell you the truth.\n\n465\n00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,500\n>> That's true, that's true.\n\n466\n00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,210\nSo I'd like to take a real quick second\nhere and just show you how you can\n\n467\n00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,090\nidentify the version of the Window's\nupdate system that you have.\n\n468\n00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:20,210\nAnd you can do that by\nnavigating down into C: here.\n\n469\n00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,160\nApparently I'm setting up a home\ngroup here in the background.\n\n470\n00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,870\nYou can navigate into C: then\nif you go from C: > Windows.\n\n471\n00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:34,240\nYou can scroll down in here to, actually,\nI believe it's right in Windows.\n\n472\n00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,685\nAnd you're going to want to check for\nwuapi.\n\n473\n00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:40,243\n>> I think you're in the right\n>> Right before it- [CROSSTALK]\n\n474\n00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:41,745\n>> And there we go.\n\n475\n00:22:41,745 --> 00:22:42,295\n>> There it is.\n\n476\n00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:44,775\n>> And you don't want the mui here.\n\n477\n00:22:44,775 --> 00:22:46,435\nWe want this one right here.\n\n478\n00:22:46,435 --> 00:22:50,885\nAnd that's your Windows Update\nApplication Programming Interface deal.\n\n479\n00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:53,350\nAnd if you right-click on that and\nchoose Properties.\n\n480\n00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:59,170\nYou're gonna see up here there's\na Details button tab and\n\n481\n00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,209\nthis'll show you the current version of\n\n482\n00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:07,984\nthe update client here,\nthe AP update client.\n\n483\n00:23:07,984 --> 00:23:14,851\nNow I guess we get to go in and\nlook and see how far behind I truly am.\n\n484\n00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,500\n>> So let's take a look at this\ninterface right here, okay.\n\n485\n00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,950\nSo notice on the left hand side we\nhave two different tabs for us.\n\n486\n00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,160\nAnd clearly the 152 updates there,\n\n487\n00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,340\nnotice that the majority of them at this\npoint all have the word security in them.\n\n488\n00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:30,980\nOkay?\n\n489\n00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,730\nSo if that doesn't tell you\nanything that there's only one\n\n490\n00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:39,940\nthat doesn't look like a security at least\nin that list that we see on the screen.\n\n491\n00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,300\nWhich is that third one down.\n\n492\n00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,340\nBut notice that every\nsingle one at that point\n\n493\n00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,970\njust about looks like a security update.\n\n494\n00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,580\nI'm not gonna tell you\nevery one of them is, but\n\n495\n00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,370\nthe majority of the ones you missed Wes.\n\n496\n00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,130\n>> I was gonna say.\n\n497\n00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,383\n>> Are all security updates,\nyou forgot some yeah.\n\n498\n00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:56,870\n>> So apparently I need to disconnect this\ncomputer completely from the network.\n\n499\n00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,333\n>> Yeah, so.\n\n500\n00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:02,150\n>> And the one that wasn't,\nI guess is still technically security.\n\n501\n00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,800\nWindows Defender and the MRT.\n\n502\n00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,440\nYeah.\n\n503\n00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,560\nAnd there were a few that were up there\na little bit earlier, but that's fine.\n\n504\n00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,660\nSo, for us here, we see why these are\nactually listed as important updates here.\n\n505\n00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,770\nNow, go ahead and click on the optional so\n\n506\n00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,926\nthat we can also take\na look at that as well.\n\n507\n00:24:14,926 --> 00:24:16,167\n>> Sure, I can do that.\n\n508\n00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:19,800\n>> So, remember that these are the two\ncategories now in Windows 7, right?\n\n509\n00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,030\nWe have important and we optional for us.\n\n510\n00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,390\nSo, here in the optional updates you\nactually see where there's an update to\n\n511\n00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:32,480\nthe Windows 7 64-bit platform\nupdate that you have.\n\n512\n00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,545\nAnd well, look at that, you can actually\nadd in the Bulgarian language pack.\n\n513\n00:24:36,545 --> 00:24:38,280\n>> I was going for, was it Croatian?\n\n514\n00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,200\n>> Yeah, Croatian, Czech.\n\n515\n00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,080\nAnd all these different\nother language packs for us.\n\n516\n00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,440\nWe actually needed them as well.\n\n517\n00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,410\nNow, a lot of times you may need them.\n\n518\n00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,540\nMost of the time, I'm probably not\ngoing to need every single one of them.\n\n519\n00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,080\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n520\n00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,760\n>> It is what we have here.\n\n521\n00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,820\nSo, a lot of different updates for\nus are actually available.\n\n522\n00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,920\nAnd so when Windows goes in,\n\n523\n00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,870\ndoes the automatic updates, looks\nlike we got every single one of them.\n\n524\n00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,590\n>> And again, with a metered bandwidth,\nlike Ronnie pointed out, if you really\n\n525\n00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:09,691\nlook at the amount of updates that are in\nthis, we're talking about half a gig.\n\n526\n00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:15,620\n[LAUGH] .If you only have so\nmany gigs per month that you can connect\n\n527\n00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:21,150\nto the internet, you might want to\nconsider, I don't know, staging these.\n\n528\n00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,950\n>> Yeah,\n>> Prioritizing?\n\n529\n00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,400\n>> Yeah, again just doing some every day\nmight actually end up working out for you.\n\n530\n00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,570\nRather than downloading\nthem all at a time.\n\n531\n00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,119\nOkay, all at one time for us.\n\n532\n00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:33,998\nSo, it does actually work out for us here.\n\n533\n00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:38,710\nAll right, so, Wes let's talk about\nthe idea of how, now that we've downloaded\n\n534\n00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:43,100\nthem, it says download and install,\nbut notice it hasn't installed yet.\n\n535\n00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,810\n>> That's right.\n\n536\n00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,720\n>> Now, if I click on that big\nblue button over on the right-hand\n\n537\n00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,500\nside with the shield on it,\nwhat does it install?\n\n538\n00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,860\n>> It is going to install probably every\nsingle one of these updates in the list.\n\n539\n00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,030\n>> Yeah.\nBy default right?\n\n540\n00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,853\n>> Normally,\nwhen we saw it at the very beginning,\n\n541\n00:25:57,853 --> 00:25:59,191\nI noticed that you unchecked them.\n\n542\n00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,346\nBut if we can go back\ninto that bigger list.\n\n543\n00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:03,388\n>> There you go.\n\n544\n00:26:03,388 --> 00:26:05,120\n>> Click, yeah, there you go.\n\n545\n00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,110\nUnless it's changed it back, it could.\n\n546\n00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,129\nNotice that every single\none of them is checked,\n\n547\n00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:12,097\nbecause it believes every single one\nof these are actually important.\n\n548\n00:26:12,097 --> 00:26:15,593\nBut what if I wanted to install just,\nlet's do a couple of them here.\n\n549\n00:26:15,593 --> 00:26:16,892\n>> Okay, okay, sure.\n\n550\n00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:20,677\n>> The very first thing we can do is click\nthe name field here once, if you will.\n\n551\n00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:24,433\nAnd that little check box there,\nadd a checkmark and then take it out and\n\n552\n00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:26,192\nwe can start to select which one.\n\n553\n00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:30,550\n>> Let's do that first one there.\n\n554\n00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,430\nAnd let's do that Internet Explorer one.\n\n555\n00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,020\n>> Okay, sure, we can do that.\n\n556\n00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,550\nWe'll say okay to this.\n\n557\n00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,720\nOh, that's, that amount,\nsee I can handle that amount.\n\n558\n00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,005\n>> Yep.\n>> That's a big difference.\n\n559\n00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:42,130\nWe'll go ahead and install it.\n\n560\n00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,840\n>> Let's see what happens.\n\n561\n00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,750\n>> And we'll click install.\n\n562\n00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,780\nYep.\n\n563\n00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,071\n>> And go ahead and click on that view.\n\n564\n00:26:48,071 --> 00:26:49,535\nI don't know if it brings\nyou back to the same page.\n\n565\n00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:50,590\nIt does.\n\n566\n00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:55,315\nSo, notice now that it actually tells us\nhow it's installing, how it's running.\n\n567\n00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:58,882\nAnd it will also, in a moment,\ntell us whether or\n\n568\n00:26:58,882 --> 00:27:02,550\nnot we need to reboot\nthe actual computer as well.\n\n569\n00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:06,050\nSo, our first particular section\nhere that we've taken a look at is\n\n570\n00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:09,690\nthe idea of talking about the need for\nthe idea for updates here.\n\n571\n00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,650\nAlso the basic configuration for them, and\nwe've now manually chosen to just install\n\n572\n00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,970\na few updates instead of letting\nthem all install at one time.\n\n573\n00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,780\nWe're gonna take our break now and\n\n574\n00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,720\nthen we're gonna talk about how we can\ntake a look at verifying that they've been\n\n575\n00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,460\ninstalled as well as possibly even getting\nrid of an update if we don't need it.\n\n576\n00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,450\nOkay.\n>> Sounds good.\n\n577\n00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,372\n>> All right.\nLet's go ahead and take a break and\n\n578\n00:27:31,372 --> 00:27:32,688\nwe'll be back after this.\n\n579\n00:27:32,688 --> 00:27:40,200\n[MUSIC].\n\n580\n00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,759\nAll right, welcome back as we continue\non talking about the idea and\n\n581\n00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:46,020\nthe world of Windows updates here.\n\n582\n00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,182\nWe've went ahead and\nwe now installed just a couple of updates,\n\n583\n00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:53,525\nnot all 152 of them, so that we can\nat least do this demo for us here.\n\n584\n00:27:53,525 --> 00:27:56,345\nSo, let's go back and\nsee what we're actually up to now, Wes.\n\n585\n00:27:56,345 --> 00:28:00,055\n>> All right,\nnow we have installed this update and\n\n586\n00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:03,152\nyou'll notice that Ronnie said earlier\nsome of these are gonna require a restart.\n\n587\n00:28:03,152 --> 00:28:06,332\nWell, we just happen to, I guess,\npick the right chamber here.\n\n588\n00:28:06,332 --> 00:28:07,772\nAnd boy, it clicked.\n\n589\n00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:09,342\n>> Yeah.\nThe nice thing is, remember,\n\n590\n00:28:09,342 --> 00:28:15,142\nnotice the warning where it says Windows\ncan't update important files and\n\n591\n00:28:15,142 --> 00:28:18,322\nservices while the system is using them.\n\n592\n00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:21,972\nSo, save any open files and\nthen restart the actual computer.\n\n593\n00:28:21,972 --> 00:28:26,180\nNow, a lot of times for us, if we don't\ndo this,it will tell us that it needs to\n\n594\n00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,520\nrestart at some point, and\nyou'll get this kind of unusual, but\n\n595\n00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,420\nannoying window in the lower\nright hand corner for us.\n\n596\n00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,140\nAnd it's not showing up yet\ncuz we haven't done this yet.\n\n597\n00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,865\nBut if we leave it long enough, it's\ngonna show up and going to tell you, hey,\n\n598\n00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:42,805\nwe're going to restart this computer\nin ten minutes or whatever it is.\n\n599\n00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,805\nAnd then you'll have to go in there and\nmanually tell it to wait or\n\n600\n00:28:45,805 --> 00:28:47,205\nto do everything else here.\n\n601\n00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:51,722\nSo, Wes, go ahead and\nselect the Restart Now.\n\n602\n00:28:51,722 --> 00:28:55,837\nSo, while we're actually restarting\nthis particular machine here.\n\n603\n00:28:55,837 --> 00:29:00,617\n[LAUGH]\n>> What's interesting, look at there, it\n\n604\n00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:03,872\nsays, Windows Update needed to close, even\nthough it told me to restart the machine.\n\n605\n00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,002\n>> Yeah.\n\n606\n00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:10,716\n>> All right, so,\nlet's go ahead and force it.\n\n607\n00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,280\n>> We're living on the edge.\n\n608\n00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,150\nThat's okay, we're living on the edge.\n\n609\n00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:18,150\n>> So, while we're actually taking\na look at the idea of updates for us.\n\n610\n00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,630\nRestarting again is an important part\nof it, especially if it needs it here,\n\n611\n00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,080\nthat shouldn't happen every\nsingle update though.\n\n612\n00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,759\nSo, it should only happen\non the very important ones,\n\n613\n00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:31,220\nthat absolutely need to\nreconfigure something.\n\n614\n00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,135\nAnd when it comes back up,\nwe're gonna in and\n\n615\n00:29:34,135 --> 00:29:38,302\nverify that those updates did\nactually install successfully.\n\n616\n00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:42,195\nAnd then we're gonna take a look at being\nable, of course, to get rid of an update\n\n617\n00:29:42,195 --> 00:29:46,280\nif we need to, and we're gonna also talk\nabout the idea of hiding updates too.\n\n618\n00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,330\n>> Yeah, I'd like to just jump in\nhere real quick and if we can show\n\n619\n00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,400\nthat screen right there, you've got to\nbe very careful, one of the things to\n\n620\n00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,230\nkeep in mind is updates is there are\ncertain times you don't wanna do updates.\n\n621\n00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,875\nAnd one of those times is when you run\nthe risk of having a power failure.\n\n622\n00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:02,665\n[LAUGH] So you might not want to be\nperforming updates in an electrical storm,\n\n623\n00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:05,348\nmuch less have your computer\nconnected to anything.\n\n624\n00:30:05,348 --> 00:30:06,380\n>> Right.\n\n625\n00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,040\n>> But be very careful because\ncertain updates, most updates,\n\n626\n00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,030\nyou don't want to interrupt.\n\n627\n00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,480\nAnd if there is a risk that you that\nyou're run of having a power failure,\n\n628\n00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,760\nmight be a better time after that risk\nhas eliminated itself or moved on.\n\n629\n00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,330\n>> Yeah, nice speedy machine here Wes.\n\n630\n00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,170\nIt's still actually configuring\nnow the second update.\n\n631\n00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,940\nSo, a lot of times when you watch this,\n\n632\n00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,080\nnotice that it tells you don't\nturn off your computer right now.\n\n633\n00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,400\nAnd this is what Wes was\nactually referring to.\n\n634\n00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,290\nSo, sometimes you could actually end\nup again corrupting the update and\n\n635\n00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,360\nthat could bring your computer to\na state that you don't want it to be in.\n\n636\n00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,480\nSo again,\npay attention when it does this, okay.\n\n637\n00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,782\nNow this is actually a system\nthat we've gotten used to seeing.\n\n638\n00:30:46,782 --> 00:30:48,575\nI'll tell you the truth,\nthe newer operating sys,\n\n639\n00:30:48,575 --> 00:30:50,183\na little bit annoying\nhow they do the updates.\n\n640\n00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:53,730\nSo, but for us here what we're\nfocusing in on Windows 7.\n\n641\n00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,171\nSo, let's go ahead and\nget back into the Windows updates, and\n\n642\n00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:58,420\nlet's see what else we can have.\n\n643\n00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,320\n>> Control Panel here.\n\n644\n00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,590\nRemember if you're in the Category view,\nit's going under System and Security.\n\n645\n00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:09,540\nWindows update here, and\nnow I'm down to 150.\n\n646\n00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,610\n>> There you go, all right.\n\n647\n00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,700\n>> Okay, we'll save those for\na later and greater date.\n\n648\n00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,090\nTake a look at the view update history.\n\n649\n00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,660\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n650\n00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,960\nwe're gonna do a little of review here.\n\n651\n00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,690\nNow, interestingly enough,\nwe see our updates here ready for us.\n\n652\n00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,620\nWhen you are reviewing update history,\n\n653\n00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,780\nyou might need to see what\nwas involved in this update.\n\n654\n00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,580\nOne of the things that you\ncan into this panel here and\n\n655\n00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,280\ndo, you can actually select\nany one of these updates, and\n\n656\n00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,910\nif you right-click,\nyou've got a couple of options.\n\n657\n00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:45,835\nNow, view details, we'll see this one,\nand we'll see what the view details are.\n\n658\n00:31:45,835 --> 00:31:50,495\nBut, one of the things that I want you to\nkeep in mind is that the copy details,\n\n659\n00:31:50,495 --> 00:31:53,651\nwhat it does is it takes\nthe details of that update and\n\n660\n00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:55,834\nit puts it on the clipboard for you.\n\n661\n00:31:55,834 --> 00:32:03,400\nAnd then what I could do, now this might\nnot be something that you need to do,\n\n662\n00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,603\nbut I could create a text\ndocument here And I can say,\n\n663\n00:32:08,603 --> 00:32:15,640\nI don't know, Windows Update Results,\nand just paste this in here.\n\n664\n00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:21,320\nAnd only for the purposes of,\nmaybe emailing this off to a tech for\n\n665\n00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,156\ninstance, maybe they're doing\nhelp desk support here.\n\n666\n00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:30,660\nAnd apparently, yes, okay.\n\n667\n00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,970\nAnd then I can mail that\nfile off if I wanted to,\n\n668\n00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:39,330\ncuz it's got pretty detailed,\nhere we go, report here.\n\n669\n00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,440\nThe one that we were really looking at,\nthough, is the view details.\n\n670\n00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,080\nAnd when you look at the view details,\nhere, you can get a certain level of\n\n671\n00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,430\ninformation about, what was installed and\nwhy it was installed.\n\n672\n00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,395\nSo, they're telling us here, that you\nknow, for a fluid browser experience,\n\n673\n00:32:54,395 --> 00:32:56,385\nyou should've had this update,\nbecause it's the latest and\n\n674\n00:32:56,385 --> 00:32:58,285\ngreatest thing since sliced bread.\n\n675\n00:32:58,285 --> 00:33:01,695\nAnd then it's easy,\nit's seamless, it has no seams.\n\n676\n00:33:01,695 --> 00:33:04,295\nAnd then last, it makes it safer,\n\n677\n00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:07,895\nwhich I would probably say that's one\nof the main reasons we wanted it.\n\n678\n00:33:07,895 --> 00:33:08,665\n>> Right\n>> But,\n\n679\n00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:11,170\nyou can also get more information here.\n\n680\n00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:15,700\nBy going out to the knowledge base,\nand reading more behind the individual\n\n681\n00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,360\nupdate was for, and\nhow it applies to your system.\n\n682\n00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,610\n>> All right.\n\n683\n00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,190\nSo, now that we have these\nupdates in place, and\n\n684\n00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,570\nwe can actually see what\nthey've been installed for.\n\n685\n00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:31,780\nYou hate to say it, even though updates\nare incredibly important, if you've been\n\n686\n00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:36,900\nusing that computer system for awhile,\nyou may find out after an update,\n\n687\n00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,260\nthat things don't work as well for\nyou, as you think that they should.\n\n688\n00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:45,510\nSo, a lot of times it's also important to\nnot only be able to view the installed\n\n689\n00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:50,980\nupdates here, but also be able to back\nout of an update, if we need to as well.\n\n690\n00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,790\nSo Wes, let's take a look at that option.\n\n691\n00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,800\nWe may do it,\ncuz it's gonna ask us to restart again.\n\n692\n00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,403\nBut we can at least talk\nabout where it's gonna go.\n\n693\n00:33:56,403 --> 00:33:57,550\nWe can do that now.\n\n694\n00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,290\nYou're gonna notice, and\n\n695\n00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,530\nI just wanna go back to this console here,\nwe have no options.\n\n696\n00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:05,390\nWe don't have a single option in here\nabout rolling back, if you will.\n\n697\n00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,500\nKinda like we talk about in other\nepisodes, rolling back drivers,\n\n698\n00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,170\nwe have no option in here that says\njust roll back this installation.\n\n699\n00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,980\nYou actually have to go to\na different location here, and\n\n700\n00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,100\nwe're gonna go back down to Programs and\nFeatures.\n\n701\n00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,550\nSo we push the Start button here,\ngo back to Control Panel, and\n\n702\n00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,450\nI just wanna leave this one open.\n\n703\n00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,680\nI could have done it in that window here.\n\n704\n00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,430\nAnd then go to Programs.\n\n705\n00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,960\nYou'll notice that there's\na program in Features here.\n\n706\n00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,240\nNow we go here to turn features on,\n\n707\n00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,370\nlike our remote administration kits,\nand stuff like this.\n\n708\n00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:36,000\nBut we also have the view\ninstalled updates here.\n\n709\n00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,770\nWe go to the view install updates.\n\n710\n00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,980\nI was gonna say, I hope it's here.\n\n711\n00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,830\nGonna see some updates.\n\n712\n00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:45,455\nNow, what I'd like to show you here real\nquick, is how many updates did I install?\n\n713\n00:34:45,455 --> 00:34:47,285\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I only installed three.\n\n714\n00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:47,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n715\n00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,290\n>> But remember what the setting was.\n\n716\n00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:52,830\nInstall recommended updates automatically.\n\n717\n00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,160\nSo even though it gave me a list,\n\n718\n00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,480\nthere are some in the background\nthat it said, you know what?\n\n719\n00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,460\nYou told us to install these,\ncuz we recommended them, and\n\n720\n00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,330\nthat's what they did here.\n\n721\n00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,840\nSo let's go to the Internet Explorer 11,\nthe one that we just seen her.\n\n722\n00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,120\nAnd if I right click on it,\njust like uninstalling a program,\n\n723\n00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,460\nI get the ability to\nnuinstall this update.\n\n724\n00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,670\nNow keep in mind, drastic,\nyou might have to do a system restore.\n\n725\n00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,520\nThis is probably the first\nplace you wanna go.\n\n726\n00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,990\nIf it locks you out of your system, and\n\n727\n00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,200\ncauses just irreversible damage, you\nmight have to go into system restoration.\n\n728\n00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,740\nBut that's for another episode here.\n\n729\n00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,190\nWe're gonna say,\nwell maybe we didn't like that.\n\n730\n00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,300\nWe didn't like that update.\n\n731\n00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,885\n>> Now let's just go ahead and do no for\nright now, cuz we know that that one's\n\n732\n00:35:32,885 --> 00:35:34,439\ngonna cause a [CROSSTALK]\n>> A restart.\n\n733\n00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:35,250\nOkay, yeah. Sure, sure. >> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n734\n00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,520\n>> So yeah, let's choose another one.\n\n735\n00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,409\nLet's choose Windows Hot Fixes.\n\n736\n00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:39,650\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Choose one of the Hot Fixes.\n\n737\n00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,500\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay, we'll do that.\n\n738\n00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,020\nSure.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n739\n00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,040\n>> We'll do an uninstall.\n\n740\n00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,174\n>> And this probably gonna cause\nus to restart [CROSSTALK].\n\n741\n00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,180\n>> That's okay.\n\n742\n00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,160\nNow, the reason why we wanna mention this,\nright, is that sometimes,\n\n743\n00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,580\nin a particular business\nenvironment that you actually have,\n\n744\n00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,520\nyou may find out that an update\nreally does cause problems there.\n\n745\n00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,420\nGo ahead and restart that.\n\n746\n00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,470\n>> Okay.\n>> We'll talk about the issue that we're\n\n747\n00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,300\ntalking about.\n\n748\n00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:00,800\nRight?\n\n749\n00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,920\nSo in our environment,\nwe actually did have this.\n\n750\n00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,300\nAnd I think Nate is the one that\nactually discovered this for us here.\n\n751\n00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:12,680\nWhen a browser went to update, all of\na sudden our Picker Line of Business App,\n\n752\n00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,895\nabsolutely just wouldn't function,\nor work.\n\n753\n00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:15,415\nOkay?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n754\n00:36:15,415 --> 00:36:16,713\n>> So what we had to do, and\n\n755\n00:36:16,713 --> 00:36:17,925\nNate's over there smiling about it.\n\n756\n00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:21,315\nBut what we had to do,\nis actually roll back the actual update,\n\n757\n00:36:21,315 --> 00:36:23,455\nto ensure that we got\nthe earlier version browser, so\n\n758\n00:36:23,455 --> 00:36:26,175\nit could actually work with\nour line of business app.\n\n759\n00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:26,900\nOkay?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n760\n00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:31,190\nSo sometimes knowing which update we\nactually need to go ahead and rollback,\n\n761\n00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:36,630\nand uninstall, is as important as actually\nupdating the actual computer itself.\n\n762\n00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,100\nSo you've got to make sure that\nyou know where to do this.\n\n763\n00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,400\nAnd know what updates are actually being\napplied in a a business environment ,is\n\n764\n00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,110\nhighly critical for us.\n\n765\n00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,290\nAnd a home user, maybe not so much.\n\n766\n00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,170\nBut remember if you're\nworking with that computer.\n\n767\n00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,098\nAnd now you lose functionality,\nsome of the work isn't right.\n\n768\n00:36:51,098 --> 00:36:53,450\nCheck out and\nsee what's changed since last time.\n\n769\n00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,630\nNormally, if anything,\nit's going to these updates.\n\n770\n00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,130\nSo, take a look at each one,\nin the way that Wes kind of showed you,\n\n771\n00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,280\nthat you could hover over them,\nand actually see some details.\n\n772\n00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,160\nYou might find out it is affecting\nthe program you're talking about, or\n\n773\n00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,205\nthat function that you're talking\nabout as well, to be able to do so.\n\n774\n00:37:07,205 --> 00:37:10,325\n>> Sure, and another place that you\ncan look, a little bit more verbose,\n\n775\n00:37:10,325 --> 00:37:12,065\nmaybe not quite as easy to read.\n\n776\n00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:19,715\nIs if we navigate down here into Windows,\nwe can go to computer, then local disk C.\n\n777\n00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:24,825\nAnd if we navigate into Windows, let's see\nif I can find that Windows update log.\n\n778\n00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,340\nWindows, got to love the search field,\nthere we go.\n\n779\n00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,775\nOh, it disappeared.\n\n780\n00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:32,276\nThere we go.\n\n781\n00:37:32,276 --> 00:37:37,490\nWe'll double-click this,\nand like I said, not so\n\n782\n00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:43,150\nintuitive on the log itself,\nbut it mentions everything.\n\n783\n00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:48,280\nRight down to the unique identifier,\nthat identifies the installation itself.\n\n784\n00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,710\nWhat version of the installation.\n\n785\n00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,480\nWas it digitally signed?\n\n786\n00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,785\nAnd of course they're\nall digitally signed.\n\n787\n00:37:51,785 --> 00:37:56,600\nBut priority in these, so\nIt's kind of verbose, but\n\n788\n00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,720\nif you really need to figure out what's\ngoing on, and the general level reviews\n\n789\n00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,250\ndon't give you the information, you might\nbe able to find it in here as well.\n\n790\n00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:07,306\nSo just remember\nC:/Windows/Windowsupdate.log.\n\n791\n00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:08,690\n>> There you go, okay.\n\n792\n00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,670\nNow there's also other features for\nus too, right?\n\n793\n00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:14,670\nThis is the way that you and\nI can actually point and\n\n794\n00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:18,660\nclick to configure these settings\nthat we've been looking at.\n\n795\n00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,770\nBut what if you're\nsupporting a lot of users,\n\n796\n00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:26,490\nagain hundreds of users or\neven thousands of users here?\n\n797\n00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:29,320\nWell, what we can actually\ndo is actually configure it,\n\n798\n00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,710\nthrough what we call the idea\nof group policy, for\n\n799\n00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:36,410\nus to be able to instead\nactually program this thing out.\n\n800\n00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:41,120\nAnd have those actually apply to those\nhundreds, or the thousands of users, or\n\n801\n00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,810\ncomputers, on our network instead.\n\n802\n00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,730\nSo we wanna take a look at\nthe way that we do that, as well.\n\n803\n00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,600\nOkay?\nSo anything else here, Wes,\n\n804\n00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,630\nthat we need to take a look at?\n\n805\n00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,840\n>> Oh, let's see here.\n\n806\n00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,260\nNo, the only thing I can think of is,\nmaybe hiding updates.\n\n807\n00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:55,930\n>> Oh, yeah, that's right.\n\n808\n00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,590\nI forgot.\n>> So about the only thing I think that we\n\n809\n00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,810\ndidn't do here is\n>> Hiding an update.\n\n810\n00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,550\nNow if you remember,\n\n811\n00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,980\nwhen we were talking we have, well let's\nget back into this crazy list here.\n\n812\n00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,040\nAnd we're going to go\nto the optional ones.\n\n813\n00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,770\nI don't want to see this whole list.\n\n814\n00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,170\nMaybe I don't know these languages,\nI don't speak Dutch, I don't speak Czech.\n\n815\n00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,900\nI really don't want these.\n\n816\n00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,720\nSo what I'm going to do here is I'm\ngoing to do a shift click here.\n\n817\n00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,870\nI'll put a check mark in the first one,\nhold down the shift key, and\n\n818\n00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:25,740\nselect the last one.\n\n819\n00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,050\nAnd then what I can do is I\ncan right click on these, and\n\n820\n00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,020\nI can choose hide updates.\n\n821\n00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,240\nNow, when I do that, the next time\nWindow's updates searches, or\n\n822\n00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,580\nI should say Windows Update Client\nsearches the Windows Update Servers.\n\n823\n00:39:40,035 --> 00:39:40,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n824\n00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,490\n>> I have to do this a lot with, if you're\nrunning an enterprise level edition,\n\n825\n00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:46,450\nyou'll always get these language packs,\nand they get kind of annoying.\n\n826\n00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:51,430\nYou're like, well, I didn't want to have\n158 downloads, I only wanted to have 150.\n\n827\n00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,680\nSo I come in here and hide them.\n\n828\n00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,250\nAnd you could see that they're hidden,\nif I uncheck this, I believe.\n\n829\n00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,125\nMaybe.\n\n830\n00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:02,708\n>> Yeah.\n\n831\n00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:03,583\n>> Now hopefully.\n\n832\n00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:05,542\nI probably just hosed it up.\n\n833\n00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:09,020\n>> Yeah, now you might think that,\nwell that's simple enough.\n\n834\n00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,260\nIt's not gonna show up.\n\n835\n00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,190\nBut the reason why this is very\nimportant is a situation that I\n\n836\n00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,360\nreally mentioned a little bit earlier.\n\n837\n00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,950\nThat particular update that we have for\nupdating the actual browser again\n\n838\n00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,500\ncan cause the same issue with\nour line of business at and\n\n839\n00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,650\nthat happens and\nwe have to actually do this everyday.\n\n840\n00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,890\nWell this means we have to send Nate\nback in everyday to go ahead and\n\n841\n00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,810\nuninstall that update again.\n\n842\n00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,650\nBut instead, by hiding the update\n\n843\n00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:36,745\nit actually allows our machines to\nactually not look for that update.\n\n844\n00:40:36,745 --> 00:40:39,365\nAnd not apply the update as well.\n\n845\n00:40:39,365 --> 00:40:41,695\n>> And let me show, cuz we've still\ngot four optional updates up here.\n\n846\n00:40:41,695 --> 00:40:43,663\nLet me go ahead and\nshow just hiding these as well.\n\n847\n00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:44,238\n>> There you go.\n\n848\n00:40:44,238 --> 00:40:49,036\nWell, I mean it effectively hid\nthe other 30 or whatever it was, 35.\n\n849\n00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,592\nAnd if I hide these two,\nhopefully it won't break it again.\n\n850\n00:40:52,592 --> 00:40:55,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It takes a second here to hide them.\n\n851\n00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,520\nAnd I get impatient faster.\n\n852\n00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,350\n>> Yeah, I was gonna say, yes,\n\n853\n00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,390\nI was actually pointing to\na lot of different stuff there.\n\n854\n00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,561\n>> You can see that there great out here.\n\n855\n00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:04,346\nAnd if I go back to Windows Update,\nit's thinking about it.\n\n856\n00:41:04,346 --> 00:41:09,600\nNow notice I only have 141 updates and\nall the optionals are gone.\n\n857\n00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,720\n>> Yeah.\n\n858\n00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,700\nSo this actually is very important for us,\n\n859\n00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,170\nespecially in the situation here, where\nthat update is causing problems here.\n\n860\n00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,790\nHiding them may be the way to go\nbecause Windows is not gonna stop\n\n861\n00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:22,480\npushing that update,\nthat particular update.\n\n862\n00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,950\nFor us, hiding it is just as\neffective as anything else.\n\n863\n00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,300\n>> Well I just got done\nplugging into the matrix.\n\n864\n00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,060\nAnd just in a few seconds\nI've learned Czech.\n\n865\n00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,810\nNow I've hidden this update.\n\n866\n00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,900\nIt's not gonna show up and bug me anymore.\n\n867\n00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,780\nSo remember there is an option here.\n\n868\n00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,450\nProbably one of the last options\nwe really need to discuss\n\n869\n00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,680\nis restoring a hidden update.\n\n870\n00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:45,583\nSo, maybe if I find out that I've learned,\nlike I said, plugged into the matrix here\n\n871\n00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:49,000\nand I've learned the Czech\nlanguage in a matter of seconds.\n\n872\n00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,190\nSo I choose Restore.\n\n873\n00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,930\nAnd you're gonna see here,\ngive it a second.\n\n874\n00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,800\nAnd of course it's gonna check for\nupdates.\n\n875\n00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,410\nSo we'll see here in a few minutes,\n\n876\n00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:02,330\nthat we should have that one\noptional update back in the list.\n\n877\n00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:06,820\n>> Yeah, right now it's got to go back,\nand now that you've hey find this update,\n\n878\n00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,620\nand it not to download that update,\nand put it back in.\n\n879\n00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,200\n>> That's right.\n\n880\n00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,850\n>> That's gonna take a little\nbit of time when we do it, okay?\n\n881\n00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,392\n>> All right.\n>> So, as we move on here,\n\n882\n00:42:14,392 --> 00:42:18,114\nwe're now talking about what are some\nof the settings that we can actually do\n\n883\n00:42:18,114 --> 00:42:19,820\nthrough group policy.\n\n884\n00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:24,170\nNow even though we're showing this\nthrough our local group policy editors,\n\n885\n00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,960\nthe settings are essentially the same,\nthat we would run inside of\n\n886\n00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,170\nActive Directory inside of the Group\nPolicy Management console as well.\n\n887\n00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,106\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n888\n00:42:33,106 --> 00:42:36,620\ntake a look at some of the settings\nthat we're gonna encounter here.\n\n889\n00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,450\nAnd let's also talk about the context\nof them as we go through and\n\n890\n00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:40,690\nwhat we're pointing them to.\n\n891\n00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,197\n>> Sounds good.\nSo\n\n892\n00:42:41,197 --> 00:42:44,739\nwe're gonna launch up our\nGroup Policy editor here.\n\n893\n00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:48,900\nThat's gpedit.msc.\n\n894\n00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,590\nYou'll see it show up\nhere on the Start menu.\n\n895\n00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,940\nGo ahead and click this.\n\n896\n00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,909\nAnd this is gonna bring up the editor,\nhopefully.\n\n897\n00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:58,299\nThinking about it, it might happen.\n\n898\n00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:01,770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe.\n\n899\n00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:02,270\nAll right.\n\n900\n00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,330\nLet's go ahead and\nexpand out these settings.\n\n901\n00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,060\nNow, we have different settings.\n\n902\n00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,698\nIt depends on what is it that\nwe wanna accomplish here?\n\n903\n00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:14,950\nDo we wanna accomplish this for\nthe entire computer or\n\n904\n00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,010\ndo we wanna do it on\na user-by-user basis and\n\n905\n00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:20,230\nyou've gotta be careful, as you've\nseen in some of the other episodes,\n\n906\n00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,610\nthese settings, you really have to pay\nattention to what settings you are dong\n\n907\n00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:28,220\nhere because you might inadvertently lock\nthe wrong person out of the console.\n\n908\n00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,390\nSo one of the very first things we\ntalk about is a patch management\n\n909\n00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,570\nsolution, right?\n\n910\n00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:37,580\nAs Ronnie mentioned earlier, maybe I don't\nwant 300 computers all connecting out\n\n911\n00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:42,620\nat 3 AM to the Microsoft,\nWindows Updates servers and\n\n912\n00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,590\nmaybe pulling down that one update that\njust crashed the production network\n\n913\n00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,980\nbecause no longer can we use\na lot of business application.\n\n914\n00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,150\nSo what we can do is, we can say,\ndon't go out to Micro, or Windows Update.\n\n915\n00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:57,800\nWe could say look internally,\nto a system if you will, that's gonna\n\n916\n00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,500\nbe managed by a systems administrator,\nand they're gonna selectively approve and\n\n917\n00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,970\ndeny, if you will, what updates, that they\nwant to have applied to their machines.\n\n918\n00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:10,370\nAnd again a patch management system like\nthis is gonna ensure some stability.\n\n919\n00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:13,160\nSo one of the things that\nwe can do is we can go into\n\n920\n00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,460\nAdministrative Templates\n> Windows Components.\n\n921\n00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,485\nWe scroll all the way\ndown to the bottom here.\n\n922\n00:44:20,485 --> 00:44:23,625\nWe've got this container here,\nWindows Update, all right.\n\n923\n00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,735\n>> That's quite a few\ndifferent settings there, Wes.\n\n924\n00:44:25,735 --> 00:44:29,645\n>> There is a few settings here and\nsome of these different settings,\n\n925\n00:44:29,645 --> 00:44:32,665\nthey talk about the Windows\nUpdate Power Management feature.\n\n926\n00:44:32,665 --> 00:44:36,640\nAre we gonna allow Windows Update\nto restart computers.\n\n927\n00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,190\nAre we gonna warn people?\n\n928\n00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:42,600\nOne of the big ones, though,\nhere is this, where is the Internet?\n\n929\n00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,160\nRight there.\n\n930\n00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,970\nThis one right here is\none of the big ones.\n\n931\n00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:49,440\nAnd this is specifying Internet\nMicrosoft Update Service location.\n\n932\n00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,190\nTechnical jargon, for hey, we wanna point\nit to our internal update server and\n\n933\n00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,660\nnot connect outbound at 3\no'clock every day to Microsoft.\n\n934\n00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:02,300\n>> Yeah, now Windows calls this\nthe Windows Services Update Server.\n\n935\n00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,470\nOr Windows Server Update Service,\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n936\n00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:09,725\nThis particular server is what we\nwould set up inside of a business, and\n\n937\n00:45:09,725 --> 00:45:14,395\nthat is the server that would reach\nout to Microsoft and get the updates,\n\n938\n00:45:14,395 --> 00:45:17,965\nagain, downloaded to\nthat type of computer.\n\n939\n00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:22,955\nThen, internally, all of my machines\non the network would actually be able\n\n940\n00:45:22,955 --> 00:45:27,295\nto point there, and be able to retrieve\ntheir updates from that one location.\n\n941\n00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:30,580\nSo instead of every single machine,\nif I have a thousand machines,\n\n942\n00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,250\nreaching out across the Internet at 3 AM,\nthey're really only reaching an internal\n\n943\n00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:38,900\nserver at 3 AM instead, and being able\nto download that as an example, okay?\n\n944\n00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,510\nWhat this setting helps us do is what,\nWes?\n\n945\n00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:44,270\n>> This is gonna point us\nto that specific location,\n\n946\n00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:46,620\nto that WSUS server that\nRonnie's talking about.\n\n947\n00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,250\nWe got a couple of\ndifferent settings in here.\n\n948\n00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,300\nAnd to configure them,\n\n949\n00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,985\nfirst thing you're gonna do is you're\ngonna right-click there and choose Edit.\n\n950\n00:45:56,042 --> 00:45:59,877\nAnd I was actually talking to Nate about\nthis earlier, as you've seen in some\n\n951\n00:45:59,877 --> 00:46:03,670\nof the other episodes, you've really\ngot to be careful to these settings.\n\n952\n00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,565\nBecause sometimes in disabling it,\nyou enable it.\n\n953\n00:46:06,565 --> 00:46:09,499\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, we'll definitely save that for\n\n954\n00:46:09,499 --> 00:46:11,520\nanother episode for sure.\n\n955\n00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,498\nBut the one big one here that we\nwanna do is we wanna enable this.\n\n956\n00:46:14,498 --> 00:46:15,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n957\n00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:19,010\n>> All right, now the settings in here,\ntwo basic settings.\n\n958\n00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,680\nWhere do we point to download updates, and\n\n959\n00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,620\nwhen I update, remember those logs that\nwe talked about, that Windows log.\n\n960\n00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,440\nWhen we've got that locally\non the machine, and\n\n961\n00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,800\nif we've got an administrator out there\nthat's doing a patch management solution,\n\n962\n00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,550\nthat administrator might wanna see the\nresults of any of the updates that have\n\n963\n00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,270\nbeen downloaded to the machine and\ninstalled locally.\n\n964\n00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:41,620\nSo what we do here is, it's just a URL,\nand I'm just gonna type in,\n\n965\n00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:47,700\nlet's say the Internet\nsite here http://wsus.\n\n966\n00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:52,274\nNow with this setting here you also\npointed out to the same server, or you can\n\n967\n00:46:52,274 --> 00:46:56,706\nand most likely I believe you would,\nyou could point it out back to WSUS and\n\n968\n00:46:56,706 --> 00:47:00,782\nsay not only do I wanna update my,\nor download my updates internally\n\n969\n00:47:00,782 --> 00:47:05,457\nwithin my Internet, also wanna push out\nthe reports back to the same server.\n\n970\n00:47:05,457 --> 00:47:09,584\nSo, the URL,\nimagine this is gonna be the same, okay?\n\n971\n00:47:09,584 --> 00:47:13,260\n>> Yeah, now, what we're doing here\nis right, this actually allows us to\n\n972\n00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,820\ngo ahead and configure the actual\nindividual computer at this point,\n\n973\n00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,910\nto ensure,\ninstead of reaching out to Microsoft.\n\n974\n00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:23,790\nThat when it goes to look for updates it's\nsupposed to actually look here instead.\n\n975\n00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,780\nAnd so, we use that HTTP because generally\nit is going out to a Web server to do it.\n\n976\n00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,890\nWe're gonna follow the same format but\nwe're gonna use the name that\n\n977\n00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,790\nwe've assigned to our Windows Update\nServer instead to be able to do this.\n\n978\n00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:39,830\nNow, when we do this, do I have to change\nanything in terms of the client and\n\n979\n00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:40,970\nthe automatic updates?\n\n980\n00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:44,530\nWell, yes you go to help over here,\non the actual right hand side.\n\n981\n00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,610\nMake sure you take a look\nat those settings,\n\n982\n00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:49,050\nif they ask you is there anything\nelse we need to configure?\n\n983\n00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:51,890\nSo, Wes are there other things\nthat we might need to configure if\n\n984\n00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:52,792\nwe're doing this?\n\n985\n00:47:52,792 --> 00:47:57,725\n>> Well, again we might need to set\nautomatic updates again to automatically\n\n986\n00:47:57,725 --> 00:47:58,437\nconnect.\n\n987\n00:47:58,437 --> 00:48:00,563\n>> That's it.\n>> So keep in mind couple of settings\n\n988\n00:48:00,563 --> 00:48:02,580\nwe're saying, where do you look?\n\n989\n00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,380\nNow we have to say, okay you can look.\n\n990\n00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:04,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n991\n00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:08,590\n>> So we'll have to come in here and\ngo ahead and say okay to this.\n\n992\n00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:12,130\n>> And right above it, I believe\nis configuring automatic updates.\n\n993\n00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,780\nAnd we say enable, and\nnow we set our patch management schedule.\n\n994\n00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:20,126\n>> Mm-hm, now remember that this can be\ndone not only at the individual computer\n\n995\n00:48:20,126 --> 00:48:21,100\nlevel, okay?\n\n996\n00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,200\nSo we're doing this, it's only\ngonna apply to this computer, but\n\n997\n00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,760\nto everybody that ever\nlogs on to this computer.\n\n998\n00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,751\nBut if we were to actually apply\nthis in group policy, okay,\n\n999\n00:48:29,751 --> 00:48:33,916\nnow if you want to learn more about that,\nagain, head on over to 70-410 show,\n\n1000\n00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:36,107\nwhen you can take a look\nat the server shows.\n\n1001\n00:48:36,107 --> 00:48:38,459\nThat will actually show you\nhow set this thing up, or\n\n1002\n00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:40,603\nthe 411 shows will actually do that for\nyou.\n\n1003\n00:48:40,603 --> 00:48:43,610\nI can't remember exactly\nwhich particular episode.\n\n1004\n00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:44,131\n>> Lot's of numbers there.\n\n1005\n00:48:44,131 --> 00:48:45,690\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, lot's of numbers here.\n\n1006\n00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:47,240\nBut for us here, right?\n\n1007\n00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,280\nMaking sure that we get these things set.\n\n1008\n00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,976\nA lot of times a policy's\nnot just about setting one.\n\n1009\n00:48:50,976 --> 00:48:54,330\nBut notice that this one, there's actually\ntwo different settings that we have\n\n1010\n00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,253\nto actually make sure that are happening,\nfor\n\n1011\n00:48:56,253 --> 00:48:58,201\nthem to actually work\ntogether effectively.\n\n1012\n00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:58,787\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1013\n00:48:58,787 --> 00:49:01,719\nNow if I go ahead and\nI set this policy, all right?\n\n1014\n00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:05,388\nWhich I'm gonna go ahead and do, and\nI'm gonna go ahead and just make sure.\n\n1015\n00:49:05,388 --> 00:49:07,699\nCuz this isn't gonna apply\nto the computer here, so\n\n1016\n00:49:07,699 --> 00:49:10,442\nwhat I'm gonna do is launch our\ncommand prompter real quick.\n\n1017\n00:49:10,442 --> 00:49:13,960\nAnd let's make sure that we make\nthese settings instantaneous here.\n\n1018\n00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,617\nAnd we're gonna do our GP update,\n\n1019\n00:49:16,617 --> 00:49:19,192\nforward slash use the force,\n>> Yeah.\n\n1020\n00:49:19,192 --> 00:49:20,280\n[LAUGH]\n>> And hit Enter.\n\n1021\n00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,890\n>> Yeah, and a lot of times on the local\ngroup policy it may apply immediately.\n\n1022\n00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:27,954\nBut for safe side this is what I always\ndo as well, if I'm doing the testing and\n\n1023\n00:49:27,954 --> 00:49:30,847\nI want to verify that everything is\nactually working the way I want it to.\n\n1024\n00:49:30,847 --> 00:49:31,781\n>> It's funny,\nI wonder where I learned that.\n\n1025\n00:49:31,781 --> 00:49:34,150\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n1026\n00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:38,520\nSo, now what I wanna do here\nreal quick is I'm going to\n\n1027\n00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,565\ncreate another user here real quick,\n\n1028\n00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:47,380\ncuz I wanna show you another configuration\nthat you might wanna do here as well.\n\n1029\n00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,550\nSo let me go ahead and just real quick,\nlet's make another user.\n\n1030\n00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:52,196\nLet's just call him Wes.\n\n1031\n00:50:00,566 --> 00:50:01,160\nCreate.\n\n1032\n00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:05,250\nAll right, now one of the things\nto keep in mind is that, yeah,\n\n1033\n00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:08,470\nI did configure that policy and I said\nyou're gonna go out to Windows Update, or\n\n1034\n00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,798\nour internal server, but\nif I go ahead and do a log off.\n\n1035\n00:50:11,798 --> 00:50:15,900\nYeah I'm gonna,\n\n1036\n00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,615\nhopefully it's gonna maybe not install or\nuninstall all those updates.\n\n1037\n00:50:19,615 --> 00:50:23,200\n[LAUGH] And I log back in as well, myself,\n\n1038\n00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,670\nI just created a real quick standard\nuser here to see what they would see.\n\n1039\n00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:30,840\nCuz what we've said on the back end\nis that we want you to look here.\n\n1040\n00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,780\nMaybe we wanna go the step farther.\n\n1041\n00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,180\nMaybe we want it to be\ncompletely configured or\n\n1042\n00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,800\nin the hand of the system's administrator.\n\n1043\n00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,530\nWe don't want any local\ninterface here even showing.\n\n1044\n00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:45,999\nSo even though we've\ndefined where to look,\n\n1045\n00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:52,860\nif I come into the Control Panel here,\nand Windows Update, check for updates.\n\n1046\n00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:56,770\nNow, again, we're gonna point it\nout to that location that we said.\n\n1047\n00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,680\nBut maybe I wanna go\na step further than this.\n\n1048\n00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,860\nMaybe I don't even want them to\nhave access to this page at all.\n\n1049\n00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,040\nIf I go ahead and I log off real quick.\n\n1050\n00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:08,040\nLet's look at that setting,\ntoo, in the Group Policy.\n\n1051\n00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,370\n>> Okay.\n\n1052\n00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,360\n>> Now,\nthis is gonna be a user-defined setting.\n\n1053\n00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:16,239\nWhich, again,\nwe mention in other episodes here.\n\n1054\n00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:20,487\nAnd if I go back and\nlaunch our editor here,\n\n1055\n00:51:20,487 --> 00:51:26,400\nremember that is,\ndoesn't start with a c, gpedit.msc.\n\n1056\n00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,110\nAnd we launch this.\n\n1057\n00:51:29,155 --> 00:51:32,880\nNow we're pretty much the same location,\nbut\n\n1058\n00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,690\nthe difference is it's under\nUser Configuration here.\n\n1059\n00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,886\nMaybe I wanna, like I said, maybe I wanna\ngo a little bit farther than that, and\n\n1060\n00:51:38,886 --> 00:51:41,320\nI don't even want them to have\naccess to this console at all,\n\n1061\n00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,472\nbecause it's amazing how a bored used\ncan get bored and click around and well,\n\n1062\n00:51:44,472 --> 00:51:47,080\nbypass every security\nimplementation that you've got set.\n\n1063\n00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,602\nSo, we're gonna scroll down.\n\n1064\n00:51:49,602 --> 00:51:54,520\nAnd I did that kinda fast here, so\nlet me just explain where I was there.\n\n1065\n00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:59,490\nSo, you're gonna go to the User\nConfiguration > Administrative Templates,\n\n1066\n00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:03,170\nand then Windows Components, and you'll\nsee pretty much the path is the same.\n\n1067\n00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:06,427\nNow we get two different options here,\nbut not many.\n\n1068\n00:52:06,427 --> 00:52:07,029\n>> Right.\n>> And\n\n1069\n00:52:07,029 --> 00:52:09,570\nthe big one here is this one right here.\n\n1070\n00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:12,580\nRemove access to all\nWindows update features.\n\n1071\n00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,780\n>> Okay.\n\n1072\n00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,940\n>> And if we right-click and choose Edit.\n\n1073\n00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,440\nYou gotta be careful with this one.\n\n1074\n00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,080\nIf you pay attention to this one,\nenabling it, you will have to set,\n\n1075\n00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,700\nand if you pay attention\nto the explain here.\n\n1076\n00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,060\nZero.\n\n1077\n00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,290\nSays don't show any notifications.\n\n1078\n00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:29,109\nWell it's a little bit more than that.\n\n1079\n00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:31,013\nIt's not just not showing notifications.\n\n1080\n00:52:31,013 --> 00:52:33,773\nYou're not gonna see anything,\nincluding the interface and\n\n1081\n00:52:33,773 --> 00:52:35,860\nthat's the one that we\nmight want to enable.\n\n1082\n00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,230\n>> All right.\n\n1083\n00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,830\n>> So we're gonna do that.\n\n1084\n00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,897\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and do a log off.\n\n1085\n00:52:45,094 --> 00:52:48,800\nAnd let's see if it applies\nwithout doing GP update.\n\n1086\n00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,300\nWhat do you think?\n\n1087\n00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,360\n>> It should.\n\n1088\n00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,621\n>> Hopefully, cuz it's a log off, log on.\n\n1089\n00:52:51,621 --> 00:52:52,341\n>> Cuz of User Configuration, Yep.\n\n1090\n00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:53,014\n>> Yep, yes sir.\n\n1091\n00:52:53,014 --> 00:52:53,647\nAll right, now.\n\n1092\n00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,185\nWait for the spinning cheerio there.\n\n1093\n00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:04,161\nControl Panel > System and\nSecurity > Windows Updates.\n\n1094\n00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:06,994\nOh, access denied.\n\n1095\n00:53:06,994 --> 00:53:07,871\n>> There you go.\n\n1096\n00:53:07,871 --> 00:53:10,697\n>> Now, well, maybe I can still check for\nupdates though.\n\n1097\n00:53:10,697 --> 00:53:13,640\nOh, sorry, sorry, no.\n\n1098\n00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,549\nWell maybe I can change the settings.\n\n1099\n00:53:15,549 --> 00:53:18,661\nOh, still can't even change the settings.\n\n1100\n00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:20,045\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> They're all carried out,\n\n1101\n00:53:20,045 --> 00:53:21,410\njust like it says at the top.\n\n1102\n00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:22,710\nNow we don't get the local user,\n\n1103\n00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,990\nin this case the local user or any user\nif we're going through group policy.\n\n1104\n00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,360\nWe don't even give them the access to\nmess around with these settings, at all.\n\n1105\n00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:33,670\nReview Update History,\nit's okay, a few details.\n\n1106\n00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:36,940\nIt's read-only so they can't\nactually mess with anything here.\n\n1107\n00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,584\nRestore hidden updates,\noh, sorry, access denied.\n\n1108\n00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:40,504\nThere you go.\n>> So Wes you do\n\n1109\n00:53:40,504 --> 00:53:42,595\nnot get access to anything.\n\n1110\n00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:43,181\n>> That's right.\n\n1111\n00:53:43,181 --> 00:53:47,693\n>> Go ahead and just log off of that and\n\n1112\n00:53:47,693 --> 00:53:52,212\nlog back in as the administrator.\n\n1113\n00:53:52,212 --> 00:53:53,525\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right.\n\n1114\n00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:56,832\n>> Yeah, so\nin terms of the updates here, right?\n\n1115\n00:53:56,832 --> 00:54:00,420\nWe've covered updates just about in any\npossible configuration that we can here.\n\n1116\n00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,480\n>> Sure.\n>> We've gone through\n\n1117\n00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,830\nall of the actual settings.\n\n1118\n00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,040\nInside the control panel and\nthe updates setting there.\n\n1119\n00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,660\nMake sure you do pay attention to this,\nand\n\n1120\n00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:10,120\nagain the scenario that\nyou're actually put in.\n\n1121\n00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,170\nAs you actually read this again and\ntake a look at it.\n\n1122\n00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:16,070\nSo don't skip this part just\nbecause you think it's easy.\n\n1123\n00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:18,680\nMake sure you go back through and\ncheck these things out.\n\n1124\n00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,850\nIt's probably not the first time that\nyou'll actually have take a look at\n\n1125\n00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:24,440\nthe idea of group policy or the last time\nyou'll do it So make sure you remember,\n\n1126\n00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,660\nthat you have to take a look at\nsome of these settings there,\n\n1127\n00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,620\nin those automatic updates.\n\n1128\n00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,100\nWe've just showed you really,\ntwo of the most of the important ones, but\n\n1129\n00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,250\nthere are several important\nones that are in there.\n\n1130\n00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,365\nSo make sure you, again,\nreview that concept, as well.\n\n1131\n00:54:35,365 --> 00:54:36,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1132\n00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,280\n>> Knowing how to, not only install\nthe updates, but being able to hide them,\n\n1133\n00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:45,050\nas well as being able to uninstall them is\nalso an important part of maintaining and\n\n1134\n00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:48,055\nmanaging your Windows 7 environment and\nyour computer as well.\n\n1135\n00:54:48,055 --> 00:54:48,970\nOkay?\n\n1136\n00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:52,990\nSo that for us really ends that particular\nsection on updates unless you have\n\n1137\n00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,450\nanything else in terms of the updates?\n\n1138\n00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:55,540\n>> No, I think you covered it.\n\n1139\n00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,980\nThe only one thing I would add,\n\n1140\n00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,810\nas you've seen on other\nepisodes that they've covered,\n\n1141\n00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:02,280\nthey've covered system restore so you can\ncheck those episodes for system restore.\n\n1142\n00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,130\nRemember, worst case scenario,\nevery time you install an update,\n\n1143\n00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:08,390\nthe first thing that happens, the system\nrestore creates a restore point.\n\n1144\n00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:11,530\nSo, if you try some of these methods,\n\n1145\n00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:14,790\ntechniques, if you will,\nto roll back an update or\n\n1146\n00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:19,680\nthat driver installation through\nupdate and it doesn't fix the problem.\n\n1147\n00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,370\nWorst case scenario,\nyou can do system restore.\n\n1148\n00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:24,035\nBut it really should be\na last case scenario.\n\n1149\n00:55:24,035 --> 00:55:26,550\n>> All right, so\nwe're gonna take our break right now, and\n\n1150\n00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:31,525\nwhen we come back we'll talk about\nthe idea of managing our hard drives.\n\n1151\n00:55:31,525 --> 00:55:37,448\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back\nas we continue on in managing and\n\n1152\n00:55:37,448 --> 00:55:41,024\nmaintaining here, or monitoring and\n\n1153\n00:55:41,024 --> 00:55:45,287\nmaintaining, the idea of Windows 7 for us.\n\n1154\n00:55:45,287 --> 00:55:49,748\nWe have just finished going over the idea\nof updating our Windows 7 environment.\n\n1155\n00:55:49,748 --> 00:55:52,688\nNow we wanna talk about\nthe idea of managing disk or\n\n1156\n00:55:52,688 --> 00:55:54,375\nmanaging hard drive for us.\n\n1157\n00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:57,883\nA lot of times you may actually find out\nthat you need to add in another hard drive\n\n1158\n00:55:57,883 --> 00:55:59,280\nor even multiple hard drives.\n\n1159\n00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,913\nWe want to make sure that you actually\nknow how to get them to be recognized, and\n\n1160\n00:56:02,913 --> 00:56:06,382\nalso some of the different ways in which\nwe can configure the hard drives and\n\n1161\n00:56:06,382 --> 00:56:08,530\nmake them work a little\nbit more efficiently or\n\n1162\n00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:11,330\nbetter in terms of what we\nactually need them to do.\n\n1163\n00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,540\nSo Wes what do we have on tap here.\n\n1164\n00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:17,580\n>> Well we have a piece of software\nthat allows you to manage and\n\n1165\n00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:20,690\nmaintain the partitions and\nvolumes within a Windows system.\n\n1166\n00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,010\nAnd that's Disk Management.\n\n1167\n00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:24,100\nNow you can also do this\nthrough the command prompt and\n\n1168\n00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,980\nthat's Diskpart, and it's just\nthe command line equivalent to what\n\n1169\n00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,700\nyou're gonna see here\ntoday within the GUI.\n\n1170\n00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,856\nOne of the easiest ways to get to this,\nStart,\n\n1171\n00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:34,940\nright-click Computer, chose Manager.\n\n1172\n00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:38,620\nAnother one of those utilities that\nremember, multiple ways to get there.\n\n1173\n00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,390\nThis is one of the easier\nways that I like to do it.\n\n1174\n00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:45,210\nWhen we get to Disk Management though,\nyou should notice something right away.\n\n1175\n00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:49,720\nAnd that's the fact that these disks here,\nthey're not initialized.\n\n1176\n00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,150\nWe've got a couple of options here.\n\n1177\n00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:54,140\nWe've got an option that's been\naround since the days of PC.\n\n1178\n00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,090\nAnd that's NBR.\n\n1179\n00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,240\nAnd there's limitations to NBR and\nsome of the things that it can do, and\n\n1180\n00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,120\npartition sizes if you will.\n\n1181\n00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,580\nAnd then there's also GPT.\n\n1182\n00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:05,600\nGPT is like a newer version of MBR.\n\n1183\n00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,070\nA little different platform,\n\n1184\n00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:09,900\nbut one of the great things is\nit's got a lot more efficiencies.\n\n1185\n00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,040\nIt's got a redundancy, if you will.\n\n1186\n00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,840\nMaster boot records could get corrupted.\n\n1187\n00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:18,630\nGPT kind of takes care of that by\noffering a little bit of a redundancy and\n\n1188\n00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:20,210\ncan scale up much larger.\n\n1189\n00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:23,690\nWhen we talk about this idea of\nadding in additional hard drives,\n\n1190\n00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:27,690\nwe've got to remember that the operating\nsystem may not recognize the drives that\n\n1191\n00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:31,160\nare put in right away, because when you do\nbuy new ones and you plug them right in,\n\n1192\n00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,820\nit says, look, I recognize drives but\nI can't access them.\n\n1193\n00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,620\nSo usually in the idea of\nthe disk management tool for\n\n1194\n00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:42,480\nus here, it provides a way\nto begin to initialize them.\n\n1195\n00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,490\nIn other words, to get them to be able to\nrecognized by the operating system itself.\n\n1196\n00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:49,630\nThe two options that we have here,\nif you take a look at the bottom,\n\n1197\n00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:53,850\nthe note there, it tells us why we\nwould choose one over the other, right?\n\n1198\n00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:57,470\nIt tells us right there that the GPT\npartition style is not recognized by\n\n1199\n00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,590\nall previous versions of Windows.\n\n1200\n00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:02,770\nSo if you're running an older version\nof Windows and you want to connect it,\n\n1201\n00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,290\nit may not actually do it.\n\n1202\n00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:07,070\nSo just kind of realize that\nthat may be the option.\n\n1203\n00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:10,930\nThe second one tells us that,\nhey, there's a two terabyte drop.\n\n1204\n00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:15,780\nIn other words, anything larger than two\nterabytes, you need to run it as GPT.\n\n1205\n00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,800\nNow don't get me wrong,\nNBR has been around for\n\n1206\n00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,890\na long time, probably will still\nbe around for a long time.\n\n1207\n00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,930\nBut the very fact is drives\nare getting larger and larger, and\n\n1208\n00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:28,310\nthe MBR really only limits us\nthe ability to create four partitions.\n\n1209\n00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:31,830\nSo GPT gives us the ability to\ncreate a lot more than that\n\n1210\n00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:34,660\non the idea of these\nlarger drives as well.\n\n1211\n00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,190\nOkay?\n\n1212\n00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:39,280\nSo again there's more technicality\nbehind that, don't get me wrong, but\n\n1213\n00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,630\nat this point here that's what\nwe actually have to realize.\n\n1214\n00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:45,200\nSo if I'm given a hard drive that's\na 4 terabyte hard drive, and\n\n1215\n00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,060\nI'm told I need to create 16 partitions,\nwell guess what?\n\n1216\n00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,010\nMBR is not gonna actually do that for us.\n\n1217\n00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:51,600\n>> That's right.\n\n1218\n00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,810\nAnd they had workarounds that\nwould allow you to do that.\n\n1219\n00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:57,390\nYou'd have to have a special,\na specialized host bus adapter and\n\n1220\n00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:01,700\nwith GPT you get around that and\nnatively it allows you this functionality.\n\n1221\n00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,590\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n1222\n00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:05,170\nI'm gonna initialize these\ndisks as the old format, MBR.\n\n1223\n00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,350\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nsay okay to this.\n\n1224\n00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:12,500\nI'm gonna go ahead and see if I can scroll\ndown a little bit there on that already.\n\n1225\n00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,230\nI'll move that up.\n\n1226\n00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:14,320\nThere we go.\n\n1227\n00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,560\n>> Yep.\n>> So you're gonna see that we've got\n\n1228\n00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,080\na couple of hard drives in here.\n\n1229\n00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:19,870\nNow.\n\n1230\n00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:22,330\nThe very first one that we have,\ndisk zero here,\n\n1231\n00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:24,790\nthis is where my operating\nsystem is installed.\n\n1232\n00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:28,040\nThis is the Windows volume here.\n\n1233\n00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,820\nIn another episode here, you heard\nsome of the other guys talking about\n\n1234\n00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:34,820\nthat system reserve partition and\nthat's where all of the features to be\n\n1235\n00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,890\ninstalled within Windows, so\nthat one was automatically created.\n\n1236\n00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:40,510\nAnd the C colon here,\nis where the operating system is.\n\n1237\n00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,850\nAnd if I don't do anything else,\nthis is where my data is gonna be stored.\n\n1238\n00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:47,860\nAnd one of the great things that Windows\n7 allows you to do that they didn't allow\n\n1239\n00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,250\nyou to do in the earlier days of XP.\n\n1240\n00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:53,050\nIn fact, I think in the days of XP,\nyou'd have to go to a third-party vendor.\n\n1241\n00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:56,940\nWhat if I installed Windows and\nI had one of two-terrabyte drives, but\n\n1242\n00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,020\nI decided, you know what?\n\n1243\n00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:02,520\nMaybe that's not exactly what I wanna\nhave, a one or a two-terrabyte partition\n\n1244\n01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:07,270\ntaking up all the space\ncapacity of that drive.\n\n1245\n01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,000\nFor instance, one of the situations that\nyou might run into, it's not really for\n\n1246\n01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,690\nredundancy, but maybe I want to\ndo operating system isolation.\n\n1247\n01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:16,030\nI wanna separate my operating\nsystem from my data so\n\n1248\n01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:18,770\nif I get a virus within the operating\nsystem, it doesn't corrupt my data.\n\n1249\n01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:22,410\nIn the older days, we couldn't do\nthis natively inside of Windows,\n\n1250\n01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:26,630\nwe'd have to go to a third party utility\nto be able to perform this functionality.\n\n1251\n01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:31,900\nHowever, today what we have the ability\nto do is this, shrink volume.\n\n1252\n01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,120\nSo we can dynamically resize these.\n\n1253\n01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:38,380\nAnd if I came in here to shrink volume,\nchoose that.\n\n1254\n01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:45,230\nAnd it's gonna run through a little\nanalysis here, if you will.\n\n1255\n01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,672\nWait for it.\n\n1256\n01:00:48,672 --> 01:00:49,184\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1257\n01:00:49,184 --> 01:00:50,634\n>> Yeah it does take a little bit of time,\n\n1258\n01:00:50,634 --> 01:00:54,584\nbecause what it's doing, it's trying to\nagain see how much space is actually being\n\n1259\n01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:58,710\nused on the hard drive, and then when it\ndoes that right, it's actually now taking\n\n1260\n01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:01,710\nadvantage and counting up how\nmuch free space that we have.\n\n1261\n01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:03,160\nAnd if we do this.\n\n1262\n01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,798\nWhat if the actual information\non that particular drive,\n\n1263\n01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:09,740\nin other words are spread out\nacross our entire hard drive?\n\n1264\n01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:13,683\nIt's gotta calculate all that space and\nthen if we choose to actually shrink it,\n\n1265\n01:01:13,683 --> 01:01:16,590\nit's gotta move all that data\nto the area that's being,\n\n1266\n01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,450\nthat we're gonna shrink it into.\n\n1267\n01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:19,840\nIt's got a lot to actually do here.\n\n1268\n01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,230\nSo right now, it gives this\nability to see something, right.\n\n1269\n01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:29,715\nSo, Wes had the 64 gig hard drive it\nlooks like and he's used about what?\n\n1270\n01:01:29,715 --> 01:01:30,598\nAbout 32 gigs.\n\n1271\n01:01:30,598 --> 01:01:33,655\n>> About 32 gigs, so\nmaybe I wanna recollect some space here.\n\n1272\n01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:34,794\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or, free up some space.\n\n1273\n01:01:34,794 --> 01:01:37,120\n>> Yeah.\n>> So let's do, what do you say, 10 gigs?\n\n1274\n01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,600\n>> Sure.\n>> We'll do, what, 10,\n\n1275\n01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:44,220\n23, zero there and\nwe're gonna go ahead and just use Shrink.\n\n1276\n01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:48,510\n>> So this is where it has to again\nmove all that stuff to that partition.\n\n1277\n01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,490\nThat's now gonna be a little bit smaller.\n\n1278\n01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:52,680\nAnd then free up all that free space.\n\n1279\n01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:56,970\nAnd now we've actually got another\nparticular space that we have here\n\n1280\n01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:58,120\non this first drive.\n\n1281\n01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,800\nNow remember what I just told you.\n\n1282\n01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,910\nThe drives are not recognized by Windows.\n\n1283\n01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:05,810\nWes, if you click on the file\nexplorer down there for us.\n\n1284\n01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:06,570\n>> Can do.\n\n1285\n01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:07,960\n>> And go down to computer.\n\n1286\n01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,529\n>> There we go.\n\n1287\n01:02:08,529 --> 01:02:11,410\n>> Notice that we're not seeing\nthose other hard drives.\n\n1288\n01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:15,170\nI see local disk C, but\nI don't see anything else.\n\n1289\n01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:19,090\nI've initialized them, Wes, but\nat this point they're not showing up.\n\n1290\n01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:21,830\nThat particular area that we just shrunk,\n\n1291\n01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:26,710\nwhich is now an unpartitioned space,\nis also now not showing up either.\n\n1292\n01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:31,160\nSo one of the first things that we have to\ndo is get this space to actually show up.\n\n1293\n01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,170\nSo there's a couple of\ndifferent ways we can do it.\n\n1294\n01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:36,860\nSo Wes, let's see,\none way is where we can actually do this.\n\n1295\n01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:39,440\n>> Well, if you think about it right now,\nthink about a filing cabinet, right?\n\n1296\n01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,400\nIf I take all of the rails out of\nthe file cabinet, all of the shelves,\n\n1297\n01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,660\nit doesn't really make a very\ngood storage container.\n\n1298\n01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,140\nIt's not prepared in a way that\nI could put folders in it,\n\n1299\n01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:48,565\nput files in the folders.\n\n1300\n01:02:48,565 --> 01:02:52,370\nSo, what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nstart to create this file cabinet and\n\n1301\n01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:55,280\nstart to build a structure that we can\nstart to use it as a storage location.\n\n1302\n01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,860\nOne of the easiest ways to do this and\nit's\n\n1303\n01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:01,630\nright in the name is if you right-click\nyou should see New Simple Volume.\n\n1304\n01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:03,490\nNew Simple Volume, very basic.\n\n1305\n01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:04,610\nJust a storage container.\n\n1306\n01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:07,446\nWe'll start\nthe New Simple Volume Wizard here.\n\n1307\n01:03:07,446 --> 01:03:10,980\nAnd we'll choose Next.\n\n1308\n01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,420\nNow it's gonna give us the amount of\nspace and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n1309\n01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:17,390\nwe're gonna say all of this space is\ngonna be used for this New Simple Volume.\n\n1310\n01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:22,433\nAlright and I tell you what,\nI'm just gonna leave it,\n\n1311\n01:03:22,433 --> 01:03:24,304\nit sequentially labels them here.\n\n1312\n01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:24,945\n>> You can see.\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n1313\n01:03:24,945 --> 01:03:27,279\n>> The next available\ndrive is next letter, yep.\n\n1314\n01:03:27,279 --> 01:03:29,800\n>> And\nwe're just gonna leave it as the default.\n\n1315\n01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,590\nAnd now what we can do here is\nformat it with a file system, NTFS,\n\n1316\n01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:37,030\nas you learned in other episodes,\nthat's recommended for Windows today.\n\n1317\n01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:40,030\nDefault allocation, unit size,\ndefault cluster size, if you will.\n\n1318\n01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:41,940\nBut I'm going to change the volume label.\n\n1319\n01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,375\nAnd I'll call this Data.\n\n1320\n01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:43,908\nAll right,\n\n1321\n01:03:43,908 --> 01:03:46,959\nnow I get the ability to perform\na quick format versus a full format.\n\n1322\n01:03:46,959 --> 01:03:53,833\nQuick format is if you've already\nhad it formatted at NTFS.\n\n1323\n01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:55,917\nIt can do a quick format, no problem.\n\n1324\n01:03:55,917 --> 01:04:00,380\nYou do a full format though, it's going\nto look at literally every sector on this\n\n1325\n01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:04,781\ndrive possibly for errors, marking them\nas bad and making sure that it doesn't\n\n1326\n01:04:04,781 --> 01:04:09,380\nuse any of that space, physical platters\non the drive that may be failing.\n\n1327\n01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,720\nSo we're just going to go ahead and\nsay next on this one.\n\n1328\n01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:16,970\nFinish the wizard, and\nnow it goes from black to blue.\n\n1329\n01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:17,680\n>> Yeah.\n\n1330\n01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,320\nNow notice what it also ended\nup doing which is assigning\n\n1331\n01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,330\na driver\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1332\n01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:24,825\n>> So Wes if we click back\non that file explorer again\n\n1333\n01:04:24,825 --> 01:04:25,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1334\n01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:31,170\n>> We should now see an extra hard drive\n>> If we go down to Computer, and\n\n1335\n01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:34,180\ngo ahead and click on Computer and that\nway, we can see it in the graphic there.\n\n1336\n01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:35,070\n>> There we go.\n>> Oops.\n\n1337\n01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,080\nIt's still not showing up there, Wes.\n\n1338\n01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,310\nLet's refresh that screen.\n\n1339\n01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:39,500\n>> There we go, yeah.\n\n1340\n01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,970\n>> And let's see what we can do there.\n\n1341\n01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,740\nThere.\n\n1342\n01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:45,470\n>> Interesting that it didn't\ngive it a mounting point.\n\n1343\n01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,640\n>> Yeah, so it should be showing up.\n\n1344\n01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,720\nWe do see it there under\ndata on this screen.\n\n1345\n01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,680\nGo ahead and close out that window and\nopen it again.\n\n1346\n01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:55,670\nMaybe that's what's happening.\n\n1347\n01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,830\n>> Yeah.\nI don't know that's right.\n\n1348\n01:04:58,830 --> 01:04:59,590\nYeah, another drive letter.\n\n1349\n01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:01,861\n>> I think what we got, let's go ahead and\nreassign a drive letter.\n\n1350\n01:05:01,861 --> 01:05:03,205\nLet's change the drive letter.\n\n1351\n01:05:03,205 --> 01:05:10,540\nChange and\nwe're going to call this the Z drive.\n\n1352\n01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,730\nThat's ok don't worry about- [CROSSTALK].\n\n1353\n01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:15,930\nThat's what Ronnie was looking for\nhe's looking for Windows Explorer.\n\n1354\n01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:19,060\nHere to start telling us hey,\nyou might wanna check this out because\n\n1355\n01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:23,020\nnow what we've done is we've created our\nfiling cabinet and we've essentially\n\n1356\n01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:26,180\ngave it a doorway into the container\nif you will to start using it.\n\n1357\n01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:30,630\nSo, now, let me turn the autoplay\noff because You know that's not\n\n1358\n01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:31,390\nthe security risk.\n\n1359\n01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:33,810\nAnd get back to where.\n\n1360\n01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:35,150\nThere you go\n>> There it is.\n\n1361\n01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:37,359\nSo there's that extra drive now for us.\n\n1362\n01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:41,400\nNow, learn that this is a partition\non this one hard drive.\n\n1363\n01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:46,100\nSo what Wes has done has effectively\ncreated again a logical partition and\n\n1364\n01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:51,290\nnow where that one physical drive is being\nrecognized as local disks C and the other\n\n1365\n01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:57,090\nportion of that 10 gigs here, is now being\nrecognized as drive D as well, okay?\n\n1366\n01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,500\nSo this is one way,\nthat we can actually do this.\n\n1367\n01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:04,210\nNow, I do have two additional drives here,\nor Wes has two additional drives.\n\n1368\n01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,180\nWhat if we actually need to use them\na little bit more effectively as well,\n\n1369\n01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,350\ninstead of just creating\nmultiple partitions like this.\n\n1370\n01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:10,330\nLet's see what else we can do.\n\n1371\n01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:12,750\n>> All right, so\nlet's say that the Z: drive,\n\n1372\n01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:14,920\nif you will here, starts to get full.\n\n1373\n01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:15,700\nAll right.\n\n1374\n01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:20,710\nI start to come to the capacity limit, and\nunfortunately I've got to make up my mind,\n\n1375\n01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:25,880\nam I going to repartition this again,\nor do I have other options?\n\n1376\n01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:29,670\nAnd one of the things that you can\ndo is you can create a span volume.\n\n1377\n01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:31,810\nNow, I believe at the basic disk,\n\n1378\n01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:35,070\nI'd have to turn it into a dynamic\ndisk to be able to do this.\n\n1379\n01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:39,415\nYou have to be careful If you turn a basic\ndisk into a dynamic disk, other than\n\n1380\n01:06:39,415 --> 01:06:43,155\nthe current boot volume, no other\noperating system is going to be bootable.\n\n1381\n01:06:43,155 --> 01:06:45,285\nSo, since we've already got\nWindows installed on here,\n\n1382\n01:06:45,285 --> 01:06:47,775\nit is the boot volume, we're not\ngoing to have to worry about that.\n\n1383\n01:06:47,775 --> 01:06:52,100\nBut, you have to be careful and you do\nthat, you go over here to basic disk.\n\n1384\n01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,630\nYou right click, and\nyou can choose convert to dynamic.\n\n1385\n01:06:56,180 --> 01:07:00,690\nAll right, now,\nwe're just going to keep disk 0 here.\n\n1386\n01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:05,412\nSecond, and we're going to convert and\nnow it tells you, be careful, except for\n\n1387\n01:07:05,412 --> 01:07:06,918\nthe current boot volume,\n\n1388\n01:07:06,918 --> 01:07:10,040\nno other operating systems\nare going to be bootable.\n\n1389\n01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,530\nI only have this one operating system so\n\n1390\n01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:14,388\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ntake care of that and let it happen.\n\n1391\n01:07:14,388 --> 01:07:19,150\nAll right, now, I get the ability.\n\n1392\n01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:24,070\nOh, okay, so we're going to do\nthe add mirror here, all right.\n\n1393\n01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:26,550\nAnd now, when we talk about mirror,\n\n1394\n01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:30,620\nremember that mirror is\na raid implementation.\n\n1395\n01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:35,120\nNow, typically this is a lot more\nefficient to do this in hardware.\n\n1396\n01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,150\nBecause when you do it in hardware,\nit's the card that is performing,\n\n1397\n01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:39,970\ndoing the RAID controller.\n\n1398\n01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:41,740\nControlling the RAID array, if you will.\n\n1399\n01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,800\nIn software you're gonna rob\nyour operating system of\n\n1400\n01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,225\nprocessing cycles from the CPU.\n\n1401\n01:07:46,225 --> 01:07:48,389\nCause it's the CPU that's gonna\nbe managing and controlling them.\n\n1402\n01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,680\nNow I'm only gonna select\none of these disks.\n\n1403\n01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,530\nFor now, I'm gonna say add mirror, and\n\n1404\n01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:58,730\nagain you're gonna see that this\ndisk right down here is basic.\n\n1405\n01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:02,250\nSo essentially gave him the same\nwarning that it gave me about\n\n1406\n01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:04,440\nthe bootable disk here.\n\n1407\n01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,200\nSo we're gonna go ahead and convert that.\n\n1408\n01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,484\nLet it convert it to dynamic.\n\n1409\n01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,330\nGive it a second here.\n\n1410\n01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:16,030\n>> Yeah.\n\n1411\n01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:19,760\nNow what we're seeing right here\nis that idea of mirroring, right?\n\n1412\n01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:24,110\nWhen we saw that Wes went ahead and\ncreated that dynamic volume, we have a lot\n\n1413\n01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:27,660\nmore options than what we had in\nthe beginning when Wes went ahead and\n\n1414\n01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:31,840\nright clicked on that unpartitioned\nspace to the right of drive C.\n\n1415\n01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,740\nBut now that it was\nconverted to a dynamic disk,\n\n1416\n01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:39,210\nit gave him the ability to create\nwhat we call a mirrored volume.\n\n1417\n01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:39,820\nOkay?\n\n1418\n01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:44,420\nThe mirrored volume means that the data\nthat is written to the Z: drive\n\n1419\n01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:48,230\nwill also be the same data that you've\nwritten out to, oh, look at that!\n\n1420\n01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:49,540\nThe Z: drive again.\n\n1421\n01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,200\nOkay?\n\n1422\n01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,900\nSo now that she is doing that,\n\n1423\n01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,670\nnow the idea of the re-syncing\nhere is ensuring that if there's\n\n1424\n01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:59,230\nany data that was on the original one,\nit's gonna also write it down here.\n\n1425\n01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:02,960\nSo if one of the two\ndrives ends up failing,\n\n1426\n01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,000\nthe other drive still has the data for us.\n\n1427\n01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:06,880\nOkay?\n\n1428\n01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,380\nYep.\n\n1429\n01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,650\nAll right.\nWell this is gonna take a second and\n\n1430\n01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:11,620\nI'm sure.\n\n1431\n01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,820\nI think we can go on with\nsome of the other volumes.\n\n1432\n01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:18,060\nNow, what I wanted to show you here,\nreally is a span volume.\n\n1433\n01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,780\nA span volume is one of\nthe things to future proof,\n\n1434\n01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:24,190\nit you will your storage\ncapacity from a limitation.\n\n1435\n01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:25,920\nNow it's not going to\ngive you any redundancy.\n\n1436\n01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,040\nAll it's going to do is take a small\ncontainer and just add more storage to it.\n\n1437\n01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,130\nSo, since this is a dynamic disk,\n\n1438\n01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:36,840\nwe need to configure this\nother disk here that's basic.\n\n1439\n01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,490\nWe need to go ahead and\nright click on that.\n\n1440\n01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:40,930\nWe convert it to a dynamic disk.\n\n1441\n01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:47,070\nAnd looks like it's dynamic now.\n\n1442\n01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:51,300\nAnd what I want to do is I want\nto take this hard drive, and\n\n1443\n01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,170\nI'm going to create a spanned volume.\n\n1444\n01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:58,970\nNow keep in mind, that if the storage\ncapacity starts to, on this one drive,\n\n1445\n01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:03,410\nstarts to reach its limit, this will\nallow us to extend that if you will to\n\n1446\n01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:06,760\na partition, if you will,\nthat is essentially attached so\n\n1447\n01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,010\nthey act as a single unit on\na another physical drive.\n\n1448\n01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:15,790\nI'm gonna do this, now here we get the\noption to select whatever hard drives we\n\n1449\n01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:23,840\nwant to put within the span volume,\nwe're going to select disk two and add.\n\n1450\n01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,210\nNow, this is going to be a little\nbit different mirror and stripe.\n\n1451\n01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:28,870\nAll right.\nMirror and\n\n1452\n01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:36,400\nstripe you have to define a single\ncapacity for the entire array if you will.\n\n1453\n01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,900\nIn this, because it's a span volume,\nwe can pick and\n\n1454\n01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,960\nchoose exactly how much space\nwe want to use for one drive.\n\n1455\n01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,280\nAnd how much space we want to use for\nthe other drive.\n\n1456\n01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,790\nSo maybe I say, on this one,\nthe very first disk, I'm gonna do.\n\n1457\n01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:49,210\nLet's see.\n\n1458\n01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,390\nMake sure I have enough space.\n\n1459\n01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:54,829\nI'll go ahead and do 10,\nI'm gonna do 10 gigs here.\n\n1460\n01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:01,174\nOn the second one,\nI'm gonna go ahead and do,\n\n1461\n01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:03,210\nlet's say\n>> Do 10 again.\n\n1462\n01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:04,080\n>> Do 10 again?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1463\n01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:04,920\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1464\n01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,460\nDo 10 again for consistency.\n\n1465\n01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:08,790\nChoose Next.\n\n1466\n01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:12,880\nNow on this one since it's our span\nvolume I'm gonna call this X for X step.\n\n1467\n01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:17,330\nNext, and we'll call this spanned.\n\n1468\n01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,180\nMaybe.\n\n1469\n01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:21,192\nWes will call it something.\n\n1470\n01:11:21,192 --> 01:11:23,750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Spanned and volume.\n\n1471\n01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:27,560\nAnd we'll do the quick format.\n\n1472\n01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,586\nThen we'll finish this.\n\n1473\n01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:34,540\n>> Yep, so in terms of the idea\nof the span volume now, right.\n\n1474\n01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:39,320\nWhat we have is now this\nparticular hard drive\n\n1475\n01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:42,900\nis going to stretch across\ntwo physical drops.\n\n1476\n01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:43,750\nSo we have a volume.\n\n1477\n01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:45,784\nThat's a logical hard drive and so\n\n1478\n01:11:45,784 --> 01:11:50,486\nthe total combined space is actually now\nacross two different hard drives given\n\n1479\n01:11:50,486 --> 01:11:54,709\nessentially a 20 gig hard drive even\nthough the space is across both.\n\n1480\n01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:59,334\nIn the span volume the way that this works\nis that the data Will be written on to\n\n1481\n01:11:59,334 --> 01:12:04,322\nthe first volume here, take up the entire\nten gigs before it starts sending it over\n\n1482\n01:12:04,322 --> 01:12:07,400\nto that second volume as what we have.\n\n1483\n01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,090\nSo, on the original data drive,\n\n1484\n01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:14,120\nthe Data Z here, that we have,\nwe created the mirror, which mean that\n\n1485\n01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:19,140\nall of the data written to one of those Z\ndrives, is also gonna be on the other one.\n\n1486\n01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:22,340\nSo any file that's copied on to\nthe one will be on the other one here.\n\n1487\n01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:26,540\nWhereas the span volume is gonna fill\nup that one particular partition\n\n1488\n01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:30,890\nx before it actually fills up\nthe next one here is what we have.\n\n1489\n01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:36,490\nOn this one, though, on the span volume,\nif we lose one of those drives,\n\n1490\n01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:40,230\nwhatever data was written on that\nother drive it's gonna be gone.\n\n1491\n01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,890\nRemember that we have no\nreal redundancy here.\n\n1492\n01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:45,550\nThe only one that we have\nany redundancy at all on,\n\n1493\n01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:49,750\nat this point, is gonna be the Z drive,\nwhich we did and we traded as a mirror.\n\n1494\n01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,560\n>> Yeah, so when we want redundancy,\n\n1495\n01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,620\nwe want more of a fault tolerance in our\ndata, obviously we're gonna do it here.\n\n1496\n01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:03,710\nIf we wanna, again, future proof it,\nif you will, if you really can do that,\n\n1497\n01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:07,820\nfuture proof it from a capacity\nlimitation what we use is a span volume.\n\n1498\n01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:09,540\nNow, keep in mind there's\nno redundancy in here.\n\n1499\n01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:13,240\nIf you lose one of the drives, you're\ngonna lose the data that's on that drive.\n\n1500\n01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,010\nThe last one here,\nmaybe we wanna do this for performance.\n\n1501\n01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:20,150\nMaybe we have frequently accessed data,\nso up until this point,\n\n1502\n01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:23,190\nmaybe we've got important data, crucial\ndata, we're going to want to mirror that.\n\n1503\n01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:24,650\nWe're going to make sure\nthat we have a backup,\n\n1504\n01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,430\njust in case one of the drives fails.\n\n1505\n01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:29,900\nMaybe non-essential general level data\nwe just put in the spanned volume.\n\n1506\n01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,090\nMaybe we've got frequently\naccessed data and\n\n1507\n01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:36,340\nwe want to make sure that its\nperformance is up to par.\n\n1508\n01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:40,800\nThe last one that we can\ndo is the striped volume.\n\n1509\n01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,765\nEssentially a software raid zero.\n\n1510\n01:13:42,765 --> 01:13:44,990\n[COUGH] Now\n\n1511\n01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:50,428\nwith this we've gotta select the disks\nthat we want to be in the volume.\n\n1512\n01:13:50,428 --> 01:13:52,810\nChoose that.\n\n1513\n01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:58,605\n[COUGH] Now on this one you're\ngonna notice that regardless of\n\n1514\n01:13:58,605 --> 01:14:02,838\nwhich one I select,\nit's gonna take the smallest one.\n\n1515\n01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:05,254\nChoose next.\n\n1516\n01:14:07,134 --> 01:14:09,108\nShould be S.\n\n1517\n01:14:09,108 --> 01:14:10,175\nPush next.\n\n1518\n01:14:14,228 --> 01:14:15,306\nStriped.\n\n1519\n01:14:18,035 --> 01:14:18,640\nAnd there we go.\n\n1520\n01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:24,510\n>> All right, now on this striped volume,\nwhat makes this thing really give\n\n1521\n01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:28,340\nus the high performance that we need\non the frequently accessed data\n\n1522\n01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:32,500\nis that the data literally is actually\nwritten across both of the drives here.\n\n1523\n01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:36,150\nSo it is actually literally striping\nthe data across both of them so\n\n1524\n01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:40,030\nthat sends the data to really\nboth drives at the same time\n\n1525\n01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:42,580\ngiving this again higher performance here.\n\n1526\n01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:47,600\nThe problem that we really do have though,\nis that in this,\n\n1527\n01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,990\nin the software array that we have,\nwe don't have any fault tolerance.\n\n1528\n01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:56,740\nSo if this one, one of the volumes\nnow gets corrupted, wel,\n\n1529\n01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:00,220\nbecause the data was striped across\nboth of these particular volumes, or\n\n1530\n01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:03,500\nthese drives here,\nit's not gonna actually help.\n\n1531\n01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:07,310\nYou actually end up losing the entire\nstripe of data, is what we have.\n\n1532\n01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:11,130\nNow the interesting thing is, Wes, how\nmany hard drives have we actually created?\n\n1533\n01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,780\nIt's easy enough to see\nin the Windows explorer.\n\n1534\n01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:13,780\n>> Yes.\nDefinitely and\n\n1535\n01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:14,970\nI was gonna leave that one there.\n\n1536\n01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:18,250\nLet's go to computer here and\nboy do we have a lot.\n\n1537\n01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,490\n>> Yep.\n\n1538\n01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:22,425\nSo now notice the overall capacities\nthat we have here, right.\n\n1539\n01:15:22,425 --> 01:15:28,800\nSo with data volume, drive Z, even though\nwe created ten gigs on one drive and\n\n1540\n01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:33,090\nten gigs on the other, notice that it's\nonly showing that there's ten gigs.\n\n1541\n01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:38,000\nSo we're really not actually again\ntaking advantage of the total capacity.\n\n1542\n01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,220\nWe again, are mirroring and\n\n1543\n01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:44,020\ntaking advantage as much as we can here of\nthe idea of redundancy which means again\n\n1544\n01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:47,250\nwhen one breaks the other one still has\nthe data on it and that's a good thing.\n\n1545\n01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:51,860\nNotice with the span volume we can\nactually choose one size hard drive and\n\n1546\n01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:55,400\nthen chose another one for later on and\nwe can choose any size we want to.\n\n1547\n01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,710\nWe made it ten of this next\nbecause it was just easy for\n\n1548\n01:15:57,710 --> 01:16:00,010\nus to remember in terms\nof the numbers here.\n\n1549\n01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:02,850\nBut the nice thing about the span volume\nis if we add another hard drive at\n\n1550\n01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:07,330\nthis point, we can still add it to\nthe span volume and continue to grow it.\n\n1551\n01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:08,320\nBut once again,\n\n1552\n01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,760\nany loss on any one of those volumes\nagain is a loss of that data.\n\n1553\n01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,000\nWith the striped volume here.\n\n1554\n01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,180\nHigh performance.\n\n1555\n01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:16,960\nNo doubt that we have.\n\n1556\n01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,740\nEven if it is using the ideal software\nthat should handle all the controls\n\n1557\n01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:24,210\ninstead of actually hardware it's\nstill going to work super fast for us,\n\n1558\n01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:25,870\nwhich is darn cool.\n\n1559\n01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:29,930\nBut at the same time, notice that it\nactually does give us the combination\n\n1560\n01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:32,030\nof how much space we\nactually have in there.\n\n1561\n01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:35,650\nOkay, so in this one again,\nhigh performance but\n\n1562\n01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:39,430\nno fault tolerance at all or\nno redundancy that we have here in place.\n\n1563\n01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:42,830\nOkay, so we don't have to go out and\nbuy some fancy hardware to do it.\n\n1564\n01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:44,630\nWe can use the Windows to do it.\n\n1565\n01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:48,350\nBut, again, we do lose the performance of\ntrue hardware, but we also lose some of\n\n1566\n01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:51,590\nthe true performance of the redundancies\nthat we really would have.\n\n1567\n01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:52,430\n>> Yeah definitely.\n\n1568\n01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:55,260\nWhen it comes down to it, anytime\nyou implement something in software\n\n1569\n01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:59,120\nyou've got to remember that you're going\nto rob processing cycles from other\n\n1570\n01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,970\ncomponents within the operating system.\n\n1571\n01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:05,640\nSo everything that's hardware accelerated\nis usually a lot more efficient.\n\n1572\n01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:09,620\n>> All right, now we're actually moving\non to our last little segment here\n\n1573\n01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:13,100\nin which we're talking about\nthe idea of removable devices.\n\n1574\n01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,570\n>> Removable devices.\n\n1575\n01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:15,440\nThat's right.\n\n1576\n01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,150\nThat's right.\n\n1577\n01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:16,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n1578\n01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:21,550\nAll right, so there might be a situation\nin a managed environment where you\n\n1579\n01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:25,800\nDon't want anybody to just be able to\nbring one of these little devices off\n\n1580\n01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,340\nout of the parking lot that they found,\nthat says virus written right on them.\n\n1581\n01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:34,450\nWell we might not want people to be able\nto attach those removable devices because\n\n1582\n01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:37,584\nby their exploitable nature,\nthey can cause problems.\n\n1583\n01:17:37,584 --> 01:17:40,630\nSo one of the things that we can\ndo is we can set a policy in here.\n\n1584\n01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:48,030\nAnd if we go back to GP edit,\nin our local group policy editor,\n\n1585\n01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:51,464\nGPedit.msc, and we launch this.\n\n1586\n01:17:56,074 --> 01:17:59,016\nAll right, now we're gonna be in\ncomputer configuration here and\n\n1587\n01:17:59,016 --> 01:18:01,285\nwe're gonna be in\nthe administrative templates.\n\n1588\n01:18:02,475 --> 01:18:04,545\nThen right here we're\ngonna go to system and\n\n1589\n01:18:05,895 --> 01:18:09,730\nthen from system we're gonna\nlook at device installation.\n\n1590\n01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:15,230\nNow you have to select device\ninstallation restrictions.\n\n1591\n01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:18,600\nAnd you're gonna see over here down,\nthere we go, second to the bottom,\n\n1592\n01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,220\nalmost to the bottom here.\n\n1593\n01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:22,580\nWe'll have this policy setting here and\n\n1594\n01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:25,920\nI believe this is the one\nthat you're talking about.\n\n1595\n01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:31,230\nThat if we enable this,\nthis is not going to allow me to use a or\n\n1596\n01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:32,740\neven plug in a USB device.\n\n1597\n01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:36,210\nAnd that might be exactly\nwhat we want to do.\n\n1598\n01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:39,870\nSo if we enable this, come up here and\n\n1599\n01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:42,810\nchoose OK,\nyou will now see that it's enabled.\n\n1600\n01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:45,220\nAnd then from here on out,\n\n1601\n01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:50,420\nwe won't be able to plug in\nthese removable devices here.\n\n1602\n01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:52,378\n>> Yeah.\nNow a lot of times for\n\n1603\n01:18:52,378 --> 01:18:56,400\nus, even though that is kind of an all or\nnothing, it's like chop off the head and\n\n1604\n01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,150\nkill the whole thing.\n\n1605\n01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,910\nWe may find out, especially inside of\ngroup policy, that we can literally\n\n1606\n01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:07,300\nrestrict it to the actual brand\nof this particular device itself.\n\n1607\n01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:10,110\nSo by using certain ideas that\nare actually on there this can actually be\n\n1608\n01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:11,260\ndone as well.\n\n1609\n01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:14,460\nIn the setting that we had in that group\npolicy there wasn't any real settings for\n\n1610\n01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:16,190\nus but it does prevent that.\n\n1611\n01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:20,310\nThe ability for someone to actually go in\nand plug in that device either to infect\n\n1612\n01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:23,600\nthe computer, or again, to actually\nbe able to remove data from it.\n\n1613\n01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,320\nAnd so, again,\nprotecting our systems here,\n\n1614\n01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:30,330\nbeing able to manage the devices that\nwe plug in, especially storage devices,\n\n1615\n01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:35,200\nis part of the idea of managing the disks\nas well, and monitoring them too.\n\n1616\n01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:41,330\nSo anything else, Wes, in terms of disc\nmanagement or the idea of updates for us?\n\n1617\n01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:43,390\n>> No,\njust when it comes to doing your updates,\n\n1618\n01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:44,870\njust make sure that you do your research.\n\n1619\n01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:48,550\nMake sure you selectively approve or\ndeny certain updates.\n\n1620\n01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:51,320\nRemember not all updates are required so\n\n1621\n01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,690\non the ones that are optional\njust pay attention.\n\n1622\n01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:56,840\nWhen it comes to drive management, just\nmake sure that you know which drive that\n\n1623\n01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,970\nyou're managing and\nthat can help out a lot.\n\n1624\n01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:01,057\n>> Right.\nAll right, so\n\n1625\n01:20:01,057 --> 01:20:06,700\nas always as we take a look at the end\nof our show here we do wanna make sure\n\n1626\n01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:11,060\nthat as we go out that you're more than\nwelcome to join us each and every day.\n\n1627\n01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:13,430\nWe're actually live each and\nevery day here.\n\n1628\n01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:16,080\nWe want you to actually have the\nopportunity of course to be able to ask\n\n1629\n01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,290\nquestions if you need to.\n\n1630\n01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:18,810\nSo we do have a chatroom for you.\n\n1631\n01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:21,540\nLive on our chat, at anytime,\nyou can actually post questions.\n\n1632\n01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,973\nWe'll actually be able to watch it and\nmonitor it and\n\n1633\n01:20:23,973 --> 01:20:27,630\nbe able to answer your questions even\nlive on air but even after the show.\n\n1634\n01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:29,352\nWe actually have a Q & A on our website.\n\n1635\n01:20:29,352 --> 01:20:31,438\nPlease do go on there and\npost questions as well.\n\n1636\n01:20:31,438 --> 01:20:32,466\nOur goal, of course,\n\n1637\n01:20:32,466 --> 01:20:35,499\nis to make sure you have the answers\nbefore you go into the exam booth\n\n1638\n01:20:35,499 --> 01:20:39,460\nrather than while you go into the exam\nbooth or while you're taking the exam.\n\n1639\n01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:43,090\nSo feel free to actually take\nthat action on our resource.\n\n1640\n01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:46,459\nDon't forget we also have a Roku\nchannel that you can also sit at and\n\n1641\n01:20:46,459 --> 01:20:47,730\nwatch as well.\n\n1642\n01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:50,780\nSo for ITProTV, my name is Ronnie Wong.\n\n1643\n01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,509\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n1644\n01:20:52,509 --> 01:20:53,449\n>> Signing off.\n\n1645\n01:20:53,449

Nathan Copeland, here with Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:37,965\n>> How you doing, Nate?\n\n5\n00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:38,855\n>> Pretty good, Wes.\n\n6\n00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:39,425\nHow are you today?\n\n7\n00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:41,145\n>> Doing okay, thanks for having me back.\n\n8\n00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:41,965\n>> Oh yeah.\nNo doubt.\n\n9\n00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:42,490\n>> It's good to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:47,395\n>> It's been a while,\nI had this same conversation with Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:49,485\nIt's been awhile since we\ndid an episode together.\n\n12\n00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:50,155\n>> That's right.\n\n13\n00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:53,255\n>> I guess maybe I'm the one\nthat hasn't been doing episodes.\n\n14\n00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:54,225\n>> No, no, no.\n\n15\n00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:55,737\nIt's definitely been me.\n\n16\n00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:57,690\n[LAUGH] But it is good to be back here.\n\n17\n00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,190\nRight on.\n\n18\n00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,760\nToday, we're going to continue\non with monitoring and\n\n19\n00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,840\nmaintaining Windows 7 and today,\n\n20\n00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,700\nwe're going to pick up on the official\nobjectives, once I pull those guys up.\n\n21\n00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,340\nSo on the official objectives,\nwe'll be starting with monitoring systems.\n\n22\n00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,440\nThings with event logs,\nevent subscriptions, really cool.\n\n23\n00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:30,180\nWhere you can have computers collect\nevents from other machines and\n\n24\n00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,370\nhave them in one place.\n\n25\n00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,119\nPretty neat stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:39,290\nNow, we get into data collector sets and\nthose sorts of things where we can get\n\n27\n00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,880\nperformance reports, we can get baselines,\nand really neat fancy stuff there.\n\n28\n00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,430\nThen to finish it off,\nconfigure performance settings and\n\n29\n00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,010\nthese end up kind of\nbeing across the board.\n\n30\n00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,790\nSo we've actually got network performance\nsettings, we've got desktop environment,\n\n31\n00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,015\nwhere you configure our theme,\nand those sorts of things.\n\n32\n00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:00,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n33\n00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,460\n>> Then to finish it off,\nwe've got power plans,\n\n34\n00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,610\nand mobile computing performance stuff.\n\n35\n00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,210\n>> That's right.\n\n36\n00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,590\n>> Yeah, quite far across the board there.\n\n37\n00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,230\n>> It really is.\n\n38\n00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,150\n>> So some neat things that we can do to\nmonitor and maintain our client systems.\n\n39\n00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,870\n>> Yup.\n\n40\n00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,650\n>> So to start this thing off with,\n\n41\n00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,945\nwe'll jump into event collector sets,\nand event logs.\n\n42\n00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:25,850\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n43\n00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,340\n>> So the idea is to where we\ncan have a group of PCs and\n\n44\n00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,510\nwe can have a management PC,\nwhether it's domain controller or\n\n45\n00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:40,570\nsome other PC that we designate as\nthe head PC and then go out and\n\n46\n00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,770\ncollect the event logs from\nthese other PCs all around.\n\n47\n00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,670\nWhat kind of scenarios or\nsituations would we set this up in?\n\n48\n00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,960\nWhat would we want to collect?\n\n49\n00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,320\n>> It really depends.\n\n50\n00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,870\nThink about it in a situation where you've\ngot a completely decentralized networking\n\n51\n00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,030\nmodel, where you literally have to go to\nevery single individual computer and for\n\n52\n00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,880\nsome reason, there's an issue that seems\nto be manifesting itself on more than\n\n53\n00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,990\none computer.\n\n54\n00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,720\nWhat do I have to do?\n\n55\n00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,340\nI have to go computer to computer, and I\nhave to pull up the individual event logs\n\n56\n00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,410\nfor every computer that I'm inspecting.\n\n57\n00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,440\nIt would be more efficient, and\nit would be less administrative effort,\n\n58\n00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,300\nif I could have a centralized monitoring\nstation and that my computers,\n\n59\n00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,550\nlet's say if they're on different floors.\n\n60\n00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,770\nMaybe we got scenarios where there\nare different floors and because I'm lazy,\n\n61\n00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,445\nI don't wanna have to walk\nto the different floors.\n\n62\n00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I could have centralized solution that\n\n63\n00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,120\ncan collect all this information for\nme, have it in one location for\n\n64\n00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,970\nall of my computers and there again,\nan ease of administration.\n\n65\n00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,340\nSome things that you might wanna see.\n\n66\n00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,890\nMaybe you had a power failure.\n\n67\n00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,140\nYou had a power failure not sure exactly\nwhat time you had a power failure.\n\n68\n00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:53,400\nWell, your event logs within Windows\nwill show you an event like that and you\n\n69\n00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,620\ncan go in here and say okay, I see that\nthe power failure happened at 3:30 AM.\n\n70\n00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,110\nMaybe, for some reason,\nyour computers aren't contacting DNS and\n\n71\n00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,030\nyou wanna figure out\nwhy is that happening?\n\n72\n00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,850\nWell, guess what?\n\n73\n00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,820\nDNS client doesn't start,\nthat's gonna show up in the logs too.\n\n74\n00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,530\nWe can do a little bit of\ninvestigative report, maybe turn into\n\n75\n00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,790\nColumbo [LAUGH] and figure out why\nsome of the services aren't working.\n\n76\n00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,860\nSo anything really that pops up in our\nevent logs are things that we can collect.\n\n77\n00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,622\nSo we can collect things\nlike log on events or\n\n78\n00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:32,200\nperhaps, maybe there's one particular\nprogram that we're looking to see if\n\n79\n00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,320\nit is being installed, or if a particular\nuser is trying to access a resource.\n\n80\n00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,050\nMaybe, if you have auditing turned on, I\nwant to make sure nobody is trying to get\n\n81\n00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,320\ninto this folder, and I told them no,\nand if they do, I need to find out, so\n\n82\n00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,602\nthat we can talk to this person and\nwhatever.\n\n83\n00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:54,060\nSo you can set those event collections,\nwhereas that event is logged and\n\n84\n00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,600\nyou I guess click them all different PC's.\n\n85\n00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,410\n>> Oh yeah, definitely.\n\n86\n00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,480\nEspecially with something like\nNate's saying like security.\n\n87\n00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,070\nWith security, a lot of times, if there's\nsome kind of attack against your network,\n\n88\n00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,780\nno matter how good the attacker or\nhacker is, they always leave some kind of\n\n89\n00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,270\ntrace remnant behind that you\ncan go in and investigate.\n\n90\n00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,430\nWell, those security logs.\n\n91\n00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,840\nMaybe I want to figure out around\nwhat time this attack occurred.\n\n92\n00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,780\nI can go into the security logs in\nevent field and what I can do is look\n\n93\n00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,505\nat the failed log in attempts and maybe I\nsee a bunch of failed to log in attempts,\n\n94\n00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:29,195\nthen right at the same time, all of the\nsudden, I see a successful log in attempt.\n\n95\n00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,665\nWell, I'm not sure that's\ngoing to give you some sign or\n\n96\n00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:33,005\nindication of some sort\nof brute force attack but\n\n97\n00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:36,335\nit can then lead you to gathering a little\nbit more information that might come\n\n98\n00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:40,125\nto a solution,\nwhatever the problem might have been.\n\n99\n00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,220\n>> Mm-hm.\nSo Wes,\n\n100\n00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:48,180\nin order to collect these event logs and\nstuff, what pieces are we looking at?\n\n101\n00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,630\nWhat do we need,\ninfrastructure, setup-wise?\n\n102\n00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,260\n>> That's right.\nOne of the easiest ways to set this up is\n\n103\n00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,620\nreally in a domain-based environment cuz\nthen you can use authentication through\n\n104\n00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,210\nKerberos within\nthe Active Directory domain.\n\n105\n00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,890\nNow you can set this up in\na work group environment but\n\n106\n00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:07,730\nit definitely requires a lot\nmore administrative overhead.\n\n107\n00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,910\nYou have to go trust the computers,\nmake sure they're in local accounts.\n\n108\n00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,230\nSo what we're going to do is, one of these\nthat you would, a setup if you will,\n\n109\n00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:21,910\nwith the event subscriptions that we'd\nsee commonly in a larger environment\n\n110\n00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:27,730\non our computer that is\ngoing to send events.\n\n111\n00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:32,405\nWe have to run a program called\nthe Windows Remote Management Utility and\n\n112\n00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:36,335\nwhat this does, essentially, is that it\nopens up the firewall and lets an inbound\n\n113\n00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:43,415\ncommunication come through and the source\ncomputer where you collect everything,\n\n114\n00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:49,375\nall these events can actually\ntrigger an event subscription.\n\n115\n00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:54,395\nOr, it could just be the computer\nthat your monitoring,\n\n116\n00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:58,340\ncan also trigger the event forwarding,\nif you will.\n\n117\n00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,980\nSo on the PC side of the computer\nthat you want to monitor the events,\n\n118\n00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,090\nwhat you do is you end up running\nthe Windows Remote Management Utility.\n\n119\n00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,550\nThen on the computer that is gonna\ncollect all of your event subscriptions,\n\n120\n00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,730\nyou're gonna run\nthe Windows Event Collector Utility and\n\n121\n00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,550\nthat's a little command line\nutility that you could run.\n\n122\n00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,840\nAsks you a couple of questions, and there\nagain, it's gonna open the firewall for\n\n123\n00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,320\nyou and have it all prepared.\n\n124\n00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,095\nMm-hm.\n\n125\n00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:27,225\n>> Nice.\n\n126\n00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:27,865\nYou you know what?\n\n127\n00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:31,505\nSo we've been talking about this Event\nViewer and these events in collecting this\n\n128\n00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:34,945\nstuff but we haven't yet\ntaken a look at Event Viewer.\n\n129\n00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:39,177\n>> Sure.\n>> So, again, we can use my PC here.\n\n130\n00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:40,157\n>> Sure.\n\n131\n00:07:40,157 --> 00:07:45,328\n>> Now to get into the good old event,\nwe'll browse into our\n\n132\n00:07:45,328 --> 00:07:50,717\ncontrol panel and\nwe'll go into the System and Security and\n\n133\n00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:57,537\nthen down in Administrative tools,\nwe have the Event Viewer right there.\n\n134\n00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:59,047\nWe'll open this guy up.\n\n135\n00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:02,127\nNow, right away, it looks pretty busy.\n\n136\n00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:02,920\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n137\n00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,160\n>> There's a lot of things to click\non a lot of windows to look at.\n\n138\n00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,310\nNow, we can filter these event logs.\n\n139\n00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,520\nTo I guess,\nto find what word am I looking for?\n\n140\n00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,010\nOr at least, narrow it down to\nwhere there's not so much stuff.\n\n141\n00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,030\n>> That's right.\n\n142\n00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,040\nNow one of the things that's really\nimportant with that is, you'll see,\n\n143\n00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,780\nwe're going to talk about some different\nlevel of events that can happen, or\n\n144\n00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,150\nthat you can see and\nhappen from time to time.\n\n145\n00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,000\nAnd one of the ones that\nseems to fill up the logs is\n\n146\n00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,370\njust generalized information events.\n\n147\n00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,590\nSo for instance, when your computer\nstarts up and DHCP client comes online.\n\n148\n00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,230\nIt says service successfully started or\nservice successfully stopped.\n\n149\n00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,100\nSome of that information\nmight not be important to us.\n\n150\n00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,600\nMaybe we're looking at it at a certain\npoint in time when we had some kind of\n\n151\n00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,430\nerror or some kind of event that\ncaused a crash within a program.\n\n152\n00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,360\nWell, we can filter the log.\n\n153\n00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,550\nAnd we can filter it to exactly\nwhat it is that we're looking for.\n\n154\n00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,350\nAnd this can help eliminate some\nof the non-essential stuff.\n\n155\n00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,720\nAnd I'm not saying that the information\nevents aren't essential or important,\n\n156\n00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,590\nthey are.\n\n157\n00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,260\nBut maybe in your current situation,\nyou don't wanna go through 480 information\n\n158\n00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,000\nevents just to get to the one warning or\nerror that you're looking for.\n\n159\n00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,858\nSo, filtering definitely helps out a lot.\n\n160\n00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:17,850\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n161\n00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,990\nLet's do that, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,490\n>> Sure.\n\n163\n00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,660\n>> Let's filter this thing out.\n\n164\n00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,540\nSo, if we expand out the windows logs,\nwe've got these different ones.\n\n165\n00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,690\nWe've got applications,\nsecurity, setup, system.\n\n166\n00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,340\nWe have forwarded events.\n\n167\n00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> Which I think we'll get into here\n\n168\n00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,300\nin a minute.\n\n169\n00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,200\n>> Definitely.\n\n170\n00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,080\n>> And so,\njust in application logs, right?\n\n171\n00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,910\nCertain applications\nthat installed in there.\n\n172\n00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,810\nThey have any errors or any problems\nlike that, it would go in there.\n\n173\n00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,640\nSecurity logs generally are going\nto be our logon events.\n\n174\n00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,430\nThose sorts of things are.\n\n175\n00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,570\n>> Like you mentioned earlier,\nfile object access, a shared resource.\n\n176\n00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,310\nHey, we now know that somebody's\naccessed the shared and\n\n177\n00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,568\nwe can see evidence of that.\n\n178\n00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:00,415\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n179\n00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:01,270\nYep, yep.\n\n180\n00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,950\nAnd then we've got setup log, right?\n\n181\n00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,680\nProbably.\n\n182\n00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,890\nYeah, really cool stuff\nstuff in setup log.\n\n183\n00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,960\nWithin system.\n\n184\n00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,540\nSystem is gonna be where the bulk\nof the logs are gonna go.\n\n185\n00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,600\nNow, right away,\njust a bunch of information stuff.\n\n186\n00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,540\nLook, we got a firewall issue.\n\n187\n00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,690\nWhat?\n\n188\n00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,660\nFirewall issue.\n\n189\n00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,970\nAll right so, we've got a number of\ndifferent types of logs, right?.\n\n190\n00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,870\nSo we've got these information logs,\nkind of harmless.\n\n191\n00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,060\nJust things that happen,\nsomething has started.\n\n192\n00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,000\nRight here it says, the diagnostic system\nhost service entered the stopped state.\n\n193\n00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,705\nWell cool, doesn't really affect\nme in browsing internet for\n\n194\n00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:42,565\nlike funny cat pictures.\n\n195\n00:10:42,565 --> 00:10:44,535\n>> You're not really going to\nlose any sleep over that one.\n\n196\n00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:45,055\n>> No.\n\n197\n00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:48,930\nNo.\nBut stuff that is still logged, right?\n\n198\n00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,708\nWe have error events, right?\n\n199\n00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:58,380\nA little bit more critical, but you know,\nthe firewall service terminated.\n\n200\n00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:05,790\nIf I float my mouse there and raise this\nwindow up a little bit and mouse down.\n\n201\n00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,150\nClick on that.\n\n202\n00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,580\nWe do have some information\nhere about this event.\n\n203\n00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:16,140\nDown here in general, it tells us,\nand you know, not too bad.\n\n204\n00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,350\nSometimes, you know, these windows events.\n\n205\n00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,740\n>> Very generic.\n\n206\n00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,760\n>> The errors on them, very,\nvery generic, but so yeah, not bad.\n\n207\n00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,280\nAnd we have some information down here\nthat, you know, event ID's and things that\n\n208\n00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,090\nwe can use to research the problem,\na little bit to find more out about it.\n\n209\n00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,840\nThen on the details tab.\n\n210\n00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,050\nWe can drill down into it.\n\n211\n00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,650\nAnd get some information that may or\nmay not be helpful,\n\n212\n00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,220\nto getting down to\nthe core of the problem.\n\n213\n00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,870\n>> Sure.\n\n214\n00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,173\nI think it's interesting, as I said\nat the beginning, a service stops or\n\n215\n00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:53,130\na service starts and a service stops.\n\n216\n00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,030\nThose are information events.\n\n217\n00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,350\nAnd they're not important.\n\n218\n00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,480\nThe first thing we look at is a service\nthat stopped that generated an error.\n\n219\n00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,590\nAnd that's the firewall service.\n\n220\n00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,070\nThat's one service that you\ndefinitely don't want to stop.\n\n221\n00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,550\nAnd we can see that here.\n\n222\n00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,890\nNow, If you'll look in some of those,\nwhether it's information,\n\n223\n00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,850\nwhether it's warning, you're gonna see\nthat event ID that Nate was mentioning.\n\n224\n00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,720\nThat's very important,\nbecause you can take that event ID.\n\n225\n00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,040\nYou can go to Microsoft\ndirectly if you want to.\n\n226\n00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,090\nYou can open your web browser.\n\n227\n00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,990\nYou can plug that event ID in.\n\n228\n00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,900\nSometimes, they're generic.\n\n229\n00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,240\nSometimes, you'll get\na list back that says,\n\n230\n00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,820\nhey, one of these ten things could happen.\n\n231\n00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,670\nAnd then, it's up to you to figure out\nwhich one of those ten things happen.\n\n232\n00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,780\nAnd sometimes, they're very specific.\n\n233\n00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,740\nFor instance, it says, maybe,\nthe DNS client couldn't resolve a name or\n\n234\n00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,360\ncouldn't contact\nthe Window's update server.\n\n235\n00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,070\nSo again, sometimes they can be generic.\n\n236\n00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,610\nSometimes, they can be\na little bit more specific.\n\n237\n00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,730\nBut when you look at\none of these event IDs,\n\n238\n00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,150\nyou can plug them into a search engine.\n\n239\n00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,900\nYou could check out things\nlike www.social.microsoft.com.\n\n240\n00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,990\nAnd there's forum,\ncommunity-based forums out there.\n\n241\n00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,900\nAnd I could almost guarantee you,\nnot always, but almost guarantee you,\n\n242\n00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,460\nthat if you come across Event ID,\nthat's run on your computer.\n\n243\n00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,062\nThere's probably been a few\nmore people before you,\n\n244\n00:13:04,062 --> 00:13:05,190\nthat have had that same, Event ID.\n\n245\n00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,980\n>> So\nthere are a number of events in here.\n\n246\n00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,934\nAll right so, up here at the top,\nthe number of events 5,162.\n\n247\n00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:16,152\nNow, trying to parse through this.\n\n248\n00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:20,483\nIt could be a bit of a task,\nin itself, right?\n\n249\n00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:22,247\nIt's like okay well, clear my calendar,\n\n250\n00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:24,110\nI've gotta sift through\nall this stuff and.\n\n251\n00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,195\n>> Well, if you're getting paid hourly.\n\n252\n00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:26,875\n>> I know, yeah.\n\n253\n00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,730\nIt's all hey, it's all by the hour.\n\n254\n00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,735\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now what we can do,\n\n255\n00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:32,060\nis we can filter this thing out.\n\n256\n00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,265\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n257\n00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:38,391\n>> All right so over here, under the\nactions, we have the filter current log.\n\n258\n00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:41,130\nOf course, we just current L.\n\n259\n00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,200\nBut current log.\n\n260\n00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,780\nAnd then, we can filter this thing out.\n\n261\n00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,570\nNow, we have a few little\ncategories here right?\n\n262\n00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,188\nSo we can filter by critical events,\narea events, warnings,\n\n263\n00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:55,233\nthose informational events and then,\nwe can check here for verbose.\n\n264\n00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:57,785\nVerbose is just really detailed.\n\n265\n00:13:57,785 --> 00:14:02,560\nIf we need to get down to know\neverything that there is about it,\n\n266\n00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,700\nwe click on verbose.\n\n267\n00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,890\nSo we can just click on, we'll just do,\nhow about just criticals and warnings.\n\n268\n00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,000\n>> Yeah, I usually do the three.\n\n269\n00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,426\nI always have to put error in there,\nbut that's just me.\n\n270\n00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:18,800\n>> All right, if we wanted to look for\na particular event ID,\n\n271\n00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,840\nwe can enter this in there,\nif we knew what event ID we were after.\n\n272\n00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,160\nNow, if there's a particular event\nlike let's say, some kind of,\n\n273\n00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,085\nI don't know, audit event or something.\n\n274\n00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:29,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That you know,\n\n275\n00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,399\nwe could quickly filter down there just\nto look for that particular event.\n\n276\n00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,860\nAnd other key words, and\nthose sorts of things.\n\n277\n00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,020\nA particular user or\ncomputer that is logged in there.\n\n278\n00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,450\nLet me just click Cancel\non that right quick.\n\n279\n00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,650\nSo we can see over here for the user,\nfor this information one right here,\n\n280\n00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,580\nit says, Windows Defender service\nentered the running state.\n\n281\n00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,430\nOkay, well, that's good, I'm glad it did.\n\n282\n00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,043\nAnd down here, the user, right?\n\n283\n00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:58,920\nNot available is a system service.\n\n284\n00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,120\nBut for the computer, right?\n\n285\n00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,030\nCKBWCL8.\n\n286\n00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:05,220\nSo that is the computer for\nthis event log.\n\n287\n00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,440\nAnd if we were to filter this, right?\n\n288\n00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,150\nSo we can filter by those computers and\nusers there.\n\n289\n00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,200\nBut I will check these three off and\nclick OK.\n\n290\n00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,800\nAnd pretty quick.\n\n291\n00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,170\nAnd so now, all those informational\nevents have been filtered out.\n\n292\n00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,620\nAnd so now, we can drill down in here and\nlook at the core things.\n\n293\n00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,960\nIt looks like there is a number of\nwarnings, more so than I thought.\n\n294\n00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,996\nThere is something that is not happy.\n\n295\n00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:35,500\nA WLAN, Wes,\ndo you have an idea what WLAN might be?\n\n296\n00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,190\n>> I would say, something to\ndo with your wireless adapter.\n\n297\n00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:39,985\n>> I would think so.\n\n298\n00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:43,620\n>> [LAUGH] But it's interesting you've\ngot some PNP stuff going on in there.\n\n299\n00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,040\n>> Yes, I told you.\n\n300\n00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,514\n>> Plug and play, the ACPI,\n\n301\n00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:54,025\nthe application configuration power\ninterface isn't working right for you.\n\n302\n00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:56,958\n>> Yeah, on this XPS12.\n\n303\n00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,010\nSo I've loaded Windows 7 onto it.\n\n304\n00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,130\nSo that we can use Windows 7\nto run these series of shows.\n\n305\n00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:06,990\nAnd there's been some really quirky\nthings going into this PC so\n\n306\n00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,400\nI guess I'm not terribly\nsurprised to see that there's,\n\n307\n00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,255\nit had just a number of problems.\n\n308\n00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:16,810\n>> Say, what you have done\nif you had to check error,\n\n309\n00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,335\nyou wouldn't be able to see\nall them nice red list.\n\n310\n00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:23,154\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Windows 7 man this thing is junk,\n\n311\n00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:26,100\nnothing ever works.\n\n312\n00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,800\nWindows 7 isn't junk though,\nit's a good operating system.\n\n313\n00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,018\n>> Well, you also mentioned by filtering\nby event ID, if you go back to your\n\n314\n00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:38,652\nfilter log there and let's say that maybe\nwe don't want all that information,\n\n315\n00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:40,609\nmaybe we just want event ID 11.\n\n316\n00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,460\nSee if we can get a little more specific.\n\n317\n00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,700\nThere we go, all of them right there.\n\n318\n00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,930\nSo, you can filter down and\n\n319\n00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,020\nyou can really isolate the specific\nevents you're looking for.\n\n320\n00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,780\nYou'll see in their keywords like for\ninstance, we're talking about maybe some\n\n321\n00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,530\nsecurity auditing and I don't really wanna\nsee every successful authentication.\n\n322\n00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,530\nI don't wanna see every time\nthe system accessed a resource.\n\n323\n00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:17,440\nWhat I wanna see is just maybe\naudit the failed log in attempts.\n\n324\n00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,420\nAnd what I can do is I can\ngo in here to keyword.\n\n325\n00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,400\nWe press the down arrow and\nwe choose audit failure and\n\n326\n00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,750\nfailure login if you will,\nno, it'd be audit failure.\n\n327\n00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,998\nAnd what you can do is you can just narrow\nit down on that specific subject or\n\n328\n00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:35,275\nkeyword as you go.\n\n329\n00:17:35,275 --> 00:17:36,715\n>> We can save these filters,\n\n330\n00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:40,835\nwe can call them up later that perhaps if\nthere was something we were looking for.\n\n331\n00:17:40,835 --> 00:17:44,535\nSo the next time that we\ncome into event viewer,\n\n332\n00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:50,100\nwe can call up those filters and\nbe able to browse things pretty quickly.\n\n333\n00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,840\nSo, Wes, now we've got application\nsecurity and setup system.\n\n334\n00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,480\nBut then these forwarded event,\nso on my machine there are none.\n\n335\n00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,130\n>> Yep, yep.\n\n336\n00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:00,920\n>> Right.\n\n337\n00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,550\n>> This would be a log for your collector.\n\n338\n00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,240\nWe talked about\nWindows Events Collector Utility.\n\n339\n00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,820\nThis would be on the system that's gonna\ncollect all of those event subscriptions.\n\n340\n00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:18,830\nSo when a computer that is\nconfigured to forward events,\n\n341\n00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,890\nthe collector machine again collects them,\nimagine that.\n\n342\n00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,530\nThen, they show up in the forward events\nand you gotta work in between your forward\n\n343\n00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:32,610\nevents and your subscriptions there too as\nwell which we're gonna see here in a bit.\n\n344\n00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,810\n>> I guess, should we jump into that?\n\n345\n00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,560\n>> Sounds good to me.\n\n346\n00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,270\nAll right, so\nI'm in Windows 7 here as well, all right.\n\n347\n00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,230\nAnd one of the first things you wanna\ndo is you wanna make sure that you run\n\n348\n00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,270\na command that is called WinRM,\nthat's Windows Remote Management.\n\n349\n00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,560\nAnd it's something that\nneeds to be enabled and\n\n350\n00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,960\nfirewall exceptions need to be\nmade in order for this to work.\n\n351\n00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,740\nSo this is on the computer that is\ngonna send its events to the collector,\n\n352\n00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,740\nif you will, the collection computer.\n\n353\n00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,610\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nlaunch my command prompt.\n\n354\n00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:14,750\nLet me go ahead and make this\nridiculously small font bigger here.\n\n355\n00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,930\nGive everybody headaches\nout there trying to see it.\n\n356\n00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:25,261\nAll right, what we're gonna do is,\nyou need to run winrm,\n\n357\n00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:28,998\nthen space,\nall one word is gonna be quickconfig.\n\n358\n00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,270\nAll right, make sure Wes is\nin fact spelled that right.\n\n359\n00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,860\nAll right, and\nit's gonna ask us a couple questions.\n\n360\n00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,090\nIt's gonna say, it's not receiving\nrequests on this machine at all.\n\n361\n00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,500\nRemember, we have\na firewall blocking this so\n\n362\n00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,890\nit's gonna ask us do we want to\nstart this service, and say yes.\n\n363\n00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,980\nAll right, and\nthen it's gonna ask us if we wanna open up\n\n364\n00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,475\nthe Windows Remote Manager Listener, and\nif we do this which you're gonna have to,\n\n365\n00:19:58,475 --> 00:20:04,340\n[LAUGH]\nwe're gonna say yes.\n\n366\n00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,020\nAnd you can see now that\nit's opened up the firewall.\n\n367\n00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,850\nNow with this, here, we're still not done.\n\n368\n00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:16,530\nOn this machine or any machine that you're\ngonna run this event collector utility or\n\n369\n00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,930\nyou are gonna allow this computer to\nforward events remember, the collector's\n\n370\n00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,850\ngonna have to communicate with this\ncomputer so the collector machine is gonna\n\n371\n00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,680\nhave to be placed in the local\nadministrative account on this computer.\n\n372\n00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,860\nSo that will be the next step that\nwe have to verify that we do.\n\n373\n00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,150\nSo I'm gonna go to computer\nmanagement here or computer.\n\n374\n00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,580\nLet's try computer management.\n\n375\n00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,709\nRight-click Computer, choose Manage.\n\n376\n00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,956\nAnd where we're going here is we're\ngonna go into the users node here.\n\n377\n00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,700\nOr, groups node, excuse me.\n\n378\n00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,720\nLet's see if we can add\nthis directly here.\n\n379\n00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,070\nYou'll see that I have my groups node and\nthe administrator group here.\n\n380\n00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,190\nAnd we're gonna do an add.\n\n381\n00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,430\nYou can see domain administrator,\nlocal administrator, user01,\n\n382\n00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,010\njust the local administrative\naccount that I've created.\n\n383\n00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:10,290\nAnd one of the things that you'll wanna\ndo and you probably have seen this in\n\n384\n00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,000\nsome of the other episodes when they\ntalk about this interface here,\n\n385\n00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,040\nis when you select object types,\nit's not gonna search for computers.\n\n386\n00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,330\nAnd remember, that's what we need to do.\n\n387\n00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:22,430\nWe need to put the collector computer\nin the local administration group here.\n\n388\n00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,050\nSo we go to Object types,\nmake sure that we select Computer.\n\n389\n00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,240\nAnd then my computer name here, I'm gonna\ndo this from the domain controller and\n\n390\n00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,690\nI've made it kinda simple for\nmy spelling abilities.\n\n391\n00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,615\nI've called it DC.\n\n392\n00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:37,575\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll see, do a check name here, and\n\n393\n00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:38,115\nthere it is.\n\n394\n00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:40,455\nIt comes up, okay.\n\n395\n00:21:40,455 --> 00:21:44,405\nAnd now we've got that DC in there,\nin the local administrative group,\n\n396\n00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:47,945\nwhich is okay and so far so good.\n\n397\n00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:53,680\nHopefully, this computer now is ready\nto start helping us forward events,\n\n398\n00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,280\nif you will, to our collector machine.\n\n399\n00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:02,740\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\nswitch over to the domain controller.\n\n400\n00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,000\nNow, on the domain controller or\nthe collector computer,\n\n401\n00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,890\nit just happens to be a domain\ncontroller in this case.\n\n402\n00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,793\nWe have to start the Windows\nevent collector service.\n\n403\n00:22:23,248 --> 00:22:24,941\nOh, I think I actually made that worse.\n\n404\n00:22:24,941 --> 00:22:29,975\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n405\n00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:35,158\nwhen you run this utility,\nthis is gonna be wecutil and\n\n406\n00:22:35,158 --> 00:22:40,452\nkinda like the quick config\nthat we did on the other one,\n\n407\n00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:45,900\nthe other machine,\nonly it's gonna be abbreviated QC.\n\n408\n00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,600\nAnd it's gonna ask us do\nwe wanna change the Windows\n\n409\n00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,810\nevent collector service\nto a delayed start.\n\n410\n00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,072\nWe'll say yes, and\nit says it's configured successfully.\n\n411\n00:23:00,072 --> 00:23:04,648\nYou're gonna want to go ahead and\nmake sure that this service has started.\n\n412\n00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:08,800\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo this by going to the start menu and\n\n413\n00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,880\nservices right there.\n\n414\n00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,860\nName column you can filter, my alphabet if\nyou want, just type the letter W there.\n\n415\n00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,850\nAnd let's see, where is it,\nevent collector.\n\n416\n00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,780\nOkay, it is started.\n\n417\n00:23:21,882 --> 00:23:23,510\nAll right, so\nthis is the service if you will,\n\n418\n00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,680\nthat we essentially just started\nthrough the command prompt there.\n\n419\n00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,280\nAnd you can see that it changes\nit to an automatic delay and\n\n420\n00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,229\nthat's service is started.\n\n421\n00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,220\nSo now what we're going to do, remember at\nthis point we're on the collector machine.\n\n422\n00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,420\nSo on the collector machine,\n\n423\n00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:42,580\nwe still need to setup event viewer\nto receive those forwarded events.\n\n424\n00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,430\nAnd to do that,\nwe need to create event subscriptions.\n\n425\n00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,800\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna go to Start button here.\n\n426\n00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,910\nAnd I like the way that\nyou went to Event viewer.\n\n427\n00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,555\nOops, it didn't go that way right?\n\n428\n00:23:57,555 --> 00:24:02,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's just because it\n\n429\n00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,935\nopen up Computer Management, it's got all\nother stuff in there that we don't need.\n\n430\n00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:07,332\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n431\n00:24:07,332 --> 00:24:08,960\nwe're gonna go to subscriptions here.\n\n432\n00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,620\nWell, there's a problem.\n\n433\n00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,250\nI don't have any subscriptions.\n\n434\n00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,137\nSo what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna right-click,\n\n435\n00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:19,719\nwe're gonna choose create a subscription,\nand that computer's name, I'm gonna,\n\n436\n00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:22,090\nthe naming convention\nyou use is up to you.\n\n437\n00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,630\nI'm just gonna name the subscription after\nthe computer that I wanna create here.\n\n438\n00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,510\nAnd what I'm going to do is\nWindows logs here, and again,\n\n439\n00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,900\nthe description is up to you.\n\n440\n00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,720\nWhat we're going to do here,\n\n441\n00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,770\nmaybe you want to be a little\nbit more specific than that.\n\n442\n00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,710\nWhat I want to do is generate some\ninformation in this log as quick\n\n443\n00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,860\nas possible, so\nI'm saying all the Windows logs.\n\n444\n00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,990\nSo hopefully,\n\n445\n00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,690\none of those logs will generate something\nthat we can see here on the screen.\n\n446\n00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,130\nBut now, we got to select Computers, and\n\n447\n00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,090\nyou're going to add\na domain computer here.\n\n448\n00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:57,160\nAnd we're going to look for\nWin7 here, hopefully he finds it.\n\n449\n00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,760\nThere it is.\n\n450\n00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,690\nAll right, Win7, but\nnow what we want to do is test.\n\n451\n00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:08,990\nWithe got a good result here,\nconnectivity test succeeded.\n\n452\n00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,286\nBut one thing you might get,\n\n453\n00:25:10,286 --> 00:25:13,479\nis you might get a warming that says\ncan't get contact that computer.\n\n454\n00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,743\nAnd what you're going to want to\ndo is go over to the computer and\n\n455\n00:25:15,743 --> 00:25:17,980\nmake sure that the firewall\nexception was truly created.\n\n456\n00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,390\nI had this problem before\nwhere it's what is going on.\n\n457\n00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,950\nAnd then you move back\nover to that computer and\n\n458\n00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:26,600\nyou realize the firewall's not\nallowing that inbound communication.\n\n459\n00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,200\nSo this is good, gonna say okay to this.\n\n460\n00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,715\nNow, here I could use the machine,\nI could use the DC.\n\n461\n00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:39,020\nBu, you also have the option to choose\nAdvanced and I can use a specific account.\n\n462\n00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,050\nAnd I could come in here and\n\n463\n00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:44,860\nI could enter the administrator's\nsuper secret password, say OK.\n\n464\n00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,170\nAnd now what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna\nsay, don't use the machine account.\n\n465\n00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:51,330\nGo ahead and use my account,\nthe administrative account.\n\n466\n00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,760\nAnd I could change some other things here,\nbut we're not gonna change optimization,\n\n467\n00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,470\ndelivery optimization or\nanything like that.\n\n468\n00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,900\nAnd now I need to figure out what\nevent log, where's my events?\n\n469\n00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,120\nThere it is.\n\n470\n00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,850\nWhat events it is that I want to collect.\n\n471\n00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:15,480\nCritical, Error, Warning and\nInformation and the logs themselves.\n\n472\n00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,978\n>> Sorry didn't mean to jump in there.\n\n473\n00:26:16,978 --> 00:26:18,530\n>> Oh, no, no it's okay.\n\n474\n00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,640\n>> Now with these description events,\nof course,\n\n475\n00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,980\nnow we would be looking to collect\nperhaps a particular one or depending on\n\n476\n00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,860\nwhat it is that we're actually doing now,\nfor our intents and purposes.\n\n477\n00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,670\nSo event collectors,\nonce we initiate the subscription,\n\n478\n00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:39,420\nit does take a minute or two for\nthese to start coming in, and so yeah.\n\n479\n00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,820\nSo we're gonna check off all of them,\n\n480\n00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,360\nso no matter, the very first one,\nit gets logged.\n\n481\n00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,580\nHopefully, it should, it will.\n\n482\n00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,603\n>> We don't want to take you guys out\nfishing and not catch a fish here.\n\n483\n00:26:50,603 --> 00:26:54,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Be very specific,\n\n484\n00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,580\nthis is only one machine.\n\n485\n00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,650\nAnd it's gonna generate hundreds\nof logs by a single machine that's\n\n486\n00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,860\nforwarding events.\n\n487\n00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,860\nAnd like we were talking about\ndoing this in environment.\n\n488\n00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,290\nCan you imagine having 500 computers\n\n489\n00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,350\nthat might be going back\nto this collection system?\n\n490\n00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,890\nYou might have to add another hard drive.\n\n491\n00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:13,630\nLogs, we've said in other episodes,\ngotta be careful with logs.\n\n492\n00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,780\nWhile it's good, if you don't\ncheck them and you don't use them,\n\n493\n00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,490\nyou're gonna accrue hard drive space.\n\n494\n00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,882\nAnd that's gonna cause a performance\ndegradation, and that's an event in and\n\n495\n00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:21,395\nof itself.\n\n496\n00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:23,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, we'll go ahead and\n\n497\n00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:29,580\nsay Windows Logs here, all right, and\nI'm going to just say All Event IDs.\n\n498\n00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,750\nAnd again, I'm doing our four\nhorseman here, the Information,\n\n499\n00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,930\nError, Critical and Warning.\n\n500\n00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,670\nGonna say OK to this.\n\n501\n00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:42,170\nAnd now you'll see that the OK button down\nhere on the Subscription Properties is no\n\n502\n00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,009\nlonger grayed out.\n\n503\n00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:48,040\nAnd we hope [LAUGH] that we're\ngoing to get some logs here.\n\n504\n00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,520\nNow you'll notice that\n\n505\n00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,100\nNate mentioned our other logs within here\napplication security setup and system.\n\n506\n00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,200\nAnd then he mentioned this forward.\n\n507\n00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,436\nThere we go,\nright away we've got some forward events.\n\n508\n00:27:58,436 --> 00:27:59,022\n>> Wow.\n\n509\n00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:01,544\n>> Now the reason we [LAUGH] did this,\nkeep in mind,\n\n510\n00:28:01,544 --> 00:28:05,850\nwe only chose all of those logs, just so\nwe could show you some information here.\n\n511\n00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:11,560\nSometimes, it can be 5, 10,\n15 minutes before you ever see anything.\n\n512\n00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,950\nIf you're being very specific,\nit might be a week.\n\n513\n00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,490\nThis case, we can generate\nsome information right away.\n\n514\n00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:22,260\nAnd these logs, you'll see, going back to\nthe filtering that we were talking about,\n\n515\n00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,260\nI can filter this log as well.\n\n516\n00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,850\nI can say I wanted to collect\neverything at the time so\n\n517\n00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,750\nI have all the information I needed.\n\n518\n00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,420\nBut now maybe I just want to do error or\nlike Nate with.\n\n519\n00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,470\nLet's do Critical and Warning and\nleave Error out of it, okay,\n\n520\n00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,190\nthen we can rifle down really quick too.\n\n521\n00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:41,980\nSo you can also filter this no different\nthan if this was the local machine's\n\n522\n00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,813\nevent logs that you were looking at,\nand there you go.\n\n523\n00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:47,270\n>> All right, so seriously, there we go.\n\n524\n00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:51,956\nNow, we can collect those events and\nspend a good Friday night pouring\n\n525\n00:28:51,956 --> 00:28:55,620\nthrough event logs and\nsee what the computer's up to.\n\n526\n00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,355\n>> Right,\nkind of like watching grass grow or dry.\n\n527\n00:28:58,355 --> 00:29:03,550\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, but yeah, gosh,\nI don't know, I was trying\n\n528\n00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:09,460\nto think of something like yeah but\nat least you can have something to read.\n\n529\n00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,320\n>> I think it's very cool,\nthe fact that you can set this up and\n\n530\n00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,300\nfrom a single location I can have all\nof these computers just collectively,\n\n531\n00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,070\nI guess that's probably\na bad pun on words.\n\n532\n00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,590\nThey can all send information\nback to a single location.\n\n533\n00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,200\nAnd it takes us back to the whole reason\n\n534\n00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,568\nwe implement client server technology to\nbegin with, centralized administration.\n\n535\n00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:35,550\n>> Nice, all right, so\nwe are coming up here on break time,\n\n536\n00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,690\nwe still have a number of stuff to get to\nbut we will save that for after the break.\n\n537\n00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,200\n>> Sounds good.\n\n538\n00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,880\n>> Anything else to throw in,\non collector sets?\n\n539\n00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,410\n>> No Sir.\n\n540\n00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:43,940\n>> Sweet.\n\n541\n00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,936\nAll right, we'll get into more performance\nand neat stuff after the break.\n\n542\n00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:54,853\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n543\n00:29:54,853 --> 00:29:56,728\n>> All right, welcome back.\n\n544\n00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:02,349\nSo where we left off, we're talking\nabout those event collector sets and\n\n545\n00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:06,195\nthose good old events and\nhow we can collect them.\n\n546\n00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:10,180\n[LAUGH] Now, to go along with that,\n\n547\n00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:16,570\nlet's take a look at these monitoring\nRPCs, so specifically performance.\n\n548\n00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:24,230\nOur next big topic to touch on does get\ninto configure performance settings.\n\n549\n00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:28,710\nAnd there's a bunch of items in\nthere that we can look at and\n\n550\n00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,890\nkind of tweak and tune it and\nmake our PCs not only our own,\n\n551\n00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:35,800\nbut to I guess get them set up and\nperforming correctly.\n\n552\n00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,800\nBut before we get into that just above,\nabove that few points up there,\n\n553\n00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,790\ndata collector sets\n>> DCSs.\n\n554\n00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,102\nEverything has to be\nan acronym in IT right?\n\n555\n00:30:46,102 --> 00:30:49,270\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh yeah, you mean DCSs?\n\n556\n00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,549\nOh, that's funny.\n\n557\n00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:56,910\nData collector sets, now, that is done\nwith good old Performance Monitor.\n\n558\n00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,930\nPerformance Monitor, a really neat tool.\n\n559\n00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,826\nAll right, so you know what,\nlet's dive into Performance Monitor.\n\n560\n00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,010\nWe have something to look\nat while we talk about it.\n\n561\n00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,390\n>> Definitely.\n>> Right.\n\n562\n00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,140\nAll right, so\ngood old Performance Monitor.\n\n563\n00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,540\nAll right, to get into that guy,\nStart > Control Panel, and\n\n564\n00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,870\nwe'll go to System and\nSecurity > Administrative Tools.\n\n565\n00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:20,560\nAnd that's where we found Event Viewer but\nthis time we'll go to Performance Monitor.\n\n566\n00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:26,090\nMaximize that window, just drag this\nguy over a little bit, all right,\n\n567\n00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,090\nPerformance Monitor.\n\n568\n00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:32,010\nNow, in this default view,\nnot really a whole lot, and\n\n569\n00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,832\nmonitoring tools, well, still not\nreally a whole lot but there we go.\n\n570\n00:31:35,832 --> 00:31:43,080\nPerformance Monitor, so this gives us\na real time view on certain counters or\n\n571\n00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,542\ncertain things in our computer for\nwhich we want to track,\n\n572\n00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:53,686\nwhether it be hard drive read times,\nprocessor time.\n\n573\n00:31:53,686 --> 00:31:58,210\nI mean there are a number of\ndifferent counters that we can track.\n\n574\n00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,314\n>> Yep, I always think of the famous four\nthat we always see in another utility that\n\n575\n00:32:02,314 --> 00:32:03,670\nwe're gonna talk about.\n\n576\n00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:08,211\nA couple utilities that you can\nsee this coming cuz it's so\n\n577\n00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:12,670\nimportant is CPU, hard drive,\nnetworking and memory.\n\n578\n00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,550\nThose seem to be the ones that it's\nlike if those aren't working right,\n\n579\n00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,460\nwe've got problems.\n\n580\n00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,121\n[LAUGH] And like Nate says, you really can\nfind just about anything you wanna monitor\n\n581\n00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:24,996\nwithin a system, but a lot of times\npeople are concerned with those.\n\n582\n00:32:24,996 --> 00:32:30,130\nI get CPU, networking if you will,\nthe hard drive and your RAM.\n\n583\n00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,864\nAnd you can see this in a lot of the\nmonitoring utilities that we're gonna talk\n\n584\n00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:36,720\nabout that are constantly\nlooking at those four.\n\n585\n00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,220\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n586\n00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,950\nNow, in this guy right here, right.\n\n587\n00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,510\nSo, we can see, so what is being logged.\n\n588\n00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:48,110\nWell, we look down below, and this is\nour little list of what's being logged.\n\n589\n00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,590\nWe can see processor time, or percent\nprocessor time, which is being logged.\n\n590\n00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,730\nNow, there's not really\na whole lot going on, but\n\n591\n00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:01,010\nlet's just open up some Explorer windows.\n\n592\n00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:01,650\n>> There you go.\n\n593\n00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,339\n>> All right, maybe.\n\n594\n00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,920\nFive or six of those guys.\n\n595\n00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,180\nWe can jump over to it.\n\n596\n00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,670\nWe can see a little spike.\n\n597\n00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:12,920\nIt's kind of going back down now,\nbut, so there we go.\n\n598\n00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,410\nIt logs things in real time, as happens.\n\n599\n00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,170\nNow, we can record this as well.\n\n600\n00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,380\nAnd then we can evaluate it later\nto see what exactly is going on\n\n601\n00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,990\nwith data collector sets.\n\n602\n00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:25,520\n>> That's right.\n\n603\n00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,350\nWhat we're seeing right now is\njust the real-time snapshot.\n\n604\n00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:32,220\nWe're not actually recording or\nlogging any information here.\n\n605\n00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,410\nMaybe we want just a quick snapshot,\nfor instance,\n\n606\n00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,920\nNate's talking about processor time.\n\n607\n00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,570\nWe come in here where somebody's saying,\nwell, my computer's running very slow.\n\n608\n00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,630\nWell, maybe you just want a quick\nsnapshot like we have right here, and\n\n609\n00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,870\nwhen you come into the computer you see\nthat it looks like a downtown road map to,\n\n610\n00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,510\nI don't know,\nmaybe Manhattan or something.\n\n611\n00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,000\nAnd you're saying, well,\nsomething's gotta be wrong,\n\n612\n00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,640\nthere's a lot of activity in here.\n\n613\n00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,180\nAnd then at that point,\n\n614\n00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,785\nthat's where we're gonna have to go in to\nmaybe collecting information from there.\n\n615\n00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n616\n00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,370\nNow, to make these data collector sets,\nright?\n\n617\n00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,690\nSo what are some things, or\n\n618\n00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:07,760\nwhat are some reasons on why we would\nwant to create data collector sets?\n\n619\n00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,890\nWell, for one, right away, baselines.\n\n620\n00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:13,100\nLet's say that we set up a brand new PC.\n\n621\n00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,660\nMaybe we're not talking about a client\nmachine, but what about a server?\n\n622\n00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,810\nIt's fresh, it's brand new out of the box,\nand so we take a baseline.\n\n623\n00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,960\nWe get a record of its performance\non its day to day tasks.\n\n624\n00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,030\nMaybe we let it run throughout the course\nof the day, or the peak cycle.\n\n625\n00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,970\nThe peak times in our business.\n\n626\n00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:39,360\nAnd we want to record that, so\nthen over the lifetime of that server,\n\n627\n00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,610\nwe can then have that\nbaseline to refer to.\n\n628\n00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:46,648\nRight, so we can fall back on it,\nand say well, we can see that\n\n629\n00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:51,830\nperhaps the hardware, its performance\nis degrading or something right?\n\n630\n00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,100\n>> Yeah, that's exactly it.\n\n631\n00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,012\nI mean, when you put, for\ninstance, a server in production,\n\n632\n00:34:57,012 --> 00:35:02,570\nyou wanna see what its normal,\nday to day performance level is.\n\n633\n00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,770\nWhat should we expect?\n\n634\n00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,830\nAnd that's why the baseline\ncomes in handy,\n\n635\n00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,700\nbecause we do our default configuration,\nwe put it in a production environment, and\n\n636\n00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,990\nwe see what the normal\nperformance level is.\n\n637\n00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,940\nWhat we have to do, though,\n\n638\n00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,870\nis we have to determine what is\nit that we wanna monitor, right?\n\n639\n00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,601\nSo when we say we wanna see\nits baseline performance,\n\n640\n00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:20,250\nthat doesn't mean you\nwanna see everything.\n\n641\n00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,510\nMaybe you wanna see some specifics.\n\n642\n00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:27,250\nMaybe you wanna see CPU utilization, maybe\nyou wanna see, for instance, hard drive.\n\n643\n00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,148\nAnd we can again monitor those.\n\n644\n00:35:30,148 --> 00:35:31,535\nMm-hm.\n\n645\n00:35:31,535 --> 00:35:33,390\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n646\n00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,520\nSo yeah, let our CI app baselines.\n\n647\n00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,470\nWe need to look for\nthings like performance bottlenecks.\n\n648\n00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,680\nAll right, so we can measure,\nright, the four core, right?\n\n649\n00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,832\nSo with the disk, network,\nCPU, and hard drive,\n\n650\n00:35:47,832 --> 00:35:52,300\nwe're gonna take a look at those and yeah,\nlook for bottlenecks and certain things.\n\n651\n00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:57,610\nPerhaps during the course of the time,\nwe can determine trends.\n\n652\n00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:02,340\nSo we can see certain trends that happen,\nperhaps, on that busy time.\n\n653\n00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,260\nYou know, maybe we can see there's\na particular spike in something and\n\n654\n00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,250\ndrilling down into it and\nwe can investigate it.\n\n655\n00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,950\nMaybe we can find that all of our users\nare now eating lunch at their desks.\n\n656\n00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,070\nAnd so now they're streaming Netflix or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n657\n00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,470\nWe can find that out.\n\n658\n00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,490\n>> Maybe have a web server that\nyou need that's performing SSL.\n\n659\n00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:26,590\nAnd at a certain time in the day, we start\nto get slow webpage load times and stuff.\n\n660\n00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,768\nAnd people start complaining at\na certain time, well, we can, again,\n\n661\n00:36:29,768 --> 00:36:30,820\nsee what is that trend.\n\n662\n00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,950\nIs it a certain time in the afternoon that\nwe start to see these spikes, if you will,\n\n663\n00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,788\nor spike in performance,\nI guess would be the other way.\n\n664\n00:36:37,788 --> 00:36:41,830\nCrashes in performance [LAUGH] and\nwe can use that for analysis.\n\n665\n00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,830\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n666\n00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:47,952\nAnd also we can use it to\ntest configuration changes.\n\n667\n00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:52,910\nLet's say, well, instead of this tool,\nwe're gonna now use this tool or\n\n668\n00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:58,930\nwe're gonna upgrade this program or we're\ngonna implement a new thing of some kind.\n\n669\n00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:03,940\nWell, we you can use this to see how our\nsystem is reacting to those changes and\n\n670\n00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,835\nthen we can gauge whether or not we wanna\npush it out to our other servers or\n\n671\n00:37:06,835 --> 00:37:10,930\nthroughout the whole company, or the\nbranch offices, and those sorts of things.\n\n672\n00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,120\nMaybe even in an operating\nsystem deployment.\n\n673\n00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,768\nMaybe what we wanna do is maybe\nwe've got an older server.\n\n674\n00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:18,500\nAnd we wanna see,\n\n675\n00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,520\nis it gonna meet our performance levels\nwhen we put the new operating system on?\n\n676\n00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,210\nMaybe we wanna figure out,\ndo we have to upgrade CPU?\n\n677\n00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,440\nMaybe the current CPU\nperformance isn't adequate for\n\n678\n00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,400\nwhatever the services\nthat we're providing.\n\n679\n00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,371\nAnd again, we can take these statistical\nsnapshots and analyze the data.\n\n680\n00:37:33,371 --> 00:37:37,939\nAnd we would see that that performance\ndegradation and maybe signs for\n\n681\n00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:40,815\nupgrading a specific hardware component.\n\n682\n00:37:40,815 --> 00:37:42,121\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n683\n00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:43,312\nAll right, Wes, so\n\n684\n00:37:43,312 --> 00:37:47,952\nlet's take a look at what it is that we\nneed to do to create a data collector set.\n\n685\n00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:55,430\nAll right, so on my PC here, so\nwe've got over here data collector sets.\n\n686\n00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,950\nWe'll drill down into it.\n\n687\n00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,470\nNow we have user defined\ndata collector sets.\n\n688\n00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:06,530\nIf there was something particular that I\nwanted to look for, I can create my own.\n\n689\n00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,980\nNow we also do have these system ones.\n\n690\n00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,840\nSo I click on the little arrow.\n\n691\n00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,520\nWe have System Diagnostics,\nSystem Performance.\n\n692\n00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,500\nAnd so\nwe'll just click on System Diagnostics.\n\n693\n00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,760\nAnd here are those counters, or\n\n694\n00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,500\nthose things that this data collector\nset will then monitor and log.\n\n695\n00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,020\nAnd then you click on into Performance,\nright.\n\n696\n00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:34,090\nNot really a whole lot more on that.\n\n697\n00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,320\nThen you click on Performance Counter,\n\n698\n00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,580\nthen we can see all these different\nones that it will then log and track.\n\n699\n00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,651\n>> Yeah, and what it's showing\nyou there with the asterisks\n\n700\n00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:47,680\nthat are up there is those\nare different categories.\n\n701\n00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,940\nThe different categories,\ncomponents if you will,\n\n702\n00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,250\nbut each component has\nmultiple characteristics.\n\n703\n00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,124\nLike for instance,\nif you're talking about a hard drive,\n\n704\n00:38:56,124 --> 00:38:59,170\nwe might be talking about read speed,\nversus write speed.\n\n705\n00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,690\nSo again,\nthe category is physical disk there, but\n\n706\n00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:07,730\nyou'll see that asterisk symbol that\nsays everything within that category,\n\n707\n00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,880\nevery individual counter, just put it\nall in this whole entire component and\n\n708\n00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,910\nevery characteristic of it,\ngo ahead and put it in the DCS.\n\n709\n00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:23,760\nNow, these area pre-built data collector\nsets that come bundled into Windows.\n\n710\n00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,180\nThese aren't user-defined, so\nmaybe they're adequate for your company.\n\n711\n00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,620\nMaybe they're adequate for your baseline.\n\n712\n00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,930\nMaybe they're a little\nbig more information.\n\n713\n00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,900\nMaybe they're not even in the ballpark.\n\n714\n00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,538\nMaybe you need something\na little more specific.\n\n715\n00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,705\nSo that's where you can get into\nthe user-defined DCS as well.\n\n716\n00:39:37,705 --> 00:39:39,122\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n717\n00:39:39,122 --> 00:39:41,088\nAll right, so let's see.\n\n718\n00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:47,246\nRight there is disk, and so these are the\ndifferent ones that Wes was talking about.\n\n719\n00:39:47,246 --> 00:39:51,913\nWe've got disk time and write time,\nfree space, yada, yada, yada.\n\n720\n00:39:51,913 --> 00:39:56,060\nAnd so then that asterisk then would\njust be to collect all of them.\n\n721\n00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,700\n>> Yep.\n\n722\n00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,387\n>> Right.\n>> What you'll do is you can select\n\n723\n00:39:59,387 --> 00:40:02,250\nthe category itself at the top there.\n\n724\n00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:07,420\nLittle down arrow will, there you go,\nand that selects the whole thing.\n\n725\n00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,956\nAnd when you choose add,\nyou're going to see now, again,\n\n726\n00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:12,150\nthat asterisk symbol that\nI was telling you about.\n\n727\n00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,650\nAnd that's every single individual\ncharacteristic of the category or\n\n728\n00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,950\nthe component that you're looking at.\n\n729\n00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,025\n>> All right.\nAnd so just click on OK.\n\n730\n00:40:20,025 --> 00:40:24,055\nAnd that will then add all those\ncounters to this current log,\n\n731\n00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:26,335\nright, that S being RAM.\n\n732\n00:40:26,335 --> 00:40:28,075\nAll right?\n\n733\n00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:33,615\nSo let's, we'll just jump back over\nhere into the system diagnostics.\n\n734\n00:40:33,615 --> 00:40:34,165\nRight?\n\n735\n00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:40,710\nSo we can right-click on this guy,\nand let's see here.\n\n736\n00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,070\nWe can just click on Start.\n\n737\n00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,040\n>> Yeah, go ahead.\n\n738\n00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,580\n>> Right, let this guy run, and there he\ngoes, he's running in the background.\n\n739\n00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,850\nWe click on Start, and let it run for\na few minutes, and then stop.\n\n740\n00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,860\n>> Perfect.\n\n741\n00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:04,657\n>> Then once this guy has ended,\nall right, there we go.\n\n742\n00:41:04,657 --> 00:41:10,400\nWe can click on latest report,\nand there we go.\n\n743\n00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,790\nSo now we can see duration ten seconds.\n\n744\n00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,620\nGood little duration there.\n\n745\n00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,390\nAnd then there we go.\n\n746\n00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,330\nSo we can drill down and\nwe can see what, on the surface,\n\n747\n00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,710\nit found in that diagnostics\nrun right there.\n\n748\n00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,490\nBut then if we want to\ntake a look at the graph,\n\n749\n00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,690\nthere's a little graph\nbutton right up here.\n\n750\n00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,480\nWe can click on it.\n\n751\n00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,759\n>> Now, what do I tell you\nabout a road map to a big city?\n\n752\n00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,030\nLet's make it easier to filter.\n\n753\n00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,270\nWhy don't you go up to the top\nwhere that red X is and\n\n754\n00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,330\nthere's a little highlighter\njust to the right to it.\n\n755\n00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,486\nSelect that and\nthen pick a counter down at the bottom.\n\n756\n00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:49,740\nAnd it's now highlighted.\n\n757\n00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,580\nAnd it shows you the individual component,\n\n758\n00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,990\nwhichever counter it is\nthat you're looking at.\n\n759\n00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,670\nAnd, that's one of the reasons you\nhave to be very, very particular.\n\n760\n00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:00,290\nBe very specific in what it\nis you want to monitor, or\n\n761\n00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,210\nyou're gonna get results like this.\n\n762\n00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,400\nWhen you get results like this,\n\n763\n00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,070\nit might be harder to\ndetermine what the problem is,\n\n764\n00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:11,470\neven using this [LAUGH] software than it\nwould be to use some kind of other avenue.\n\n765\n00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,680\nAnything else but trying to read that.\n\n766\n00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,080\nYeah, so since there is so\nmuch stuff on there, if I click, so\n\n767\n00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,380\nyou can see that the highlighted line,\nright, it's just running right there.\n\n768\n00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,990\nIf I click off of it, there.\n\n769\n00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,775\nIt goes away, right?\n\n770\n00:42:26,775 --> 00:42:28,115\nHave to go back when you\nsee it's highlighted,\n\n771\n00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:29,725\nthere's a lot of mess on there.\n\n772\n00:42:29,725 --> 00:42:32,115\nNow we also click on these\nlittle check marks and\n\n773\n00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:36,625\nit will hide that particular\none from the graph.\n\n774\n00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:39,745\nNow there's a number of\ndifferent counters in there so\n\n775\n00:42:39,745 --> 00:42:43,160\nI'm goodness sakes, It would take\na lot to check on all of that.\n\n776\n00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,740\nBut let's go back up here to user defined.\n\n777\n00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,210\nLet's click on new, and\nwe'll define a data collector set.\n\n778\n00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:54,246\nWe'll call this, what do you say?\n\n779\n00:42:54,246 --> 00:42:55,833\n>> Baseline.\n\n780\n00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:59,017\n>> Baseline, all right.\n\n781\n00:42:59,017 --> 00:43:02,370\nNow here we go, so\nwe can create it from a A template.\n\n782\n00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,120\nRight?\nSo the templates are there.\n\n783\n00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,950\nThey are on our system.\n\n784\n00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,380\nWe do a system diagnostics.\n\n785\n00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,520\nSystems performance.\n\n786\n00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,300\nOr just create one manually.\n\n787\n00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,230\nSo Wes would-\n>> I would say manually.\n\n788\n00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:13,160\nBecause then we get to get a little but\nmore specific.\n\n789\n00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,450\nAnd then we can say okay,\nthese are the counters I want.\n\n790\n00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,760\nI don't want to have all those other ones.\n\n791\n00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,550\n>> All right, so then click on next.\n\n792\n00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,900\nAll right.\n\n793\n00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,810\nSo are we going to just create the logs.\n\n794\n00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,390\n>> Yep.\nI do a performance counter.\n\n795\n00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:28,890\n>> All right.\n\n796\n00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,720\nI'll click on next.\n\n797\n00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,110\nNow a performance counter alert.\n\n798\n00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,640\nThis is regenerate alerts.\n\n799\n00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,260\nIn a way, then we can send out,\nI guess messages off that.\n\n800\n00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,380\n>> Sure.\nYou define a threshold, and\n\n801\n00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,880\nwhen a certain component that\nyou're looking at hits a threshold,\n\n802\n00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,799\nsend out an alert to you and\nmakes you aware.\n\n803\n00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,550\nWe'll click on Next.\n\n804\n00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,220\nSo, now we add in those counters.\n\n805\n00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,640\nThose things that we're\ngonna be looking at.\n\n806\n00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,060\nAll right, Wes which one do you think?\n\n807\n00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,700\n>> Let's do that percent processor, Tom.\n\n808\n00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,370\nI like that one.\n\n809\n00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,092\nAnd, how about we just say \"Add\" and\nleave it at that and say \"OK\".\n\n810\n00:44:07,092 --> 00:44:09,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna come back to it, though.\n\n811\n00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,980\nBecause there are a couple\nof different ways.\n\n812\n00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,562\nThat, well, I'll tell you what,\nhow about we do memory as well.\n\n813\n00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,994\nAnd open up memory there and let's see.\n\n814\n00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:20,947\nDo we have anything on paging?\n\n815\n00:44:23,106 --> 00:44:25,280\nThere we go.\nHow about pages per second?\n\n816\n00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,570\n>> All right.\n\n817\n00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,870\n>> All right.\nWe're gonna test memory.\n\n818\n00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,548\nNow if you can go to logical disk.\n\n819\n00:44:32,635 --> 00:44:38,050\nAnd let's look at pages per second and\nwrite speed, writes per second.\n\n820\n00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,140\nIt does pages per second,\nthat might be physical disk.\n\n821\n00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,285\nOh!\n\n822\n00:44:43,285 --> 00:44:43,785\nWas that it?\n\n823\n00:44:46,078 --> 00:44:51,925\nIt might be physical disk that's\nlooking at the page file there.\n\n824\n00:44:51,925 --> 00:44:53,601\nOr not.\nNo, it's gonna be one of the two there.\n\n825\n00:44:53,601 --> 00:44:54,945\n>> That was the key length.\n\n826\n00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:56,070\n>> Hey, that sounds good.\n\n827\n00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,360\nSounds good to me.\n\n828\n00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,800\n>> And then, anything else?\n\n829\n00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,160\nWe're good?\n\n830\n00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,010\nOkay.\nAll right,\n\n831\n00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:04,580\nwe'll just throw in Network Interface\nsince it was just sitting right there.\n\n832\n00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,450\n>> There you go.\n\n833\n00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:08,920\nPerfect.\n>> I have that done.\n\n834\n00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,660\n>> Backups per second.\n\n835\n00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,142\n>> Backups per second, I like it.\n\n836\n00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:15,550\nAll right and\nwe'll just choose that one right there.\n\n837\n00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,100\nAll right, and okay.\n\n838\n00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,020\nVery good.\n>> So then\n\n839\n00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,930\nthese counters here are the ones\nthat we will be looking for.\n\n840\n00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:25,800\nAnd Sample Interval, how often it's\ngoing to pull this device to find out.\n\n841\n00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,340\n15 seconds we'll ask?\n\n842\n00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,640\nOne second, two seconds?\n\n843\n00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,230\nDo two seconds.\n\n844\n00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,160\n>> Two seconds?\n\n845\n00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,890\nAll right weeks.\n\n846\n00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,330\nNo, we're good with the two weeks there.\n\n847\n00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:36,695\nWe'll see you guys back in a while.\n\n848\n00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:37,840\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n849\n00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,350\nnow the route directory, right?\n\n850\n00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:42,240\nSo, where it's going to be\nsaving to is the default\n\n851\n00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,360\nsystem drive in parenthesis there.\n\n852\n00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,770\nSo the system drive for\nus will be the C drive.\n\n853\n00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:52,380\n>> Then in our Perf logs folder,\nadmin, baseline.\n\n854\n00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,200\nBaseline is what we named this one.\n\n855\n00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,180\nRight?\n\n856\n00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,480\nNow, the run as, right?\n\n857\n00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:04,220\nSo run as we pick a particular\nuser that we want this to run as.\n\n858\n00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:09,414\nPerhaps if we're delegating something\nout to a like we've got some servers,\n\n859\n00:46:09,414 --> 00:46:12,798\nwe're going to delegate\nthis data cluster set to be\n\n860\n00:46:12,798 --> 00:46:16,710\nable to monitor performance\nto a particular user.\n\n861\n00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:20,080\nMaybe it's a help desk, or\nmaybe even a department head, or\n\n862\n00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,800\nsomebody that needs to be aware of these\nchanging conditions, we can do that.\n\n863\n00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,485\nBut, for us, we'll choose the default for\nthis one here.\n\n864\n00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:28,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n865\n00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:31,000\n>> All right, and we'll click on Finish.\n\n866\n00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,240\nLet me drag that out just a little bit.\n\n867\n00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,330\nAll right, there we go.\n\n868\n00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:37,500\nNow, is it collecting any\ninformation at this point?\n\n869\n00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,400\n>> It is doing absolutely nothing.\n\n870\n00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,550\nIt's like putting,\ndeveloping a policy, and\n\n871\n00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:45,484\nleaving it in some folder\nsomewhere on somebody's desk.\n\n872\n00:46:45,484 --> 00:46:46,780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So,\n\n873\n00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,310\nwe have to actually run\nthis data collector.\n\n874\n00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,420\n>> All right.\n\n875\n00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:55,120\nSo, I'll click on this guy and\nselect on Start.\n\n876\n00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,110\nWe can do properties.\n\n877\n00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,000\nWe'll click on properties.\n\n878\n00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,260\nWe'll set up a particular description for\nit.\n\n879\n00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,740\nWe've got the directory.\n\n880\n00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,100\nWe can change the security schedule.\n\n881\n00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,100\nHow often this is going to run.\n\n882\n00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,990\nPerhaps if we want to run it\nevery day around lunchtime.\n\n883\n00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:15,010\nOr every day at the close of business.\n\n884\n00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:15,650\n>> That's right.\nWell you\n\n885\n00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:20,600\nmention the difference between\nrunning a on peak hours or off hours.\n\n886\n00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,210\nSome people might say, well you're\ngonna want to run that in off hours.\n\n887\n00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,390\nYou're not gonna want\nto disturb the machine.\n\n888\n00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,510\nWell, if we're looking for\nperformance issues we might want\n\n889\n00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:34,570\nto run this DCS during the time\nwhen it's most crucial.\n\n890\n00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:38,280\nSo again you'll have to develop that as\nyour baseline, whatever your system is for\n\n891\n00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,254\nbaselining, that'll be part of developing\nthe test is also determining when you're\n\n892\n00:47:42,254 --> 00:47:43,110\ngonna run on it.\n\n893\n00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,750\n>> All right,\nthen we have stop conditions.\n\n894\n00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,260\nSo what's gonna happen to\nmake this guy stop right?\n\n895\n00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,120\nWhen it reaches a certain side.\n\n896\n00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,200\nSo, Wes you brought\nthe idea of event logs.\n\n897\n00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,102\nHow event logs, they do take up space.\n\n898\n00:47:55,102 --> 00:47:58,206\n>> Sure.\n>> Letting this guy run it's still logging\n\n899\n00:47:58,206 --> 00:48:03,630\ninformation, whether it's a little bit or\na lot, it still does take up space.\n\n900\n00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:08,500\nWe can set up certain duration,\nreach to the overall duration.\n\n901\n00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,910\nAll right, how about just 15 seconds.\n\n902\n00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,920\n>> Sounds good to me.\n>> All right, we'll do that for now.\n\n903\n00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,430\nAnd we'll just click on okay.\n\n904\n00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,870\nWe'll right click on this guy,\nclick on start.\n\n905\n00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,630\nLook at this guy just a second.\n\n906\n00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:21,500\nThere it goes.\n\n907\n00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,060\nIt's now running.\n\n908\n00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:27,140\nAnd after 15 seconds if it should,\nshould, right.\n\n909\n00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:30,600\nHit that stop condition and\nthen we can browse into this and\n\n910\n00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,230\ntake a look at the performance\nthat's coming off of this PC.\n\n911\n00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:38,310\n>> Now when we talk about browsing into\nit you can do a lot of the right-clicks\n\n912\n00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:41,570\nwhere it says show latest report but you\nalso have that section within performance\n\n913\n00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:44,090\nmonitor that is for the reporting.\n\n914\n00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,900\nYou'll see there that\nyou have your reports.\n\n915\n00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,320\nAnd under your reports,\nyou either have the system defined logs.\n\n916\n00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,700\nAgain, logs that have been generated\nby the system defined DCS and\n\n917\n00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,570\nyou also have the logs for your user\ndefined, or manually defined DCSs.\n\n918\n00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:57,970\nAnd those reports will still show there.\n\n919\n00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:00,810\nAnd they'll also have the time and\ndate that they ran.\n\n920\n00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:04,280\nAnd some kind of random\nnumeric number there.\n\n921\n00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,540\nI'm sure it probably has some\nkind of value to it, but\n\n922\n00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,533\nit'll help you differentiate\nbetween the logs.\n\n923\n00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:11,710\n>> Alright.\n\n924\n00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,440\nSo then choosing that route, right?\n\n925\n00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,195\nSo they're under reports and user define.\n\n926\n00:49:17,195 --> 00:49:18,455\nThere is baseline.\n\n927\n00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:23,035\nYou can drill down into that and\nsure enough, there we go.\n\n928\n00:49:23,035 --> 00:49:28,245\nSo we can see that system is calm,\nright, in the 15 seconds.\n\n929\n00:49:28,245 --> 00:49:30,210\nWe let this guy run.\n\n930\n00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,680\nNot terribly a whole lot.\n\n931\n00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:39,770\nAnd then we click on-\n>> Right to left, three, there you go.\n\n932\n00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,650\nAnd you can change the view if you want.\n\n933\n00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,430\nIf you don't like the graph\nyou can go to histogram.\n\n934\n00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,850\nIf you don't like histogram\nyou can go to report.\n\n935\n00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:46,870\nAnd we've seen all these.\n\n936\n00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:47,900\nNate's already showed us this.\n\n937\n00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,030\nJust a different way to get to it.\n\n938\n00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,100\nAgain, you can just\nchange the default view.\n\n939\n00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,750\nMaybe the line graph's\nnot what you wanna see.\n\n940\n00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,490\nMaybe you wanna see something\na little bit different than that.\n\n941\n00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:57,460\n>> Nice.\n\n942\n00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,530\nAll right, well yeah, there you go.\n\n943\n00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:03,140\nCreating those collector sets and\nlogging your information on the PC.\n\n944\n00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,690\nWes, do you have anything\nelse to add onto that?\n\n945\n00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:10,560\n>> Other than that,\njust remember that you can also get your\n\n946\n00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,005\nperformance monitor in the command\nprompt by typing in perfmon,\n\n947\n00:50:15,005 --> 00:50:19,870\nP-E-R-F-M-O-N.exe, and it will launch\nit from the command prompt as well.\n\n948\n00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:23,530\nNow, we've got a graphical\nuser interface for a reason.\n\n949\n00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:27,560\nUse it, but remember, on the test, the one\nway that you know how to get to something,\n\n950\n00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,055\nprobably won't be the way they ask you,\nso know multiple ways.\n\n951\n00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:30,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n952\n00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,700\nAll right, well good deal Wes.\n\n953\n00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,190\nWell, we do have a few minutes left.\n\n954\n00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,250\nLet's go ahead and do this.\n\n955\n00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,220\nWe'll go ahead and take our break now.\n\n956\n00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:41,930\nAnd then when we come back, we've got a\nnumber of other little performance things,\n\n957\n00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:44,570\nand little tweaks that we\ncan do to our desktop, and\n\n958\n00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:47,110\nirk out that last little bit\nof performance out of it.\n\n959\n00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:47,820\n>> Good stuff, man.\n\n960\n00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,570\n>> All right, sweet.\n\n961\n00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,485\nThen we'll get to that stuff.\n\n962\n00:50:49,485 --> 00:50:53,800\nAfter the break.\n\n963\n00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:59,130\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back.\n\n964\n00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:03,825\nAll right, so where we left off,\nwe're talking about getting into these\n\n965\n00:51:03,825 --> 00:51:07,157\nlittle bit of a laundry list\nof performance items and\n\n966\n00:51:07,157 --> 00:51:11,840\nthings that we can kind of tweak and\nget the most out of our RPCs.\n\n967\n00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,650\nNow the first one that we have lined up,\nconfiguring the page file.\n\n968\n00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:19,960\nNow, so Wes, tell me, this page file.\n\n969\n00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,960\nSo what's the story behind this page file?\n\n970\n00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,510\n>> Well the page file paging\nsystem was created really for\n\n971\n00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:29,360\ndays when you had limited memory.\n\n972\n00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,040\nAnd what the page file allows you to\ndo is essentially treat a portion\n\n973\n00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,660\nof your hard drive as though\nit were physical RAM.\n\n974\n00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,980\nInside of Windows, they have something\ncalled a Virtual Memory Manager.\n\n975\n00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:44,330\nAnd it's what helps to allocate\napplications that need\n\n976\n00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:47,170\na certain portion of memory\nto store their data.\n\n977\n00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,420\nWell, if you start to run out of RAM,\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n978\n00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,860\nWell, you're not gonna be able\nto launch that application.\n\n979\n00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,720\nSo this is a way that's transparent\nto the application themselves.\n\n980\n00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,470\nWhen they ask for memory they relieve\nit because what happens is the virtual\n\n981\n00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:03,010\nmemory manager takes data that's not\ncurrently in use out of the RAM and\n\n982\n00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:05,730\nwrites it to the visible hardrive or\n\n983\n00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:09,970\npages it if you will to the physical\nhardrive and now when an application...\n\n984\n00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:10,860\nHe's looking for the data.\n\n985\n00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,940\nSays, hey wait,\n\n986\n00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,420\nI had my data in RAM now I'm looking to\nfind it with the virtual memory manager.\n\n987\n00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,270\nAgain, transparent to the application,\njust takes it off the hard drive,\n\n988\n00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:25,247\nputs it back into the physical memory, and\nagain, the application continues the work.\n\n989\n00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:25,965\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n990\n00:52:25,965 --> 00:52:30,515\nNow there are some aspects of this\npage file that we can mess with,\n\n991\n00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:33,155\nlike how much it can take.\n\n992\n00:52:33,155 --> 00:52:35,425\nAnd we can turn it off all together.\n\n993\n00:52:35,425 --> 00:52:37,855\nNow, to get to this guy, right?\n\n994\n00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:39,895\nGood old page file.\n\n995\n00:52:39,895 --> 00:52:46,290\nSo what we're gonna do We'll just open up\na, we'll get into our system properties.\n\n996\n00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,100\nAnd then we'll get into well,\njust our properties again.\n\n997\n00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:51,680\n>> I know.\n\n998\n00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,545\nA door in front of a door.\n\n999\n00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:53,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1000\n00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:57,980\nAnd then inside the performance tab,\nright, we'll click on settings.\n\n1001\n00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,990\nAnd into advanced.\n\n1002\n00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,770\nAnd then we had the virtual\nmemory down here, right?\n\n1003\n00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:06,480\nOur paging area.\n\n1004\n00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,260\nLet me click on change.\n\n1005\n00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,305\nAnd so now we can kind of monkey\nwith this guy a little bit.\n\n1006\n00:53:11,305 --> 00:53:11,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1007\n00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,420\n>> All right.\n\n1008\n00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,430\nSo right now it's set up by default for\n\n1009\n00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:19,635\nWindows to automatically\nmanage this page fell.\n\n1010\n00:53:19,635 --> 00:53:20,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And for\n\n1011\n00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:22,760\nthe most part it's kind of\nthe best setting, right?\n\n1012\n00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,155\nSo we'll let Windows choose\nwhat to do with it, right?\n\n1013\n00:53:26,155 --> 00:53:26,840\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1014\n00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:31,100\n>> Now, if we didn't wanna do that, if we\nwanted to tweak it for our own rights,\n\n1015\n00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:36,019\nthen we could uncheck this box, and\nnow these other options become available.\n\n1016\n00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:43,480\nSo right now, for the size of our page\nfile we have the system manage size.\n\n1017\n00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,110\nSo we'll just let Windows\nfigure out how much it wants.\n\n1018\n00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:50,510\nNow, Wes, typically, it's, what,\n\n1019\n00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:52,180\none and a-\n>> 1.5?\n\n1020\n00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:52,810\n>> What's that?\n\n1021\n00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,350\n>> It's 1.5.\n\n1022\n00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:55,060\n>> Yep.\n\n1023\n00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,030\n>> One and a half?\n\n1024\n00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:59,640\n>> One and a half times the memory that\nyou have installed on your system.\n\n1025\n00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,432\nWhich it can be kind of a lot-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1026\n00:54:02,432 --> 00:54:03,704\n>> On there.\n\n1027\n00:54:03,704 --> 00:54:06,650\nNow, so we can set a custom size, right?\n\n1028\n00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:11,080\nSo we can choose, hey I don't think\nyou really need that much memory.\n\n1029\n00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,505\nThen we can set that custom size,\nor just no page file at all.\n\n1030\n00:54:15,505 --> 00:54:16,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1031\n00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:19,480\n>> Now\n>> So if you look on, browse around some\n\n1032\n00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:25,230\nforums, there seems to be conflicting\nideas on this setting right here,\n\n1033\n00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:30,240\nand for me, I think hey, well my\ndesktop PC and I think yours does too,\n\n1034\n00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,510\nhas 16 gigs of ram\n>> That's a 24GB page file by default.\n\n1035\n00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:37,260\n>> That's crazy.\n\n1036\n00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,810\nThat's insane.\n\n1037\n00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,190\nIn my desktop I have an SSD.\n\n1038\n00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:42,435\nAnd I think yours does too.\n\n1039\n00:54:42,435 --> 00:54:44,330\n>> Mm-hm\n>> 16GB of RAM.\n\n1040\n00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:48,010\nAnd if I toss up task manager,\nwhich we'll get into here in a minute,\n\n1041\n00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:51,720\nand look at the RAM,\n>> I mean it's

all.\n\n1044\n00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:02,510\nLet's save these read and\nwrites to our SSD and don't even use it.\n\n1045\n00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:04,670\nNow some people say, hey that's perfect.\n\n1046\n00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:09,330\nWhy offload anything to a hard\ndrive when a RAM is so much faster.\n\n1047\n00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:10,960\nIf you have 16GB of RAM.\n\n1048\n00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,000\nUse it.\n\n1049\n00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,890\nUse all of it.\n\n1050\n00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,090\nDon't even write to the hard drive.\n\n1051\n00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:19,630\nOther people say, hey,\nyou shouldn't do it, it's not optimized,\n\n1052\n00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:21,190\nyou should just let Windows do it.\n\n1053\n00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,890\nThere's kind of different\ntrains of thoughts.\n\n1054\n00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:25,470\n>> There is.\nAnd some people say, don't disable

thing I did is disabled it.\n\n1057\n00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,430\nSo I haven't had any problems yet,\nbut those are just problems,\n\n1058\n00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:40,720\nmaybe I do have the problems and\nI'm just not aware of it.\n\n1059\n00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,346\nI might need to go home and\ncheck the Even View.\n\n1060\n00:55:44,346 --> 00:55:45,566\n>> [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] Event view.\n\n1061\n00:55:45,566 --> 00:55:49,787\nYeah now, so some people will say,\nfor crash dumps, things of that sort,\n\n1062\n00:55:49,787 --> 00:55:54,142\nif you do have a blue screen, if you don't\nhave a page file or anything at all,\n\n1063\n00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:58,170\nthen information can be lost,\nyou won't really be able to get it back.\n\n1064\n00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:03,928\nIf you were to not disable it, but\nat least give yourself 500 Megs,\n\n1065\n00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:09,800\n300 Megs, just something there that\nWindows can use OS and me also.\n\n1066\n00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,620\nOn my desktop, I just turned it off.\n\n1067\n00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n1068\n00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:16,531\n>> And so far, I haven't seen\nany performance problems, or\n\n1069\n00:56:16,531 --> 00:56:18,875\nrandom application crashes.\n\n1070\n00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,710\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> The only thing I ever seen, I can't\n\n1071\n00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,380\n>> I can't remember the name of\n\n1072\n00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,100\nthe monitoring software, but\nI had a monitoring software that\n\n1073\n00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,152\npretty much monitored everything,\nincluding the paging file.\n\n1074\n00:56:26,152 --> 00:56:27,028\nHey, that's Spotlight.\n\n1075\n00:56:27,028 --> 00:56:28,670\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's it, Spotlight in Windows.\n\n1076\n00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,110\nThat's exactly what it was.\n\n1077\n00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:33,960\nThat's the only thing I've ever\nseen disabling the paging file Do.\n\n1078\n00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:40,565\nIt just changed a green\nlight to a red light.\n\n1079\n00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:43,250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's a good third party\n\n1080\n00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,860\nmonitoring utility that you can use.\n\n1081\n00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,770\n>> It went, what dull.\n\n1082\n00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:56,240\n>> Really, quest, I guess that the dull,\nthe dull dime, I guess so.\n\n1083\n00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,390\n>> Apparently they did, okay well\n\n1084\n00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:08,051\nthan it might be a little well,\nthere we go,\n\n1085\n00:57:08,051 --> 00:57:09,820\nnow\n>> Let's just say this.\n\n1086\n00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:13,020\nAll right, let's say so we have SSDs.\n\n1087\n00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,760\nWindows, like we don't want to\nput anything on those SSDs.\n\n1088\n00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,670\nAnd I mean, they're kinda small.\n\n1089\n00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:23,110\nI think mine's 100, 128GB,\nsomething like that.\n\n1090\n00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,320\nI think you've got, what?\n\n1091\n00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,550\n256?\n>> I've got 180, two individual 80 gigs.\n\n1092\n00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,440\n>> Right.\n\n1093\n00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,900\nSo let's say that we have\na different hard drive, right?\n\n1094\n00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,760\nThe standard mechanical hard drive.\n\n1095\n00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,956\nWell let's use that hard drive for\na page file.\n\n1096\n00:57:35,956 --> 00:57:40,890\nNow we can off-load our page\nfile into a different disk, and\n\n1097\n00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:43,990\nto do that, so on the C drive\n>> Right here.\n\n1098\n00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:46,280\nWe say, hey, just no page file.\n\n1099\n00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,620\nDon't put anything on C drive.\n\n1100\n00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:52,090\nBut on the D drive, sure.\n\n1101\n00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:53,500\nWe can select that.\n\n1102\n00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:59,510\nAnd so now, we'll just click,\nclick Set on that, and let's go back to C.\n\n1103\n00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:02,820\nWe'll just click on No,\nwe'll click on Set.\n\n1104\n00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,340\nSure.\n\n1105\n00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,350\nIf it's less megs.\n\n1106\n00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:08,060\nYou get a system error\noccurs you have a problem.\n\n1107\n00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:08,650\nSure.\nThat's fine.\n\n1108\n00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:12,620\nSet.\nJust clicked on that.\n\n1109\n00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:15,640\nAnd so now the page file will be\noff loaded off of our C drive,\n\n1110\n00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,820\nand now it will be on our D drive.\n\n1111\n00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:20,500\nAnd so\nour D drive will then have our page file.\n\n1112\n00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,570\nYeah, and that's a good thing.\n\n1113\n00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:23,520\nIf you think about it,\nyou're really optimizing a system.\n\n1114\n00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,740\nBecause if you consider what\nthe virtual memory manger is doing when\n\n1115\n00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,270\nit pages, right.\n\n1116\n00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,950\nYou're getting disk i/o.\n\n1117\n00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:32,970\nAll right?\nAnd you're getting a constant disk i/o,\n\n1118\n00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:36,260\nand that's in contention for everything\nelse that's running on the drive as well.\n\n1119\n00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,570\nSo if you take that page file,\nyou put it in another drive.\n\n1120\n00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:43,160\nNow the page file we can perform paging\non a completely separate drive, and\n\n1121\n00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,200\nit can alleviate some of the contention\non the main system drive.\n\n1122\n00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:47,780\n>> All right.\n\n1123\n00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:53,080\nSo So, speaking of these caching and\nsorts of things.\n\n1124\n00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,610\nWhat about caching on our hard drive?\n\n1125\n00:58:55,610 --> 00:59:00,270\nSo we have something called\na write cache on our hard drives.\n\n1126\n00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:04,820\nSo, hard drives, it's a bit slower\nof a process than RAM, right?\n\n1127\n00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,050\nRAM is very fast.\n\n1128\n00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:08,100\nHard drive's a bit slower.\n\n1129\n00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,660\nSo we have this thing called Write Cache.\n\n1130\n00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:16,350\nTo our Windows then can write information,\ndestined for our hard drive, to RAM.\n\n1131\n00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:18,740\nThat way when the hard drive,\ncatches up, or what not,\n\n1132\n00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:23,420\nit can take the stuff, in cache, and\nthen write it onto the hard drive.\n\n1133\n00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:29,590\nNow we can manage that, so\nclick on Cancel, and then on Cancel.\n\n1134\n00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:32,010\nAnd Cancel again.\n\n1135\n00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:36,130\nAnd then, we'll exit out this, and then,\n\n1136\n00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:42,430\nwe'll go into our computer management,\nand we'll get into our device manager.\n\n1137\n00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:50,780\nAnd in our disk drives, okay, so,\nthis one here on this laptop, a SSD drive.\n\n1138\n00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:58,210\nAnd we click on our properties on that\ndrive, and in Policies, there we go.\n\n1139\n00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:02,745\nSo, we are enabling the right cache for\nthis drive.\n\n1140\n01:00:02,745 --> 01:00:03,340\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1141\n01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:09,870\n>> Now, if we didn't wanna use it,\nit can be a bit of a performance.\n\n1142\n01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:15,750\nNow, if we were to lose power,\nanything that is in that cache,\n\n1143\n01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:19,520\nwaiting to be written on to\nthe hard drive would be lost.\n\n1144\n01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,310\nSo kind of a two sides of the coin there.\n\n1145\n01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:25,820\nSure, perhaps you can get\nperformance out of it.\n\n1146\n01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:29,810\nBut you also lose the risk\nof losing that information.\n\n1147\n01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:31,909\nThat's in Queue waiting to be written.\n\n1148\n01:00:31,909 --> 01:00:34,980\nSure.\nAnd if you will, kinda close out a second\n\n1149\n01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,690\non there Nate, and\nmove out of disk management, if you would.\n\n1150\n01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:41,280\nJust like disk management,\nselect your main system drive.\n\n1151\n01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,410\nDisk zero there, right click and\nchoose properties.\n\n1152\n01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:46,609\nAnd then policies.\n\n1153\n01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:49,240\nAnd we've got the same location.\n\n1154\n01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,540\nI just bring that up, again guys,\n\n1155\n01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:53,970\nbecause again, these tests like to ask\nyou multiple ways to get to things.\n\n1156\n01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:55,910\nSo, just a couple different\nways you can get to it.\n\n1157\n01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:59,300\nYou can get to it to, one of the most\ncommon way,s is device management,\n\n1158\n01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,010\ncuz that's where you manage all\nof your hardware based devices.\n\n1159\n01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:03,680\nBut, the other place you can get in here.\n\n1160\n01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,435\nAnd seen this, as in disk management.\n\n1161\n01:01:05,435 --> 01:01:07,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1162\n01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,950\nAll right, so then, let's see,\n\n1163\n01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:12,560\nback on our little laundry list of items,\nthere's a third one here.\n\n1164\n01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,720\nUpdated drivers.\n\n1165\n01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:18,790\nSo, what does, I mean, how can updated\ndrivers get performance out of our system?\n\n1166\n01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:21,210\nDo you have some insights on how that.\n\n1167\n01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:21,930\n>> Well.\n\n1168\n01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:24,440\nLike we talked about when we\ntalked about Windows update,\n\n1169\n01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,720\nremember that drivers are what allow\nus to communicate with our hardware.\n\n1170\n01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:31,350\nWhen they get outdated,\n\n1171\n01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:34,550\nsometimes you can see you don't get\nthe full functionality of the device.\n\n1172\n01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:39,330\nOr maybe they had a bug within the drive,\nor within the functionality of the device\n\n1173\n01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:43,470\nwith the first version, of the driver,\nand you get a performance degradation.\n\n1174\n01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:47,070\nAnd one of the things you can\ndo by updating your drivers,\n\n1175\n01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,630\nis you fix some things.\n\n1176\n01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:54,210\nYou know, fix You know little\nbugs in performance and stuff.\n\n1177\n01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:58,310\nAnd that's one of the things that's\nkeeping your drivers up to date.\n\n1178\n01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:01,610\nDefinitely it'd probably be\nobvious if it's corrupted.\n\n1179\n01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:02,880\nIt's obviously gonna cause a problem.\n\n1180\n01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,810\nBut more so too,\nwhen you talk about outdated drivers\n\n1181\n01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:08,390\nis the fact that you don't\nget the full functionality.\n\n1182\n01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:12,260\nAnother thing too is sometimes\nWindows installs a generic driver.\n\n1183\n01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:16,000\nAnd it's because they can't find\na specific driver from the manufacturer,\n\n1184\n01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,210\nit's not in the driver store.\n\n1185\n01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:20,060\nSo, it just gives you a generic driver,\nthat gives you the basic functionality of\n\n1186\n01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,700\nthe device, but\ndoesn't give you the full functionality.\n\n1187\n01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:27,310\nAnd this is where updating that driver,\nthe manufacturer's specified driver,\n\n1188\n01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,480\nwill give you potentially the full\nfunctionality of the device,\n\n1189\n01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,750\nand increase the performance.\n\n1190\n01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:34,330\nI see this, I guess most commonly,\n\n1191\n01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:39,720\non my rustling around with PCs,\nwith graphics drivers.\n\n1192\n01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,640\n>> Definitely.\n\n1193\n01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,540\n>> I install Windows on my desktop PC,\nit says.\n\n1194\n01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:47,070\n>> Radeon, something,\nsomething card in there.\n\n1195\n01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:52,310\nAnd true enough, it'll work,\nI can get the full resolution out of it.\n\n1196\n01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,050\nBut I can't tweak that graphics card,\n\n1197\n01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:57,895\nI can't bend it to my will to picture\non whatever game is out there.\n\n1198\n01:02:57,895 --> 01:03:02,950\nBut If I install the catalyst control\npanel, I can drill into there,\n\n1199\n01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:06,220\nand then really set what it\nis with that graphics card.\n\n1200\n01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:09,240\n>> Well, you know, with a gaming system,\nyou don't put a lot of\n\n1201\n01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:13,050\nmoney into the graphics cards, you know,\nor if you've got multiple graphics cards,\n\n1202\n01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:16,020\nyou wouldn't want to put multiple graphics\ncards, spend the money, and then have\n\n1203\n01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:20,350\na VGA drive assigned to something that\nshould be putting out high definition.\n\n1204\n01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:22,210\nI mean it's kinda like\nbuying a Ferrari and\n\n1205\n01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:24,450\nsaying okay, we're gonna put a 40\nmiles an hour governor in it.\n\n1206\n01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:26,055\nYou're never gonna go\nover 40 miles an hour.\n\n1207\n01:03:26,055 --> 01:03:30,720\n[LAUGH] So, that's definitely something\nthat you've gotta worry about if it just,\n\n1208\n01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,620\nyou know, installs a generic driver.\n\n1209\n01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:35,380\nYou can see drivers down on the drivers\nstore for things like, you know,\n\n1210\n01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:38,230\nIEEE1394 devices,\nyou know your FireWire based devices, and\n\n1211\n01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:40,930\nit's just a generic driver that gives\nyou the functionality of the device, but\n\n1212\n01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:42,880\nit may not give you\nthe full functionality.\n\n1213\n01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,610\nThat's why keeping drivers\nup to date is important.\n\n1214\n01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:49,650\n>> Now Wes, now where's let me just ask\nyou, there's multiple ways that we can\n\n1215\n01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:53,440\ndownload drivers,\nwe can get drivers onto our system right?\n\n1216\n01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,570\nWe can get them on the little CDs\nthat comes with our products.\n\n1217\n01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:00,550\nRight, we can get them through Windows\nupstate, like you mentioned in there.\n\n1218\n01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:05,210\nWe also get them through the manufacturers\nwebsites, where's your go to place?\n\n1219\n01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:08,814\n>> I go to the manufacturers website,\nbecause one of the things you probably\n\n1220\n01:04:08,814 --> 01:04:12,550\nrealize that the CD that comes with\nthe component, It has a long shelf life.\n\n1221\n01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,920\nThe problem is,\nthe driver that's on it doesn't.\n\n1222\n01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,460\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1223\n01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,935\n>> I usually, what I'll do is,\n\n1224\n01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:23,292\nif you've got an installation disk,\nby all means,\n\n1225\n01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:26,580\npop it in there and install the driver.\n\n1226\n01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,140\nIt gives you a basic level\nof functionality, and\n\n1227\n01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,640\nthe very first thing that I'm gonna do is\ngo out to the manufacturer's website and\n\n1228\n01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,630\nensure that I have that current driver.\n\n1229\n01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:36,873\n>> Mm-hm, nice.\nAll right Serial drivers,\n\n1230\n01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,130\nnow on networking performance.\n\n1231\n01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:41,551\nNow we got networking\nperformance lined up.\n\n1232\n01:04:41,551 --> 01:04:45,770\nNow let's see, Jason, if we can go\nfull screen for this one right quick.\n\n1233\n01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:50,480\nSo what we can do is,\nour networking performance, right?\n\n1234\n01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,776\nDown here below,\nwe've got what we're connected to.\n\n1235\n01:04:53,776 --> 01:04:59,290\nWe can just right-click on this guy, and\nget into our Network and Sharing Center.\n\n1236\n01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:03,410\nAll right, thank you, and once we get\ninto our Network and Sharing Center,\n\n1237\n01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:06,070\nthere's plenty of ways to\nget to the same place.\n\n1238\n01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:08,830\n>> Yep.\n>> That's one quick, easy way to get to.\n\n1239\n01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:11,220\nWe can get into our adaptor settings,\n\n1240\n01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:14,850\ngoodness gracious, there are many,\nwhich one do I wanna pick today?\n\n1241\n01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:16,890\nAll right, this guy right here.\n\n1242\n01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:21,730\nAll right, we click on this guy and\nwe can get into Properties, and\n\n1243\n01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:25,920\nwe've got this little guy right here,\nQoS packet scheduler.\n\n1244\n01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,058\nNow big Q, little o, big S, right?\n\n1245\n01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:35,010\nQuality of Service,\nQuality of Service basically is a set\n\n1246\n01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:40,810\nof I guess parameters that\nWindows will use to govern\n\n1247\n01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:45,880\nthrottle, just set priority\non network traffic.\n\n1248\n01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,760\nNow by having this thing checked, Windows,\n\n1249\n01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:53,930\nit's basic QoS is geared\ntowards multimedia.\n\n1250\n01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:57,970\nSo if you're making a video call,\nthen that will have priority.\n\n1251\n01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:01,305\nIf you're wanting to stream a video,\nit will have priority.\n\n1252\n01:06:01,305 --> 01:06:01,870\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1253\n01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:06,750\n>> Well, let's say that there's some\nbusiness app of some kind, right?\n\n1254\n01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:10,767\nSome line of business app, and\nit's getting horrible performance, right?\n\n1255\n01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:14,915\nIt could be that we have other\nthings going on with our system,\n\n1256\n01:06:14,915 --> 01:06:19,475\nthat Windows is using\nits built in QOS then\n\n1257\n01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:24,016\nto give priority to other types of network\ntraffic, and then throttling that down.\n\n1258\n01:06:24,016 --> 01:06:29,237\nWe can uncheck it, and\nyeah, let everything that's\n\n1259\n01:06:29,237 --> 01:06:35,292\ncoming out of our PC have equal right,\nequal bit of priority.\n\n1260\n01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:40,380\n>> Mm-hm, and\nin some of the forums that you go out and\n\n1261\n01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,960\nyou read on, like TechNet and stuff,\nyou'll hear some people say that this\n\n1262\n01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,890\nreally benefits you in\na very large environment.\n\n1263\n01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:51,130\nMaybe in a home environment you might\nnot see the full utilization of this.\n\n1264\n01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:54,140\nBut where you've got a lot of traffic\ntraversing and different types of traffic\n\n1265\n01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:57,560\ntraversing your network, going in and\nout of your network adapter.\n\n1266\n01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:01,920\nQOS again can allocate the appropriate\nlevel of network resources to that\n\n1267\n01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,050\nspecific traffic.\n\n1268\n01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:06,360\n>> Now, we do have some other\nstuff in with our network adapter.\n\n1269\n01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,180\nAnd, generally, anything dealing with\nnetwork performance will be with our\n\n1270\n01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:11,320\nnetwork adapter.\n\n1271\n01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, so\n\n1272\n01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:17,420\nwe've got our adapter here pulled up,\nwe can click on Configure, and\n\n1273\n01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:20,726\nI'm not going to save any changes.\n\n1274\n01:07:20,726 --> 01:07:21,233\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n1275\n01:07:21,233 --> 01:07:23,780\nhopefully it doesn't disrupt\nour screen sharing here.\n\n1276\n01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:27,950\nSo you're gonna pull up the details for\nthis.\n\n1277\n01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:33,505\nWe click on the Advance tab, and\nthere are a number of items in here that.\n\n1278\n01:07:33,505 --> 01:07:37,490\nNow the items in here, goodness sakes,\n\n1279\n01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:41,170\nlittle tweaks that we can do for\nour network card.\n\n1280\n01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:44,520\nNow, these little tweaks\nwill vary from card to card.\n\n1281\n01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:50,790\nNow if we have an Intel PCIE card,\nwe'll get different options on there.\n\n1282\n01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:52,850\n>> Sure.\n>> Than with this one.\n\n1283\n01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:57,370\nThis right here, it's a USB 3.0\nto a gigabit ethernet adapter.\n\n1284\n01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:02,488\nSince these laptops don't have a built in\nEthernet adapter, we use a little dongle,\n\n1285\n01:08:02,488 --> 01:08:06,168\nand some more items in here, right?\n\n1286\n01:08:06,168 --> 01:08:09,250\nSpeed and duplex, right?\n\n1287\n01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:16,590\nWe can set this, we can throttle, we can\nset the speed on our adaptor here, right?\n\n1288\n01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:18,890\nAuto negotiation,\nwe let Windows figure it out.\n\n1289\n01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:23,220\nSo, whatever it's plugged into,\nthis adaptor and the switch or the router,\n\n1290\n01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:24,168\nwhatever its' plugged into.\n\n1291\n01:08:24,168 --> 01:08:25,610\nWe'll let those guys figure it out,\n\n1292\n01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:28,119\nthey'll negotiate the fastest\nspeed that they support.\n\n1293\n01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:34,130\nWe can step it down, like well,\nlet's just use ten megabits, full duplex.\n\n1294\n01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:34,980\nWell-\n>> [COUGH]\n\n1295\n01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,120\n>> Ten megabits is gonna be a lot slower\n\n1296\n01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,500\nthan one gigabit.\n\n1297\n01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:44,250\nLet me set that, and let's see,\nwhat are some others?\n\n1298\n01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:46,200\nChecksum off load, right?\n\n1299\n01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:50,040\nSo each packet that comes in,\nit's checked.\n\n1300\n01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:56,250\nIt's checked for its integrity, and\nin Windows, it can do all that stuff.\n\n1301\n01:08:56,250 --> 01:09:00,540\nOr we can offload it to our network\nadapter and go hey, network adapter you're\n\n1302\n01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:04,290\njust sitting there hanging out,\nwhy don't you do some of the work?\n\n1303\n01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:07,740\n>> Yeah definitely, I mean, cuz if like\nNate says, if this is happening inside of\n\n1304\n01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:10,620\nWindows inside of the operating system,\njust think about that.\n\n1305\n01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:14,820\nThe brains of the computer is what's\ngonna have to calculate that information,\n\n1306\n01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:15,520\nthe CPU for us.\n\n1307\n01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,720\nSo maybe we don't wanna rob again,\n\n1308\n01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,780\nprocessing cycles from\nthe operating system.\n\n1309\n01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,350\nBut we say, well you know what,\nnetwork adapter?\n\n1310\n01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:23,035\nWhy don't you earn your keep for\nthe month.\n\n1311\n01:09:23,035 --> 01:09:26,500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we'll let in hardware acceleration,\n\n1312\n01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:30,390\nwhere we could potentially see a better\nperformance versus software acceleration.\n\n1313\n01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:34,640\nWhich ultimately is gonna rob the whole\nentire system of maybe other things that\n\n1314\n01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:40,150\nit could be doing much more efficiently if\nwe weren't having it have to deal in RAM,\n\n1315\n01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:41,970\nin the system RAM, system memory.\n\n1316\n01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:43,890\nWell, with all the reassembling and stuff,\n\n1317\n01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:45,870\nof the transmission control\nprotocol information.\n\n1318\n01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:49,548\nWe can just say, all right, network\nadapter, you can earn this months rent.\n\n1319\n01:09:49,548 --> 01:09:51,412\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1320\n01:09:51,412 --> 01:09:54,598\nWe've got, lets say a jumbo packet, and\n\n1321\n01:09:54,598 --> 01:09:59,940\nlets say that we're connected to a SAN,\nor something, right?\n\n1322\n01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:04,970\nAnd so that we can get big bulks\nof information here from that.\n\n1323\n01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:12,080\nWe can optimize it here, turn that on and\noff, flow control it, see ARP offload it.\n\n1324\n01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:18,140\nRonnie had a funny joke about ARP offload,\nand I can't think of what it was.\n\n1325\n01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,690\n>> I'm missing the punch line?\n\n1326\n01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:23,143\n>> Yeah, I remember laughing at it, but.\n\n1327\n01:10:23,143 --> 01:10:25,360\n>> Aw. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH] Thanks, Wes.\n\n1328\n01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:31,348\n>> You're welcome, we got your back, man\n>> Yeah, and then down here at the bottom,\n\n1329\n01:10:31,348 --> 01:10:35,830\nwe'll link power setting West,\ndo you know what WOL is?\n\n1330\n01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:37,000\nWell, I know Wake on LAN.\n\n1331\n01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,010\nI don't know what the link\non power saving is.\n\n1332\n01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,325\nI know what the magic packet is.\n\n1333\n01:10:40,325 --> 01:10:40,830\n>> Yeah.\n\n1334\n01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:43,830\n>> I use that a lot,\nI've used that on my Media Center\n\n1335\n01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:48,040\nat home when I didn't wanna keep it on\nall the time waiting for that one show.\n\n1336\n01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,470\nSo I had to come in to the Media Center\nhere in the network adapter, and\n\n1337\n01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:51,710\nturn on Wake on LAN.\n\n1338\n01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:53,335\nAnd then what I do is task schedule it for\n\n1339\n01:10:53,335 --> 01:10:57,320\nanother computer to send that Wake on LAN\npacket, over the network, and wake that\n\n1340\n01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:03,338\nMedia Center up just in time to record\nmy next greatest Hannah Montana movie.\n\n1341\n01:11:03,338 --> 01:11:08,280\n>> [LAUGH]\nYeah, yeah, and to watch it over, and\n\n1342\n01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,270\nover, and over,\nas you cry to her performance?\n\n1343\n01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:13,135\n>> That's just between me,\nyou, and the

on.\n\n1346\n01:11:20,135 --> 01:11:25,690\n>> Sure.\n>> Let's see so, we have power plans, but\n\n1347\n01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:27,580\nthat's got some really neat stuff.\n\n1348\n01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:31,530\nWe'll skip that but\nlet's get into processor scheduling,\n\n1349\n01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:33,040\nlet's talk about processor scheduling.\n\n1350\n01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,830\nWes, do you wanna talk about real\nquick while I pull this guy up?\n\n1351\n01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:35,610\n>> Yeah, sure, definitely.\n\n1352\n01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:40,980\nWith processor scheduling keep in mind\nthat different services if you will,\n\n1353\n01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:44,950\nprograms, again, they get a certain\namount of time with the processor.\n\n1354\n01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:48,110\nBut if we want to prioritize this,\nif we want to say, you know what?\n\n1355\n01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:54,840\nWith my programs, I want them to allocate\nthe CPU's time, it's interest to programs.\n\n1356\n01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,961\nWell I can do that, and I can say,\ndon't give as much maybe time to these\n\n1357\n01:11:58,961 --> 01:12:02,399\nbackground services that I\nreally don't interact with But\n\n1358\n01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:07,143\nhow about giving me a little bit better\nperformance by allocating more priority to\n\n1359\n01:12:07,143 --> 01:12:10,300\nmy programs that I'm gonna be running.\n\n1360\n01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:13,880\nSo essentially what it'll gonna do, for\ninstance it'll give a processing cycle to\n\n1361\n01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:17,790\na specific program and then maybe one\nprocessing cycle to a background service,\n\n1362\n01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:20,540\nthen maybe two processing cycles\nto the program and only one.\n\n1363\n01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:23,560\nAnd again, it keeps prioritizing.\n\n1364\n01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,468\nYou know, the different programs versus\nbackground services that you have.\n\n1365\n01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:28,508\nAll right.\n\n1366\n01:12:28,508 --> 01:12:31,871\nNow, to get to our processor scheduling.\n\n1367\n01:12:31,871 --> 01:12:34,946\nAll right, it's the same place where\nwe go to get to our virtual memory.\n\n1368\n01:12:34,946 --> 01:12:39,320\nRight, so we're gonna do our system\nproperties on the advanced tab when you\n\n1369\n01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:45,469\nclick on settings, which will bring us up\ninto this dialog box here, or this window.\n\n1370\n01:12:45,469 --> 01:12:48,630\nThen click on the advanced tab and\nsure enough.\n\n1371\n01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:52,330\nSo we can optimize it, for\neither programs, right?\n\n1372\n01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:57,660\nSo what's currently in focus and\nbeing worked on, or background services.\n\n1373\n01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,780\nAnd remember one of the big\ndifferences between programs.\n\n1374\n01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:02,530\nPrograms are typically\nuser-initiated background services.\n\n1375\n01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:05,420\nWe don't really deal with them and\nusually the user doesn't initiate them.\n\n1376\n01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:10,200\nSo we might say, get the processor more\nfocused on something that I'm interacting\n\n1377\n01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,285\nwith rather than something that Windows\nis communicating with in the background.\n\n1378\n01:13:13,285 --> 01:13:14,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1379\n01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:20,955\nYeah, and with this setting, I guess would\nhave a greater impact would be on servers.\n\n1380\n01:13:20,955 --> 01:13:21,472\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n1381\n01:13:21,472 --> 01:13:23,975\nWhere there isn't really a lot of\n\n1382\n01:13:23,975 --> 01:13:27,345\ninteraction or\nuser initiated programs running on it.\n\n1383\n01:13:27,345 --> 01:13:30,005\nBut there's a lot of stuff\ngoing on in the background.\n\n1384\n01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:31,845\nA lot of system services going out and\n\n1385\n01:13:31,845 --> 01:13:36,550\ndoing their job and communicating and\nmaking these resources available.\n\n1386\n01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:40,850\nSo, perhaps on a server, right, background\nservices would be a better choice.\n\n1387\n01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,030\n>> Sure.\n\n1388\n01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:44,760\n>> And you know, we're kind of\njumping ahead on you here, but\n\n1389\n01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,570\nwe've got to talk about task manager.\n\n1390\n01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:48,210\nYou wanna see the priorities?\n\n1391\n01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:48,930\n>> Let's go ahead and\n\n1392\n01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:52,500\nlaunch our task manager and we can see\nwhat kind of priorities being set.\n\n1393\n01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,160\n>> All right.\nSo to get to there, right,\n\n1394\n01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,490\nwe'll just right click down here,\nmy favorite way.\n\n1395\n01:13:57,490 --> 01:14:00,710\nAnd we'll go to start Start task manager.\n\n1396\n01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:03,310\n>> That's right.\nNow if we can click the processes tab if\n\n1397\n01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:04,630\nyou would, when you get there.\n\n1398\n01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:06,480\n>> Yeah,\nlet me minimize some of this stuff here.\n\n1399\n01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,410\n>> Very good,\nprocesses tab up there at the top.\n\n1400\n01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:10,842\nAnd we wanna click the view tab.\n\n1401\n01:14:10,842 --> 01:14:15,480\nDon't worry,\nit's not a different type of view.\n\n1402\n01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:18,660\nClick the view tab, or I'm sorry the view\noption there from the menu options.\n\n1403\n01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:23,557\nSelect columns, and look for\nbase priority down there at the bottom,\n\n1404\n01:14:23,557 --> 01:14:25,470\nsecond up from the bottom.\n\n1405\n01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:28,254\nSelect that,okay.\n\n1406\n01:14:28,254 --> 01:14:32,005\nAnd if you expand out the base priority,\nyou can see what Windows is now\n\n1407\n01:14:32,005 --> 01:14:35,215\nallocating to different services in\nthe background since you've saved.\n\n1408\n01:14:35,215 --> 01:14:36,595\nIs it a normal priority?\n\n1409\n01:14:36,595 --> 01:14:39,150\nWell it might, get around to it, some day.\n\n1410\n01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:41,110\nHigh priority, better get to that now.\n\n1411\n01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:45,050\nSo essentially we've\nturned our computer into\n\n1412\n01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:48,220\na multitasker that we're influencing now.\n\n1413\n01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:52,214\nSo there's your base priority,\nand again that shows you,\n\n1414\n01:14:52,214 --> 01:14:55,720\nagain, when we are doing processor\nscheduling now how it's allocating to\n\n1415\n01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,920\ndifferent services and\nwhat it categorizes it at.\n\n1416\n01:14:58,920 --> 01:14:59,920\n>> Nice.\n\n1417\n01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:00,600\nNice.\nWell, good deal.\n\n1418\n01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,560\nWell, we've got some more with\ntask manager that we'll get into.\n\n1419\n01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,250\nI do see that we are running\nup on to our break.\n\n1420\n01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:09,970\nAnd so we'll stay vigilant to\nour breaks and stay on task.\n\n1421\n01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:13,780\nWe've got just a few more items to get to\nand a little bit more in Task Manager.\n\n1422\n01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,069\n>> Yeah.\n>> We'll touch on that after the break.\n\n1423\n01:15:16,069 --> 01:15:23,185\n[SOUND].\n\n1424\n01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,720\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n1425\n01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,600\nAll right, so where we left off, we were\ntalking about to go with task manager.\n\n1426\n01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,226\nAnd now we can view the priority level,\nwhich is pretty neat,\n\n1427\n01:15:32,226 --> 01:15:34,823\nin task manager we can\nsee that stuff there.\n\n1428\n01:15:34,823 --> 01:15:38,098\nAnd let's jump back into task manager.\n\n1429\n01:15:38,098 --> 01:15:42,236\nAnother tab that I do\nwanna take a gander at.\n\n1430\n01:15:42,236 --> 01:15:47,710\nLet's close that out.\n\n1431\n01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:51,223\nAll right, and good old task manager,\nthis performance stuff, right,\n\n1432\n01:15:51,223 --> 01:15:54,567\nthat's the idea of what we're talking\nabout here is everything about\n\n1433\n01:15:54,567 --> 01:15:57,850\nperformance and looking and\nconfiguring things.\n\n1434\n01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:04,488\nOn this performance tab here, gives a\nquick look at what we got going on, right?\n\n1435\n01:16:04,488 --> 01:16:10,980\nWe've got this CPU usage bar,\nso 20% CPU usage, not too bad.\n\n1436\n01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:17,120\nMemory only 1.4 gigs of memory\nbeing used out of 8 gigs possible.\n\n1437\n01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:17,950\n>> All right?\n\n1438\n01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,460\nWe got the little.\n\n1439\n01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,660\nWe've got four little, little spots here.\n\n1440\n01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,920\nWhy the four boxes?\n\n1441\n01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,140\n>> Well, those are the cores.\n\n1442\n01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:27,410\nYou see those are the individual cores.\n\n1443\n01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:32,470\nNow, keep in mind that Windows operating\nsystem and it's not specific to Windows.\n\n1444\n01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:34,070\nI mean other operating\nsystems do this too.\n\n1445\n01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:38,020\nWindows is a operating system\nthat understands multi-threading.\n\n1446\n01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:41,500\nSo you might have, for instance,\nIntel does hyper-threading, right?\n\n1447\n01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:45,050\nThat is their multi-threading technology.\n\n1448\n01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:48,610\nAnd you have to have an operating\nsystem that's aware of multi-threading.\n\n1449\n01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:51,960\nSo you might see more cores\nin task manager than you\n\n1450\n01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,640\nphysically have on the CPU.\n\n1451\n01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:56,360\nAnd again, that's because Windows is\naware that it could send multiple\n\n1452\n01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,360\nthreads of data into a single core.\n\n1453\n01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:02,180\nSo, it represents those as logical\ncores here in task manager.\n\n1454\n01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:05,490\nSo, what we're seeing here\nis the individual cores.\n\n1455\n01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:09,090\nNow, I'm not sure,\nis this one doing hyper-threading here?\n\n1456\n01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:12,060\n>> This one, I do not believe so.\n\n1457\n01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,050\n>> Okay, yeah.\n\n1458\n01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:16,492\nSo, if you have for\ninstance an Intel quad-core and\n\n1459\n01:17:16,492 --> 01:17:20,562\nit does multi-threading or\nhyper-threading technology,\n\n1460\n01:17:20,562 --> 01:17:25,330\nthen even though you have a quad\ncore physical logical unit in it.\n\n1461\n01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:30,900\nAnyways, multiple processors\non board of the CPU itself.\n\n1462\n01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:34,976\nWhat it's going to be represented here as\nis twice what the physical cores is so\n\n1463\n01:17:34,976 --> 01:17:39,130\nif you have a quad cores CPU you're\ngonna see it as eight cores in here.\n\n1464\n01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:43,760\n>> Now we do have this button on here,\nresource monitor.\n\n1465\n01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,700\nAnd resource monitor right,\nit's like a task manager on steroids.\n\n1466\n01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:48,810\n>> Yes.\n\n1467\n01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:53,100\n>> It can show about the same\nkind of thing, right?\n\n1468\n01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,750\nOur CPU, memory, disk and network right?\n\n1469\n01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:59,515\nThe four cores that we talked earlier, but\n\n1470\n01:17:59,515 --> 01:18:04,743\nit gets a bit more granular and\nit shows us a lot of stuff going\n\n1471\n01:18:04,743 --> 01:18:09,675\non with our system, and\nwe go through and set the stuff.\n\n1472\n01:18:09,675 --> 01:18:13,377\nNow this right here,\nit's all real time performance so\n\n1473\n01:18:13,377 --> 01:18:17,060\nif we want to log this stuff,\nlittle knowledge check.\n\n1474\n01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:20,300\nIf we want to log our performance and\n\n1475\n01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:24,030\nwhat's going on, Wes,\nthe tool that we would use for that?\n\n1476\n01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:25,176\n>> Logging our performance?\n\n1477\n01:18:25,176 --> 01:18:26,318\nI don't know.\n\n1478\n01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:28,275\nIs it gonna be performance monitor?\n\n1479\n01:18:28,275 --> 01:18:29,300\n>> [LAUGH] Yep.\n\n1480\n01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,435\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1481\n01:18:30,435 --> 01:18:33,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Didn't, didn't pull one on you.\n\n1482\n01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:34,346\nBut, yeah.\n\n1483\n01:18:34,346 --> 01:18:37,720\nSo resource monitor\n>> Real time data if we want to log it,\n\n1484\n01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,170\nperformance monitor.\n\n1485\n01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:41,084\n>> That's right\n>> All right,\n\n1486\n01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:46,010\nso we got into good old task manager,\nall right.\n\n1487\n01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:53,241\nHere's another fun tool for a monitoring\nstuff in our systems, reliability monitor.\n\n1488\n01:18:53,241 --> 01:18:56,980\nAlright, so\nI just started to type in reliability.\n\n1489\n01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:59,170\nAnd so we go in our little search,\nclick on this guy.\n\n1490\n01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:04,270\nNow this right here will show our system.\n\n1491\n01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:11,960\nAnd it will give us a cute little\ngraph on how reliable our system is,\n\n1492\n01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:16,480\nand affecting it, you know,\ncrashes, airs, that sort of thing.\n\n1493\n01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:20,870\nNow, on this profile, here, I built this\none up before the series of the show.\n\n1494\n01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:25,190\nI normally use Windows 8 for\neverything, but I installed Windows 7.\n\n1495\n01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:28,530\nSo, my history doesn't\ngo back very far at all.\n\n1496\n01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:33,681\nBut, we see on this day here,\nthis would be the 12th.\n\n1497\n01:19:33,681 --> 01:19:36,300\nI got some problem.\n\n1498\n01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:41,608\nI click on it, FCU update,\nupdate service, FCU update or FC update.\n\n1499\n01:19:41,608 --> 01:19:48,088\nYeah, so we can check out our\nsystem service here and goodness.\n\n1500\n01:19:48,088 --> 01:19:54,360\nAnd if this PC had been installed here for\na while we can drill real far back and\n\n1501\n01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:58,880\nget a good overview look at\nhow reliable our system is.\n\n1502\n01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,050\n>> Yeah, and you look.\n\n1503\n01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:02,425\nYou got a statistical Took\na snapshot at what that,\n\n1504\n01:20:02,425 --> 01:20:04,920\nthat little graph bar is\ncalled the stability index.\n\n1505\n01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:09,335\nAnd as things happen,\nwhether it's an error or a warning,\n\n1506\n01:20:09,335 --> 01:20:14,560\nthe stability index is gonna lower and\nthat's the reliability part.\n\n1507\n01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,660\nHow reliable is your computer?\n\n1508\n01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:17,230\nHow stable is it?\n\n1509\n01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:19,340\nEvery time you have something\nlike this that goes on.\n\n1510\n01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,180\nWhether it's a warning.\n\n1511\n01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:21,410\nWhether it's an error.\n\n1512\n01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:22,590\nWhether it's a critical event.\n\n1513\n01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:24,090\nIt's going to lower that stability index.\n\n1514\n01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:27,870\nNow the information level events, that\nyou see there, it's really no different,\n\n1515\n01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:28,970\nthan what we see in event view.\n\n1516\n01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:30,420\nIt's not really going to effect anything.\n\n1517\n01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,110\nIt's just letting you know,\nhey this service started,\n\n1518\n01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:34,060\nor hey this updated happened.\n\n1519\n01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:36,820\nNow if an update happens,\nand it fails to install.\n\n1520\n01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:39,100\nIt's going to lower\nthe stability index as well too.\n\n1521\n01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:43,440\nSo it's just an overall quick statistical\nsnapshot of the reliability or\n\n1522\n01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:47,070\nstability of your computer\nover a course of time.\n\n1523\n01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:48,110\n>> Nice.\n\n1524\n01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:51,710\nAll right.\nNow, the stability index.\n\n1525\n01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:55,930\nYeah, I didn't realize it had a number,\nor like a name.\n\n1526\n01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:56,580\n>> Yes it does.\n\n1527\n01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:57,620\nIt has a designation.\n\n1528\n01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:01,610\n>> Look at that line is it towards\nthe top, or is it towards the bottom?\n\n1529\n01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:02,160\n>> That's okay,\n\n1530\n01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,650\nI usually call a lot of the technology\nissues just a whatchamacallit\n\n1531\n01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:06,020\nnext to the thingamajig, but that's good.\n\n1532\n01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,260\nDon't you understand?\n\n1533\n01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:13,010\nYour own contribution to\nthe English language, thank you.\n\n1534\n01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:17,790\n>> All right, now another tool I guess\nthat we can use to, I guess, tweak or\n\n1535\n01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:24,930\nmonitor our performance in a way, perhaps\nour startup performance, is in msconfig.\n\n1536\n01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:27,800\nWe're going to get to that guy,\nwe'll click on Start.\n\n1537\n01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,720\nAnd then, msconfig.\n\n1538\n01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,550\nAll right, so it pops up there, right.\n\n1539\n01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:33,290\nAnd you can just Click on this guy.\n\n1540\n01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:36,810\nSo, System Configuration, right?\n\n1541\n01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:39,930\nSo, we get an overview of items here.\n\n1542\n01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,175\nWe can set R Boot.\n\n1543\n01:21:41,175 --> 01:21:44,850\nI see the one that I\nnormally use down there.\n\n1544\n01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:47,310\nWindows 8.1 I use for everyday computing.\n\n1545\n01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:53,740\nThis current one up here is the one I'm\nusing right now for the show, here.\n\n1546\n01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:56,040\n>> Yeah, and it's good,\nif you can stop here for a second.\n\n1547\n01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,970\nBecause I'm not running multi-boot.\n\n1548\n01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:00,340\nI use virtualization.\n\n1549\n01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:02,460\nSo I just have a host operating system.\n\n1550\n01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,640\nAnd I put all of my machines\nin virtual machines.\n\n1551\n01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:07,410\nSo I don't get to see the cool\nstuff right here that we're seeing.\n\n1552\n01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:09,760\nAnd essentially, if I understand it right,\n\n1553\n01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,840\nwhat you're seeing here is your\nboot configuration data, your BCD.\n\n1554\n01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,625\nAnd that's the path to\nthe operating system.\n\n1555\n01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:19,240\nIn the early operating system like XP,\nyou would be seeing the boot.ini file.\n\n1556\n01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:23,020\nAnd it's essentially, just a replacement\nfor that earlier file that shows the boot\n\n1557\n01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:25,190\nloader, hey,\nI need to load an operating system.\n\n1558\n01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,030\nThe boot loader's going to say,\nwhere do I find it?\n\n1559\n01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:29,250\nWell, I find it right here\nin this information here.\n\n1560\n01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:31,720\nAnd you can also,\nselect the default operating system.\n\n1561\n01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,210\nAnd you'll see over there,\nthere's a timeout, 30 seconds.\n\n1562\n01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:35,190\nWhen you're presented with a multi,\n\n1563\n01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:40,710\nmultiple operating system selection\nscreen, if I can say that right.\n\n1564\n01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:42,270\nIt'll give you your choice.\n\n1565\n01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:45,450\nNow, if you move the down arrow,\nthe timer stops.\n\n1566\n01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:47,590\nWell, you could optimize this.\n\n1567\n01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:48,440\nWell what if you're like me?\n\n1568\n01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:51,740\nAnd you don't have all these operating\nsystems here to check, to choose from and\n\n1569\n01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:52,960\nyou don't need that selection screen?\n\n1570\n01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:53,830\nWell, you can potentially,\n\n1571\n01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:57,268\nincrease the performance by\nreducing the time out on that.\n\n1572\n01:22:57,268 --> 01:22:58,115\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1573\n01:22:58,115 --> 01:23:02,040\nAll right, over here on the start up tab.\n\n1574\n01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,900\nI can just drag this out a little bit.\n\n1575\n01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:08,520\nThese are the items that we\nhave starting up with Windows.\n\n1576\n01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,030\nNow, you know,\nthere isn't really a whole lot in here.\n\n1577\n01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:13,950\nPerhaps, other systems have\nbeen installed for a while.\n\n1578\n01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:19,110\nThere could be a number of items in\nhere at startup along with Windows.\n\n1579\n01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:22,760\n>> You've got D-Link starting up.\n\n1580\n01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:23,539\n>> Yeah.\n\n1581\n01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:24,318\nYeah.\n\n1582\n01:23:24,318 --> 01:23:25,097\nYeah.\n\n1583\n01:23:25,097 --> 01:23:28,430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And let's say that yeah,\n\n1584\n01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:30,770\nthat DAEMON Tool's there.\n\n1585\n01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:35,590\nWe can Uncheck that guy, I don't\nreally want him starting up at all.\n\n1586\n01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:39,390\nAll this other stuff, Intel things,\nseem to be pretty important.\n\n1587\n01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:43,390\nSo, just uncheck that guy,\nwe'll click apply, and there we go.\n\n1588\n01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:48,200\nSo, now, the next time I boot Windows 7,\nthis guy will not be starting up.\n\n1589\n01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:51,260\nWe click on OK and it's gonna say hey,\ndo you wanna restart right now?\n\n1590\n01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,270\nOr just exit?\n\n1591\n01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:56,420\nAnd we won't make any,\nwe won't worry about it until later.\n\n1592\n01:23:56,420 --> 01:24:00,110\nSo exit without a restart.\n\n1593\n01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:01,850\n>> Yeah and it's important,\nyou know the start up tab,\n\n1594\n01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:05,180\nif you disable that stuff, with the\nexception of maybe anti-virus software.\n\n1595\n01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:08,450\nNever wanna disable that,\nyou want that during your boot time.\n\n1596\n01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:09,800\nDoesn't necessarily mean,\n\n1597\n01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:12,580\nyou're gonna break whatever functionality\nit is that you're disabling.\n\n1598\n01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:16,000\nYou're just saying, it's not that\nI don't want this to start up.\n\n1599\n01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,290\nJust keep it out of my boot process.\n\n1600\n01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:21,780\nSo I can optimize that and I can get\nto that desktop a little bit quicker.\n\n1601\n01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,910\n>> All right, so\nwhat about with our laptops?\n\n1602\n01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:29,490\nI guess not only laptops but desktops too,\ncan kinda fall into this category as well.\n\n1603\n01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:33,545\nFor maintaining our PCs is\nget into the power, right?\n\n1604\n01:24:33,545 --> 01:24:34,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1605\n01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:36,400\n>> To get it into our power settings,\nright?\n\n1606\n01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,370\nSo we'll just pull this up.\n\n1607\n01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:40,640\nSo we have a face with the name\nas we talk about them.\n\n1608\n01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,430\nAnd we wanna start in Control Panel.\n\n1609\n01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:50,710\nAnd then, we'll get into our system and\nsecurity and power options.\n\n1610\n01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:58,120\nNow specifically, in our objectives, so\nit calls out to configure power plans.\n\n1611\n01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,020\nAll right, so well just go out and\ntake a look at that right now.\n\n1612\n01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:03,450\nAll right so for\nour power plans, there's three.\n\n1613\n01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:07,910\nThere's three default\nbuilt-in power plans.\n\n1614\n01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:09,340\nWe have Balanced.\n\n1615\n01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:10,970\nWe have Power Saver.\n\n1616\n01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:13,950\nAnd Wes, do you remember the last one?\n\n1617\n01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:14,880\n>> High performance.\n\n1618\n01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,190\n>> High performance.\n\n1619\n01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:17,190\nHigh performance, right?\n\n1620\n01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:19,970\nKinda funny they hide it.\n\n1621\n01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:22,170\nGenerally, I have that one checked.\n\n1622\n01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:25,010\nCuz it's like, hey,\nif I've got the processing power,\n\n1623\n01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:25,710\ngive it to me all the time.\n\n1624\n01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:28,140\n>> That's the same thing I\ndo with my desktop as well.\n\n1625\n01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:29,850\n>> You know,\njust don't hold anything back.\n\n1626\n01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:30,680\nGive it to me straight.\n\n1627\n01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:31,270\n>> Yep.\n\n1628\n01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:36,620\n>> So we've got balanced right\nin the middle of the things.\n\n1629\n01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:40,320\nWe have power saver,\nit'll throttle certain items down.\n\n1630\n01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,030\nIt'll turn off CPU fans.\n\n1631\n01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:46,020\nI guess,\nunless you absolutely have to have them.\n\n1632\n01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:48,550\nHigh performance is everything.\n\n1633\n01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:50,740\nIt doesn't hold anything back.\n\n1634\n01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:55,112\nNow to create a power plan, if we wanted\nto have our own specific power plan,\n\n1635\n01:25:55,112 --> 01:25:56,060\nall right?\n\n1636\n01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,390\nThere's this little lid.\n\n1637\n01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:59,650\nLittle lid?\nI was reading that up there.\n\n1638\n01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:02,080\nJust click this link here.\n\n1639\n01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:06,360\nNow, we can base it off of one of\nthese others as a baseline to start.\n\n1640\n01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,285\nSo we'll say my custom plan one.\n\n1641\n01:26:09,285 --> 01:26:09,940\n>> Sure that works.\n\n1642\n01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:10,525\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1643\n01:26:10,525 --> 01:26:14,595\n>> We can base it off,\noff of this balanced one here.\n\n1644\n01:26:14,595 --> 01:26:15,925\nNow, we have two different ones.\n\n1645\n01:26:15,925 --> 01:26:18,605\nNow, on a desktop,\nit will be slightly different.\n\n1646\n01:26:18,605 --> 01:26:20,170\nThis is on a laptop.\n\n1647\n01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:21,780\nSo, it has a battery.\n\n1648\n01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:25,100\nSo, we can have certain settings\non when it's on a battery, and\n\n1649\n01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,300\nwhen it's plugged in.\n\n1650\n01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,910\n>> Right.\n>> So, perhaps on a battery, sure.\n\n1651\n01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:31,040\nDim the desktop right away.\n\n1652\n01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,385\nWe don't want that,\nif I'm not using it, sure.\n\n1653\n01:26:33,385 --> 01:26:34,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1654\n01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:35,110\n>> Turn it off.\n\n1655\n01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:37,365\nTurn off the display,\nwe would say, two minutes.\n\n1656\n01:26:37,365 --> 01:26:39,250\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That might be a little aggressive.\n\n1657\n01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:43,550\nThen, it will put the PC to sleep,\nright, five minutes.\n\n1658\n01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:49,890\nIf I walk away from it, if it's sitting\nthere idle, dim the display first.\n\n1659\n01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:52,760\nIf I'm still not reacting to it,\ngo ahead and turn it off.\n\n1660\n01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:56,700\nIf I still don't do anything to this PC,\njust go ahead and shut it down.\n\n1661\n01:26:56,700 --> 01:27:00,390\nIf it's plugged in,\nlet's dim it, turn it off.\n\n1662\n01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:01,180\nRight?\n\n1663\n01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:02,530\nPut it to sleep.\n\n1664\n01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:04,180\nHow about, never.\n\n1665\n01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:04,770\nRight?\n\n1666\n01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:05,860\n>> If it's plugged in, sure.\n\n1667\n01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:06,920\n>> If it's plugged in, sure.\n\n1668\n01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,190\n>> Yeah\n>> Let's just go ahead and leave it.\n\n1669\n01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:11,070\nMaybe, I left it plugged in for\na good reason.\n\n1670\n01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:13,970\n>> Yeah, you know while your in here,\nI customized this on my laptop.\n\n1671\n01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:17,665\nIn fact, I believe, I still have this\nplan if I haven't formatted my laptop.\n\n1672\n01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:20,390\n[LAUGH] I believe I still have\na customized plan as well.\n\n1673\n01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:25,560\nFor me,\nthere are times when I close this lid,\n\n1674\n01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:29,700\nI don't want Windows to\nput the computer to sleep.\n\n1675\n01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,660\nBut I only do that when it's plugged in.\n\n1676\n01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:37,230\nAnd the reason I say that is,\nbecause I use the external port here.\n\n1677\n01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:41,970\nAnd I'll close the lid on purpose, and\nI'll stick the laptop off to the side,\n\n1678\n01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:44,500\nbecause I'm just using\nthe external monitor.\n\n1679\n01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:47,760\nSo what I do is I create\na custom plan that says,\n\n1680\n01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:53,020\nif I'm on battery power, when I close\nthe lid, don't do anything to the monitor.\n\n1681\n01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:56,590\nNow, I pretty much keep the other\nsettings the same, to save power.\n\n1682\n01:27:56,590 --> 01:27:59,393\nBut it says, if I'm on battery,\nnot on battery, I'm sorry,\n\n1683\n01:27:59,393 --> 01:28:02,170\nis I'm on the AC adaptor and\nI close that lid, don't do anything.\n\n1684\n01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:05,213\nLeave it on, because if I didn't have\nit that way, I wouldn't be able to use\n\n1685\n01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:07,750\nthe external monitor, or\nhook this up to an external monitor.\n\n1686\n01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:09,340\nAnd essentially turn it\nback into a desktop.\n\n1687\n01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:10,850\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1688\n01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:11,800\nYeah.\nAnd, yeah,\n\n1689\n01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:15,510\nsince that's a virtual machine on my PC,\nI do have that option up here.\n\n1690\n01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:17,890\nSo choose closing the lid.\n\n1691\n01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:18,630\nClosing it does, right?\n\n1692\n01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:20,748\nSo on this one right here,\nit's on battery.\n\n1693\n01:28:20,748 --> 01:28:21,720\nOr it's plugged in.\n\n1694\n01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,740\nPut to sleep.\n\n1695\n01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:30,600\nNow, back in my younger days,\nwhen I'd take my laptop to school.\n\n1696\n01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:34,480\nWhen I was traveling from class to class,\nI would shut the lid.\n\n1697\n01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,250\nWell, maybe,\nI didn't want it to completely power down.\n\n1698\n01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:39,740\nWhat if I didn't,\nI just wanted it to sit there.\n\n1699\n01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:42,290\nBecause class is going to\nstart in five minutes, right.\n\n1700\n01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:47,510\nSo how about when I close the lid and if\nit's on battery, just don't do anything.\n\n1701\n01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:50,340\nLet me just shut the lid,\nit's under my arm anyways.\n\n1702\n01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:53,900\nAnd as I go to my next class,\nI can sit down, open up that lid.\n\n1703\n01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:58,320\nAnd then, it doesn't power down,\nanything of that sort.\n\n1704\n01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:01,900\nWe can change those settings there.\n\n1705\n01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:05,500\nOn a desktop or on a PC as well.\n\n1706\n01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,760\nThe power button, same kind of idea.\n\n1707\n01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:12,540\nNot closing that lid, but then, the power\nbutton, when I press it, what do you do?\n\n1708\n01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:14,340\n>> Yep.\nHow does it react?\n\n1709\n01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:18,250\n>> So we got those different options.\n\n1710\n01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:21,780\n>> Now we have to be careful,\nI was looking at the objectives.\n\n1711\n01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:23,890\nBut I know we have this on the list,\n\n1712\n01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:28,320\nI think it's a good place to say,\nbe careful with these power plans.\n\n1713\n01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,510\nBecause, they will affect mobile\nperformance, mobile computing performance.\n\n1714\n01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:33,690\nAnd the reason I say that is,\n\n1715\n01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:37,640\nif you look at what the difference\nis between balanced and power saver.\n\n1716\n01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,950\nBalanced shuts everything down,\nputs it in a low powered state.\n\n1717\n01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:42,720\nEvery component that can be.\n\n1718\n01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:43,960\nWell, so does power saver.\n\n1719\n01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,090\nPower saver does the same thing.\n\n1720\n01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:47,410\nSo you might be saying,\nwell what's the difference?\n\n1721\n01:29:47,410 --> 01:29:51,540\nWell balanced is called balanced, because\nit puts all devices in a low powered state\n\n1722\n01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:54,240\nwithout risking processing power.\n\n1723\n01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,330\nIt's still going to give you\nthe processing power if you need to.\n\n1724\n01:29:56,330 --> 01:29:57,730\nAnd that's why they say balance.\n\n1725\n01:29:57,730 --> 01:30:01,600\nConserve power where I can, but\ndon't hinder my performance.\n\n1726\n01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,050\nPut it on power saver and\nit's going to throttle everything down.\n\n1727\n01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:06,430\nIt's going to slow everything down.\n\n1728\n01:30:06,430 --> 01:30:08,660\nAnd it's even gonna slow\ndown the processor.\n\n1729\n01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:13,870\nSo if you happen to, let's say you\nhave a customized power plant.\n\n1730\n01:30:13,870 --> 01:30:16,890\nAnd, again, it's gonna be a power\nsaver plan when you're on battery.\n\n1731\n01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:21,000\nWell if you go from battery or\nfrom AC adapter to battery.\n\n1732\n01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,130\nAnd you've gone on a power saver plan.\n\n1733\n01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:27,550\nYou're probably going to notice a pretty\ngood difference in the performance\n\n1734\n01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:28,920\nwhen an application launches.\n\n1735\n01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:32,020\nBecause in power saver it says,\nI don't care if you need the performance.\n\n1736\n01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:36,090\nYou're not gonna get it, because my focus\nright now, is saving you all, you know,\n\n1737\n01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:37,957\njust battery conservation.\n\n1738\n01:30:37,957 --> 01:30:41,208\n>> Yeah, we can drill down\ninto settings like that, so.\n\n1739\n01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:43,940\nFor our balance,\nwe can click on change plan settings.\n\n1740\n01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:48,610\nAnd you know, with these power plans,\nit's like there's three levels, all right?\n\n1741\n01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:51,290\nSo, right here we can choose\nthese as our first level.\n\n1742\n01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:53,930\nWe can change plan settings, all right?\n\n1743\n01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:58,510\nAnd this is kinda the second level of\ndifferent items that we can select.\n\n1744\n01:30:58,510 --> 01:31:00,680\nAnd then there is a third level, right?\n\n1745\n01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:03,450\nSo there's change advanced power settings.\n\n1746\n01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:07,740\nNow, as this right here pops up,\nsome of these items in here\n\n1747\n01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:11,880\nlike I said, wasn't quite the best option.\n\n1748\n01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,850\nOkay, it's right here, so,\nrequire password on wakeup, right?\n\n1749\n01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:17,815\nSo, this option here is grayed out,\nI can't do anything.\n\n1750\n01:31:17,815 --> 01:31:19,680\nWell, here we go, right?\n\n1751\n01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,920\nWith good old UAC, right?\n\n1752\n01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:22,930\nWe'll click on this right here.\n\n1753\n01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:25,060\nSure enough, now we can change it.\n\n1754\n01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:25,970\nNow let's see.\n\n1755\n01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:27,670\nDa, da.\nI'm gonna minimize this.\n\n1756\n01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,470\nAnd we can go down into here.\n\n1757\n01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:34,300\nYeah, some items that\nI do like to check on\n\n1758\n01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:35,905\n>> Wireless adaptor settings.\n\n1759\n01:31:35,905 --> 01:31:36,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1760\n01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:39,700\n>> Right when it's in power saving mode,\nright?\n\n1761\n01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:43,300\nI like to set it to just\nmaximum everything, right?\n\n1762\n01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:46,520\n>> So, wireless adaptor settings,\nI mean, a poor wireless signal?\n\n1763\n01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,140\nI mean, come on.\n\n1764\n01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:51,210\n>> Yeah, so hey,\ntake all the power you need, all the time.\n\n1765\n01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:57,370\nSo we got that one there and\nthen, processor power management.\n\n1766\n01:31:58,450 --> 01:32:00,520\nSo our minimum processor state.\n\n1767\n01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,030\nSo how much?\n\n1768\n01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:03,140\nWell, you know that's fine.\n\n1769\n01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:04,381\nMaximum processor state?\n\n1770\n01:32:04,381 --> 01:32:07,630\nYou know,\nsure we can throttle this guy down.\n\n1771\n01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:12,330\nDepending on some situations you may\nprefer to, but heck if you've got it,\n\n1772\n01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:16,910\nif you paid the money for an I7 in\nyour laptop, I mean heavens sakes.\n\n1773\n01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:22,160\n>> There's nothing like having\na 15 minute battery life.\n\n1774\n01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:25,465\nGo back to the days of\nthe old NiCd batteries.\n\n1775\n01:32:25,465 --> 01:32:26,770\n>> [LAUGH] There we go.\n\n1776\n01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:29,170\n>> I got one hour battery life.\n\n1777\n01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:29,670\n>> Yeah.\n\n1778\n01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:30,300\n>> It was amazing!\n\n1779\n01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:33,450\nIt ran really fast, right?\n\n1780\n01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:34,770\nRight into the grave.\n\n1781\n01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:37,890\n>> Yeah.\n\n1782\n01:32:37,890 --> 01:32:43,890\nThe other option that I like to\ncheck is drill that into display.\n\n1783\n01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:44,470\nLet's go down here.\n\n1784\n01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:47,200\nAdaptive brightness, so\n\n1785\n01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:51,588\nif you do have a light sensor on the PC,\njust like a smartphone.\n\n1786\n01:32:51,588 --> 01:32:57,130\nBright environments, the screen will\nget brighter so, that you can see it.\n\n1787\n01:32:57,130 --> 01:33:01,371\nAnd dark environments, if the lights\nturn off in class or something,\n\n1788\n01:33:01,371 --> 01:33:03,190\nthen display can dim itself, right?\n\n1789\n01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:07,810\nSo it can save some of that\npower whenever you can.\n\n1790\n01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:12,190\nAll right, Wes, anything else on power,\npower plans, power settings?\n\n1791\n01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:13,030\n>> No, just, thank goodness\n\n1792\n01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:15,030\nwe don't have to do it through\nthe command prompt anymore.\n\n1793\n01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:16,505\nThank goodness we got a GUI.\n\n1794\n01:33:16,505 --> 01:33:21,115\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now the last little bit that we have,\n\n1795\n01:33:21,115 --> 01:33:28,450\nright, on our objectives, right\n>> So, is this guy right here.\n\n1796\n01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:33,490\nConfiguring our desktop environment,\nnow along with our moderating and\n\n1797\n01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:37,790\nmaintaining, our desktop environment,\nwe can tweak settings there.\n\n1798\n01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:42,140\nTo do whatever it is that we want\n>> What do you wanna do with it?\n\n1799\n01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:43,670\n>> Yep, yep.\nAnd it's remember,\n\n1800\n01:33:43,670 --> 01:33:45,070\nwe talked about personal computing.\n\n1801\n01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:49,270\nWe talked about the experience being,\nyou can configure your workspace.\n\n1802\n01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:50,220\nWe call it your desktop.\n\n1803\n01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:54,165\nIt's your work area if you will, and.\n\n1804\n01:33:54,165 --> 01:33:58,315\nPretty much every aspect of\nthe desktop: taskbar, start menu.\n\n1805\n01:33:58,315 --> 01:33:59,685\nFor the most part are configurable.\n\n1806\n01:33:59,685 --> 01:34:02,475\nThere are certain things that you\ncan modify just a little bit and\n\n1807\n01:34:02,475 --> 01:34:03,935\ncan't really tweak too much.\n\n1808\n01:34:03,935 --> 01:34:06,735\nBut, one of the things that they're\ngonna call out here is configuration\n\n1809\n01:34:06,735 --> 01:34:08,090\nof the Start menu.\n\n1810\n01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:13,420\nSo, if we go to the Start menu,\nor the Start button here.\n\n1811\n01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:17,000\nWe can right-click on the Start button,\nand we can choose Properties.\n\n1812\n01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,600\nWhen we choose Properties, you're gonna\nsee that we have some options here.\n\n1813\n01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,880\nNow, when you are looking\nat this interface,\n\n1814\n01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:29,800\nyou're gonna see that, if I right\nclick the Start menu, it chooses,\n\n1815\n01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:32,570\nand choose properties it takes\nme to the Start menu tab.\n\n1816\n01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:34,050\nWell, if I right click task bar and\n\n1817\n01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:35,080\nchoose properties, well,-\n>> [LAUGH]-\n\n1818\n01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,280\n>> We are pretty\n\n1819\n01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:37,330\nmuch in the same spot here.\n\n1820\n01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:39,600\nSo to configure the Start menu.\n\n1821\n01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,270\nThere are different things you can do.\n\n1822\n01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:45,000\nLike you can customize, one of\nthe things you might see somebody do is,\n\n1823\n01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,680\nwe scroll all the way\ndown on the customize.\n\n1824\n01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:50,380\nWe can do Administrative Tools here\ndisplay on the All Programs and\n\n1825\n01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:52,010\nStart menu.\n\n1826\n01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:54,300\nThat might be something\nyou wanna do there.\n\n1827\n01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:58,210\nYou can store and\ndisplay recently opened programs.\n\n1828\n01:34:58,210 --> 01:35:00,170\nWell, let's go ahead and apply this.\n\n1829\n01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:02,760\nAnd If I push the Start menu,\nthere's a lot of stuff.\n\n1830\n01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:03,890\nAnd you know what?\n\n1831\n01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:05,820\nI use that XPS viewer daily.\n\n1832\n01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:07,880\nWell, not really.\n\n1833\n01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:11,340\nBut it's showing up on my Start menu and\nfor me that's a little bit too cluttered.\n\n1834\n01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:14,553\nSo you can customize the Start Menu by\nright-clicking on the Start button and\n\n1835\n01:35:14,553 --> 01:35:15,780\nchoosing Properties.\n\n1836\n01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:19,920\nAnd you come in here and you can uncheck\nthat Store Recently Opened Programs in\n\n1837\n01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:24,890\nthe Start Menu and same thing here.\n\n1838\n01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:28,250\nStore and Display Recently Opened Programs\nin the Start Menu and the Task Bar.\n\n1839\n01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:30,720\nChoose OK to this.\n\n1840\n01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:34,770\nAnd now what I get the ability to do,\nit just cleans the slate.\n\n1841\n01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:37,980\nNow maybe, there's a specific\napplication that I do use a lot.\n\n1842\n01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:40,480\nLike for instance, maybe,\nI use Remote Desktop.\n\n1843\n01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:43,430\nWhat I can do is come in here,\ntype Remote Desktop.\n\n1844\n01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:44,510\nI can right click on it.\n\n1845\n01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:46,530\nAnd I can choose it,\npin to the start menu.\n\n1846\n01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:51,430\nOnce I do that, if come back to the start\nmenu, I now have the application I want.\n\n1847\n01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:55,090\nI do this a lot on my own machines,\nif I use virtual box.\n\n1848\n01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:57,090\nI use that to, so I'll pin that.\n\n1849\n01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:59,000\nJust that applications that I want.\n\n1850\n01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,920\nThe other thing that they talked\nabout us configuring the taskbar.\n\n1851\n01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:07,042\nAnd again if I right-click on\nthe taskbar and choose Properties,\n\n1852\n01:36:07,042 --> 01:36:10,440\nguys it's the same interface,\nit's just a different tab.\n\n1853\n01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:13,700\nNow one of the things that you can\ndo here, and some people like this,\n\n1854\n01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:19,420\nthere's never any middle ground on this\none, they either like it or they hate it.\n\n1855\n01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:24,281\nWe can choose the Auto-hide the task bar.\n\n1856\n01:36:24,281 --> 01:36:28,920\nNow, I don't personally like this but\nmaybe some people do.\n\n1857\n01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:32,630\nMaybe they want a little more\nreal estate on their desk top.\n\n1858\n01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:37,210\nSo, again it hides the taskbar,\ntaskbar goes away.\n\n1859\n01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:41,210\nAnd again, hover over this,\nbring it back here.\n\n1860\n01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:43,407\nAnd I'm gonna change that setting back,\nI really don't like that setting.\n\n1861\n01:36:43,407 --> 01:36:45,860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you can customize it.\n\n1862\n01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:47,240\nI can unlock the taskbar.\n\n1863\n01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:48,990\nAnd now I'll tell you,\nI have used this feature.\n\n1864\n01:36:48,990 --> 01:36:53,260\nI thought there was no way I was gonna\nmove the taskbar to any other location\n\n1865\n01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:57,580\nthan what it defaults to, until I had dual\nscreens with 15 virtual machines running.\n\n1866\n01:36:57,580 --> 01:37:02,730\nAnd I kept moving it to one side and\nin a newer operating system, your taskbar,\n\n1867\n01:37:02,730 --> 01:37:05,030\nwell your taskbar shows\nup on both screens.\n\n1868\n01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:08,780\nSo on one screen I would move\nthe taskbar to the side and\n\n1869\n01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:11,510\nthat gets it out of the way of the virtual\nmachines and I can still get to the icons.\n\n1870\n01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:13,823\nBut I tell you, that's probably\nthe only time I've ever done that.\n\n1871\n01:37:13,823 --> 01:37:14,945\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1872\n01:37:14,945 --> 01:37:17,090\nthat's one of the things that you can do.\n\n1873\n01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:22,960\nNow the other thing that they call out on\nthe exam here guys is showing gadgets.\n\n1874\n01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:27,430\nGadgets are mini applications and\nthey were introduced in Vista and\n\n1875\n01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:29,430\nthen were continued in Windows 7.\n\n1876\n01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:33,300\nAnd to configure gadgets,\nthere are built-in gadgets and\n\n1877\n01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:35,588\nyou can right-click on the desktop here,\nyou can choose Gadgets.\n\n1878\n01:37:35,588 --> 01:37:38,714\nAnd you're gonna see a few that\nare built in to the operating system.\n\n1879\n01:37:38,714 --> 01:37:43,150\nNow, one thing to keep in mind is that\nthese are called out on the exam, but\n\n1880\n01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:45,430\nthey were discontinued after Windows 7.\n\n1881\n01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:47,840\nStill means that we still\nhave built-in ones here, so\n\n1882\n01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,470\nI'm just gonna take a look\nat a couple of them here.\n\n1883\n01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:52,720\nI'm gonna double-click the calendar,\ndouble-click the clock.\n\n1884\n01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:56,080\nAnd we can modify these to\nsuit our needs if we need to.\n\n1885\n01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:57,450\nSo for instance, the clock here,\n\n1886\n01:37:57,450 --> 01:38:02,040\nI can choose a little wrench icon,\ngives me the ability to name the clock.\n\n1887\n01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,269\nSo I'm gonna be creative here and\nI'm gonna name this, well, clock.\n\n1888\n01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:09,578\nAnd I like that, neon,\nI like that one right there.\n\n1889\n01:38:09,578 --> 01:38:13,486\nAnd I'm gonna show the second hand,\nand now I have my clock that,\n\n1890\n01:38:13,486 --> 01:38:15,490\nwell, I've named clock there.\n\n1891\n01:38:15,490 --> 01:38:16,949\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Some of these,\n\n1892\n01:38:16,949 --> 01:38:19,860\nyou might not be able\nto do too much to them.\n\n1893\n01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:21,960\nLike for instance,\nI can choose a larger view here and\n\n1894\n01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:24,210\nreally all it does is\nshows me the days too.\n\n1895\n01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:25,500\nSo you can configure gadgets,\n\n1896\n01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:30,610\nthey're just mini applications, however\npast Windows, they've been discontinued.\n\n1897\n01:38:30,610 --> 01:38:33,130\nThey found security\nvulnerabilities in third party\n\n1898\n01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:34,930\ngadgets that could exploit the system.\n\n1899\n01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:37,390\nSo Microsoft said okay,\nthat's enough, enough is enough,\n\n1900\n01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:39,585\nno more third party gadgets anymore.\n\n1901\n01:38:39,585 --> 01:38:43,436\nAnd because of the security\nvulnerabilities they pretty much have done\n\n1902\n01:38:43,436 --> 01:38:44,340\naway with them.\n\n1903\n01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:48,590\nNow one of the last things that we\nhave to look at is the themes, right?\n\n1904\n01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:49,990\nThe themes?\n\n1905\n01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:50,620\n>> Yeah, themes.\n\n1906\n01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:55,430\nNow you know, last little bit right,\nso the themes on our PC's\n\n1907\n01:38:55,430 --> 01:39:00,260\nare on the desktops, right, so\nthe colors, the aspects of it.\n\n1908\n01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:04,960\nSo we've got the arrow\ntheme on Windows and so\n\n1909\n01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:10,260\nto get to our themes, right-click,\ngo down into Personalize.\n\n1910\n01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:12,800\nAnd we've got these different\nthemes that are all set up.\n\n1911\n01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:15,704\nWe've got our basic themes\ndown here at the bottom,\n\n1912\n01:39:15,704 --> 01:39:18,010\nwe can change it to Windows Classic.\n\n1913\n01:39:18,010 --> 01:39:21,900\nI'm not sure how much these would\nmess with the screen sharing\n\n1914\n01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,470\nsoftware that I have running right now.\n\n1915\n01:39:23,470 --> 01:39:27,200\nBut we've got our arrow themes for\nour glass type things,\n\n1916\n01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,948\nthat transparency,\nwhich I really like the glass stuff.\n\n1917\n01:39:30,948 --> 01:39:31,948\n>> I do too.\n\n1918\n01:39:31,948 --> 01:39:36,222\n>> Of course, with the screen sharing\nsoftware that we have outputting here,\n\n1919\n01:39:36,222 --> 01:39:40,030\nit doesn't play well so\nwe're just in our basic theme.\n\n1920\n01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:42,590\n>> Well, I'll give you an example here.\n\n1921\n01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:45,573\nI believe Don says that he\nwants all the performance.\n\n1922\n01:39:45,573 --> 01:39:49,229\nCuz when you look at this really,\nvisually rich as they call it,\n\n1923\n01:39:49,229 --> 01:39:52,940\nthis interface,\nit really is a good-looking interface.\n\n1924\n01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:56,000\nBut it's taking resources, there's no\ndoubt that it takes resources from you.\n\n1925\n01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,280\nAnd for instance, like Don, he says,\n\n1926\n01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:01,780\nwell I want the performance in the\ncomputer, over that visually rich desktop.\n\n1927\n01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:04,370\nSo he'll switch his to\nthe Classic in favor of\n\n1928\n01:40:04,370 --> 01:40:08,410\nallocating those resources to other\nmore important things to him,\n\n1929\n01:40:08,410 --> 01:40:12,210\nthat makes his computing experience\na little bit more efficient.\n\n1930\n01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:13,480\nMe?\n\n1931\n01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:15,250\nIt's all about the flair.\n\n1932\n01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:16,590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean this is awesome.\n\n1933\n01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:17,860\n[LAUGH] I love the interface.\n\n1934\n01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:19,329\nI love the arrow interface.\n\n1935\n01:40:19,329 --> 01:40:23,910\n>> Mm, now there is one option that is\nhiding behind our little window down there\n\n1936\n01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:26,620\nthat we also wanna take a look at.\n\n1937\n01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:31,820\nAnd it is the screen saver,\nwe can jump full screen right quick.\n\n1938\n01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:35,740\nWe got the screen saver\nhiding back behind there, and\n\n1939\n01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:40,810\nclicking on good old screen saver,\nwe get in here and set those items.\n\n1940\n01:40:40,810 --> 01:40:43,330\nSo right now there's no screen saver.\n\n1941\n01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:48,400\nAll right, when a computer sits idle,\nthis is gonna dim the monitor or\n\n1942\n01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,850\njust turn that monitor off,\nand that's fine.\n\n1943\n01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:54,490\nNow if we wanted something [LAUGH]\n>> 3D text?\n\n1944\n01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:58,489\n>> 3D text, right, flying [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1945\n01:40:58,489 --> 01:41:00,788\n>> Flying at us, we can do that.\n\n1946\n01:41:00,788 --> 01:41:05,495\nNot really green,\n\n1947\n01:41:05,495 --> 01:41:10,435\ngoing green is kind of the craze these\ndays, which I'm completely on board for.\n\n1948\n01:41:10,435 --> 01:41:13,975\nSo no screen savers,\njust turn that monitor off.\n\n1949\n01:41:13,975 --> 01:41:21,170\nWe could modify those things and\nreally make our PC, ours.\n\n1950\n01:41:21,170 --> 01:41:22,220\n>> And I don't know,\n\n1951\n01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:27,410\nit might be debatable whether monitors\nanymore suffer from the burn-in effect.\n\n1952\n01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:29,365\nI mean the screen savers originally,\n\n1953\n01:41:29,365 --> 01:41:32,120\nthey were to help us alleviate\nthat burn-in effect.\n\n1954\n01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:35,510\nWell, that's not the only reason\nyou might set a screen saver.\n\n1955\n01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:38,650\nOne of the things I can think of is for\nsecurity purposes, right?\n\n1956\n01:41:38,650 --> 01:41:41,690\nWe wanna make sure that we lock our\ncomputers when we walk away from it for\n\n1957\n01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:43,340\nsecurity purposes, but what if we don't?\n\n1958\n01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:45,850\nWell, you can have a fail safe that says,\nafter a certain minute or\n\n1959\n01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:47,855\nfew minutes of inactivity,\nit goes to the screen saver.\n\n1960\n01:41:47,855 --> 01:41:51,304\nThen it requires you to enter a password\nto get back into your computer or\n\n1961\n01:41:51,304 --> 01:41:52,407\nproductive desktop.\n\n1962\n01:41:52,407 --> 01:41:53,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1963\n01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,206\n>> I just say that because some people\nmight say there's not a burn-in effect\n\n1964\n01:41:56,206 --> 01:41:58,573\nanymore, then other people could say well,\nlook at this.\n\n1965\n01:41:58,573 --> 01:42:00,705\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can still see this image in here and\n\n1966\n01:42:00,705 --> 01:42:02,182\nit's been there for 40 days.\n\n1967\n01:42:02,182 --> 01:42:05,502\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so with burn-in,\n\n1968\n01:42:05,502 --> 01:42:10,786\nthe new phrase is\ntemporary image retention.\n\n1969\n01:42:10,786 --> 01:42:12,167\n>> Wow.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1970\n01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:13,814\n>> Burn-in, right?\n\n1971\n01:42:13,814 --> 01:42:15,740\n[LAUGH]\n>> My mind is hurting from that one.\n\n1972\n01:42:15,740 --> 01:42:19,740\n>> Yeah, I know, temporary image\nretention, that's the new way to call.\n\n1973\n01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:21,115\n>> No, that's great.\nIt sounds important.\n\n1974\n01:42:21,115 --> 01:42:21,615\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1975\n01:42:21,615 --> 01:42:23,198\n>> Actually, it sounds worse.\n\n1976\n01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:25,185\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's like ow,\n\n1977\n01:42:25,185 --> 01:42:26,698\nI definitely wanna stay away from that.\n\n1978\n01:42:26,698 --> 01:42:27,648\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1979\n01:42:27,648 --> 01:42:32,106\nSo as far as configuring\nour desktop environment,\n\n1980\n01:42:32,106 --> 01:42:36,366\nthere are just a few\nsettings that we touched on.\n\n1981\n01:42:36,366 --> 01:42:39,318\nThere's many more, and other third party\n\n1982\n01:42:39,318 --> 01:42:44,200\nutilities that we can put in to\nreally get the most out of our PCs.\n\n1983\n01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:46,840\nAnd we can do it on an individual basis or\n\n1984\n01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:49,740\nwe could set it through\nour local group policy.\n\n1985\n01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:54,590\nAnd we can force these settings,\na certain environment, well, force,\n\n1986\n01:42:54,590 --> 01:42:59,750\nwe can, I'm trying to think\nof a nice way to say it.\n\n1987\n01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:02,847\nWell, we can tell our users [LAUGH]\nwhat screen saver they're gonna have.\n\n1988\n01:43:02,847 --> 01:43:04,490\nWe can tell them what-\n>> Here we go.\n\n1989\n01:43:04,490 --> 01:43:05,490\n>> What?\n>> I've got a technical term.\n\n1990\n01:43:05,490 --> 01:43:07,710\nWe can define the computing environment.\n\n1991\n01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:09,907\n>> We can define\nthe computing environment.\n\n1992\n01:43:09,907 --> 01:43:10,418\nThank you, Wes.\n\n1993\n01:43:10,418 --> 01:43:13,535\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we can do that for our users and\n\n1994\n01:43:13,535 --> 01:43:18,140\nreally help them out, because setting up\nthe wallpaper can be a laborious task.\n\n1995\n01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:23,243\n>> I mean, heavens sakes, all those\ncat pictures and days of the week.\n\n1996\n01:43:23,243 --> 01:43:25,075\n>> That's right.\nHow's that for image retention?\n\n1997\n01:43:25,075 --> 01:43:27,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Define the computing experience.\n\n1998\n01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:30,070\n>> Define the computing experience,\nI like that.\n\n1999\n01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:32,920\nAll right, Wes, well,\nthat wraps up our topics for the day.\n\n2000\n01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:37,310\nWe had a number of different items to\ngo to with our event collector sets,\n\n2001\n01:43:37,310 --> 01:43:40,110\nour data collector sets,\nour desktop environment and\n\n2002\n01:43:40,110 --> 01:43:43,390\ndifferent tools that we can\nuse to monitor Windows.\n\n2003\n01:43:43,390 --> 01:43:46,840\nAnd we can get a good idea on\nwhat's going on behind the scenes.\n\n2004\n01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:48,300\n>> Yeah, that's right, definitely.\n\n2005\n01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:50,500\n>> Well, any last parting words?\n\n2006\n01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:51,906\n>> No sir.\n>> Before we part, no?\n\n2007\n01:43:51,906 -->

That's- >> A month ago.\n\n39\n00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,490\n>> That's pretty good.\n\n40\n00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,450\nYeah, mine was about two months ago here.\n\n41\n00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,650\nAnd remember that our computer\nsystems have changed over time.\n\n42\n00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,120\nAnd now if Nate for one reason or\nanother ends up losing his data,\n\n43\n00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,220\nin that time that he actually,\nsince he last backed up.\n\n44\n00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,490\nWell, now we've got an issue.\n\n45\n00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,150\nHe can't go back and recover it.\n\n46\n00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,910\nAnd so, we want to make sure that you\nunderstand how to use the tools inside of\n\n47\n00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,340\nWindows 7 to go ahead and create a backup.\n\n48\n00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,770\nAnd we'll take a look at some\nof the options there as well.\n\n49\n00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,836\n>> Yep, so Ronnie, before we get started,\nlet me ask you this.\n\n50\n00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,160\n>> Yes.\n\n51\n00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,270\n>> So you backed up two months ago.\n\n52\n00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,830\n>> I did.\n>> All right,\n\n53\n00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,200\nhave you ever lost a lot of data\nthat you have not had backed up?\n\n54\n00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,440\n>> I have not lost a lot of\ndata that I've had backed\n\n55\n00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:03,980\nup,\n>> Okay.\n\n56\n00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,350\n>> Except for\nthe very fact that I've misplaced stuff.\n\n57\n00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:06,911\n>> All right, well, let me,\n>> Yeah.\n\n58\n00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:08,895\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, instead of a lot of data have you\n\n59\n00:03:08,895 --> 00:03:11,503\never lost any data that you\nwere unable to replace?\n\n60\n00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:13,128\n>> Yes.\n\n61\n00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:14,255\nYes I have.\n\n62\n00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,050\nBy just simply misplacing the information.\n\n63\n00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,564\n>> Oh, okay.\n>> Yeah.\n\n64\n00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:20,158\n>> Right?\n\n65\n00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:20,866\n>> Yeah, true.\n\n66\n00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,086\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, all right.\n\n67\n00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:22,960\nWell yeah, okay.\n\n68\n00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,020\nWell I.\n\n69\n00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,180\n>> Are wondering if I'm lying to you?\n\n70\n00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,860\n>> Well no, no, no.\n\n71\n00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,450\nI thought there was more to the story.\n\n72\n00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,628\n>> And so just like yes, I haven't, okay.\n\n73\n00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,730\n>> So,\nyou've never had a hard drive crash?\n\n74\n00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,140\nYou've never had, like, carrying something\nand just dropped it and it broke?\n\n75\n00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,045\n>> No, no.\n\n76\n00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:42,838\nI've been one of those lucky people\nthat really haven't had a lot of\n\n77\n00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:44,260\nfailures like that.\n\n78\n00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,150\nBut what I have had again, is the idea\nof me misplacing stuff, or moving from\n\n79\n00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,810\none computer system to another one,\nand not remembering where I put stuff.\n\n80\n00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,430\nSo yeah, it does happen.\n\n81\n00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,961\n>> I'll share a quick story with you.\n\n82\n00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:58,510\n>> All right, sounds great.\n\n83\n00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,750\n>> So I have this, I had this hard drive.\n\n84\n00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,490\nAnd on the hard drive,\nit was a terabyte drive, and\n\n85\n00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,000\nit was chock full of\nall these media files.\n\n86\n00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,150\nMovies and TV shows and MP3s,\nit had thousands upon thousands of MP3s.\n\n87\n00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,600\nEverything was on this one drive and\nthat's all it had.\n\n88\n00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,140\nThere were no other backups or copies and\nit's just music and media, right?\n\n89\n00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,310\nNothing terribly, irreplaceable.\n\n90\n00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,950\nOne day, I browsed to the hard drive,\nand Windows did not recognize it.\n\n91\n00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,920\nIt was just nothing.\n\n92\n00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,050\nAbsolutely dead in the water.\n\n93\n00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,230\nI pulled that drive out and\nI stuck it another PC.\n\n94\n00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,190\nI ran some recovery software on it.\n\n95\n00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,180\nI could browse and\nI could see the file structure and so\n\n96\n00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,310\nit wasn't completely dead.\n\n97\n00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,198\nI just couldn't get to it the normal way.\n\n98\n00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:52,480\nI couldn't double-click on any songs and\nplay them back in Media Player.\n\n99\n00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,310\nWell, so with this recovery software,\n\n100\n00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,290\nI was able to recover just about\nall the files from that disk.\n\n101\n00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,730\n>> Wow, you must have been very happy.\n\n102\n00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,010\n>> I was.\nHowever, as it recovered everything,\n\n103\n00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,160\nit created one folder.\n\n104\n00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,870\nIt was recovery and\nthen the date that it ran.\n\n105\n00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,336\nAnd browsing into that\nfolder it was file00001.\n\n106\n00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:17,129\n>> Renamed all your files.\n\n107\n00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:19,720\n>> Below it file00002.\n\n108\n00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,280\nIt took everything, I mean there were\nthousands upon thousands of files.\n\n109\n00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,960\nAnd it gave them all generic names and\ndumped them all into one folder.\n\n110\n00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,700\n>> Nice.\n[LAUGH]\n\n111\n00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,326\n>> So I still have it so\n\n112\n00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:35,007\nthat folder is tucked away\nbecause one day I might wanna\n\n113\n00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:39,296\nlisten to something that\nI forgot a long time ago.\n\n114\n00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:40,253\n>> [CROSSTALK] zero, zero, five.\n\n115\n00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:43,332\n>> Yeah.\n\n116\n00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:47,670\nI still consider it a loss,\nthere's like all the meta data for\n\n117\n00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,070\nthe all songs, MP3s, what album they were\non, the track, the artists, everything.\n\n118\n00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,310\nEven all the movies with their,\nanyhow, but yes, so\n\n119\n00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,530\nif I had a backup of that folder, then\nit would have saved a lot of heartache.\n\n120\n00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,080\nAnd now today,\nI use Windows storage spaces.\n\n121\n00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,580\nI use storage spaces to\nslave in a bunch of drives,\n\n122\n00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,990\nI think there's five drives now that\nit writes all the information onto.\n\n123\n00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,170\nSo if I lose one drive,\nthen everything's fine.\n\n124\n00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,150\n>> Yeah.\n>> I've since upgraded my stuff.\n\n125\n00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,160\n>> Yeah, so remember that.\n\n126\n00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,780\nWhat Nate is mentioning\nhere in storage spaces.\n\n127\n00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,650\nYou're not going to find\ninside of Windows 7.\n\n128\n00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,880\nWhat you are going to find though is\nactually going to be the Windows Backup\n\n129\n00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,690\nitself.\n\n130\n00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,100\nSo Nate, do you wanna take a look\nat the idea of Windows Backup?\n\n131\n00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,760\n>> All right yeah, sure.\n\n132\n00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,170\nSo Windows Backup, the bulk of what\nwe're gonna be going over today.\n\n133\n00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,150\nAnd Ronnie, I did get up those objectives\n>> Oh, excellent.\n\n134\n00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,910\n>> I browsed to them, and so\ntoday we'll be going over\n\n135\n00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,440\nconfiguring a backup with recovery\ndisks and it's scheduling a backup.\n\n136\n00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,810\nWe'll be going over the recovery options,\n\n137\n00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:56,480\nsuch as system restore points and\nhow to restore from these restore points.\n\n138\n00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,440\nRolling back a driver.\n\n139\n00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,280\nAnd then file restore points and\nprevious versions of files, shadow copies.\n\n140\n00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,460\nRestore user profiles.\n\n141\n00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:14,490\nI know of two tools off the top of\nmy head that we can use to get that.\n\n142\n00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,900\nAnyhow, there we go.\n\n143\n00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,930\n>> All right, sounds good.\n\n144\n00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,090\n>> So to jump back anything I'm\ngonna just start from the beginning.\n\n145\n00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,980\nSo control panel all right, we'll go and\nclick on System and Security.\n\n146\n00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,570\nAnd then in System and Security,\nwe'll go down do Backup and Restore.\n\n147\n00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,220\nSo here we go.\nSo now on this Windows 7 machine I haven't\n\n148\n00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,000\nrun any backups or any history like that.\n\n149\n00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,336\nAnd so, there's not really a whole\nlot to look at in this point.\n\n150\n00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:48,958\nBut the very first objective mentions\ncreating a system repair disk.\n\n151\n00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:53,865\nNow to create a system repair disk, the\nlink is just over here on the left side.\n\n152\n00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:58,697\nNow if we click on it,\nit's going to give me a big fat error\n\n153\n00:07:58,697 --> 00:08:02,610\nthat it does not detect a DVD burner.\n\n154\n00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,890\nSo on this XPS there\nare no optical drives,\n\n155\n00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,840\nwhich is a trend I've been seeing lately.\n\n156\n00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,850\nThese machines,\nthey don't have any optical drives but\n\n157\n00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:16,590\nif you want a system repair disk, you're\ngoing to need a DVD burner of some kind.\n\n158\n00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:21,370\nAnd so basically what this is is going\nto make like a Windows PE type disk.\n\n159\n00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,060\nA disk with some recovery tools on it.\n\n160\n00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,940\nYou can boot from this disk in case your\ncomputer is just hosed to no end and\n\n161\n00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,690\nbooting off of this disk, it'll give you\noptions that you can run a system restore,\n\n162\n00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:41,790\nyou can load up a system image, a bit for\nbit copy of Windows, things of that sort.\n\n163\n00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,400\nSo a good thing to have it.\n\n164\n00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:49,430\nIf you have a Windows installation DVD,\nthat will also work in this case.\n\n165\n00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,480\nWe will able to click through\nthe really cool wizard,\n\n166\n00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,220\nif I move this out to the side.\n\n167\n00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,820\nSo what you do is put in a blank DVD or\n\n168\n00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,140\nCD in your optical drive and\nit will pop up here.\n\n169\n00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,580\nThen you click on Create Disk,\nand that's it.\n\n170\n00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,290\nIt burns a disk.\n\n171\n00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,260\nYou can write on to it,\nsystem repair disk.\n\n172\n00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,820\nIn the event the PC can't boot up,\nof course you have\n\n173\n00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,720\nto change the boot order in your\nBIOS to boot from a DVD first.\n\n174\n00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,970\nJust put that into your DVD drive.\n\n175\n00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,780\nClose that tray.\n\n176\n00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,280\nBoot off that disk, and booyah!\n\n177\n00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,980\nThere you go.\n\n178\n00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,090\nSo, that's that one.\n\n179\n00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,410\nNow, what about just creating\na backup in general?\n\n180\n00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,970\nWe're running a little bit long, so\n\n181\n00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,940\nwhy don't we just step\nthrough Through the process.\n\n182\n00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,010\n>> Sounds great.\n\n183\n00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,240\n>> All right so first things first.\n\n184\n00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640\nWindows back up have been set up for sure.\n\n185\n00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,610\nAll right let's go ahead and set it up.\n\n186\n00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,040\nSo we're going to run on this and\nthis window.\n\n187\n00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,740\nHere we'll start.\n\n188\n00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,460\nAll right now for backing up Windows,\n\n189\n00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,500\nwe cannot back up to our system drive.\n\n190\n00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,320\nWe're backing up the system drive or\n\n191\n00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,620\nC drive in this case, we can't save\nto it for one reason or another.\n\n192\n00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,140\nWe have to have some other source.\n\n193\n00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:16,040\nWhether it's a USB key large enough,\na network share, which may or\n\n194\n00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,790\nmay not be ideal, or\njust a separate hard drive.\n\n195\n00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:26,070\nNow in this one, so I do have this\nextra drive so if we browse into here.\n\n196\n00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,580\nNow if you can see I got C drive, which\nRonnie, here's a little knowledge check.\n\n197\n00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,160\nThere's a lock on here.\n\n198\n00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,310\nDo you know what that lock signifies?\n\n199\n00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,430\n>> That lock is there for\n\n200\n00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,870\nthe idea of BitLocker,\nwhich is our full volume encryption.\n\n201\n00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,940\nOr it's a little icon that you\njust decided to post on your own.\n\n202\n00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,111\nNo, it's actually BitLocker.\n\n203\n00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:45,870\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n204\n00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,120\nI was gonna say you had it right,\nbut now you're getting off topic.\n\n205\n00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,450\nBut, yeah, so okay, BitLocker.\n\n206\n00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,180\nAll right, so we've got our system drive,\nand then we've got our D drive now.\n\n207\n00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,950\nSo I wonder, let's see.\n\n208\n00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,710\nAll right, so we've got used space,\n36 gigabytes.\n\n209\n00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,365\nAll right, yeah,\nwe've got plenty of space.\n\n210\n00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:08,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so let's,\n\n211\n00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,340\nwe'll go back here.\n\n212\n00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,320\nAll right, sounds pretty good.\n\n213\n00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,220\nAll right, so\nwhat is our backup destination?\n\n214\n00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,020\nWell we could say that on the network but\n\n215\n00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:22,230\nour backups can be pretty large, depending\non what it is that we're backing up.\n\n216\n00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,770\nSo saving over to a network,\nif it's a hundred megabit network,\n\n217\n00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:32,690\nIt's going to transfer at around\nten to 11 megabytes per second.\n\n218\n00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,375\nWhich I think isn't very fast.\n\n219\n00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it could take a while.\n\n220\n00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,270\nSo, we'll just choose the D drive.\n\n221\n00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,300\nAll right.\nAnd yep and\n\n222\n00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,870\nthat's fine as the physical disk.\n\n223\n00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,270\nSure, we'll click on next.\n\n224\n00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,500\nNow what is it that we want to back up?\n\n225\n00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,150\nWe could let Windows decide,\nor let me decide.\n\n226\n00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:58,400\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nchoose let me decide.\n\n227\n00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,940\nAll right and now, so\nhere we can pick the different items so\n\n228\n00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,910\nwe've got the libraries and\nRonnie, you've got a user account.\n\n229\n00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,150\n>> Yeah, look at that.\n\n230\n00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,010\n>> All right,\nhopefully you've created your own.\n\n231\n00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,390\nSo we can back this stuff up.\n\n232\n00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:17,460\nAnd then into the C drive, we can back\nup the whole drive if we wanted to.\n\n233\n00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,960\nBut let's not.\n\n234\n00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,460\nLet's back up the Dell folder.\n\n235\n00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,680\nI don't know what's in the Dell.\n\n236\n00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,860\nDrivers sure.\n\n237\n00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,790\nWe'll back up Dell.\n\n238\n00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,710\nWe'll back up.\nWhat else do you want to back up Ronnie?\n\n239\n00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,430\n>> Backup your updates.\n\n240\n00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,720\n>> Updates, we'll back up updates.\n\n241\n00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,850\nThe user's folder, no, because we're going\nto get our profiles and stuff up there.\n\n242\n00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,640\nRecycle bin?\n\n243\n00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,520\n>> Backup your drivers.\n\n244\n00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,290\nIs that a separate,\nthat is a separate folder.\n\n245\n00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,430\n>> We'll back that stuff up and\nthat's pretty good.\n\n246\n00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,720\nAnything in program files we can\njust reinstall some stuff in there.\n\n247\n00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,840\nAll right, so it looks pretty good.\n\n248\n00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,850\nNow, we do have this option down here.\n\n249\n00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,940\nNow, this is to include a system image.\n\n250\n00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,730\nSo Ronnie, tell us.\n\n251\n00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,250\nSo what's the difference between\na Windows backup and a system image?\n\n252\n00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,650\n>> Okay, in the system image, it actually\ngathers everything on the hard drive and\n\n253\n00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,540\nessentially takes your entire\ncontents of your hard drive and\n\n254\n00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,920\nstores it as a single file.\n\n255\n00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,360\nOkay, this is gonna take the longest\nbackup that you can actually run, but\n\n256\n00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,160\nit will give you the most\ncomplete backup that you'll have.\n\n257\n00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,200\nThe way that Nathan is actually walking\nthrough this, notice he can pick and\n\n258\n00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,100\nchoose what he actually wants to backup.\n\n259\n00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,200\nSystem energy, of no real choice.\n\n260\n00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,445\nHere Nathan is actually being picky.\n\n261\n00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:33,170\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n262\n00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,660\nYou know with that system there, sure\nenough, it is just a bit for bit copy, or\n\n263\n00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,470\nwhat would you say, a bare metal restore?\n\n264\n00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,030\n>> Yup.\n\n265\n00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,120\n>> So I mean there are other,\nthere's third party tools that will do it.\n\n266\n00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,600\nWhat's the one that you use around here,\nstarts with a P?\n\n267\n00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,810\n>> Oh Paragon.\n\n268\n00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,665\n>> Yep.\nParagon.\n\n269\n00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:52,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Paragon does.\n\n270\n00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,760\nAnd there's a new one too that-\n>> Don't tell me.\n\n271\n00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,429\nParagon two.\n>> No.\n\n272\n00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:57,510\n>> Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n273\n00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,230\n>> No, not Paragon Two.\n\n274\n00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:05,110\nSo Ronnie, he ran into this,\nrestoring, a Windows server.\n\n275\n00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,930\n>> Yes.\n>> Restoring this thing, and\n\n276\n00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,250\nRonnie, do you wanna share the story?\n\n277\n00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,722\n>> No, you can share the story.\n\n278\n00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:11,880\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n279\n00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,860\n>> It hurts me.\n\n280\n00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,950\nIt hurts me to share.\n\n281\n00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,556\n>> Yeah, well.\n\n282\n00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:17,005\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Long story short.\n\n283\n00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:20,730\nRonnie was fighting with this Windows\nserver to try to restore this thing.\n\n284\n00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,560\n>> Yeah.\n>> And was just hitting these dead\n\n285\n00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,060\nends all over, and\nit ended up being the RAID controller.\n\n286\n00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,010\n>> Yeah.\n\n287\n00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,330\n>> Anyhow, long story short,\n\n288\n00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,350\nhe was looking for\na way to restore this Windows server.\n\n289\n00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,435\nAnd we stumbled upon\na utility called Redo.\n\n290\n00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:36,340\nR, e, d, o.\n\n291\n00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,350\nAnd using this Redo utility,\nwe're able to take a backup\n\n292\n00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:45,510\nof an existing server and\nrestore it to this new server.\n\n293\n00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,650\nAnd yeah, you got it up and\nrunning, right?\n\n294\n00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,460\n>> Yeah.\n\n295\n00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,090\n>> Nice, so other third party\nutilities bit for bit backup,\n\n296\n00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,180\nWindows can do it as well\nwith the system image.\n\n297\n00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,040\n>> And you may be wondering why we,\n\n298\n00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,645\nwhy are we still harping\non the idea of Windows?\n\n299\n00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:02,950\nWell, one, it's included inside\nof Windows 7 which means for\n\n300\n00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,910\nyou it's free and for\nyour company again another free item\n\n301\n00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,240\nthat you have as long as you're willing\nto do it machine by machine here.\n\n302\n00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,180\nBut the idea of doing this for\nyour machine and\n\n303\n00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,850\ndoing this system image is\na very good thing to do.\n\n304\n00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,430\nAnd actually this is what I do instead,\nI actually use this system image cuz\n\n305\n00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,550\nI know I want to make sure I\nget everything if I need it.\n\n306\n00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,260\n>> All right, for\nus though I'm going to uncheck it.\n\n307\n00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,370\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, now click on next.\n\n308\n00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,460\nWe got our little summary screen,\nthat works.\n\n309\n00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,690\nIt says here that our EFS certificates\nare not included in this back up.\n\n310\n00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,125\nIt's not covered in here on\nbacking up our certificates.\n\n311\n00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:45,338\nIn the EFS set of objectives,\nMike Roderick he\n\n312\n00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:50,292\ncovered, how to back up our certificates.\n\n313\n00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:51,042\nBut, all right.\n\n314\n00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:52,482\n>> Now, before we hit that,\n\n315\n00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:56,020\nnotice right above that little\nbox that Nate pointed out there.\n\n316\n00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,245\nIs the idea of scheduling this right,\nso remember when Nate was talking about\n\n317\n00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:04,740\nthe idea that it seems fairly slow\nto Nate, it seems fairly fast to me.\n\n318\n00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,170\nWhy?\nBecause I'm on a slower network than\n\n319\n00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,660\nNate's actually used to.\n\n320\n00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,530\nBut for me it is actually fairly nice, but\n\n321\n00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:15,290\nif it is slow what you may chose to do Is\nuse the option to schedule the backup.\n\n322\n00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,060\nGo ahead and\nclick on that Change Schedule for us and\n\n323\n00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,100\nlet's take a look at these options.\n\n324\n00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,179\nThis gives us, again, the ability for\n\n325\n00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:25,140\nus to actually choose what\nschedule we want to run it on.\n\n326\n00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,618\nWe may not choose to do this in terms\nof right in the middle of the business.\n\n327\n00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:31,230\nSo when Nate is doing his day trading,\n\n328\n00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,920\nhe may choose to not actually run his\nbackup during that particular point.\n\n329\n00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,320\nBut he may choose to run it at some\npoint during the mid afternoon or\n\n330\n00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,920\nlate in the evening, but\nNate's probably still up doing stuff on\n\n331\n00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,800\nbecause he's probably trading over in\nJapan by that point for all we know.\n\n332\n00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,980\nBut whatever it might be, right, you\nchoose a schedule that actually fits your\n\n333\n00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,920\nparticular way that you\nactually want to back it up.\n\n334\n00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,570\nAnd that's probably the better way to go\nbecause that means it's automatically\n\n335\n00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,400\ngoing to do it for you,\n\n336\n00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,359\nand you don't have to be reminded like oh\nyeah I better run my backup this month.\n\n337\n00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,640\nA week.\nWhatever you want to do, daily.\n\n338\n00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,000\n>> All right, now Sunday at 7 PM,\n\n339\n00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,320\nthere's evening shows,\n>> I know,\n\n340\n00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,520\nyour wrestling shows were selling or\nsomething like that.\n\n341\n00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,600\n>> Wrestling shows.\n\n342\n00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,460\n>> My Gypsy Wedding.\n\n343\n00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:11,975\n>> The what?\n\n344\n00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:16,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n345\n00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,190\nLet's pick a day.\n\n346\n00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:19,920\nNot Sunday at 7:00.\n\n347\n00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,990\nProbably want to do it,\ndaily might be a bit much.\n\n348\n00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,030\nMonthly.\n>> I do mine monthly.\n\n349\n00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,100\n>> You do yours monthly?\n\n350\n00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,950\nAll right.\n\n351\n00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,430\nLet's just say weekly.\n\n352\n00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,670\nWe make a lot of changes.\n\n353\n00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,250\nAll right.\nNot Sunday.\n\n354\n00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,850\nWhat is it Monday?\n\n355\n00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,770\n>> Sure, Saturday it will.\n\n356\n00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,500\nLet's pick Friday.\n\n357\n00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,180\nBecause Friday I'm gonna\nleave the computer on.\n\n358\n00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,170\n>> Okay,\nyou're gonna leave the computer on.\n\n359\n00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:48,235\n>> Yeah, I'll shut it down each all right,\nhow about three in the morning?\n\n360\n00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,710\n>> Three in the morning Friday.\n\n361\n00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,610\nI might be using it.\n\n362\n00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,230\nWe'll do 1 AM.\n\n363\n00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,240\nAll right.\n\n364\n00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,410\nYeah cause we'll be up Friday at one.\n\n365\n00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,320\n>> Yeah sure.\n\n366\n00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,060\n>> So we'll go ahead and click OK,\nSave settings, and run the back up.\n\n367\n00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,990\nDrag that window up, pull that down.\n\n368\n00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,640\n>> Now this is the first time,\nwe're backing up, so\n\n369\n00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,030\nit's going to immediately run a back up,\nbut at this point from on, it should kick\n\n370\n00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,280\nin on the schedule that we set, and\nthat's probably a better way to do it.\n\n371\n00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,330\nWe don't need to be surprised by this,\nwe go in and\n\n372\n00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,230\nset it up, we want to be sure\nthat it actually is running, and\n\n373\n00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,460\nthat we are doing it, and so\nhere it is actually backing it up.\n\n374\n00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,090\n>> So, yeah, this guy here is going\nto take a minute or two to run, so\n\n375\n00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:37,050\nwe will once this guy is done it will come\nback and revisit some of these options.\n\n376\n00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,752\nSo let's talk a little bit\nabout system restore points.\n\n377\n00:18:41,752 --> 00:18:46,120\nAll right, so Ronnie how does system\nrestore differ from a backup?\n\n378\n00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,400\n>> System restore point, is what it\ndoes is it really takes a look at\n\n379\n00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,500\njust the operating system\n>> The files are actually essential\n\n380\n00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,720\nto your particular computer system.\n\n381\n00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,010\nIt's not taking a look at\nany of your personal files.\n\n382\n00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,180\nIt's does not do anything.\n\n383\n00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,030\nIt's going to actually take a snapshot for\na picture, that's what I like to call it,\n\n384\n00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,730\nof the way your hard drive existed\nat a particular point in time.\n\n385\n00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,680\nAnd so, that way,\nif anything changes on the system\n\n386\n00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,210\nthat can affect the overall\noperating system itself.\n\n387\n00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,690\nWe at a later date can come back and\nchoose this restore point and,\n\n388\n00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,610\nsay, make all of the Windows\nfiles the way it was on\n\n389\n00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,300\nthis date when everything still\noperated and still worked here.\n\n390\n00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,100\nOkay?\nSo it actually does help us to do that.\n\n391\n00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,940\n>> And we can either turn it on or\nwe can turn it off and\n\n392\n00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,830\nwe can adjust several things about it.\n\n393\n00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,050\nAll right, so, our backup did finish.\n\n394\n00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,610\nLet's see, so, let's say that\n\n395\n00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,890\nFriday night at 1 PM instead of\ngoing to the club on that day,\n\n396\n00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,790\nwe're going to stay inside and\nmaybe we'll be using RPC.\n\n397\n00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:55,160\nWe do need to alter our schedule,\nit's pretty easy.\n\n398\n00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,480\nRight down there below,\nwe can change our settings.\n\n399\n00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,130\nWe can modify the schedule that\nour backups are going to take.\n\n400\n00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,540\nOf course once we step through the wizard\nagain, we can change that stuff, managing\n\n401\n00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,070\nour space, we can see what these backups\nare gonna take up on our hard drives.\n\n402\n00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,980\nNow running these backups, I mean,\nunless we overwrite these backups, or\n\n403\n00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:21,390\nwe just keep a certain number, it'll chew\nup a good degree of hard drive space.\n\n404\n00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,580\nOf course,\ndepending on how large they are.\n\n405\n00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,180\nSo on your backups, how many do you keep,\nhow far back do you go?\n\n406\n00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,530\nDo you just keep one, five, 90?\n\n407\n00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,510\n>> I normally just keep one,\nbecause I'm constantly overwriting my\n\n408\n00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,100\npicker system image\n>> With the latest thing that happened.\n\n409\n00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,810\nIf I deleted something in the past,\nI don't really have that anymore.\n\n410\n00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,130\nBut usually if I deleted it, I probably\ndon't really care about it as well.\n\n411\n00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,830\nNow Nate just showed us a very\nimportant screen on what we saw there.\n\n412\n00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,520\nThe reason why is that\nremember that backup is only\n\n413\n00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,790\nhalf of the process itself, right?\n\n414\n00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:58,870\nRunning the backups, get that copy\nsaved is incredibly essential for us.\n\n415\n00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,780\nBut the other part of it is actually\nthe idea of taking a look and\n\n416\n00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,070\nviewing those backups as well, because you\nwant to make sure that they've run and\n\n417\n00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,180\nyou want to make sure, of course,\nthat you can access them too.\n\n418\n00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,420\nSo don't take it for granted.\n\n419\n00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,340\nSo a lot of times you may come in and\nyou realize where it tells you hey,\n\n420\n00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,560\nthe backup did not successfully run.\n\n421\n00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,840\nWell you need to go in there and\nfigure out why it didn't run so\n\n422\n00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,490\nyou can actually get it back\non the regular schedule.\n\n423\n00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,455\nIf you're like me though, you take a look\nand go I'll deal with that later and\n\n424\n00:21:26,455 --> 00:21:29,200\nlater on is like six weeks later or\nsix months later and\n\n425\n00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,170\nyou don't want that to happen right.\n\n426\n00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,100\nSo you want to make sure that you\nare able to, to again take a look and\n\n427\n00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,315\nverify that the backups have run\ncause this is gonna be important,\n\n428\n00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:42,035\nespecially if the data on your\ndrives are critical to you.\n\n429\n00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:43,647\nYou don't want to lose any of that.\n\n430\n00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:44,609\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n431\n00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:45,715\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n432\n00:21:45,715 --> 00:21:47,025\nSo, let's see.\n\n433\n00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:49,205\nSo, down here, we've got, all right, so\n\n434\n00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:55,607\nwe can see our our summary of our\ndata file backup, 125 megs, not bad.\n\n435\n00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:58,417\nOur system image, though,\n>> Zero.\n\n436\n00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,077\n>> bit for bit zero, so\nwe don't have anything back.\n\n437\n00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:03,137\nOther files, free space in total.\n\n438\n00:22:04,497 --> 00:22:07,047\nSo if we do want to take\na gander at our backups,\n\n439\n00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:09,787\nas Ronnie mentioned,\nwe can view on that stuff.\n\n440\n00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:15,280\nThere we go, we can delete things,\nwe can manage our backups that way.\n\n441\n00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,640\nBut with the system image being at zero,\nlet's go ahead and create a system image.\n\n442\n00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,110\n>> That's all right with me.\n\n443\n00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,750\n>> We'll click on Close.\n\n444\n00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,650\nTo create that system image,\nover on the left hand\n\n445\n00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,999\nside above our System Repair Disk,\nCreate a System Image.\n\n446\n00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,940\nWell click on this, and so once again to\ncreate a system image of our C drive,\n\n447\n00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,740\nwe can't save it to the C drive,\n\n448\n00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:47,550\nwe have to pick some other location,\nand of course we get that warning.\n\n449\n00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,570\nSo the C and\nD drive they're not two separate disks,\n\n450\n00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,160\nthey're different partitions.\n\n451\n00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,840\nSo if the physical disk itself fails,\n\n452\n00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,500\nwell then we'll lose our backups and\neverything.\n\n453\n00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,380\nBut for our demo, that should be fine.\n\n454\n00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,270\n>> Now this is more important to\nthe home user than it is to a regular\n\n455\n00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,140\nbusiness user.\n\n456\n00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,470\nIn terms of business, if you have a little\nbit more experience, you know that you\n\n457\n00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:13,950\nwould never want to literally back up the\ncontents on your one particular partition\n\n458\n00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,220\nto the same physical hard drive even\nthough it's a different partition.\n\n459\n00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,770\nAgain, most home users may not\nactually not the difference.\n\n460\n00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:25,020\nWhen they look in files for, it looks\nlike two physical separate hard drive.\n\n461\n00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,440\nWell it can work, don't get me wrong,\nin the very fact that one partition could\n\n462\n00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,160\ngrow, and you do have a back up computer\nto replace it on the second partition.\n\n463\n00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,440\nWhat Nate mentioned here was\nabsolutely critical as well.\n\n464\n00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,750\nThe very fact that they're on the same\nphysical drive means that if we have\n\n465\n00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,140\nthe hardware failure, it doesn't matter\nbecause now your backup is gone,\n\n466\n00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,720\nas well as your actual operating\nsystem volume is gone too.\n\n467\n00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,958\nSo, you're gonna actually be in\nmuch more trouble than you think.\n\n468\n00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:54,121\nSo always, best practice is to make\nsure we're either backing up to\n\n469\n00:23:54,121 --> 00:23:58,590\na physical volume, or again,\njust to another machine somewhere else.\n\n470\n00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,390\nUsually across a network.\n\n471\n00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,500\n>> So Ronnie,\nlet's take a look at disk management.\n\n472\n00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,030\n>> Sounds good.\n\n473\n00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,930\n>> We'll just see that these\ntwo are on the same disk.\n\n474\n00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,730\nSo we'll click on this.\n\n475\n00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,020\nSo we'll go to our computer.\n\n476\n00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,000\nLet's click on Manage.\n\n477\n00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,980\nThere's more than one way to\nget to places in Windows.\n\n478\n00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,480\nWe're going to Disk Management.\n\n479\n00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,640\nWe'll just maximize that.\n\n480\n00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,440\nSo sure enough, right?\n\n481\n00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440\nSo there's our C partition, right?\n\n482\n00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,740\nAnd our D partition on Disk 0 right?\n\n483\n00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,980\nSo it's on the same disk.\n\n484\n00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,480\nIf they're on separate disks,\nthen we would have a Disk 1 down here, or\n\n485\n00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,740\nDisk 2 or what not.\n\n486\n00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,080\nSince I got on this machine, same disk.\n\n487\n00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,980\nClose all that.\n\n488\n00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:47,884\nAll right, so creating our system image.\n\n489\n00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:51,060\nSo one or more DVD's.\n\n490\n00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,467\nSo Ronnie, how many system images\ndo you think that you could create,\n\n491\n00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:56,420\nthat would just take one DVD?\n\n492\n00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,115\n>> Not any.\n\n493\n00:24:57,115 --> 00:24:59,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I don't even think you could\n\n494\n00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,020\nactually do that even if you just\ninstalled Windows 7 on it, and\n\n495\n00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,200\nfully expanded.\n\n496\n00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,090\nYou may be able to, but I doubt it.\n\n497\n00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,520\n>> Right, maybe if it's a dual layer DVD.\n\n498\n00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520\n>> It's possible.\n\n499\n00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,300\n>> I think Windows 7,\nthere were like seven, eight gigabytes,\n\n500\n00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,890\nmaybe after its,\nafter you'd done an uninstall.\n\n501\n00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,840\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you can get 9 point something off\n\n502\n00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,770\nof, anyhow.\n\n503\n00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,540\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so we won't choose any DVDs.\n\n504\n00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,320\n>> Yeah, but there is a nice thing, right?\n\n505\n00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,170\nIs that you can't.\n\n506\n00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,237\nSo, what it will do, right, if you\nwant to create this system image, and\n\n507\n00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,520\nyou wanna use DVDs.\n\n508\n00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,310\n>> If you have nat 61.27 gigs, right?\n\n509\n00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:36,740\nYou can probably put that over, what,\n\n510\n00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,250\nabout however many that is 15, 20?\n\n511\n00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,490\n20 actual different DVDs.\n\n512\n00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,240\nAnd of course, you'd sequentially label\nthem to make sure that you could actually\n\n513\n00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,170\nrestore them all.\n\n514\n00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,720\nBut you can, right?\n\n515\n00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,770\nMost people are probably\nnot gonna do this.\n\n516\n00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,650\nBut if you actually wanted to,\n\n517\n00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,710\nthe good thing is it gives you this\nadvantage to be able to do it.\n\n518\n00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,040\n>> You know, Ronnie,\nI haven't burned a DVD in a while.\n\n519\n00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,780\nAbout how long does it\ntake to burn a full disk?\n\n520\n00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,310\nHow long does it take today?\n\n521\n00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,170\n>> I don't even know.\n\n522\n00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,098\n>> Is it three or four minutes?\n\n523\n00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:06,586\n>> Easily.\n\n524\n00:26:06,586 --> 00:26:10,460\n>> I wonder if our director knows.\n\n525\n00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,886\nJason?\nHe's shaking his head.\n\n526\n00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:16,810\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Nobody here has burned a disk in\n\n527\n00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,790\na while.\n\n528\n00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:22,693\nBut if you're having to burn 20 DVDs,\nand let's say, it takes, I don't now,\n\n529\n00:26:22,693 --> 00:26:25,051\nthree, four minutes to burn one disk?\n\n530\n00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:26,880\nRonnie, you're the math guy.\n\n531\n00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,498\nHow much does that come out to?\n\n532\n00:26:28,498 --> 00:26:29,598\n>> A lot.\n\n533\n00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:30,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n534\n00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,370\nMany?\n\n535\n00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,100\nMore than an hour?\n\n536\n00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,330\n>> Yeah, more than an hour.\n\n537\n00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,660\n>> I guess that would be a job for\nyour kids.\n\n538\n00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,490\n>> Yeah.\n>> Like all right,\n\n539\n00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,070\nyou want to earn your allowance,\nyou've got to burn these DVDs.\n\n540\n00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,360\n>> That's right, just say it.\n\n541\n00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,500\nDon't do anything else.\n\n542\n00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,270\n>> Yeah, get a\n>> Because I've got to use the computer.\n\n543\n00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,250\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.\n\n544\n00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,320\nAll right.\nSo other than DVDs,\n\n545\n00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,270\nwe can save to a network location.\n\n546\n00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,290\n>> Yeah.\n>> And of course,\n\n547\n00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:59,525\ndepending on the size of the network,\neven that could take a while.\n\n548\n00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:00,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n549\n00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,180\n>> But we'll just choose the disk.\n\n550\n00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,200\nAll right, and\nnext getting kind of hidden up down there.\n\n551\n00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,800\nAll right.\n\n552\n00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,160\nSo then, what is it exactly\nthat we want to back up?\n\n553\n00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,550\nWell, in this image right here,\nit's all grayed out.\n\n554\n00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,450\nSo it doesn't give us the option.\n\n555\n00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:15,970\nAll right.\n\n556\n00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,480\nSo we'll just click on next.\n\n557\n00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,290\nAnd you chose into backup drive C.\n\n558\n00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,230\n>> Oh no.\n\n559\n00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,000\n>> It's encrypted.\n\n560\n00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,350\nOh, that's right, it's BitLocker.\n\n561\n00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,360\n>> Backup location though,\nwill not be encrypted.\n\n562\n00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,390\nThat's what it's telling you.\n\n563\n00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,090\n>> Okay.\n\n564\n00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,532\nFair enough.\n\n565\n00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:33,550\nAll right so we go back up,\nlittle summary screen, sounds good.\n\n566\n00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,070\nAll right, let's start it.\n\n567\n00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,510\nSo Ronnie, do you wanna take bets\non how long it's gonna take?\n\n568\n00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,320\n>> How long it's gonna take?\n\n569\n00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,420\n>> Yeah to make a system image.\n\n570\n00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,510\n>> Five minutes?\n\n571\n00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,350\nTen minutes?\n\n572\n00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,310\n>> Five? All right.\n>> I'm gonna go with 20 minutes.\n\n573\n00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,780\n>> 20 minutes?\n\n574\n00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,290\n>> All right.\n\n575\n00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,070\n>> Okay.\n\n576\n00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,690\n>> All right.\nGood deal.\n\n577\n00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,892\nAll right, so we'll let this,\nwe'll let this guy run.\n\n578\n00:27:55,892 --> 00:27:58,321\nWe do have a few minutes\nleft on this break.\n\n579\n00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:01,082\nBut I think we'll go ahead and\ntake our break now.\n\n580\n00:28:01,082 --> 00:28:03,000\nWe'll let this guy run.\n\n581\n00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,670\nComing back, we do have a system restore\npoints and some aspects of that.\n\n582\n00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,190\nSound good?\n\n583\n00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:10,810\n>> Sounds great.\n\n584\n00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,310\n>> Sweet.\nAll right.\n\n585\n00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,190\nWe'll get into system\nrestore after the break.\n\n586\n00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:21,440\n[MUSIC]\n\n587\n00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,780\n>> All right, welcome back.\n\n588\n00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,200\nSo, where we left off, we had that\nbackup running, and it finished.\n\n589\n00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,022\nAnd it finished almost\nexactly at 20 minutes.\n\n590\n00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:33,570\n[LAUGH] I'm just kidding.\n\n591\n00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,430\n>> Oh dear!\n\n592\n00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,740\n>> No, I'm just kidding, it, it finished\npretty, pretty close to five minutes.\n\n593\n00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, and here it goes.\n\n594\n00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,770\nIt finished.\n\n595\n00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,680\nAnd the first thing it, it props up is,\n\n596\n00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,575\ndo you want to create\nthat system repair disk?\n\n597\n00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:47,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n598\n00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,930\n>> And, so I, you know, I, I would.\n\n599\n00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,520\nLet's, you know, let's just say yes.\n\n600\n00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,910\nMaybe, that'll get her to, oh no.\n\n601\n00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,470\nStill won't.\n\n602\n00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,630\nBut sure enough,\nwe'd have to have that DVD burner.\n\n603\n00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,240\nAnd so on that pop-up.\n\n604\n00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,900\nActually, I guess I did\nclick it kind of fast.\n\n605\n00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:06,130\nBut it said that we can use that\nsystem repair disk to restore\n\n606\n00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,470\nWindows from this image in the event\nthat we can't boot up Windows at all.\n\n607\n00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,790\n>> And that's why I really want you\nto create that system repair disk\n\n608\n00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,910\nas well, right?\n\n609\n00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,430\nIf you come to that point where\nyou boot your machine up and\n\n610\n00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,060\nthe machine won't start.\n\n611\n00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,450\nIf you do have a DVD drive,\n\n612\n00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,640\nyou can put that system repair\ndisk right in the machine.\n\n613\n00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,270\nReboot.\n\n614\n00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,090\nAnd that will give you,\none of the options, of course,\n\n615\n00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,940\nthat it will give you is the ability\nto restore from a system image.\n\n616\n00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,915\nSo as long as you have access to system\nimage and you have that system repair\n\n617\n00:29:34,915 --> 00:29:39,260\ndisk, you should be able to put it back\non that computer and not worry about it.\n\n618\n00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,140\nYep.\n\n619\n00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,690\n>> All right, so that's that.\n\n620\n00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:47,220\n>> So we'll go in and click on close.\n\n621\n00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,200\nWhat should we move on to next?\n\n622\n00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,300\n>> We were talking, just briefly, at\nthe idea of using System Restore as well.\n\n623\n00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:02,578\nNow, System Restore is a very good\ntool for us, because it allows us,\n\n624\n00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:07,250\nagain, to go back into our\ncomputers back in time.\n\n625\n00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,120\nThe very fact is sometimes you and\nI install things on the computer.\n\n626\n00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,960\nAnd all of a sudden, the computer\ndoesn't work as well as it should or\n\n627\n00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,910\ndoesn't work the way that it should.\n\n628\n00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,680\nSystem restore gives us the ability to\ntake a snapshot of the way essentially\n\n629\n00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,060\nthat the Windows files actually are at\nthat particular point when it did work.\n\n630\n00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,940\nSo if we do something like this it's\ngoing to allow us to be able to\n\n631\n00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,380\nrestore the computer back to that point.\n\n632\n00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,490\nNow, remember that,\n\n633\n00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,430\nsystem restore it's not going to touch any\nof the files that you and I have created.\n\n634\n00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,250\nIt really is only looking\nat the windows files.\n\n635\n00:30:38,372 --> 00:30:42,000\n>> All right, so well,\nshould we create some system restores?\n\n636\n00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,790\n>> Let's go ahead and do it.\n\n637\n00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,430\n>> And\ntake a look at some of those options.\n\n638\n00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,250\n>> Yeah let's show them where\nit actually is that we can\n\n639\n00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,469\nfind this stuff and let's do it.\n\n640\n00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,980\n>> All right.\nSo to get to good old system restore.\n\n641\n00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,660\nSo what we'll do is we'll\ncome back to this backup.\n\n642\n00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,830\nI think we'll play with it for\na little bit.\n\n643\n00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,870\nAll right.\nSo we'll go into Control Panel, and\n\n644\n00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,960\nSystem and Security, and\nwe'll click on System.\n\n645\n00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,170\nJust pull that down.\n\n646\n00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,150\nThere we go, and\nwe'll click on system protection.\n\n647\n00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,562\nAnd in system protection,\nwe've got system restore.\n\n648\n00:31:17,562 --> 00:31:22,290\nAll right, so on this window that we\ncan see right here, is that we have\n\n649\n00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:27,170\nSystem restore is currently turned on for\nour C drive, our system.\n\n650\n00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,780\nIt is not turned on for a D drive.\n\n651\n00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:35,000\nSo, anything that we do on D,\nnone of it will be logged or kept.\n\n652\n00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,630\nSo, also, playing in with system restore,\nis we get good old shadow copies.\n\n653\n00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,240\n>> Right.\n\n654\n00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,041\n>> So, Ronnie what's the story\nbehind the shadow copies?\n\n655\n00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:48,584\n>> Well, for us here, when we take a look\nat the idea of shadow copies, right?\n\n656\n00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:54,110\nIt's again gonna keep the files for\nus in previous versions of state.\n\n657\n00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,375\nPrevious versions is what we'll have.\n\n658\n00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,820\nSo that way if we do write information\nto the hard drive, okay, and\n\n659\n00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,757\nwe end up losing some of that information,\na lot of times we can actually just\n\n660\n00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:06,120\nbring it back up and\nbe able to get access to them again.\n\n661\n00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,830\nSo system restore points use what we\ncall volume shadow copy to do that.\n\n662\n00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,770\nSo, it's again, it's the technology in\nthe background that allows us to be able\n\n663\n00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,360\nto keep both versions of\nparticular files that we have so\n\n664\n00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,620\nthat we can actually replace\nthem when we need to.\n\n665\n00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,120\nYeah.\n\n666\n00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,522\n>> All right.\n\n667\n00:32:22,522 --> 00:32:27,040\nAll right let's go ahead and\ncreate some system restore stuff.\n\n668\n00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,780\nAll right.\n\n669\n00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,790\nSo, then back over here,\nall right, we can click on create.\n\n670\n00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,800\nNow so Ronnie so, so\n\n671\n00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,578\nyou know Windows it will create it's own,\nit's own restore points.\n\n672\n00:32:37,578 --> 00:32:40,880\n>> Right.\n>> So things after like updates.\n\n673\n00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,900\nAdd a lot of updates, things of that sort.\n\n674\n00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,240\nMajor changes to the system Windows\nwill automatically generate these\n\n675\n00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,540\nrestore points.\n\n676\n00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,210\nYou know as a safety precaution.\n\n677\n00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,330\nSo it can always roll back.\n\n678\n00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,960\nSo we can create these\nrestore points manually\n\n679\n00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,830\nwith this little button right here.\n\n680\n00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,660\nGo click on create and let's give a name.\n\n681\n00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:07,970\nWe'll just call this one during,\n[TYPING] during the show.\n\n682\n00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,590\nClick on, create.\n\n683\n00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,110\nIt will take a minute and\ncreate this system restore point.\n\n684\n00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,910\nAll right.\n\n685\n00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:18,890\nSo, with those shadow copies,\nprevious versions, those sorts of things.\n\n686\n00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:23,160\nSo, I do have a file and\nwe can take a look at some of the stuff,\n\n687\n00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,290\nonce this guy sits here and\ndoes it's restore thing.\n\n688\n00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,470\nWhile it grinds it away, but while it\ndoes it we'll drag it out of the way.\n\n689\n00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:36,750\nLet's take a look at, doesn't that always\nhappen, as soon as you navigate away.\n\n690\n00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,200\nAll right, there we go,\ncreated successfully, cool.\n\n691\n00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,610\nAll right.\n\n692\n00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:45,610\nSo with those previous versions.\n\n693\n00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,150\nAll right.\n\n694\n00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,010\nLet's go into here.\n\n695\n00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,160\nWe'll go into our C drive.\n\n696\n00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,040\nWe have this folder here.\n\n697\n00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,530\nThese GameCodes.\n\n698\n00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,380\n>> Okay.\n\n699\n00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,160\n>> All right, so\nin our GameCodes we have this file here.\n\n700\n00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,450\nPath to the Castle.\n\n701\n00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,260\n>> Path to the Castle.\n\n702\n00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,120\n>> It's pretty important.\n\n703\n00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,570\nAlmost everything happens in a castle.\n\n704\n00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,700\n>> Okay, sounds good.\n\n705\n00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,470\n>> So we'll open it up.\n\n706\n00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,490\nAll right, so there are our instructions.\n\n707\n00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,360\nGo left through the woods,\ngo right over the river.\n\n708\n00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,500\nAvoid the goblins, and\nsearch for the secret gate.\n\n709\n00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,630\n>> Secret gate.\n\n710\n00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,500\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay.\n\n711\n00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,890\n>> Does that sound familiar?\n\n712\n00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,920\n>> It doesn't sound familiar to me at all.\n\n713\n00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,810\nYeah, sorry.\n\n714\n00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,480\n>> That's fine.\n\n715\n00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,830\nI just made it up.\n\n716\n00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,820\n>> Okay.\n\n717\n00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,160\n>> All right.\n\n718\n00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,646\nSo here's our file.\n\n719\n00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,289\n>> Is it half-pipe?\n\n720\n00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:28,190\n>> No.\n\n721\n00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,000\nNo, that'd be a lot cooler if it was.\n\n722\n00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,650\n>> Call of Duty.\n\n723\n00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,440\n>> Well, no.\n\n724\n00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,710\nYeah, Call of Duty.\n\n725\n00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,065\nWe'll say,\n\n726\n00:34:36,815 --> 00:34:42,370\nactually, actually, there is no gate.\n\n727\n00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:47,820\nThe gate is, it's all in your head.\n\n728\n00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,322\n>> OK.\n\n729\n00:34:48,322 --> 00:34:51,440\n>> All right and then we'll click on Save.\n\n730\n00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,360\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n731\n00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:57,920\nNow, let's say that we've made\nsome other changes, instead\n\n732\n00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,710\nof left it was go center through\nthe woods doesn't really make any sense.\n\n733\n00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,110\n>> Straight through the woods?\n\n734\n00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:10,920\n>> Instead of go right we're gonna say go\n>> Southwest.\n\n735\n00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,440\nI was like, wait this is video game.\n\n736\n00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,310\nHow do I know what my coordinates are?\n\n737\n00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,865\nThen we're going to save it.\n\n738\n00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:20,210\nSounds good.\n\n739\n00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,940\n>> Close it back out and so\nit's now time that we're to go and\n\n740\n00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,820\nfind and see our castle.\n\n741\n00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,860\nSouthwest, what does that even mean?\n\n742\n00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,270\nSo somebody has gone on\nto our machine here and\n\n743\n00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,710\nit's changed our path to the castle.\n\n744\n00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,056\n>> How devious of them.\n\n745\n00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:38,930\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n746\n00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,680\nHow devious, indeed, Ronnie.\n\n747\n00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,710\n>> That's right.\n\n748\n00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:46,415\n>> Well, fortunately with us,\nour previous versions.\n\n749\n00:35:46,415 --> 00:35:53,245\nSo we can sort of roll back this file\nto a previous version of this file.\n\n750\n00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:57,335\nThese previous versions,\nthey're created two ways.\n\n751\n00:35:57,335 --> 00:36:01,415\nThey are created by doing\na system back up and\n\n752\n00:36:01,415 --> 00:36:05,810\na system back up will create\nthese snap shots more or less.\n\n753\n00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:10,900\nAnd a doing a system restore will\nalso create these little snapshots.\n\n754\n00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,150\nAll right, so\n\n755\n00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,080\nthen to get those previous versions,\nall right we right-click on our file, and\n\n756\n00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:22,200\nwe can choose Properties, and then you get\nthis tab right here, previous versions.\n\n757\n00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,340\nSo click on the previous versions,\nthere we go we've got two of them.\n\n758\n00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,100\nWe'll just drag this\nover Path to the Castle.\n\n759\n00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,740\nAll right, date modified.\n\n760\n00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,160\nToday, right after each other.\n\n761\n00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,440\nCool.\n\n762\n00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,980\nAll right, so let's pick one.\n\n763\n00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,860\nHow about that one right there?\n\n764\n00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,630\n>> Sure.\nPick that one right there.\n\n765\n00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,660\n>> All right.\nShould we open it?\n\n766\n00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,340\n>> Open it.\n>> Should we make another copy of it?\n\n767\n00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,140\n>> Open it.\n>> Or just try to restore it?\n\n768\n00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,010\n>> Open it.\n[LAUGH]\n\n769\n00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,250\n>> All right.\n\n770\n00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,020\nThere we go, open up.\n\n771\n00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,030\n>> Nice.\n>> Left of the woods,\n\n772\n00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,660\nright over the river.\n\n773\n00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,440\nAvoid the gate.\n\n774\n00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,500\nWell, but we already know that\nthe gate doesn't really exist.\n\n775\n00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,000\nLet's open up this one.\n\n776\n00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,300\nAll right, go left.\n\n777\n00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,390\nSo this guy wouldn't have gotten\nvery far at all, all right.\n\n778\n00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,780\nSo we can take a gander at those guys we\ncan, all right we can just copy it or\n\n779\n00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,220\nwe can just straight up restore it.\n\n780\n00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:10,110\nWhich one was this one,\nfind the gate, all right and\n\n781\n00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,310\nwhat do we have currently,\noh yeah there is no gate.\n\n782\n00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:20,530\nSo lets go back, oops\n>> We won't need that one quite yet.\n\n783\n00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,530\nThere we go.\n\n784\n00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,130\nLet's go ahead and restore that one.\n\n785\n00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:31,180\nAll right, it's actually restored\nfrom our previous versions.\n\n786\n00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,540\nLet's come back over here.\n\n787\n00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,110\nOh, and sure enough.\n\n788\n00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:40,430\nAll right, so now, we're able to\nrestore back to our previous versions.\n\n789\n00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,840\n>> Yeah,\nthe key to remembering this, right,\n\n790\n00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,340\nis when Nate said, here, the very fact is,\nif we go and back the files up or\n\n791\n00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,580\nwe use that system\nrestore point to do this.\n\n792\n00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,240\nOkay.\n\n793\n00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:53,160\nSo that gives us this ability in terms of\nindividual files to be able to do this.\n\n794\n00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,000\nRemember that a system restore\npoint though is really useful\n\n795\n00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,440\nif you do have issues with the Windows\noperating system itself because that's\n\n796\n00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,900\nnormally where changes are.\n\n797\n00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,550\nSometimes you may get, for example, a\nvirus on the actual computer, that you go,\n\n798\n00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,170\nhey, this is really effecting us.\n\n799\n00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:11,390\nWell if you've been creating system\nrestore points along the path.\n\n800\n00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:15,550\nWhat you can do a lot of times is\ngo back to a previous point in time\n\n801\n00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,390\nbefore you actually realize\nthat activity was going on.\n\n802\n00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,920\nAnd now that again will affect\nthe Windows operating system, but\n\n803\n00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,210\nit's not gonna affect any of your\nparticular files on your computer\n\n804\n00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,960\nthat you've generated,\nwhich is pretty much key for us as well.\n\n805\n00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,350\nSo it gives us, again,\nanother type of recovery.\n\n806\n00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,810\nNow, Nate, let's go into that system\nrestore, into that configure tab and\n\n807\n00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,380\nlet's see how we can actually\nconfigure this as well.\n\n808\n00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,760\nSo, we did see one turned on,\n\n809\n00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,950\nbut we didn't actually see how to turn\nit on or the space that it can use.\n\n810\n00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,010\nAll right, let me cancel that stuff.\n\n811\n00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,240\n>> Yep, and there you go.\n\n812\n00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,260\nYep.\n>> All right, so it,\n\n813\n00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,800\nsorry, I'm daydreaming.\n\n814\n00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,100\nWhat?\n>> Yeah, in the Configure tab,\n\n815\n00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,900\nclick on it.\n\n816\n00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,820\n>> Oh in the Configure tab?\n\n817\n00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,298\n>> Or, okay, Configure button.\n\n818\n00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:57,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> My apologies, wrong syntax.\n\n819\n00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,548\n>> All right, so here.\n\n820\n00:38:58,548 --> 00:39:03,040\nAll right, [LAUGH] that was kind of funny.\n\n821\n00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,470\nAll right.\nSo here we go in our configure tab.\n\n822\n00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:10,410\nSo we can change some of the space\nrequirements that system restore uses.\n\n823\n00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,770\nAll right.\n\n824\n00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:19,110\nWe can just straight up turn it off, which\nfor this one I guess I had D highlighted.\n\n825\n00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,320\nSo, right now, so\n\n826\n00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,055\nanything now that is on that D drive,\nit's not gonna be wrapped up in here.\n\n827\n00:39:25,055 --> 00:39:25,750\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n828\n00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,720\n>> So, does that mean that if\nwe browse over to our D drive,\n\n829\n00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,410\nwe'll just pick something.\n\n830\n00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,520\nHow about, I don't know, one of those.\n\n831\n00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,585\nNot a bad choice.\n\n832\n00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:39,660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Something else that I can\n\n833\n00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,220\nclick on is games or recovery keys.\n\n834\n00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,450\nSo our recovery keys, so\nlet's make a guess Ronnie,\n\n835\n00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:50,140\nare they going to have anything\nin their previous versions?\n\n836\n00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,080\n>> They shouldn't.\n\n837\n00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,250\nUnless you turn off system restore.\n\n838\n00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,988\n>> System restore not\nturned on our D drive, so\n\n839\n00:39:56,988 --> 00:40:01,724\nif this BitLocker recovery key was ever\nchanged or modified in Modify them,\n\n840\n00:40:01,724 --> 00:40:04,542\nmodified, yeah we will\nbe able to roll back.\n\n841\n00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:05,370\n>> There you go.\n\n842\n00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,850\n>> There we go.\n\n843\n00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,480\nSo we can close this out.\n\n844\n00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,160\nSo we won't really turn it on.\n\n845\n00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,770\nGo ahead and cancel.\n\n846\n00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,940\nLet's go back to our C drive,\nand the configure button.\n\n847\n00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:17,501\n>> All right so,\n\n848\n00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:20,370\nmake sure you notice those three options\nup at the top as really the key, right?\n\n849\n00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,980\nWhether you're gonna turn this on for\neverything, or\n\n850\n00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,880\njust because you want to use\nthe previous versions of files here.\n\n851\n00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,790\nNow, Nate, if I choose that second one, do\nI still have system restore to go back to,\n\n852\n00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,610\nto make sure I create\nthose previous versions?\n\n853\n00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,180\n>> I don't know.\n\n854\n00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,850\n>> Okay.\n\n855\n00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:35,810\n>> Maybe.\n\n856\n00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:36,580\n>> Possible.\n\n857\n00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,690\n>> All right.\n\n858\n00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:43,140\nSo what we can do is,\nall these system restore points, right?\n\n859\n00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,780\nSo not only can we slide\nthis little slider around.\n\n860\n00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,510\nWe can delete all of our\nsystem restore points.\n\n861\n00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,910\nSo I'll share a little story with you.\n\n862\n00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,520\n>> Okay.\n>> All right, so back in the day.\n\n863\n00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,730\nBack in the day when,\nwhenever I would get an infected computer,\n\n864\n00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:07,930\nI would try everything in my arsenal\nto try to clean out my computer,\n\n865\n00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:12,800\nto get rid of all the traces of virus or\nmalware, whatever else is on my system.\n\n866\n00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,240\nAnd I stumbled across\nthis one stubborn one.\n\n867\n00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,070\nWell, there were many stubborn ones.\n\n868\n00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:21,290\nBut one of the earlier stubborn ones and\nI could not get rid of all the traces.\n\n869\n00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:26,480\nAnd it turns out that there's\na little companion part of it.\n\n870\n00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,820\nRight?\nCause you delete one and\n\n871\n00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,130\nthe other one copies the other guy back.\n\n872\n00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,690\nIt was sitting in a system restore point.\n\n873\n00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,610\nAnd, you know,\nit took me a while to figure it out.\n\n874\n00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,420\nAnd so then I was like,\n\n875\n00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,850\nwell wait a minute, how do I delete\nthese system restore points?\n\n876\n00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,620\nSo sure enough it's right there.\n\n877\n00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,290\nThere is that delete button.\n\n878\n00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:46,650\nI deleted all of my system restore points.\n\n879\n00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,260\nAnd you know what?\n\n880\n00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:48,850\n>> It worked.\n\n881\n00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,050\n>> Well, that one part did.\n\n882\n00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:50,820\n>> Oh.\n[LAUGH]\n\n883\n00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,380\n>> I still didn't get rid of it.\n\n884\n00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,130\nI ended up just wiping everything out.\n\n885\n00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,780\nSpent a lot of, I tell you.\n\n886\n00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,770\nMalware removal is an art.\n\n887\n00:41:58,770 --> 00:41:59,930\n>> It is.\n\n888\n00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,610\n>> They are so sneaky these days.\n\n889\n00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:06,170\nAnd even besides, so\nyou don't get any traces of them.\n\n890\n00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,310\nHeaven sakes.\n\n891\n00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,780\nHow can you really be sure?\n\n892\n00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:13,340\nHow can you really be sure,\nRonnie, that your system is clean?\n\n893\n00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,506\n>> Yeah.\nGood luck.\n\n894\n00:42:14,506 --> 00:42:15,346\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n895\n00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:16,370\n>> Good luck.\n\n896\n00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,560\nThe only way again,\nis keeping up the data and\n\n897\n00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,640\nmake sure you do have your regular\nantivirus running and going.\n\n898\n00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,470\nAnd again, monitoring your systems to see.\n\n899\n00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,570\n>> Yes.\n\n900\n00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,050\nA little off topic there.\n\n901\n00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,420\nSo sure enough right there\nin our little control panel,\n\n902\n00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,440\nwe can delete these system restore points\nif you need to for whatever reason.\n\n903\n00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,240\nWe can adjust our slider to how much space\nour system restore points can take up.\n\n904\n00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:46,010\nHere it will tell you, just a measly 5%,\nbut our hard drive is not terribly big so\n\n905\n00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:49,140\nthat will work for us.\n\n906\n00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,235\n>> So let's say this.\n\n907\n00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,600\nLet's say that what we actually have here.\n\n908\n00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,390\nNow, we are actually at a point\nin which our particular computer\n\n909\n00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,180\nhas come to this point where\nI've installed a program.\n\n910\n00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,740\nAnd it no longer works\nthe way that it needs to.\n\n911\n00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,960\nAnd it's starting to affect other things.\n\n912\n00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,090\nHow do I now take that system restore\npoint and put it to use on it, right?\n\n913\n00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,810\n>> We can use this restore point.\n\n914\n00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:11,900\n>> Let's do it.\n\n915\n00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,710\n>> All right.\n\n916\n00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:17,242\nSo what we can do, right, is on this\nbutton right here, system restore.\n\n917\n00:43:17,242 --> 00:43:21,250\nWhen you click on this and it brings\nup this nice, little Wizard here.\n\n918\n00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,680\nSome of the restore files and settings.\n\n919\n00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,140\nYou know, Don, always read these.\n\n920\n00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,760\nI usually just, you wanna read it?\n\n921\n00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,410\n>> Go ahead.\n\n922\n00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:26,945\n>> All right.\n\n923\n00:43:26,945 --> 00:43:28,720\nSystem restore can fix things.\n\n924\n00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,382\nClick on next.\n\n925\n00:43:29,382 --> 00:43:31,160\nAll right so, here we go.\n\n926\n00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,850\nSo these are all the system restore\npoints currently on the show.\n\n927\n00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:38,320\nSo we've got some of these\nautomatic restore points.\n\n928\n00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,880\nWe got some from Windows update.\n\n929\n00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,960\nBefore this segment,\nafter game docs creation show, right.\n\n930\n00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,882\nSo we got our manual ones\nthat we created manually.\n\n931\n00:43:47,882 --> 00:43:52,120\nAll right, now sometimes,\nthere are more restore points out there.\n\n932\n00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:58,400\nWe can click on this one and it adds a few\nmore ones in there, and which ones did it?\n\n933\n00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,012\n>> It should say system generated\n>> There we go.\n\n934\n00:44:01,012 --> 00:44:05,970\nSo that backup one, so if we unclick,\nall right, backup one's gone.All right.\n\n935\n00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:07,240\nSo that backup, right?\n\n936\n00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,030\nRan that credit system restore point.\n\n937\n00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:13,120\nSo then, what we can do is,\nwe can click on one of them.\n\n938\n00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,790\nHow about after that game docs creation.\n\n939\n00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:20,920\nWe can scan for any affected programs,\nif bringing this restore point back,\n\n940\n00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,000\nif it does conflict with something else.\n\n941\n00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,360\nWe can take a look at that.\n\n942\n00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:26,570\nI click on Next.\n\n943\n00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,500\nAll right,\nwe have a little summary screen, right.\n\n944\n00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,770\nEverything looks good.\n\n945\n00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,740\nAnd we click on Finish.\n\n946\n00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,690\nNow is it going to hose anything up,\nRonnie?\n\n947\n00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:35,260\n>> It should not.\n\n948\n00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,050\n>> All right.\n\n949\n00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,600\n>> Oops.\n>> Okay.\n\n950\n00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,560\nOnce it's started it\ncannot be interrupted.\n\n951\n00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,740\nDo you want to continue?\n\n952\n00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,090\n>> I guess you do.\n\n953\n00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,248\nAll right well, you know what?\n\n954\n00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:47,870\n[LAUGH] Send it as sharing\nour screen sharing software.\n\n955\n00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,060\n>> All right, we want.\n\n956\n00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:49,760\n>> Say no.\n\n957\n00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,280\n>> Okay,\n>> And yeah, but there you go.\n\n958\n00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:52,860\nIt'll run.\n\n959\n00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,690\nThere will be a reboot in the process.\n\n960\n00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,020\nOnce the machine reboots,\nit'll pop up and say, hey,\n\n961\n00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,640\nsystem restore completed successfully.\n\n962\n00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,560\nYour files and folders or whatever it was\naffected by it, yeah, are all intact.\n\n963\n00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:11,500\n>> Yeah, now,\neven if you can't get access to\n\n964\n00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,285\nthe Windows system as you\nnormally get access to it, right?\n\n965\n00:45:15,285 --> 00:45:16,925\nIf you can boot into safe mode,\n\n966\n00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:20,495\nyou have the ability to also\nrun system restore from there.\n\n967\n00:45:20,495 --> 00:45:23,285\nNot only have the ability to\nrun system restore from there.\n\n968\n00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:28,205\nIf you have created that system repair\ndisk or you have a copy of the Windows\n\n969\n00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:32,995\ninstallation disk with you,\nyou can repair this particular computer.\n\n970\n00:45:32,995 --> 00:45:36,275\nAnd when you do so, you'll see that\none of the options you have there\n\n971\n00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,980\nis ability again to actually\nrun a system restore as well.\n\n972\n00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,060\nSo, it gives you several options.\n\n973\n00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,070\nIt doesn't leave you locked out,\nif you can't get back into Windows.\n\n974\n00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,300\nYou have either Safe Mode or\n\n975\n00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,346\nthe system repair disk that will\nactually help you to get back in.\n\n976\n00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:53,160\nBe able to try to fix the problem\nusing a restore point.\n\n977\n00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,610\n>> If you have them.\n\n978\n00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,890\n>> Alright, so, we do have this other way.\n\n979\n00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:02,490\n>> Okay\n>> That we can use to restore our system,\n\n980\n00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:05,650\nwell it may not restore, but\nat least start this guy up.\n\n981\n00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,200\nLast known good configuration Alright.\n\n982\n00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,160\n>> Every time that Windows\nsuccessfully starts.\n\n983\n00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,190\nAnd then, when it shuts down,\nit will save these settings.\n\n984\n00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,490\nThe like registry settings,\nsystem settings, to a little file.\n\n985\n00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:21,040\nIt's burried in the registry.\n\n986\n00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,910\nAnd I was talking to Wes about it one day.\n\n987\n00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:26,670\nI don't remember why we\nwere talking about it.\n\n988\n00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:31,220\nBut he knew the key path\nof where it was stored in.\n\n989\n00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,080\nI was like how, you know what?\n\n990\n00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,720\nJust nevermind.\n\n991\n00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,120\nI don't even want to know\nwhy you memorized it.\n\n992\n00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,030\n>> The registry?\n\n993\n00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:36,640\n>> Yep.\n\n994\n00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,500\nBut yeah,\nit saves it a little bit in there.\n\n995\n00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:44,040\nNow, if for some reason that Windows\ncannot successfully start up.\n\n996\n00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,360\nWe can use an option\ncalled last known good\n\n997\n00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:52,000\nto use those settings that\nwere in there to boot up from.\n\n998\n00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,212\nNow, to get to that,\nlet's just cancel out of that.\n\n999\n00:46:56,212 --> 00:47:00,200\nAll right, so\nit doesn't involve restarting.\n\n1000\n00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,182\nI'm going to jump over here and\nuse this virtual machine.\n\n1001\n00:47:03,182 --> 00:47:06,820\nAll right, so\nwe got this workshop machine right here.\n\n1002\n00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,200\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\nrestart it.\n\n1003\n00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,720\nNow, as it's restarting,\n\n1004\n00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,480\nI'll be pressing the f8 key to get\ninto our advanced boot options.\n\n1005\n00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,050\nSo click on restart.\n\n1006\n00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:21,840\nAnd as soon as it restarts,\nI'll start pressing that f8 key.\n\n1007\n00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:25,990\nSoon as it restarts.\n\n1008\n00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,560\nF8 key.\n\n1009\n00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:33,230\nAll right, sure enough.\n\n1010\n00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:34,510\nHere we go.\nLet me push that down arrow.\n\n1011\n00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:38,140\nAll right so,\nhere on our advanced boot options.\n\n1012\n00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,130\nWe've got a number of items here.\n\n1013\n00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:43,780\nYou know,\nour different safe modes our boot logging.\n\n1014\n00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,140\nLow res video, if we have\na problem with our video driver.\n\n1015\n00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,125\nWe can jump into there.\n\n1016\n00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:53,332\nDirectory Services Mode to Debugging Mode\nand if we accidentally got this menu then,\n\n1017\n00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:57,040\nwe can just Start Windows Normally\ndown there at the bottom.\n\n1018\n00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,500\nThe one that we are after is that\nlast known good configuration.\n\n1019\n00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:04,600\nThat's it.\n\n1020\n00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,730\nWindows is now gonna boot up.\n\n1021\n00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,230\nIt's gonna go and look for\nthat registry key in there,\n\n1022\n00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,960\nit's gonna grab whatever\nregistry settings,\n\n1023\n00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,530\nsystem settings that worked last time,\nwhenever it successfully shut down.\n\n1024\n00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:22,170\nIt'll use those settings there, and\nboot off of those based off of that.\n\n1025\n00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,945\nNow let's say that your system, that it's,\n\n1026\n00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,816\nyou're kind of having a problem but\nnot really.\n\n1027\n00:48:28,816 --> 00:48:33,595\nIf you use this last known good\nconfiguration and if it can partially\n\n1028\n00:48:33,595 --> 00:48:38,432\nboot up some, but\nWindows doesn't fully load and\n\n1029\n00:48:38,432 --> 00:48:44,072\nthen it crashes, well then that last\nknown good configuration is now hosed up.\n\n1030\n00:48:44,072 --> 00:48:46,202\nSince it was,\nit would have partially boot up.\n\n1031\n00:48:46,202 --> 00:48:51,496\nIt's going to start creating a new\nlast known good configuration.\n\n1032\n00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:55,586\nOnce you get to that point it\nwon't really be an option.\n\n1033\n00:48:57,156 --> 00:49:00,786\nRemember, that really the idea\nof the successful boot up\n\n1034\n00:49:00,786 --> 00:49:04,838\nis when we finallyare able\nto log into the machine.\n\n1035\n00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:09,208\nWhen that happens, that writes all those\nsettings back into that configuration\n\n1036\n00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:12,208\ninto the registry file\nwhere it actually needs to.\n\n1037\n00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:14,998\nAnd that file is only good for\nthe time that you use it that one time.\n\n1038\n00:49:14,998 --> 00:49:17,450\nAnd that's pretty much the key for\nus here.\n\n1039\n00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:21,938\nSo, if you do happen to know that hey,\n\n1040\n00:49:21,938 --> 00:49:27,208\nthis is my last option, last known good,\nthat's what it's going to do.\n\n1041\n00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:29,670\nAgain if you boot up into it now and\n\n1042\n00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:33,060\nlet's say it takes twenty\nminutes to boot into it, right?\n\n1043\n00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:37,240\nWhat you're now saying is that it now\ntakes the time, and you can log in and you\n\n1044\n00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,820\ncan boot into it, you've now overwritten\nthat last known good configuration.\n\n1045\n00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,899\nSo now the next time your computer boots\nup, it is not going to be the one that was\n\n1046\n00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,073\nactually good It's gonna be the one that\ntook 20 minutes for you to boot up, and\n\n1047\n00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:51,095\nit's gonna say, yeah,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n1048\n00:49:53,394 --> 00:49:56,310\n>> All right, we've got a few\nminutes left, but let's do this.\n\n1049\n00:49:56,310 --> 00:50:00,820\nWe still have a few more,\njust a couple more little items to get to.\n\n1050\n00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,750\nBut, let's go ahead and\ntake our break here.\n\n1051\n00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,460\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1052\n00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,943\n>> And, when we get back,\nwe've got a few more items,\n\n1053\n00:50:05,943 --> 00:50:08,947\na little bit more to restoring files and\nthose sorts of things.\n\n1054\n00:50:08,947 --> 00:50:12,027\nSo we'll get into that\nstuff after the break.\n\n1055\n00:50:12,027 --> 00:50:19,201\n[MUSIC]\n\n1056\n00:50:19,201 --> 00:50:20,944\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n1057\n00:50:20,944 --> 00:50:24,951\nAll right, so where we left off, we were\ntalking about backup and restore and\n\n1058\n00:50:24,951 --> 00:50:27,310\nthose sorts of things in between.\n\n1059\n00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:31,840\nNow let's take a look at\nour game codes folder.\n\n1060\n00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,000\nThe one that we were messing with earlier.\n\n1061\n00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,990\nSo on that game codes folder,\nlet's browse in there,\n\n1062\n00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:43,370\nand our C drive and game codes, all right,\nso we've got our Path to the Castle.\n\n1063\n00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:47,910\nLet's say that Ronnie, you don't want\nanybody playing any games, and so\n\n1064\n00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:50,010\nyou just delete it.\n\n1065\n00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,870\nThere it is.\n\n1066\n00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,632\nAll right, so now, oh, oh no!\n\n1067\n00:50:53,632 --> 00:50:54,754\nActually you were,\n\n1068\n00:50:54,754 --> 00:50:58,190\n[LAUGH] I'm trying to think of\na scenario off the top of my head.\n\n1069\n00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:01,690\nSo you're like oh, my bad,\nI didn't mean to delete it.\n\n1070\n00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:06,520\nWell, what we can do is, back in\ngood old backup and restore utility.\n\n1071\n00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,080\nLet's go ahead and\nrecover that folder from a backup.\n\n1072\n00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:14,520\nI'm sure it's sitting in the recycle bin,\nso let's just empty it.\n\n1073\n00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,092\n9 I don't know what's in there but,\nthere it is.\n\n1074\n00:51:17,092 --> 00:51:19,240\n>> [LAUGH] Not in there any more.\n\n1075\n00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,160\n>> Yeah, not in there any more.\n\n1076\n00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,329\nWell, actually, no, we didn't include\nour recycle bin in our backup.\n\n1077\n00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:26,110\n>> Did we?\n>> No,\n\n1078\n00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:29,550\nbecause we chose what files we did anyhow.\n\n1079\n00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:33,090\n>> There you go.\n>> All right, so to get back to it, so\n\n1080\n00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,920\nwe'll go down and\nclick on Restore my files.\n\n1081\n00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:41,720\nAnd in here, oh no, nothing's in there,\nwell we've gotta browse, so let's browse.\n\n1082\n00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,140\nNow you can pick individual files or\nfolders.\n\n1083\n00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:50,830\nNow, if I wanted to restore just\nthat Path to the Castle document,\n\n1084\n00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:53,840\nwe'd choose files, but\nI wanted to restore the whole folder,\n\n1085\n00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,409\nthe whole game codes folder,\nso we'll click on folders.\n\n1086\n00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:01,680\nSo it automatically goes back\nto our little back up stuff.\n\n1087\n00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:07,790\nSo we got backup of C, we can click on it,\nand there are the items that we backed up.\n\n1088\n00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,827\nSo there is the game codes folder, so\n\n1089\n00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:14,970\nwe'll add our folder to the backup,\nor the recover queue.\n\n1090\n00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,150\nSure enough,\nwe can browse over our stuff in there.\n\n1091\n00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,130\nClick on next.\n\n1092\n00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:22,590\nNow, where do we want to restore it to?\n\n1093\n00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:25,540\nWell, we could put it back\nwhere it was before, or\n\n1094\n00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,570\nwe could pick some other location.\n\n1095\n00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:31,570\nPerhaps, if we're wanting\nto restore this version,\n\n1096\n00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:35,050\nwe don't want to put it in\nthe original location for conflicts.\n\n1097\n00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:39,830\nMaybe it was never deleted,\nmaybe we just want to test our backups.\n\n1098\n00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:44,210\nSo we could put it in another location so\nwe don't mess with our existing files.\n\n1099\n00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:47,070\nBut, because Ronnie deleted that guy,\n\n1100\n00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:52,320\nwe'll put it in its original location and\nwe'll click on Restore.\n\n1101\n00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,412\nThere we go.\n\n1102\n00:52:53,412 --> 00:52:56,580\nAll right, files have been restored,\nso we'll click on finish and\n\n1103\n00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,190\nthen let's go browse back in there.\n\n1104\n00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,700\nAll right, so\nwe'll go back into our C drive, and\n\n1105\n00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:06,070\ngame codes there at the bottom, and\nthere's our Path to the Castle.\n\n1106\n00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:10,010\nCool, there we go, we restored that.\n\n1107\n00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:13,428\nNow, as far as restoring things and\nwhatnot,\n\n1108\n00:53:13,428 --> 00:53:18,010\nwe also have other things that\nwe can restore or roll back.\n\n1109\n00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:22,330\nOne of them called out in\nthe objectives are drivers.\n\n1110\n00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,590\nWe can roll back our drivers.\n\n1111\n00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:27,360\nLet's say we have some particular driver,\nand you know\n\n1112\n00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:32,820\nstaying on top of our updates, staying\non top of our latest updated drivers,\n\n1113\n00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:37,100\nsometimes they don't work\nthe way that we thought they do.\n\n1114\n00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:41,100\nGenerally, you always think,\nif it's an updated driver,\n\n1115\n00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,330\neverything should be fixed from\nthe previous version of the driver.\n\n1116\n00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:47,150\nSo they're just adding\nsome new functionality or\n\n1117\n00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:51,980\nmake it compatible with newer editions of\nWindows but that's not always the case.\n\n1118\n00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:58,380\nSometimes strange things happen,\nand drivers can break hardware,\n\n1119\n00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,640\nor break other features or things and\nyeah and we can roll those drivers back.\n\n1120\n00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:09,320\nSo to roll our drivers back,\nwhat we can do then,\n\n1121\n00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:14,410\nas we'll go back in here, we'll get into\ncomputer manager, our Device Manager.\n\n1122\n00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:20,480\nClick on Computer, we'll get into Manage,\nand into Device Manager.\n\n1123\n00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,630\nAll right, let's [LAUGH] I\nguess I didn't see that one.\n\n1124\n00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,390\nAll right, so\nwhat about our display adapters?\n\n1125\n00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,430\nSo we'll include, no,\nI won't roll this one back.\n\n1126\n00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:36,850\nWe'll click on this and\nwe can go into our properties\n\n1127\n00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:44,960\nand on our driver tab Oh look,\nI guess we can roll back if we wanted to.\n\n1128\n00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,080\nAnyway, I don't remember ever updating\nthis driver, so I was like wait a minute.\n\n1129\n00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,920\nIf you're never updated a driver,\nif it's the original one,\n\n1130\n00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,940\nthis option here to roll back the driver,\nit will be grayed out.\n\n1131\n00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,078\nLet's find one, probably keyboards.\n\n1132\n00:55:02,643 --> 00:55:04,200\nAll right, there we go.\n\n1133\n00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:10,360\nSo this is grayed out, so there's no other\ndriver that we can roll back to, right?\n\n1134\n00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,640\nSo that one we can't.\n\n1135\n00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,586\nLet's go back to our display devices.\n\n1136\n00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:19,421\nAll right, now let's say that\nI updated this graphics and\n\n1137\n00:55:19,421 --> 00:55:21,730\nI don't have all my resolutions.\n\n1138\n00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:27,440\nOr it's stuck in, you know, 640 by 480 or\nthe colors are all messed up.\n\n1139\n00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,620\nThere is something wrong with the driver.\n\n1140\n00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,900\nNow, if you're able to get into Windows,\n\n1141\n00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,210\nthen this right here would work fine,\nright?\n\n1142\n00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:37,500\nWe're gonna roll this driver back,\nwe click on it, it rolls it back.\n\n1143\n00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:43,770\nGenerally, it would also need a system\nreboot for changes to take effect.\n\n1144\n00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:49,283\nNow, Ronnie, let's say that we've\nhosed some kind of driver and we can't\n\n1145\n00:55:49,283 --> 00:55:54,640\nget into Windows to roll this driver\nback but what other option do we have?\n\n1146\n00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,400\n>> You gotta have a system repair disk.\n\n1147\n00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:02,120\n[LAUGH] Once you have that system repair\ndisk like you again can try and let\n\n1148\n00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,850\nthe repair happen, in other words, it can\ntry and do it all for you automatically.\n\n1149\n00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:08,820\nOr you can go and\nrestore that picker file from that.\n\n1150\n00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,310\nIf it's bad enough where you can't\nget booted back into the computer,\n\n1151\n00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:14,930\na lot of times Windows will recognize\nthat, automatically reboot,\n\n1152\n00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:17,900\nand give you options that you can try.\n\n1153\n00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,256\nI've done this before\nwhere I've actually said,\n\n1154\n00:56:20,256 --> 00:56:23,121\nI want to see what happens when\nI do this with the video driver.\n\n1155\n00:56:23,121 --> 00:56:26,878\nThe good thing about the way that\nWindows works, if it can't find\n\n1156\n00:56:26,878 --> 00:56:31,044\nthe video driver port, it will put\nthe most generic video driver it can,\n\n1157\n00:56:31,044 --> 00:56:35,688\nwhich will give you the that 640 by\n480 mode sometimes or 800 by 600,\n\n1158\n00:56:35,688 --> 00:56:40,331\nwhatever it actually is now at this point\nin time, and at least allow you to try and\n\n1159\n00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:44,838\nget access back into the actual system\nthrough safe mode, and from safe mode,\n\n1160\n00:56:44,838 --> 00:56:47,774\nthen you can use that roll\nback driver to go ahead and\n\n1161\n00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:50,443\nrestore that previous version, all right.\n\n1162\n00:56:50,443 --> 00:56:51,561\nSo when you update a driver,\n\n1163\n00:56:51,561 --> 00:56:54,200\nit doesn't automatically get\nrid of your current driver.\n\n1164\n00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,490\nIt stores it in a hidden location.\n\n1165\n00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:59,330\nAgain just really,\nsomewhere that it can retrieve here.\n\n1166\n00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:01,670\nIn just in case something\nlike this does happen.\n\n1167\n00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,950\nWhere you do update a new driver and\nyou don't get everything that you actually\n\n1168\n00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:07,490\nneed out of the driver, or\nit again, begins to hinder the ways\n\n1169\n00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,800\nyou can use the computer, usually\nbeing able to do that is key for us.\n\n1170\n00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,200\nAlso before you actually do updates like\nthis, the recommendation of course, is for\n\n1171\n00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,610\nyou to do a System Restore point.\n\n1172\n00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,940\nEven though the computer does it\nautomatically for you day by day.\n\n1173\n00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,570\nSometimes it does it when you\nactually make system changes.\n\n1174\n00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:27,010\nIf you're not sure,\ndo a manual restore point and go ahead and\n\n1175\n00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:31,260\ndescribe it as before updating\nmy video graphics driver.\n\n1176\n00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:35,203\nAnd that way you actually can pinpoint it\nvery easily when you need to go back and\n\n1177\n00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:36,354\ntry and restore that.\n\n1178\n00:57:36,354 --> 00:57:38,014\nOkay.\n\n1179\n00:57:38,014 --> 00:57:43,741\n>> All right, so the last little\nthing that we have left to go over,\n\n1180\n00:57:43,741 --> 00:57:47,680\nis the idea of restoring\nour user profiles.\n\n1181\n00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:54,320\nCuz sometimes user profiles can get\ncorrupt somehow, crazy computers, right?\n\n1182\n00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,620\nSometimes, things just happen.\n\n1183\n00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,620\n>> Now user profiles, again,\nsometimes you end up missing files,\n\n1184\n00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,910\nyou end up losing them.\n\n1185\n00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:04,110\nBut if you are on a good backup plan,\nthat's probably the best way for\n\n1186\n00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,180\nyou to be able to gain access to them.\n\n1187\n00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:10,300\nSo back on Nate's screen, if you'll\nbring up that backup and restore again.\n\n1188\n00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,580\nYou'll see an option there at\nthe bottom of the screen here.\n\n1189\n00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,680\nLet's see if we can get back to it.\n\n1190\n00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,918\nNotice where it says restore, right?\n\n1191\n00:58:16,918 --> 00:58:21,395\nIf you already have a backup right\nthere on that first link with\n\n1192\n00:58:21,395 --> 00:58:25,021\nthe little shield it says\nrestore all user files.\n\n1193\n00:58:25,021 --> 00:58:26,390\nGo ahead and click on that link for us.\n\n1194\n00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:30,490\nAnd from there, notice that it can\nactually allow you to search for\n\n1195\n00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:32,640\nthe actual files that\nyou actually have here.\n\n1196\n00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,040\nSo let's go ahead and\nbrowse for the folders again.\n\n1197\n00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,882\nAt this point go into your back up or\n\n1198\n00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:44,180\nNathan's back up,\nI don't know which one it would be.\n\n1199\n00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,480\nGo into the back up of drive C.\n\n1200\n00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,460\nI'll try to see if we\nactually showed that or not.\n\n1201\n00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:49,760\nGo to users.\n\n1202\n00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,330\nThere we go.\n\n1203\n00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:53,370\nAnd so I thought I had mine on here.\n\n1204\n00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:56,403\nBut that'll work.\nGo ahead and select that Add Folder for\n\n1205\n00:58:56,403 --> 00:58:58,079\nright now and click Add.\n\n1206\n00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,443\nAll right, so notice that what we\ncan do here is we can actually\n\n1207\n00:59:01,443 --> 00:59:04,430\nrestore the entire user profile from here.\n\n1208\n00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:08,222\nNow there is a difference between the idea\nof actually restoring everything,\n\n1209\n00:59:08,222 --> 00:59:11,784\nwhich is probably the best way to do this,\nbut if it is corrupted some how,\n\n1210\n00:59:11,784 --> 00:59:15,692\nyou can't gain access to it, you actually\nhave to go back in and make sure the user\n\n1211\n00:59:15,692 --> 00:59:19,211\nprofile is valid and every everything\nis good but this is how you do that.\n\n1212\n00:59:19,211 --> 00:59:21,847\nSame process then what we have here.\n\n1213\n00:59:21,847 --> 00:59:24,790\n>> All right, profile's running.\n\n1214\n00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:27,052\nLet's take a look at this other thing.\n\n1215\n00:59:27,052 --> 00:59:30,160\nAll right so let's say we've had\nthese system restore points.\n\n1216\n00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,210\nAnd our PC can't boot up.\n\n1217\n00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,780\nThe last known good doesn't help us any.\n\n1218\n00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:39,330\nAnd we need to somehow use one\nof these system restore points.\n\n1219\n00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:42,170\nAll right, so let's do this.\n\n1220\n00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:46,442\nLet me jump into here, so\nhere on this virtual machine.\n\n1221\n00:59:46,442 --> 00:59:50,160\n>> All right.\n>> Let's go and restart this guy.\n\n1222\n00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,700\nSo something's up with our system and\n\n1223\n00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,640\nwe need to use one of these\nsystem restore points.\n\n1224\n00:59:56,112 --> 00:59:58,440\nAll right let's go ahead and\nrestart this guy.\n\n1225\n00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,360\nAs soon as it restarts\nI'll push what key Ronnie?\n\n1226\n01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,070\n>> Knowledge check\n>> F8\n\n1227\n01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:04,760\n>> Just the number eight\n\n1228\n01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,470\nkey\n>> F8\n\n1229\n01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,672\n>> Yes F8.\n\n1230\n01:00:07,672 --> 01:00:13,680\nAll right, so of these options we get\nin here to our advanced boot options so\n\n1231\n01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,830\nwe can select this very first one.\n\n1232\n01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:17,100\nPrepare your computer.\n\n1233\n01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:21,616\nAll right, and it's going to load\nup some of these system files.\n\n1234\n01:00:21,616 --> 01:00:27,280\nNow if our Sudo files\nare hosed up we'll need either\n\n1235\n01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:32,550\nour installation DVD or\nwe'll need that system repair disk.\n\n1236\n01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,900\nAnd as this guy slowly churns away.\n\n1237\n01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,690\nThe font will be a little\non the small side.\n\n1238\n01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:40,690\nI apologize for it.\n\n1239\n01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:47,300\nNow we have our system recovery\noptions select keyboard input method.\n\n1240\n01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,649\nI guess we change it if we want.\n\n1241\n01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:50,952\nAll right.\nWe'll just click on next.\n\n1242\n01:00:50,952 --> 01:00:55,515\nSo now we have to pick\none of our User accounts,\n\n1243\n01:00:55,515 --> 01:01:00,546\nwe've got some,\nlook home group user is in there,\n\n1244\n01:01:00,546 --> 01:01:05,239\nlets go ahead and pick mine,\nand the password.\n\n1245\n01:01:10,661 --> 01:01:14,537\nFrom here we've got a number\nof different options.\n\n1246\n01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:18,677\nWe can run, we can check our\nmemory maybe see how that works.\n\n1247\n01:01:18,677 --> 01:01:22,047\nWe can get into our command prompt,\nthen image recovery, right.\n\n1248\n01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:25,277\nSo that system image the bit for\nbit copy that we made,\n\n1249\n01:01:25,277 --> 01:01:28,857\nof course not on this machine,\nwe did it on our real machine.\n\n1250\n01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:35,370\nStart up repair if we need to go into\nthere but then there we go system restore.\n\n1251\n01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:37,010\nRestore Windows to\nan earlier point in time.\n\n1252\n01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:38,760\nSo we click on this.\n\n1253\n01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,260\nNow on this virtual machine we\ndidn't run any repairs on this one.\n\n1254\n01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:45,860\n[LAUGH] we didn't sweet.\n\n1255\n01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:48,121\nThat must have been from earlier.\n\n1256\n01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,782\n[LAUGH] Sweet.\n\n1257\n01:01:50,782 --> 01:01:52,760\nAll right so let's just go ahead and\npick that one.\n\n1258\n01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,510\nAll right, and we click on next.\n\n1259\n01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:57,900\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n1260\n01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,020\nJust gonna restore stuff to the C drive.\n\n1261\n01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,380\nClick on finish.\n\n1262\n01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,960\nOnce started it cannot be interrupted.\n\n1263\n01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,050\n>> Why?\n>> Well because it's changing a lot\n\n1264\n01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:11,610\nof system settings, registry keys,\nsorts of things in the background.\n\n1265\n01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:12,580\nSo we'll click on yes.\n\n1266\n01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:14,030\nSure, go ahead.\n\n1267\n01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:18,540\nAnd it's gonna go ahead and\napply this system restore to our system.\n\n1268\n01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:22,430\nAnd after it's done, our PC will reboot,\nwe'll get back into Windows.\n\n1269\n01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:26,780\nHopefully we'll get a little prompt\nthat'll say, the restore was successful.\n\n1270\n01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:28,650\nEnjoy your rolled back system.\n\n1271\n01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:31,990\nSweet.\n\n1272\n01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:33,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right,\n\n1273\n01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:36,030\nwell that does it on system restore.\n\n1274\n01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:40,110\nRonnie, anything else to touch on?\n\n1275\n01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:42,780\n>> Just kinda remember that in this\nparticular section, we hit on what?\n\n1276\n01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,780\nWe hit on the ideas of being able to\nback up the actual computer system,\n\n1277\n01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,950\na full disk image backup in\nterms of a Windows system image,\n\n1278\n01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:53,530\nas well as being able to back up\nindividual folders that we then back up,\n\n1279\n01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:55,910\nany particular files,\nthat you can do that as well.\n\n1280\n01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:59,590\nAnd then we also took a look at\nthe idea of using system restore,\n\n1281\n01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:03,770\nhow to configure it as well as how to\ncreate a system restore point, and also\n\n1282\n01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:07,960\nhow to actually run one of these restore\npoints for us to restore out state.\n\n1283\n01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,690\nAnd then lastly,\n\n1284\n01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:12,690\nwe talk about the idea of again using\nprevious version of files here.\n\n1285\n01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:15,990\nTo be able to restore files that\nhave been corrupted or, again,\n\n1286\n01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:19,660\nmay have actually been deleted\naccidentally here for us as well.\n\n1287\n01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,076\n>> All right, sweet.\n\n1288\n01:03:23,076 --> 01:03:25,890\nWell if you ever have any\nquestions during the show,\n\n1289\n01:03:25,890 -->
