          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,409\n[NOISE] We want to take a moment to talk\n\n2\n00:00:05,409 --> 00:00:10,254\nabout the 70-680 exam and\n\n3\n00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:14,745\nwhat it means to you, right.\n\n4\n00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:16,102\nSo Windows 7 and you.\n\n5\n00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:16,614\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n6\n00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:19,310\n>> For those of you that are seeking\n\n7\n00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,090\nthe knowledge and\nvalidation that shows that you're aware\n\n8\n00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,910\nof how to work with Windows 7, well, the\nMicrosoft 70-680 exam is the one for you.\n\n9\n00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,960\nThis exam covers a wide variety of\ntopics pertaining to Windows 7,\n\n10\n00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,510\nand not just Windows 7 in terms of\nhow to use it like end user style,\n\n11\n00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,360\nbut network administrator style.\n\n12\n00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,940\nSo how to install and deploy Windows 7,\nhow to manage and maintain Windows 7 and\n\n13\n00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,310\nhow to secure it and\nkeep it operational in your environment.\n\n14\n00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,730\nThis is valuable information that anybody\nis going to need to work in a corporate or\n\n15\n00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,344\nenterprise environment where you're\nsupporting Windows 7 workstations.\n\n16\n00:00:56,602 --> 00:00:58,840\nAll right, so\nto get an idea of what the exam is like,\n\n17\n00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,990\nlet's take a look at the official\nMicrosoft page for the exam.\n\n18\n00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,470\nSo I've got it pulled up right here,\n\n19\n00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,140\nand you'll see some basic\ninformation about it.\n\n20\n00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,210\nThe actual title for\nthe exam is Windows 7, Configuring.\n\n21\n00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,460\nWhy they reversed these\nthings is beyond me.\n\n22\n00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,860\nBut it's nice because it is one set of\nobjectives, one exam, one certification.\n\n23\n00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,010\nWhen you pass this exam,\nyou get the MCTS, or\n\n24\n00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,590\nMicrosoft Certified Technology Specialist,\nin Windows 7.\n\n25\n00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:32,420\nThe exam objectives cover a variety of\nthings, and they break it down here.\n\n26\n00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,950\nLet me just collapse all these so\nwe can get the overviews.\n\n27\n00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,730\nAnd what you'll see looking at the list,\nis we've got things,\n\n28\n00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,700\nvery basic, installing, upgrading and\nmigrating to Windows 7.\n\n29\n00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,670\nAll right, well,\ninstalling Windows 7 is not very hard.\n\n30\n00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,120\nBut we'll see there's a variety of\nways to do it, and a variety of\n\n31\n00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,700\nconcerns we have depending on what\noperating system we may be coming from.\n\n32\n00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,657\nIf we're coming from Windows XP or\nVista or wherever, right?\n\n33\n00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,610\nWe'll also see other things\nlike Deploying Windows 7.\n\n34\n00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,140\nThis is talking about\nimage-based deployment.\n\n35\n00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,220\nSo if you've got a thousand workstations\nyou need to install Windows 7 on,\n\n36\n00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,920\nhow can we do that.\n\n37\n00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,560\n>> We also have the idea\nof configuring hardware and\n\n38\n00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,340\nother compatibility issues for us too.\n\n39\n00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,000\nA lot of times when you are actually\na network administrator,\n\n40\n00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,580\nyou're moving from earlier operating\nsystems and earlier applications and\n\n41\n00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,650\nwe need to make sure that we can\nensure that they work with Windows 7.\n\n42\n00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,471\nAnd so it gives us some different ways\nto be able to troubleshoot them and\n\n43\n00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:31,270\nto evaluate them and\n\n44\n00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,430\nsee if they're actually gonna be\nappropriate for our Windows 7 environment.\n\n45\n00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:37,650\n>> Yep.\n\n46\n00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,385\nAs well as we continue to move on.\n\n47\n00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:41,340\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yep, sorry.\n\n48\n00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,830\n>> I have no idea what's happened here.\n\n49\n00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,390\nBut my mouse is no longer working.\n\n50\n00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:50,730\n[LAUGH] It's lighting up, but it's not-\n>> Oh, yeah, it's not letting you click.\n\n51\n00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,345\n>> Yeah, I don't understand what I've\ndone, and I can't scroll anymore.\n\n52\n00:02:54,345 --> 00:03:01,715\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like that web page locked up.\n\n53\n00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,450\nCuz outside of the browser\nit's working just fine, but\n\n54\n00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,890\ninside of the browser it was dead.\n\n55\n00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,689\nYou know what I might do?\n\n56\n00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,013\nI could probably just pull up,\nwell, no those are our own notes.\n\n57\n00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:13,230\nAll right.\n\n58\n00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,495\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:24,184\n>> Okay, Jason.\n\n60\n00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,740\nWe were only what,\nlike a minute or two into that?\n\n61\n00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,770\nWhy don't we just restart?\n\n62\n00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,270\n>> All right.\n\n63\n00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:40,200\n[COUGH] [LAUGH]\n>> Do you have it sorted out, or\n\n64\n00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,093\nwere you gonna?\n\n65\n00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:43,438\n>> Well, yeah it's working now.\n\n66\n00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:45,615\nWe'll see if it [CROSSTALK]\n>> If not,\n\n67\n00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:47,815\nI've got mine up on the same page so.\n\n68\n00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:48,419\n>> Okay, all right.\n\n69\n00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,011\n>> Maybe we can.\n\n70\n00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:52,052\n>> So, if I do like a thumbs down or\nwhatever,\n\n71\n00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:55,942\nwe'll cut to Ronnie's,\nbut otherwise I've got it.\n\n72\n00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:57,022\nOkay.\n\n73\n00:03:57,022 --> 00:03:58,496\nTake two.\n\n74\n00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:06,819\n[MUSIC]\n\n75\n00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:11,574\nIn this video we're gonna take\na look at the Microsoft 70-680 exam,\n\n76\n00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:14,800\nwhich is the Windows 7 configuring exam.\n\n77\n00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,190\nI like to refer to this as the show\nthat almost wasn't, right?\n\n78\n00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,680\nWhen ITProTV launched,\nwe launched in October of 2013,\n\n79\n00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,510\nand Windows 8 had just come out, and\nwe launched our Windows 8 training, and\n\n80\n00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,980\nwe said, you know what,\nlet's not go backwards.\n\n81\n00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,620\nLet's not do older software, older shows.\n\n82\n00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,190\nLet's just focus on\nthe newer technologies.\n\n83\n00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,250\nBut we've gotten such a demand for\nWindows 7, there's so\n\n84\n00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,455\nmany people out there\nthat still use it and\n\n85\n00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:47,530\nit's their mainstream OS that we really\ndo need to go back and cover it.\n\n86\n00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,860\nAnd so to do that we've brought in this\nshow right here, the Windows 7 show.\n\n87\n00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,230\nWe're gonna be tackling the 70-680 exam,\nwhich is one of the nicer ones because\n\n88\n00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,600\nit's one set of objectives,\none exam, one certification.\n\n89\n00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,930\nWhen you pass the 70-680 exam,\nyou get the MCTS in Windows 7 configuring.\n\n90\n00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,300\nThat's the Microsoft Certified\nTechnology Specialist.\n\n91\n00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,840\nIt's a quick certification.\n\n92\n00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,740\nYou jump in, you pass it,\nyou get it on your resume.\n\n93\n00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,720\nIt's a real benefit.\n\n94\n00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,570\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat some of the objectives that\n\n95\n00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,460\nare on this exam that are things that\nwe're gonna be covering in this show.\n\n96\n00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,780\nWell, the exam itself starts out where\nyou would logically think it would,\n\n97\n00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,850\ninstalling and upgrading, well,\nand migrating, to Windows 7.\n\n98\n00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,280\nIf you've got Windows XP,\nWindows Vista and\n\n99\n00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,940\nyou want to get on Windows 7,\nhow do you do it?\n\n100\n00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,640\nHow do you install it, how do you upgrade?\n\n101\n00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,920\nAnd so\nthat's were we kind of begin the show.\n\n102\n00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,240\n>> The second objective that you\nactually talk about here is the idea of\n\n103\n00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,600\ndeploying Windows 7.\n\n104\n00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,960\nNow if you're a standalone user you may\nnot have heard this term before, but\n\n105\n00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,860\nif you've been working in\nthe IT industry at all\n\n106\n00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,600\nwe tend to actually do what we\ncall image-based deployment.\n\n107\n00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,470\nAnd so in here we actually show\nhow to actually create an image.\n\n108\n00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,870\nHow do we add in information\nto that image, and\n\n109\n00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,370\nhow do we actually end up\npushing it out to computers.\n\n110\n00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:04,970\n>> Yeah.\n\n111\n00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,820\nAnd you know, the first one,\nthe first module,\n\n112\n00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,850\nthat's really talking about one machine.\n\n113\n00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,510\nBut the second module, that is hundreds,\nthousands of machines, right?\n\n114\n00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,160\nYou may have a very,\nvery large environment.\n\n115\n00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,350\nThe third section is configuring\nhardware and applications.\n\n116\n00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,720\nSo you've got Windows 7 installed,\nwhat do you do now?\n\n117\n00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,820\nWell, you likely have unique hardware,\nno two computers, well that's\n\n118\n00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,910\nnot necessarily true, but most computers\nhave [LAUGH] various configurations.\n\n119\n00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,310\nBut you also have various applications\nthat you use as part of your business and\n\n120\n00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,700\nyour day to day operations.\n\n121\n00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,230\nSo how do we get those configured,\n\n122\n00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,330\nhow do we get them running,\nand how do we support them?\n\n123\n00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,180\n>> And the next session here on\nconfiguring network connectivity.\n\n124\n00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,040\nThis is basic networking to ensure that\nour Windows 7 environment will again run\n\n125\n00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,450\non top of our infrastructure, making sure\nthat we're familiar not only with the IPv4\n\n126\n00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,490\ntechnologies, but as well as getting\nintroduced to the IPv6 technologies as\n\n127\n00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,770\nwell since we're actually moving fast\ntoward that particular migration.\n\n128\n00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,600\n>> All right, the next section is\nconfiguring access to resources.\n\n129\n00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,910\nIf you have files on your computer and\n\n130\n00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,960\nyou wanna share them with other people,\nhow do you do it?\n\n131\n00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,170\nIf you have a printer and\n\n132\n00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,820\nyou wanna make that printer available to\nmore than one machine, how do you do that?\n\n133\n00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,393\nSo we take a look at Windows 7 in\na workgroup or domain environment,\n\n134\n00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:23,470\nwhere we're sharing resources between\nsystems, and whenever you do that,\n\n135\n00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,014\nyou need to control access, so how do you\nlimit people's access to those resources?\n\n136\n00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,935\n>> Our next bigger objective here,\n\n137\n00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:34,395\non configuring mobile computing really\ndives into the world of a couple of new\n\n138\n00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:38,729\ntechnologies that again introduced\nwith Windows 7 and Server 2008.\n\n139\n00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:42,550\nWe talk a little bit about a technology\nthat we call BitLocker and\n\n140\n00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,410\nBitLocker To Go, as well as the idea\nof actually using direct access too.\n\n141\n00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,061\nAnd so along with that,\nof course, is the fast moving and\n\n142\n00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:53,685\nfast diving world of Windows mobility.\n\n143\n00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:54,875\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n144\n00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,460\nYeah, these are all topics that\nreally pertain to laptop users.\n\n145\n00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,190\nPeople who might not be at the office,\nthey might be at home or out in the field.\n\n146\n00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,400\nMore and more people have laptops\ninstead of desktops, and so\n\n147\n00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,520\nMicrosoft has a dedicated\nsection addressing that.\n\n148\n00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,230\nAll right, next is monitoring and\nmaintaining systems that run Windows 7.\n\n149\n00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,290\nOnce we get everything set up and\noperational, how do we keep it that way?\n\n150\n00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,740\nHow do we recognize when\nthere's problems on the system?\n\n151\n00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,770\nHow do we know if our system is\nrunning slower than it used to or\n\n152\n00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,040\nif we just feel like it's running slower?\n\n153\n00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,210\nSo how do we monitor that,\n\n154\n00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,330\nhow do we maintain, how do we keep\nthat system running in tip-top shape?\n\n155\n00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,130\n>> Yeah.\n\n156\n00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,760\nAnd lastly of course is actually\nrealizing that at some point sometime,\n\n157\n00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,300\nhardware may fail us,\nif not will fail us here.\n\n158\n00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,870\nAnd so here we talk about the idea of\nactually being able to take a look\n\n159\n00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,620\nat some of the recovery options that have\nalways again been inside of Windows, and\n\n160\n00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,950\nespecially focusing in on the idea\nof backing up our computers.\n\n161\n00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,970\n>> Yeah, probably one of\nthe most important topics, right?\n\n162\n00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,370\nBecause when things fail and\n\n163\n00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,920\nthings go south, how fast can you get\nthem back up and operational again?\n\n164\n00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,600\nThat's what we tackle right up there.\n\n165\n00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,240\nAll right?\n\n166\n00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,330\nSo that's kind of a highlight\nof the Windows 7 objectives, and\n\n167\n00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,520\nyou'll see that these are these\nare a lot more than just,\n\n168\n00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,530\nhow do you fire up Internet Explorer,\nhow do you do end user stuff?\n\n169\n00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,760\nThis is, how do we run Windows 7 in\na corporate or enterprise environment?\n\n170\n00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,720\nThis is valuable knowledge for anybody\nwho wants to be a network administrator,\n\n171\n00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,290\na desktop engineer, even help desk.\n\n172\n00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,750\nThis is really where you get\nyour foundational knowledge for\n\n173\n00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,100\nhelp desk operations.\n\n174\n00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,340\nSo really good information\nto be found here.\n\n175\n00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,820\nIt's a great certification and it does\ngive you that foundational knowledge you\n\n176\n00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,090\nneed to deploy Windows 7 in a business.\n\n177\n00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,873\n>> Right.\n\n178\n00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,865\n>> All right, well, if that sounds like\nsomething that you're interested in,\n\n179\n00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:40,464\nstay tuned because we've\ngot more shows coming for\n\n180\n00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:43,138\nWindows 7 as we jump through\nall of our objectives.\n\n181\n00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:44,522\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
