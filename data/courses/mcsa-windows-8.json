          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,487\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,487 --> 00:00:13,575\nThis show on ITProTV covers\nthe Microsoft 70-687 exam,\n\n3\n00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:17,720\nwhich is for the, the Windows 8 MCSA.\n\n4\n00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,170\nThe MCSA is the MIcrosoft certified\nsolutions associate and it's designed to\n\n5\n00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,250\nbe a mid level certification for I.T.\nSystems Administrators.\n\n6\n00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,278\nIf you work in an environment where\nyou support Windows 8 desktops or\n\n7\n00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:35,400\nWindows 8 machines just deployed in\nany manner inside your organization.\n\n8\n00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,970\nWell, that's what this\ncertification is designed for.\n\n9\n00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,180\nThere is more than one MCSA\nthat's out there though.\n\n10\n00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,470\nThere is the MCSA for\ndesktop infrastructure,\n\n11\n00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,860\nwhich is what pertains to Windows 8.\n\n12\n00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,680\nThere's also the MCSA for\nserver infrastructure,\n\n13\n00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,124\nwhich pertains to Windows Server 2012.\n\n14\n00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:52,776\nSo you have to make sure you're\ngoing down the right track for\n\n15\n00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:56,380\nyour certification based on the job\nrole that you're going to perform.\n\n16\n00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,050\nSo if you're someone who works\non servers quite a bit well,\n\n17\n00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,440\nthe 7687 exam is not, necessarily,\n\n18\n00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,510\none that's going to line up with\nthe certifications you need to pursue.\n\n19\n00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,700\nSo before we dive into\nthis one specifically,\n\n20\n00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,890\nlet's just take a look at that full track.\n\n21\n00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,590\nI've got pulled up here\nMicrosoft's website for\n\n22\n00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,430\nthe Microsoft Certified\nSolutions Associate,\n\n23\n00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,530\nand you'll see all\nthe different tracks they have.\n\n24\n00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,655\nThe MCSA server for\nWindows 2008 as well 2012.\n\n25\n00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:24,997\nWe've got the Windows 8 and Windows 7\nas well as some of the SQL Server and\n\n26\n00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:28,350\neven Microsoft Office 365 certifications.\n\n27\n00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,730\nEach of these are different tracks.\n\n28\n00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,530\nThey all lead to you attaining a MCSA,\nall right.\n\n29\n00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,260\nSo you really have the MCSA with its\nvarious specializations underneath it.\n\n30\n00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,080\nIf you want to work with servers,\nyou'll want to jump into the server track.\n\n31\n00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,700\nFor Windows 8 though, we've got this\nguy right here, the MCSA in Windows 8.\n\n32\n00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,510\nTo get your MCSA, you actually\nneed to complete two exams, so\n\n33\n00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,980\nit's two exams to one certification.\n\n34\n00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,600\nBut the exams are very closely related.\n\n35\n00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,640\nThe first one is this show,\n\n36\n00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,652\nconfiguring Windows 8.1 which\nlines up with the 70-87 exam.\n\n37\n00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:04,270\nAnd that exam covers all sorts\nof information pertaining to\n\n38\n00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,000\nactually setting up and\ninstalling, deploying Windows 8.\n\n39\n00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,600\nSo how do we get our environment up and\nrunning using Windows 8?\n\n40\n00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,119\nOnce you've completed and, and passed\nthat exam, you move onto the next one,\n\n41\n00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:18,286\nwhich is supporting Windows 8.1.\n\n42\n00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:20,870\nAll right, now you've got\nWindows 8 in your environment.\n\n43\n00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,200\nHow do keep it running smoothly?\n\n44\n00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,080\nHow do you trouble shoot issues and\nresolve problems?\n\n45\n00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,503\nHow do you maintain your environment,\nall right?\n\n46\n00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:31,960\nAnd that's the 70-688 exam,\nthe sister course to this one.\n\n47\n00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,859\nBut let's take a look at that 687 exam,\nbecause that's what this show is about.\n\n48\n00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,060\nAll right.\n\n49\n00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,005\nThe 7687 exam, like most Microsoft exams,\ncosts $150 to take, so it's not a terribly\n\n50\n00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:46,116\nexpensive exam, except you've gotta\ntake two of them to get the MCSA, right.\n\n51\n00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:48,510\nSo you've got about $300 in exam costs.\n\n52\n00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,230\nThat's United States dollars\nyour currency may vary.\n\n53\n00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,810\nBut the exam itself is\npretty straightforward.\n\n54\n00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,260\nYou can take it at any Pearson Vue\ntesting center located around the world,\n\n55\n00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,728\nif you've never tested with them\nbefore check out their website.\n\n56\n00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:06,321\nGo to www.pearsonvue,\nV-U-E .com/microsoft and\n\n57\n00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:10,020\nyou can sign up for an account with them.\n\n58\n00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,090\nLocate a testing center near you,\nthere's normally one near by,\n\n59\n00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,580\nand then you can go and\ntake the exam whenever you schedule.\n\n60\n00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,600\nBut for getting ready for the exam,\nwell that's where our content comes in.\n\n61\n00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,030\nAll right,\nnow who is this one designed for?\n\n62\n00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,440\nWell, it's designed for somebody\nwho's gonna be working in a business\n\n63\n00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,590\nthat is going to be supporting Windows 8.\n\n64\n00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,840\nIf you're a home user, your gonna learn\nabout a lot of technologies in this\n\n65\n00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,720\nshow that aren't useful at home.\n\n66\n00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,240\nIn fact, will make your life\na lot more difficult at home,\n\n67\n00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,930\nbecause they're technologies\ndesigned to support hundreds or\n\n68\n00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,060\nthousands of systems,\nnot to support five systems.\n\n69\n00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,410\nRight?\nYou'll find that if you use\n\n70\n00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,610\nthe technologies we discuss in this show\nat home, it will make things take a lot\n\n71\n00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,882\nlonger than they should when you could\nhave just gone and done it manually.\n\n72\n00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:55,810\nAll right, so we're really gonna focus\non automating and repeating activities,\n\n73\n00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,380\nbecause at home, you might just\ninstall Windows 8 on one machine, but\n\n74\n00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,450\nat your office, you might install\nWindows 8 on 500 machines.\n\n75\n00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,460\nAnd you don't want to do\nit 500 separate times.\n\n76\n00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,960\nSo if we can script it,\n\n77\n00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,680\nautomate it, deploy an image that\nhas everything set the way we want,\n\n78\n00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,912\nit saves a ton of time and it's absolutely\nworth it in a corporate environment.\n\n79\n00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:16,580\nAll right so let's take a look\nat what's covered on this exam.\n\n80\n00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,110\nThe exam's broken up into seven\ndifferent topic areas and\n\n81\n00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,800\nthe the font here is kind of small.\n\n82\n00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,680\nLet me zoom in on that a little bit.\n\n83\n00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,990\nAnd we can kind of run down the list here.\n\n84\n00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,670\nWe start with simply installing and\nupgrading to Windows 8.1.\n\n85\n00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,600\nAnd I know what you're saying.\n\n86\n00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600\nAll right Don, I pop in a disc and I click\nnext 20 times and we're done, right.\n\n87\n00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,930\nThat is how a normal installation will go,\nbut for\n\n88\n00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,120\nthis one we will cover\nthe automation piece.\n\n89\n00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,020\nHow can we deploy Windows 8 over the\nnetwork without even having a disc at all.\n\n90\n00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,780\nHow can we have our own line\nof business applications\n\n91\n00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,520\nall ready installed when Windows\n8 comes up the first time.\n\n92\n00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,640\nHow can we make things as\nautomatic as possible?\n\n93\n00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,370\nSo you get a chance to see that as well\nas some of the other concerns with\n\n94\n00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,180\nupgrading to Windows 8.1.\n\n95\n00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,410\nThen we'll see configuring hardware and\n\n96\n00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,530\napplications, most systems have\na fairly common set of hardware.\n\n97\n00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,480\nBut there's always these extra devices\nthat people bring in that we may need to\n\n98\n00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,730\nload custom configurations for, and we'll\nget a chance to see how all that works.\n\n99\n00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,510\nNext is the networking side.\n\n100\n00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,300\nWindows 8 is a fully network\naware operating system,\n\n101\n00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,960\nwhich is not really new for it.\n\n102\n00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,602\nBut that means that it,\nit doesn't just support it, but\n\n103\n00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:24,092\nactually expect to have\na connection to the network.\n\n104\n00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:28,270\nFor things like automatic updates and\neasy search functionality and, and\n\n105\n00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,260\nusing your Microsoft Live ID to\nsynchronize account settings.\n\n106\n00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,390\nThat stuff all requires\na network configuration.\n\n107\n00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,910\nSo we'll take a look at how to set\nup the networking under Windows 8?\n\n108\n00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,230\nTo get the machines to talk together.\n\n109\n00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,050\nThen, configuring\nthe access to our networks.\n\n110\n00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,520\nIf we start to share things like files,\nfolders,\n\n111\n00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,700\nprinters, we probably wanna control who\ncan get to what, and who can do what?\n\n112\n00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,440\nSo we'll see some of the different\ntechnologies that are available there to\n\n113\n00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,720\ncontrol access to our system.\n\n114\n00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,530\nThen we've got remote access and mobility.\n\n115\n00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,230\nSo today we're going to learn about\nthings like VPNs and dial-up connections.\n\n116\n00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,980\nHopefully, you don't have to use dial-up\nanymore but VPN is very commonly used,\n\n117\n00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,000\nas well as other mobile technologies\nlike tablet computing, right.\n\n118\n00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,690\nWindows 8 has that two different versions,\n\n119\n00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,910\nthe normal Windows 8 and\nthen the Windows 8 RT or just Windows RT.\n\n120\n00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,129\nAnd so we talk a little bit about\nthat not, not a ton on Windows RT.\n\n121\n00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,169\nBut we also discuss some of\nthe differences with mobile platforms in\n\n122\n00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:24,500\ngeneral, like supporting battery life,\nright.\n\n123\n00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,270\nYou don't have a battery in a desktop\nPC to worry about, but in a laptop or\n\n124\n00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,150\na tablet, you do.\n\n125\n00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,710\nNext we talk about monitoring and\nmaintaining Windows clients.\n\n126\n00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,590\nNow, this is a small portion on\nmaintaining the clients because the next\n\n127\n00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,170\nexam goes into great depth on it.\n\n128\n00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,560\nAnd then at the very end we've got\nsystem and data recovery options.\n\n129\n00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,070\nWhen you deploy Windows 8,\nyou need to have something in\n\n130\n00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,150\nplace to be able to back it up, and\nrestore in the event of failure.\n\n131\n00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,090\nAnd that's kind of how we round\noff those topics as we cover,\n\n132\n00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,270\nhow to safely back up and\nrestore your system?\n\n133\n00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,620\nIt's really good knowledge, all of this\nis, and most of it, you'll turn around and\n\n134\n00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,350\nuse in your environment.\n\n135\n00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,590\nWhat I find a lot of people do\nis they go through all of this,\n\n136\n00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,390\nthey learn the different options that\nare out there, and then they pick and\n\n137\n00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,200\nchoose the ones they want to\ndeploy in their organization.\n\n138\n00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,420\nBut you don't know what to use, if you\ndon't know what all is out there and\n\n139\n00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,160\nthat's what this certi,\ncertification is designed for.\n\n140\n00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,070\nI find that all in all,\nit's a pretty fair exam.\n\n141\n00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,200\nThe, the examination contents,\nit can be a lot, right?\n\n142\n00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,580\nIt's a lot of content, but\nthe exam's pretty straightforward and\n\n143\n00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,950\nMicrosoft doesn't normally get\ntoo tricky on their exams.\n\n144\n00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,160\nSo if you're gonna be going to work in\na medium or large organization, and\n\n145\n00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,850\nyou're going to be deploying Windows 8.\n\n146\n00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,560\nThis is a great certification again, it's\njust a great set of knowledge to have,\n\n147\n00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,300\neven if you don't go on to do\nthe certification, all right.\n\n148\n00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,670\nIf your environment is all Windows 7,\nit's still useful to learn Windows 8,\n\n149\n00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,740\nbecause eventually you may go to it or\nmaybe you'll skip over Windows 8, and\n\n150\n00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,360\nyou'll just go straight to Windows 10.\n\n151\n00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,340\nWell, Windows 10 is building off of\na lot of the Window 8 technologies.\n\n152\n00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,580\nSo if you skip over an OS,\nyou're gonna be behind an eight ball.\n\n153\n00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,810\nYou've got a lot more knowledge to make up\nfor the changes between the two systems.\n\n154\n00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,480\nBut if you learn Windows 8 in between, now\nyou're that much closer to being ready for\n\n155\n00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,240\nWindows 10.\n\n156\n00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,480\nSo it's always a good idea to\nlearn the new operating system,\n\n157\n00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,590\neven if they're not that popular, right?\n\n158\n00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,515\nLike Windows Vista.\n\n159\n00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:14,330\n[LAUGH] So, so we definitely\nkeep that in mind as we go and\n\n160\n00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,240\nselect our certifications.\n\n161\n00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,380\nNow if you are interested\nin learning about servers\n\n162\n00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,740\nthis is not the certification for you.\n\n163\n00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,700\nThis is the MCSA for\n\n164\n00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,150\nwindows 8, you need to look into\nthe MCSA for Windows server 2012, right.\n\n165\n00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,800\nThat's going to steer you in the server\nside and maybe you want to do both right.\n\n166\n00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,500\nIt's not that many exams to go and\nget the MCSA in both and now, you know,\n\n167\n00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,430\nthe server and desktop side, and\nthat make you a very powerful person.\n\n168\n00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,810\nAs far as being attractive\nto a company to hire or\n\n169\n00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,660\njust being able to\nsupport the environment.\n\n170\n00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,590\nYou'll better understand\nthe interaction between client and, and\n\n171\n00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,710\nserver if you know\nthe configurations of both, right.\n\n172\n00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,230\nSo there's a lot of\nbenefits doing both sides.\n\n173\n00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,040\nAll right, so\nif that sounds like what you wanna learn,\n\n174\n00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,930\nthe certification you're looking to get,\nthen you're in the right place.\n\n175\n00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,640\nStay tuned.\n\n176\n00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,910\nWe'll have more Windows 8\nepisodes coming up soon.\n\n177\n00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,750\nBut if you're looking for servers or\nif you're just starting in IT, right.\n\n178\n00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,710\nYou haven't even gotten your feet wet yet.\n\n179\n00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,420\nThis isn't the greatest starting point for\nyou.\n\n180\n00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,960\nYou're looking to learn about servers,\nthere's the MCSA for Windows Server.\n\n181\n00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,720\nAnd if you're just getting started,\nwell you might want to take a look\n\n182\n00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,580\nat our Microsoft Technology Associate,\nthe MTA certification.\n\n183\n00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,920\nIt starts out with Windows 7 and covers\nthe basic of operating system deployment.\n\n184\n00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,470\nIs a much better place to start at if\nthis is your first IT Certification.\n\n185\n00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,130\nHowever, the MTA knowledge is,\nis pretty basic.\n\n186\n00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,220\nSo if you've working with Windows for\na little while,\n\n187\n00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,950\nyou might get kind of bored in that one.\n\n188\n00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,550\nAnd you certainly are able to just skip\nover it and come straight to the MCSA.\n\n189\n00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,760\nThat's what a lot of people do,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n190\n00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,860\nAs you go to select your certification.\n\n191\n00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,770\nAll right, well if you're sticking\nwith us for the MCSA Windows 8,\n\n192\n00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,380\nthen I'll see you in the next episode.\n\n193\n00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,710\nIf not, browse the rest of\nthe certification collection.\n\n194\n00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,420\nI think you'll find one certification or,\nor more that are,\n\n195\n00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,880\nare kind of more in line\nwith what your needs are.\n\n196\n00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,920\nAnd if you can't determine where to start?\n\n197\n00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,360\nJust ask, you can always shoot\nan email to support@itpro.tv or\n\n198\n00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,030\nemail me at Don@itpro.tv.\n\n199\n00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,260\nYou'll probably get a faster response from\nsupport, but just reach out to us and\n\n200\n00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,000\nwe'll help you.\n\n201\n00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,680\nWe can give you advice,\nsuggestions on where to start, you know,\n\n202\n00:10:13,680 -->
